      "title": "Xbox One S Outsells PS4 In Australia On The Back Of Forza Horizon 3",
      "text": "\nThe Xbox One S has been an enormously successful release for Microsoft, and it has seen Microsoft finally begin to reclaim the sales crown somewhat from Sony and PlayStation. The Xbox One has outsold PS4 in the US for a few months now , according to NPD, and it has also been outselling the PS4 in the UK. Now, it looks like a third country has been added to that list, because Microsoft have announced that in Australia, the Xbox One was the best selling console from August 1 to October 30.\nSales of the Xbox One were revitalized probably by the launch of the Xbox One S, as well as a strong software lineup, which includes ReCore, Gears of War 4 , and of course, Forza Horizon 3 .\n“We’d like to thank our fans for their continued support and passion for Xbox in Australia,” Microsoft Australia’s Xbox Business Lead Jeremy Hinton said. “It’s great to see such enthusiasm for the new Xbox One S & Forza Horizon 3 , as well as the range of exclusive bundles including Gears of War 4 , Battlefield 1 , FIFA 17 , and Minecraft – all of which are available now. With the upcoming launches of Dead Rising 4 this December, and Halo Wars 2 in February 2017, there has never been a better time to be an Xbox gamer”\nWith the launch of the PS4 Pro today, Sony may begin to regain some of the sales momentum that they have lost- but for now, kudos must be given to Microsoft for managing to turn the Xbox One around so well.",

Photo courtesy of Wikipedia, author CoredesatChikai \nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Microsoft will spend more than $250 million to expand a data center site in Southside Virginia. \nGov. Terry McAuliffe announced that the tech company's expansion of a data center in Mecklenburg County will create 44 new jobs. \nMicrosoft's total investment in the site now tops $2 billion since 2010. \nMcAuliffe approved a $500,000 grant for the expansion. The state's tobacco fund approved nearly $1 million for the project. The governor's office said it competed with other potential sites for the expansion. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Microsoft’s latest Windows Insider build 14965 is showing a \"virtual touchpad\" feature that could replace the mouse—or in any case, make life easier for Windows tablet users. It puts a touchpad on your tablet screen, so you can use that instead of a mouse whenever you connect your device to a larger display.\n\nFeatures that pop up in builds don't always make it to final versions, of course, but this feature is intriguing. From the sounds of it, first-time setup is fairly easy. When a tablet, such as the Surface Pro 4, is connected to an external display, open the Action Center and tap on the Project Quick Action tile. This will extend the Windows desktop to the external display. Next, long-press the taskbar on your tablet. When it appears select Show touchpad button.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Microsoft Rolls Out Holiday Xbox One Update",
      "text": "by Jeff Cork on November 10, 2016 at 09:46 AM 299 Views \nMicrosoft is rolling out its holiday update on Xbox One, which adds a host of new features with an eye toward communities. Players can join and create groups, send out a widespread call for gaming sessions, check the rarity of their achievements, and more. \nThe update, which was available a few months back for members of Microsoft's preview program, will be available for download starting today. One of the highlights is the looking for group functionality, which was unveiled alongside the Xbox One back in 2013. With it, players can search for game sessions using a variety of filters such as whether profanity should be used, if casual play is encouraged, or if you need to have a headset attached. These can be set up in advance, too, so you can plan ahead for your gaming weekend if you're into that kind of thing. \nPlayers can also create and join clubs, which are communities centered around common interests. Take a look at the video walkthrough below, which includes more details on those aspects of the update, as well as how achievement rarity works and, of course, the inclusion of emoji. \n\nOur Take I thought the looking for group feature sounded pretty cool when it was announced, and it's good to see that it's finally here. It sounds like a great way to get games going, especially if you want to play something that may have fallen from the spotlight.",

      "title": "Microsoft releases new Surface Books and Surface Dial - but the Dial is sold out for now",
      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago \nLast month, Microsoft held a major event in New York City, at which it announced details of its upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update , and unveiled a range of new hardware, including the Surface Studio, an all-in-one desktop PC with a 28-inch touchscreen . The Studio is available to pre-order now, with the first shipments scheduled from December 15, but those who pre-order today will have to wait for delivery sometime in early 2017 . \nBut today, Microsoft released two other devices that it announced at last month's event. \nThe first is the Surface Dial, which the company described as \"a new tool for the creative process\" . You can push down on the Dial on your desk and a contextual radial menu pops up on the display. Rotate the Dial for context-sensitive interactions, such as quickly scrolling through pages. When used with the Surface Studio, the Dial has additional functionality, giving users a more interactive experience on the display itself. \nMicrosoft says it's \"compatible with any Windows 10-enabled PC, laptop and tablet with the Anniversary Update\", although the extent of that compatibility depends on the device you use it with: The full Surface Dial experience is available exclusively on the Surface Studio, including the use of the Dial on the display itself \"Optimized off-screen compatibility\" is available on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 The Dial also works with a more limited set of features on any other PC, tablet or notebook running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update \nMicrosoft has now begun shipping the Surface Dial to those who pre-ordered it, but if you want to buy one today, you'll have to wait. The company says that \"due to strong demand, we have sold out of our initial inventory\", but you can still pre-order the Dial, priced at $99.99 , \"for delivery later this year\". \nBe sure to check out our hands-on with the Surface Dial, and the Surface Studio all-in-one . \nMicrosoft also announced more powerful versions of its current Surface Book models . The Surface Book with Performance Base features 6th-generation (Skylake) Intel Core i7 processors - rather than Intel's newest Kaby Lake chips - along with dramatic improvements in graphics performance with new discrete GPUs. The new Performance Base models also promise a boost in battery life, offering up to 16 hours of usage. \nPrices start at $2,399 with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage, rising to $3,299 for the top configuration, which won't be released until later this month. The other two Performance Base models are available from today. \nMicrosoft also quietly introduced another addition to its Surface Book range that it didn't announce at its event last month, but which is also shipping from today. Priced at $1,999 , it features an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 512GB storage, but lacks a discrete GPU. Tags",

      "text": "by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nAfter unveiling a new Microsoft Surface Book with twice the graphics performance and 30-percent more battery life than the original, Microsoft is now selling the new Surface Book with Performance Base. \nPrices start at $2,399 , which makes the 2-in-1 laptop pretty expensive for a portable Windows computer. But for that price you get a powerful processor, a high-resolution display that can be detached and used as a tablet, and up to 16 hours of battery life, among other things. \nThe new Surface Book with Performance Base measures 12.3″ x 9.1″ x 0.9″ and weighs about 3.6 pounds when used as a notebook. It has a 13.5 inch, 3000 x 200 pixel multit-touch display with support for pressure-sensitive input with a Surface Pen. \nThe laptop features an Intel Core i7-6600U Skylake processor and NVIDIA GeForgce GTX 965M graphics, with the GPU located in the laptop base (which means you’ll be limited to Intel HD graphics when using the Surface Book in tablet mode. \nOther features include 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, mini DisplayPort, a headset jack, and a full-sized SD card reader, an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera with support for Windows Hello facial recognition. \nAn entry-level model has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state storage, but higher-priced versions are available with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. \nThere are a few odd things about Microsoft’s new Surface Book. It’s launching with a last-gen CPU and last-gen NVIDIA graphics instead of a Kaby Lake and NVIDIA GeForce 10 series alternatives. \nBut the additional battery capacity and the switch from GeForce 940M to 965M graphics were big enough changes to require a new base for the laptop, which is why Microsoft is calling this model the Surface Book with Performance Base. \nUnfortunately, the company has no plans to sell the Performance Base on its own to customers who already have last year’s model and want to upgrade for the battery life and graphics improvements, even though an original Surface Book tablet works just fine with a Performance Base. \nMicrosoft is also now selling the $100 Surface Dial accessory which is designed to work with Surface Book laptops, Surface Pro tablets, and the upcoming Surface Studio all-in-one.",

The statement said the company may be giving preferential treatment to its own operating system over that of competitors. \nEarlier this year, Russia fined Alphabet Inc.'s Google 438 million rubles ($6.75 million) for competition violations. \nWrite to Laura Mills at laura.mills@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-10-160955ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Battery Issue: Fix Now Rolling Out",
      "text": "The latest firmware patch released by Microsoft is expected to correct a firmware error that causes the Surface Pro 3 battery drain. The company will also refund consumers who opt for out-of-warranty replacements after experiencing the problem. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has already released an update, which aims to fix a battery issue that affects certain Surface Pro 3 devices — a popular 2-in-1 laptop . The company states that the new firmware, which was quietly rolled out Nov. 7 should already address extreme battery drainage reported by consumers as early as August. Firmware And Diminished Battery \nThe update rollout came with the information that the problem involved devices that have LGC batteries. Several Surface Pro 3 owners have complained that since an August update, their tablets can no longer hold a charge while battery capacity seemed to have been diminished. \nThat particular update was meant to fix a previous battery problem for Surface Pro 3 devices outfitted with Simplo batteries. Microsoft has previously denied that the August firmware has caused the recent battery drainage. Surface Pro 3 Battery Problem: Solved \nMicrosoft claimed that the new fix, which is being called the Surface Pro Embedded Controller Firmware, targets the error caused by a misreported charging data to the operating system and device firmware. \n\"This update corrects the logic in the firmware component that functions as the 'fuel gauge' for the Surface Pro 3 battery, so that the actual battery capacity on devices with this particular part is accurately reported,\" Microsoft stated . \"This allows the Surface to once again leverage the maximum charge capacity of the battery.\" \nThis early, some users are already reporting that the update does not work. However, based on the firmware details provided by Microsoft, it appears that the fix is gradual and that the device will self-correct over the course several charge and discharge cycles. \nIn addition, the updates are cumulative, which means that aside from the latest patch, some Surface devices have to download other updates if these are not yet installed. Manual Update Installation \nMicrosoft explained that all pertinent updates are triggered automatically but those who have not received the firmware can manually install it. They will just need to go to Settings accessed from the Start menu, then select Update & Security. Once they see the Windows Update, they can then click Check for Updates option. The device should start automatically downloading the firmware, identified as System Firmware Update — 11/7/2016. \nMicrosoft recommends that even those Surface Pro 3 devices that are not affected by the battery issue need to install the firmware. The company also added that it will refund those who paid up to $450 to get an out-of-warranty-replacement after experiencing the battery problem. You can already save that amount for an upgrade especially now that the Surface Pro 5 is coming. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft pushed the latest update to the Xbox One Thursday, just in time for the holiday console deals to start dropping. The ability to easily connect with other gamers is the main push of the update with new built-in social features like Clubs and Looking for Groups (LFG). These same features are also rolling out to the Xbox mobile app for iOS, Android, and Windows 10.\n“With this holiday update, Xbox Live becomes even more social as we unite gamers across devices, giving you access to more people to play with that share your interests and more choice in how you play. The update also builds upon our vision to foster a welcoming experience on Xbox Live where everyone is included, respected, and supported,” Xbox Partner Group Program Manager Scott Henson explained on Xbox Wire .\nClubs, LFG, Achievement Rarity, Group Messaging + more rolling out to broader community on Xbox One & Xbox app today https://t.co/koijyWnc55 pic.twitter.com/OPJSPpoiO1 \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 10, 2016 \n\nThe big new features are gamer-created Clubs on Xbox LIVE that can be accessed from the Xbox One or mobile app. There is also the Looking for Group (LFG) option to find other players to team up with in multiplayer co-op or competitive games. The ability to send messages to groups of people has also been added along with emjois for those records. Finally, Achievement Rarity now lets Xbox One owners know how many others found an unlocked Achievements while an updated Gamerscore Leaderboard allows players to compare their progress with friends on a monthly basis.\nThese features have been in testing through the Xbox Preview Program since September . The LFG feature found in the Party tab is incredibly useful for games like Destiny or Rocket League or Battlefield 1 where playing and communicating with others not only improves your chance of success, but is required at times. LFG users can even set a date and time for when everyone in the group will get together to tackle their favorite game. There are many third-party websites and mobile apps that do the same, but this is the first opportunity for an in-console option.\n[Image by Xbox] Clubs are just like it sounds. This is a place where friends or like-minded people can come together on Xbox One for certain games, genres, or just general interests. Clubs can be created or found from the Friends tab from the left navigation menu or in the Communities tab on the main screen.\nThese game-run communities can be set for everyone to join as a Public Club, just a select few as a Private Club, or go ultra-exclusive with an invite only Hidden Club. The creator of the Club will have admin rights to manage the messages and content shared in the Club, promote others to admin, and make other necessary changes.\nThe promised Arena tournament option for the Xbox One did not make this update. It’s also been in testing the last couple of months with the Killer Instinct fighting community.\n“We plan to keep Arena in Preview through the holidays to ensure it’s great when we launch it more broadly,” Henson revealed.\n“We’re excited about the potential of Arena, and continuing to work with developers to deliver a great experience for our fans. We’ll have more to share as we expand the feature and get closer to its launch.\n[Image by Xbox] The Xbox One Holiday Update is rolling out for all Xbox One owners around the world now. If your console has not automatically download it yet, you can always open the guide, go to the Settings screen, and select “All Settings.” Then choose “System”, followed by “Console info & updates,” and finally “Update console.”\nWhat do you think of the new social features added to the Xbox One via the holiday update?

      "text": "0 0 \nIn the world of gaming, a constant concern is that gaming can be drastically hindered by two players playing on different platforms. What this means is that you need the same platform as your friend if you want to play together in a multiplayer environment. Microsoft is looking to change with its newest project. \nThe project in question is called Project Helix and its main goal is to unify the gap between Xbox and Windows players. With the goal of a unified gaming platform in mind, Project Helix aspires to create a new platform that will facilitate playing and developing all across the board, meaning that not only players on different platforms can have fun together but also that game developers will have a responsive medium to work with and a tool they can use when developing and tuning their games. \nProject Helix will most likely become to feel more real after the release of Microsoft’s Xbox Scorpio , which will happen next year. Microsoft’s initiative to unify the platforms isn’t new as it has been already implemented on a smaller scale with the help of their UWP program, which stands for Universal Windows Platform. What this platform did was unify all the Windows ecosystems by granting the same kind of access and versatility they are working towards with Project Helix. The Store has been already unified across the two distinct platforms, with Xbox and Windows users alike browsing the same medium. \nUWP has also managed to make possible the release of some Xbox titles to PC, including Fable Legends, Gears of War 4, Forza Apex, or Microsoft’s newest effort, ReCore, which was intended as an Xbox exclusive title. \n ",

      "text": "Originally Posted by Oubadah Windows 7 EOL is in 2020. Why are you still using that crappy old GTX 980? Don't you know it's obsolete now that the GTX 1080 is here? (same idiotic argument) LOL Still using W7 here, still working great as it always did. I don't see a reason to upgrade. There is only 1 reason I'd ever consider upgrading to windows 10 and that is because of DX12, but all the current DX12 titles run worse than the DX11 version. So why would I? Doom is the first \"proper\" example of how to use the new APIs (in my opinion of course), the performance gains are insane. Edited by Sleazybigfoot - Today at 8:12 am",

The new accessory is, perhaps, the most surprising and unique part of the Surface Studio. It's a big puck that is designed to be placed on the Studio's screen to produce radial menus and act as another form of input. Microsoft is selling the Surface Dial separately to the Surface Studio, so you can use it with any Windows 10 PC. I got a chance to try one out for a few days, to see whether you'd want to use a Surface Dial on a PC.\n\nIt's worth explaining what the Surface Dial is and what it isn't.

      "title": "A closer look at Microsoft’s crazy Surface Dial puck",
      "text": "share \nMicrosoft unveiled its Surface Studio PC last month, alongside a crazy-looking Surface Dial puck . The new accessory is, perhaps, the most surprising and unique part of the Surface Studio. It's a big puck that is designed to be placed on the Studio's screen to produce radial menus and act as another form of input. Microsoft is selling the Surface Dial separately to the Surface Studio, so you can use it with any Windows 10 PC. I got a chance to try one out for a few days, to see whether you'd want to use a Surface Dial on a PC. \nIt's worth explaining what the Surface Dial is and what it isn't. Microsoft is marketing it as an accessory you use in one hand while you use the other to sketch with the Surface Pen. That makes it the perfect compliment to the Surface Pen for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book users. Unfortunately, you can't use the Surface Dial on the screen of either of these devices to generate radial menus around the Dial at the moment. Microsoft is planning to add this with a firmware update early next year , but during my use I'm not convinced you'd want to use it on the small screen of either of these devices regularly. Grid View \nThe Dial isn't a large device, nor is it weighty, and it fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. It also sits unobtrusively on a desk. Its basic function is to provide contextually-relevant shortcuts within apps and Windows 10 itself. These are relatively simple in Windows 10, with the ability to adjust volume, scroll, zoom, undo, and brightness. You can also assign keyboard shortcuts for when you rotate the wheel right or left, and click the top of it. Rotating, clicking, and click and holding are the main ways you interact and control the radial menus the Dial produces. \nThe Surface Dial works best alongside a Surface Pen \nI've tested the Dial in a number of apps, including Spotify, OneNote, Photoshop, Sketchable, and Chrome. While the ability to control volume or zoom in-and-out in Photoshop is convenient, the Dial is far more useful when an app is optimized for it. I've found that Sketchable , a drawing app, has one of the best implementations available right now. You can tap and hold the top of the Dial to access radial menus for color controls, brush diameter, zoom, and undo. It really works great when paired with the Pen while you're drawing, and it feels natural to interact like this. \nOutside of Sketchable I haven't found many uses for the Dial just yet. OneNote has a neat feature to rewind when you use the Surface Pen to jot down notes, but Word and other Office apps just have the basic zoom or scroll features. Once we get a chance to test the Surface Studio I'd imagine it will make more sense with the bigger display and the combination of touchscreen, pen, and Dial input. By itself, there's not enough apps that make use of the Surface Dial yet to really get a feel for how this would exist next to your regular desktop PC. More than 15 apps currently support the Dial, but that leaves the door open for a lot more, like Sketchable, to demonstrate the potential for a device like the Surface Dial. More From The Verge",

      "title": "Microsoft's Surface Book is the MacBook Pro we didn't get",
      "text": "Microsoft's Surface Book is the MacBook Pro we didn't get Brendan G Nystedt , USA TODAY 11:47 a.m. EST November 10, 2016 \nThe new Surface Book's Performance Base fixes all the flaws of the original. (Photo: Reviewed.com) \nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales. \nLast year, Microsoft surprised everyone with its ultimate laptop/tablet combo, dubbed Surface Book . I really enjoyed using it, but lamented its high price tag and it was held back by buggy hardware. It was a beautiful, expensive laptop...one whose screen tears off to become a clipboard-style tablet. \nJust in time for the holidays (and for new MacBook Pros to finally arrive), Microsoft's reinvested in its laptop line by adding the new Surface Book with Performance Base (MSRP $2,399, $3,299 as tested). This Surface Book gets an extra kick in the pants from a faster Nvidia graphics chip in a redesigned keyboard base. The tablet portion hasn't been redesigned, but you'll not only get improved graphics but also longer battery life. \nIf you were iffy about the original Surface Book, then those concerns generally apply here. But, if you thought the first Book wasn't quite powerful enough, the Performance Base version helps shore up those weaknesses, and makes the product even more lustworthy. \nMicrosoft Surface Book with Performance Base - Buy now for $2,799.99 About the Surface Book with Performance Base \nThis new version of Surface Book keeps the beating Intel heart of the current Book, and mates it to a keyboard that has a more powerful Nvidia graphics processor and more battery inside. There are three versions of this laptop, and the one we were able to try is the top-of-the-line model that sells for the eye-watering price of $3,299: Intel Core i7-6600U dual-core processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB PCIe solid state drive 13.3-inch 3000 x 2000 IPS touchscreen Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics with 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM (in keyboard dock) WiFi AC/ Bluetooth 4.1 What We Like \nThe kinks are ironed out. The last time I used a Surface Book, the end result was a mixed bag. The model I sampled was prone to glitches—not what you want from a super expensive, premium-grade 2-in-1. And I wasn't the only one complaining, either. \nNotetaking and sketching are awesome with Surface Book's included pen. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) \nThankfully, most of these issues have been resolved at this point, and a lot of them were due to Intel's 6th generation chips, which had problems in many competing systems, too. I found the Surface Book with Performance Base perfectly usable, with little issue whether in full laptop mode, or even with the screen torn off and used as a tablet. \nA spec bump in some key areas. Some might kvetch that the new, super-expensive Surface Book with Performance Base isn't that different. It still uses a 6th generation Intel Core i7 chip in the display, meaning the detachable tablet portion is unchanged from its introduction late last year. Is that the end of the world? Well, no. Even though Intel's just debuted its latest 7th gen processors, I've found that they don't add a whole lot into the mix. These dual-core i7 processors are solid at this point. \nWhere the Performance Base changes the narrative is in graphics performance and battery life. The original discrete GPU models of Surface Book have a custom Nvidia graphics chip that helped it get a leg-up on its competition but wasn't anything to write home about. The Performance Base swaps that for a spicier Nvidia GTX 965M with 2 GB GDDR5 memory onboard. It won't game or crunch data like a Razer Blade , but it'll give a much-appreciated boost when running through demanding tasks. \nThe redesigned keyboard is satisfying to use. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) \nBattery capacity is up around 30%, all stuffed inside the redesigned Performance Base keyboard. In our intensive PCMark 8 Home battery life test, we saw a decent increase of runtime. Up from around four and a half hours, we saw nearly five hours in the test with the Performance Base version. If you're a road warrior who demands a power and battery life that can work as long as you, this new version of Surface Book should be on your list. \nSleek, and still unorthodox as all getout Bitter about the 2016 MacBook Pros? If you gravitated towards Apple's notebooks because they're beautiful and go against the grain, then meet the hipster laptop of your dreams. Surface Book with Performance Base delivers fast internals in an unforgettable, unique enclosure. If you're looking at paying Apple prices for a notebook, Surface Book might not make you shy like a startled mustang. \nBut the inclusion of a lovely pen ( recommended by our comic artist pal Braden Lamb ), the versatility of using the screen as a standalone device for watching a video or reading, is something that the MacBook Pro can't do. Sure, the Mac has a skinny Touch Bar above the keyboard, but it still doesn't have a full touchscreen like Surface Book. Additionally, the Surface Book lets you log in with your grinning face instead of using a fingerprint, a technology that, when it works, makes the Mac's TouchID sensor seem like it's old hat. \nWe think the dynamic fulcrum hinge is as beautiful and unique as it was last year.

Surface Book with Performance Base has none of these drawbacks. It might not have the awesome potential of a Thunderbolt 3 port like competitors from Razer and Dell, but everything else makes it feel ready to get real work done now, today, in the present. \nSurface Book with Performance Base retains the handy SD card reader and twin USB 3.0 ports that professional users expect. The keyboard dock, redesigned to fit a hotter, faster graphics processor, has a new keyboard to match. Redesigned though it may be, it's another A+ Microsoft keyboard—super comfortable and responsive to type on for long sprints.

The so-called \"clipboard\" is a cool party trick, but its short 2-hour battery life means you won't be binge watching Netflix on its gorgeous 13.3-inch display. Instead, you'll be limited to short bursts of content, quick batch edits in Lightroom, or a few chapters in a Kindle book. \nI've used the Surface Book clipboard to edit stories with the Surface Pen, and for that usage, Surface Book with Performance Base is as extraordinary to use as before. Journalists who like to red-pen material just like in the good ol' paper days would do well to look into a Surface for editing and notetaking. \nSure, you can use Lightroom like this...but don't count on the tablet lasting very long. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) \nNo Thunderbolt 3 in a year when everyone's added it. So, Apple took away the MacBook Pro's normal USB ports and replaced them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac fans are already bellyaching about needing adapters in order to use their current accouterments. \nThat gives the Surface Book immediate compatibility with today's devices, but there's a catch. I'd imagine, without an extensive redesign, Microsoft was unable to sneak in a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. One of these future-proofed ports would have gone a long way to bridge the gap between today's needs and tomorrow's devices, but I'd imagine that we'll have to wait for the inevitable Surface Book sequel to roll around. \nFull-size USB ports are welcome, but we're waiting for a Thunderbolt 3 to be added to the mix. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt) \nAs it stands, competing devices from HP , Dell , and Razer all give you the power of Thunderbolt and the flexibility of USB-C, giving them a slight port advantage over the updated Surface Book with Performance Base. Should You Buy It? It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. \nThanks to its boost in battery and graphics potential, Microsoft has given Surface Book a great shot in the arm. It's the highest-performing 2-in-1 we've tested thus far, and it underscores that Surface wants to win over pro and creative users. It's far from the reinvention that some people were hoping for, and if you were annoyed with the old one, this one has the exact same foibles. \nThe concept didn't need a whole lot more to push it over the edge, and the extra oomph of the Performance Base make it that much more interesting. Of course, you're still looking at a really expensive device. Given that this will trounce a similarly-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro in intensive graphical tasks, the extra price doesn't seem like a big ask. \nThrow in the detachable tablet and the useful Surface Pen, and the unique value proposition makes Surface Book more interesting than what Apple has to offer on its Pro offerings. Of course, quad-core models like the Razer Blade and Dell XPS 15 give you more computing power for your money. Where Surface Book shines is as a device that has few legitimate rivals. Its blend of performance, design, and flexibility are hard to find elsewhere. Even though it costs a pretty penny, Microsoft still has a special laptop in this supercharged Surface Book.

      "title": "The new Surface Book with Performance Base and the Surface Dial go on sale today",
      "text": "  \nTwo weeks ago, Microsoft held a much talked about Windows 10 event in New York where the company introduced new Surface hardware including an all-in-one Surface Studio PC , a radar haptic input device called the Surface Dial and an updated Surface Book hybrid PC. While the Surface Studio won’t ship until December in the US, the company has announced today that both the Surface Book and the Surface Dial are now available to purchase at Microsoft Stores and select Best Buy locations in the US and Canada. \nMicrosoft is branding its new Surface Book hybrid as the “Surface Book with Performance Base,” and it starts at $2,399. For this premium price, you get pretty high end specs including an Intel Core i7 processor, an NVIDIA GTX 965M GPU, up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage and up to 16 hours of battery life. “No comparable laptop has this much computation power, this many pixels and this much battery life, in this light of a form factor,” claimed Microsoft in its blog post. \nAs for the Surface Dial, Microsoft has been mostly advertising it as a handy accessory for its creative professionals using its new Surface Studio all-in-one PC, though the $99.99 device should work fine offscreen with any PC running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update as well as as onscreen with the company’s Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book hybrids after an upcoming firmware update . “The Dial integrates with Windows 10 Global Controls & delivers a set of unique experiences such as app-specific, contextually aware toolbars,” explained the company but you’ll probably better understand this product by watching our hands-on video below: \nDue to “strong demand,” Microsoft said that the Surface Dial is temporary out of stock on the Microsoft Store but people who pre-order it now will receive it in mid-December. If you want one right now, Best Buy is currently your only option. Sound off in the comments if you plan to buy one of these new Surface products in the coming weeks.  ",

But starting next year this is going to change. \nAs of February 2017, Microsoft will make use of the newly launched Security Updates Guide database. This, on the face of it, sounds like a great idea -- a searchable database of information -- but it changes the way information is presented and is unlikely to be well-received by users. \nThe announcement was hardly shouted from the hilltops -- it was a little afterthought tacked on the end of a short blog post : \"Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide \". \nThe main point of the blog point is to point out the existence of the new database, of which Microsoft says: \nThis month we released a preview of our new single destination for security vulnerability information, the Security Updates Guide . Instead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database. \nIs this a good idea? That remains to be seen...",

May be even graph rest api. However probably as a separate project. \nCurrently uses basic authentication. In a very near future will be switching to OAuth2. \nThis commit have only Mail module.

May be even graph rest api. However probably as a separate project. \nCurrently uses basic authentication. In a very near future will be switching to OAuth2. \nThis commit have only Mail module. Mail \nMain class for working with emails in Office 365. You can use it to perform access to different folders and may features exposed by REST api.",

As of February 2017, Microsoft will make use of the newly launched Security Updates Guide database.

      "text": "Microsoft is releasing a new update for Office Lens iOS app. This new update brings two new features: Immersive Reader and Frame Guide. Immersive Reader allows you to focus when text is highlighted and read out loud at the same time. Frame Guide allows you to frame your pictures by using Voice Over.\nImmersive Reader: \nRead aloud —Reads text out loud with simultaneous highlighting that improves decoding, fluency and comprehension while sustaining focus and attention. Font size —Allows the user to increase or decrease the size of fonts. Wide text spacing —Optimizes font spacing in a narrow column view to improve reading fluency for users who suffer from “visual crowding” issues. Back five words and forward one page —Allows the user to move backwards and forwards in the content. Speaking rate —Allows user to control the speed of the voice reading back the words. Frame Guide: \nFrame your pictures even when you have low vision or blindness by using Voice Over to get real-time hints like “move right” and “move up.”\nTo empower people with visual impairments to get an image of exactly what they’re trying to capture, we’re launching Frame Guide. Using Apple’s Voice Over technology, Frame Guide shows users how to capture their desired content by telling the user to move back, to the right or in other directions to get the full page in the frame.\nDownload the app here from Apple App Store.

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft is searching for preventative measures to battle cancer with the help of its machine learning technology . Throughout the second half of the year, we’ve reported about Microsoft Research using search query and anonymized data to link potential risks, health symptoms, and the probability of diagnosis to pave a path for healthcare professionals. \nWith 20% of lung cancer diagnoses made in non-smokers, Microsoft Research is determined to assist in finding those nontraditional causes that are plaguing the population. They’ve used a similar algorithm to the research in Pancreatic Cancer , noting that approximately 5 million anonymous searchers were examined in this particular study. Apparently, this model can identify 1.5% -40% people nearly a year in advance before they confirm a lung cancer diagnosis. Even though it’s been tweaked to prevent false positives, that’s still a significant amount of time that could potentially save a life. \nEric Horvitz, the Managing Director of Microsoft Research in Redmond, co-authored a publication for JAMA Oncology with their findings. \nThe statistical classifier predicting the future appearance of landmark web queries based on search log signals identified searchers who later input queries consistent with a lung carcinoma diagnosis, with a true-positive rate ranging from 3% to 57% for false-positive rates ranging from 0.00001 to 0.001, respectively. The methods can be used to identify people at highest risk up to a year in advance of the inferred diagnosis time. \nThe results also explained that five key factors that were found to lead to lung cancer via search queries included family history, age, radon levels, primary location, and occupation. The reason that evidence of smoking wasn’t on the list? Because it’s hard to determine the user’s smoking preferences from just a search history. \nMicrosoft Research believes that these queries may not be able to find specific causes on its own. According to the blog post, it is the start of a hypothesis that can lead to more studies and researches in the healthcare industry. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Russia Targets Microsoft in Latest Anti-trust Probe By AFP on November 10, 2016 Tweet \nRussia's antitrust authority on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market. \nIn a statement, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service said it had taken the decision after being contacted by the Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky. \nIt accuses Microsoft of reducing to six working days the time for third party software vendors to adapt their antivirus packages to the Windows 10 operating system, compared with two months for earlier versions. \nWhen a Windows user installs the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default. \nWith only a few days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, software developers like Kaspersky do not have the time to provide users with adequate service. \n\"As Microsoft itself develops the Windows Defender antivirus system, which automatically becomes active if the third party software products do not have time to be adapted to Windows 10, such measures constitute an unfair advantage for Microsoft,\" FAS deputy director Anatoli Golomolzine said in the statement. \nKaspersky confirmed approaching the antitrust authority as well as the European Commission in a statement which said the move came \"after months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.\" \nIn August, the FAS started legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in Russia. \nIn the same month, it also hit Google with a $6.75 million fine for abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on phones running the Android operating system.",

      "text": "Duration Show More Show Less \n- [Nate] ASP.NET Core is the latest evolution of Microsoft's ASP.NET Web Framework and a lot has changed. The most significant change is that ASP.NET is now cross-platform with native support for Windows, Mac, and Linux. In the past, ASP.NET applications could only be deployed on Windows and IIS Server, but cross-platform support means a number of new opportunities for deploying and running your applications. Hi, I'm Nate Barbettini. In this course I'll be guiding you through the various deployment strategies you can use to get your ASP.NET Core applications from development to production. \nWe'll cover deploying to IIS on Windows, deploying to the Azure App Service, as well as setting up and deploying to a Linux environment. We'll top it off by exploring Docker and taking a look at how containers can streamline the process of deploying your ASP.NET Core application. We've got plenty to cover in this course so let's get started. Resume Transcript Auto-Scroll",

If you’ve been waiting to buy the new, more powerful Surface Book or try out Microsoft’s fancy new Surface Dial after Microsoft’s event last month, they’ve both gone on sale today. As a recap, the new Surface Book doubles graphics performance with by using an Nvidia 965M instead of the old 940M variant, and packs in a 30% larger battery for up to 16 hours of use.

Although not many tech corporations supported the now President, organizations will slowly have to accept the result if they want to success in America moving forward. In addition to congratulating Donald Trump, Microsoft has also made it very clear they will be uncompromising in key aspects. \"Were committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.\" Chief legal officer Brad Smith stated. In combating Trump's comment that tech company's should create a backdoor for government use, Smith wrote that Microsoft is \"committed to developing technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world.\" Time will tell how the relationship between the government and companies like Microsoft will progress but for now, I am sure both sides are hopeful.",

      "text": "A \nMOSCOW: Russia's antitrust authority on Thursday (Nov 10) said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market. \nIn a statement, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service said it had taken the decision after being contacted by the Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky. \nIt accuses Microsoft of reducing to six working days the time for third party software vendors to adapt their antivirus packages to the Windows 10 operating system, compared with two months for earlier versions. \nWhen a Windows user installs the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default. \nWith only a few days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, software developers like Kaspersky do not have the time to provide users with adequate service. \n\"As Microsoft itself develops the Windows Defender antivirus system, which automatically becomes active if the third party software products do not have time to be adapted to Windows 10, such measures constitute an unfair advantage for Microsoft,\" FAS deputy director Anatoli Golomolzine said in the statement. \nKaspersky confirmed approaching the antitrust authority as well as the European Commission in a statement which said the move came \"after months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.\" \nIn August, the FAS started legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in Russia. \nIn the same month, it also hit Google with a US$6.75 million fine for abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on phones running the Android operating system. - AFP/ec",

      "text": "  \nThis is a wall of Activision’s own making. Microsoft has a long standing commitment to supporting cross-play between its platforms and games. Its own, first party games support it. Killer Instinct offers play between the Xbox One and PC versions. Forza Horizon 3 supports it. It’s even shown dedication to making such openness happen for Gwent: A Witcher Card Game . CD Projekt Red’s game will offer cross-platform play for people on Steam, the Windows 10 Store, and Xbox One. Microsoft supports cross-play for companies that seek it out. Activision decided not to seek it out for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare . \nWhich makes no sense. What did Activision believe? That this would make Windows 10 owners buy the game twice? That people would purchase a second copy for a console for a better multiplayer experience? Certainly, it doesn’t hurt people who bought the game on Steam. There are more of them in the wild. The most it would have meant is extra work on Activision's part to ensure all PC gamers could play together. \nIt’s also ironic. Cross-platform play is growing and extending its reach. We have games like Final Fantasy XIV, Street Fighter V, Rocket League, Project Spark, God Eater 2: Rage Burst, Gwent, and DC Universe Online that transcend platforms and allow people on consoles, handhelds, and PCs to all play together. Instead of embracing that and seeing what it can do to allow Call of Duty fans to play together, Activision is encouraging further division by not even allowing people with PCs the guaranteed right to play with other PC owners. \nTo not open up your game to as many people as possible is lunacy. It isn’t good for the players. It limits the number of folks you’ll have to play with. It isn’t good for consoles, as it causes wars over which ones are better or worse. It absolutely isn’t good for the people making the games, as it shows they don’t care about consumers and smart business decisions. Activision’s decision to lock down Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare makes no sense. One can only hope the outcry will cause them to rethink their decisions and work toward a more inclusive future.",

      "title": "Windows 10 Build 14965 is now available to Fast Ring Insiders",
      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just pushed a new Windows 10 build to Insiders on the Fast Ring. Build 14965 is available for both Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile . \nThis is the second Creators Update build for Windows 10 and while it doesn’t bring any new 3D features , it actually contains some interesting additions, along with a few updates for the existing apps and services. So, let’s talk about the additions one by one. \nProbably the biggest addition of Windows 10 build 14965 is the introduction of the virtual touchpad for second monitors . When you connect your Windows 10 tablet to an external display, there’s no need to attach a mouse to it because a virtual touchpad will pop up. As soon as the connection is initiated, the virtual touchpad will appear where the notifications are and you’ll be able to control your mouse pointer with it. \nThe new build also brings a huge update for Sticky Notes . The tool now features flight detection for several countries, URL and email recognition, time recognition, phone number recognition, and more. Users are currently far from satisfied with Windows 10’s version of Sticky Notes , so updates like this one are a must for Microsoft if the company wants users to stick with Sticky Notes. \nAdditionally, the new build also improves Windows Ink Workspace and the Hyper-V VM experience. Improving Windows Ink Workspace is important because the company prepares the field for the Creators Update , where using a pen is going to be more important than ever. \nAnd finally, build 14965 improves the search bar in the Registry Editor . Microsoft introduced the search bar a few builds ago, so it now just wants to polish it as much as possible before shipping the feature with the Creators Update next year. Windows 10 build 14965 known issues and other improvements \nAs always, Microsoft released a list with all the known issues that build 14965 may potentially cause, as well as all the improvements featured in the build. Here’s the list of all improvements for PC: “We have fixed the issue causing Internet Explorer to crash a few seconds after launch. We fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the “Prendre une <photo/video/selfie>” (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We’ve made some graphics improvements so the system will now respond better when WIN + L is pressed while playing a full screen game. We’ve updated the ALT + F4 Shutdown dialog to better respond to DPI changes when connected to an external monitor. We also fixed an issue where the tooltips for the taskbar notification area items would be incorrectly sized after a DPI change until rebooting the machine or otherwise signing out and back in. We’ve fixed an issue where File Explorer might crash when creating or renaming a folder on a network share. We fixed an issue resulting in the text on the Outlook Calendar tile on the Start menu being slightly fuzzy. We fixed an issue where deleted files might reappear in File Explorer with a 0 byte size. We fixed an issue resulting in a Windows Default Lock Screen window sometimes appearing after logging in. We fixed an issue resulting in File Explorer crashing after right-clicking an app in Task Manager and selecting “Open File Location”. We’ve updated our migration logic so that going forward from Build 14965, preferred UAC settings, startup shortcuts, and File Explorer folders that had been pinned to the Start menu will all now be preserved across upgrades. We fixed an issue resulting in vertical lists written in XAML, such as those found in Groove Music, unexpectedly animating in from the side. We fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed “Create an appointment” then clicked on the resulting suggestion to “Create an appointment”. We fixed an issue where in Microsoft Edge, after cancelling a file download, the progress bar for the next file downloaded might appear to be stuck at the point at which the old file’s download was a when it was cancelled . We fixed an issue that could result in the Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) periodically showing the candidate window in the upper left corner of the desktop and not being able to enter text into the Office 2016 apps and some other text editors.” Here are the improvements for Mobile: “We fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the “Prendre une <photo/video/selfie>” (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed “Create an appointment” then tapped on the resulting suggestion to “Create an appointment”. We improved the performance for English (India) text prediction. We fixed an issue in Data Usage Settings, where after selecting the data plan to be unlimited, it would still prompt to set a limit. We’ve also made it easier in the Data Usage Settings for those with dual SIM phones to differentiate between the cellular data use on each SIM, and fixed a few other polish issues, including that the sort by dropdown on the Usage Details page was unexpectedly wide. We fixed an issue where Narrator wasn’t giving feedback when adjusting sliders, for example in Settings, or in the Volume flyout. We fixed a migration issue resulting in Microsoft Edge to fail to launch for some Insiders after updating to a new build.” Known issues for PC: Double-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer will crash Microsoft Excel. The workaround is to open the document from within Excel. Microsoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt may freeze at the splash screen on launch. Known issues for Mobile: If you used the previous ‘date change’ workaround to update to Build 14951 or Build 14955: Please don’t use it any longer! The Microsoft account (MSA) ticket on your device needs to expire and then you’ll be offered today’s build. If you changed your date by 30 years… you’ll want to do a device reset. You will be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone for the next few weeks. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You just can’t install any new ones. If you do a hard reset of your phone on these builds – you will also be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround. \nTo get the latest Windows 10 build 14965, just head over to the Settings app > Update & security , and check for updates. Remember, you need to be on the Fast Ring. \nIf you’ve already installed build 14965, feel free to use the comment section below to tell us more about your experience with the new build. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nAhead of its late October Windows 10 event in New York two weeks ago, Microsoft announced a trade-in program for MacBook owners looking to buy a Surface 2-in-1 for a cheap on the Microsoft Store. While the program was initially set to end on November 7, Microsoft has since extended the deadline to November 23, 2016, 11:59 PM PST, while supplies last. \nMore than a hundred MacBook models are eligible for Microsoft’s trade-in offer. \nOther details have remained the same, and you can still get up to $650 for eligible MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro models. Of course, your Apple devices must be fully functional (including the battery), come with all original accessories, be unmodified and not password-protected. Lastly, the redemption code will still be valid until December 15, 2016. \nIf you’re interested in this offer, it’s currently available in Microsoft retail and online store in the United States (including Puerto Rico), and we invite you to check all the details on the dedicated web page .

      "title": "Microsoft Teams is coming to the Windows Store for Windows 10 PCs with Live Tile and Notifications support",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft introduced its chat-based workspace app for Office 365 , Microsoft Teams last week. Microsoft Teams is available as a Win32 app on Windows PCs, and it’s also available on the Mac, Android, iOS and Windows Phone. Interestingly enough though, the app is not available from the Windows Store on Windows 10 PCs via the Desktop Bridge (aka Project Centennial) . Additionally, the app also uses custom notifications rather than the default Windows 10 notifications\nIn an Ask Me Anything session today, Microsoft is answering some questions regarding Teams — so I went ahead and ask Microsoft is the company plans on bringing Teams to the Windows Store. And as expected, Microsoft is, indeed, bringing Teams to the Windows Store via the Desktop App Bridge. In addition to bringing Teams to the Windows Store, Microsoft will also introduce Windows 10 notifications and Live Tile support. Here is the response from Microsoft’s Swati Jhawar who is a Senior Program Manager at Skype:\n“We are working on that. We will be in Windows Store via Desktop Bridge which will enable capability to have Win 10 notifications and live tile updates” Microsoft didn’t provide any info on when the app will be available from the Windows Store, but our guess is that it will be available sometime in early 2017 which is when Microsoft Teams will be coming out of preview. We’ll let you know when Microsoft Teams is available from the Windows Store — in the meantime, make sure to checkout our hands-on with Teams here. ",

On the other hand, people based in Haryana and Gujarat led for the alternate search term \"how to convert black money.\" \nFinance Minister Confirms There's No GPS Chip in New Rs. 2,000 Note Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has officially debunked the rumour that the Rs. 2,000 note will come with a GPS tracker. The rumour has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp , with many a people forwarding the wrong information about the new currency note among their family and friends. Wallet on delivery is now a thing Consumers can now use the FreeCharge Wallet to purchase goods from Snapdeal under the Wallet on Delivery programme, an alternative to the popular cash-on-delivery (CoD) option. Paytm and MobiKwik said they too are planning such initiatives. Snapdeal on Thursday was also offering 10 percent instant discount (up to a maximum of Rs 500) on all credit debit cards for most products (except a few smartphones) ordered on its desktop and mobile sites.\nApple, Microsoft, Facebook CEOs react to Donald Trump's Win After Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US presidential elections, US tech executives expressed how they felt about the results , some publicly and some privately. Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post called for people to work together and solve problems that the world faces. Satya Nadella in a LinkedIn post congratulated Trump and said that Microsoft looks forward to working together. Though Tim Cook did not make his thoughts public, in a memo to Apple employees he asked them to move forward together and encouraged them to reach out to co-workers who are anxious after the election results. \nSamsung starts beta-testing Android 7.0 Nougat for Galaxy S7, S7 Edge Samsung has rolled out its 'Galaxy Beta Program' for Android Nougat, which lets Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge users try out its Android 7.0 software build before the public release. The beta program is currently only available for users residing in the US, UK, and South Korea, with China being added to the list shortly. The company is currently accepting applicants on a first come, first served basis so there seems to be a limited quota for beta testing. \nSanDisk launches 256GB microSD card, 2-in-1 USB-OTG drive in India Flash storage company Sandisk launched the 256GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Premium Edition card in India, along with the SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive m3.0 pen drive with both USB and Micro-USB connectors.

      "text": "Kaspersky Lab files complaint against Microsoft for giving unfair advantage to Windows Defender Posted 10 November 2016 19:33 CET by Jan Willem Aldershoff \nRussian antivirus vendor Kaspersky Lab has asked antitrust regulators in various countries (including the European Union and Russia) to make Microsoft stop giving an unfair advantage to Windows Defender. \nMicrosoft is making it hard for independent virus vendors to compete with Windows Defender, Microsoft’s own antivirus application built-in to Windows 8 and Windows 10, according to founder of Kaspersky Lab, Eugene Kaspersky. \nFor example, when users upgraded to Windows 10, their own antivirus product was disabled and Windows Defender was enabled by default. \nAnother showcase of Microsoft’s way of making it harder to compete is that antivirus companies only received a week to make their antivirus software compatible with Windows 10. And even when the antivirus software was compatible, Windows Defender would be enabled nevertheless. \nIf Windows Defender was disabled (and other antivirus software was running) it would show a warning, asking the user to uninstall their antivirus software and to turn on Windows Defender. Kaspersky argues that many users would think, “well, it’s from Microsoft – the people who make the OS; must be good; no harm in turning it on for sure”. \nAnother complaint Kaspersky has is that Microsoft has limited the possibilities antivirus companies have to warn users that their license is about to expire. Microsoft only allows a warning in the Windows Security Center, which normally users hardly ever read. If the user doesn’t timely extend his license, the antivirus software is disabled and Windows Defender is activated. \n\nKaspersky also criticizes the fact that Microsoft has limited the number of virus scanners users can have on a single system. One antivirus application is normally allowed, except for Microsoft’s own Windows Defender. Even when another antivirus application is installed, Windows Defender will occasionally become active and again ask the user to turn on Windows Defender and uninstall other antivirus applications. \nAnd all of it is not even beneficial to the user. \n“Defender gives by far not the best experience , but a below average one in the market,” Kaspersky writes in a blog titled, ‘That’s It. I’ve Had Enough!’ \nHe also has an idea what Microsoft is up to, “The trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose.” \nKaspersky goes on stating, “The company’s [Microsoft’s] intentions are easy to work out: (i) to try and get everyone to head over to the Windows Store; (ii) to levy an additional tax on independent developers; (iii) to strictly control who can do what; (iv) to suppress the competition with standardization and regulation; and (v) to further gradually take over the whole ecosystem – all to provide stable growth of profits. Put another way – to have a totalitarian/police-state platform in which there’s no place for independent developers or freedom of choice for users.” \nKaspersky Lab has therefore decided to take action, “We’ve taken the decision to address official bodies in various countries (including the EU and Russia) with a request to oblige Microsoft to cease its violation of anti-competition legislation and to remove the consequences of that violation.” \nThe company wants Microsoft to provide new versions and updates of Windows to independent developers in good time so they can maintain compatibility of their software to Windows. It also wants to force Microsoft to explicitly inform the user of the presence of incompatible software before upgrading Windows and to recommend the user to install a compatible version of the software after the upgrade and to always explicitly ask the user for his/her approval to enable Windows Defender. \nAlso other antivirus vendors are unhappy according to Kaspersky, “Despite Microsoft slowly killing off the independent security industry, so far, we’re the only ones who have bitten the bullet and decided to say something about this publicly.” \nKaspersky also warns that not only security companies should be worried about Microsoft’s business tactics, also other software developers on the Windows platform are in danger. Therefore Kaspersky calls for all independent software developers to “form an united front and all fight together”. Related Forum:",

      "text": "  Satya Nadella, chief of Microsoft. The incoming president had few kind words for tech giants during his campaign. Credit Lucas Jackson/Reuters Silicon Valley loves disruption — just not, it turns out, disruptions of a certain kind. As Farhad Manjoo writes , the world capital of technology was in shock after Tuesday’s election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. Mr. Trump had few visible fans in the Valley, other than billionaire Peter Thiel , and many vocal critics. The tech elite had criticized him for his statements about immigration and globalization, along with much in his personal behavior. Mr. Trump in turn took the Valley companies to task for building their iconic products in China, and implicitly condemned the local culture of global elites, driving their subsidized Teslas past much of working-class America. With a relationship like that, there are expectations that much of the tech business as usual is over. At first pass, even before Mr. Trump’s policies and programs are known, the tech world seems to feel as if it won’t be at the center of attention, the way it seemed to be in the now-passing Obama years. President Obama, a self-proclaimed geek, liked publicizing his school science fairs at the White House and embraced the idea that the sweeping changes to the economy and society wrought by modern technology were ultimately beneficial. Photo Mr. Trump, with his slogan of restoring America, seems more wary of big changes — particularly those that alienate his base of traditional Americans in the country’s rural zones. Not to mention that he has a well-known penchant for holding a grudge , and is likely to remember Silicon Valley’s disdain for his campaign. \n  Not being cool with the powers that be would indeed be disruptive, and could very likely affect local profits. But there are a few things the Valley should bear in mind before falling into utter despair. For starters, no matter who is in charge, the future is still coming at us, one day at a time, and they have a big role in that. The next administration won’t recall all iPhones or forbid the production of apps. And while Mr. Trump may profess anger at the digital industry, he is clearly fond of Twitter, and ran a lightweight, fast-moving and iterative campaign that owed much to his fans using new media like YouTube. Besides, Mr. Trump famously likes to do deals; with all the billions lying around the Valley, the two sides might eventually find a way to do business together.",

      "text": "Microsoft Says Russian APT Group Behind Zero-Day Attacks November 1, 2016 , 5:50 pm \nThe academics, which include four from UK’s University of Oxford, Queensland University of Technology in Australia, and Canada’s McMaster University, claim the paper they co-authored is the first in-depth analysis on the platform’s cryptographic core. \nResearchers also concluded that Signal satisfies several standard security protocols and can stand pat in the face of compromise, according authors Katriel Cohn-Gordon, Cas Cremers , Benjamin Dowling, Luke Garratt, and Douglas Stebila. \n“Derived session keys should remain secret under a variety of compromise scenarios, including if a long-term secret has been compromised but a medium or ephemeral secret has not (forward secrecy) or if state is compromised and then an uncompromised asymmetric stage later occurs,” according to the paper which was released last month. \nCryptographically speaking, forward secrecy is a property which protects past sessions against future compromises of secret keys or passwords. \nSince its inception, Signal has prided itself as a “ratcheting forward secrecy protocol” that works in synchronous and asynchronous messaging environments. The “ratcheting forward secrecy” concept, which makes it so session keys are updated with every message sent, dates back to OTR messaging, which Signal is based on. The technology, developed by Open Whisper Systems, continuously ratchets key material forward during the course of a session. \nThe researchers evaluated Signal alongside their own multi-stage key exchange security model. At least according to their analysis of the protocol’s cryptographic capabilities, Signal is secure. The researchers crafted their model around the idea that Signal is a collection of algorithms, and then observed how an adversary would interact with the scenario. In this model environment, the network is fully adversarially-controlled, but the researchers determined they could still prove the secrecy and authentication of message keys. \n“Our analysis shows that the cryptographic core of Signal provides useful security properties. These properties, while complex, are encoded in our security model, and which we prove that Signal satisfies under standard cryptographic assumptions. Practically speaking, they imply secrecy and authentication of the message keys which Signal derives, even under a variety of adversarial compromise scenarios such as forward security (and thus “future secrecy”). If used correctly, Signal could achieve a form of post-compromise security, which has substantial advantages over forward secrecy.” \nDevelopers could bolster the security around protocol in the future if they wanted – perhaps by borrowing elements from the NAXOS protocol, researchers say. Developers could also include a “static-static DH shared secret in the key derivation,” to avoid Signal’s random number generator being guessed, according to the paper. \nThe quintet said using “constructions in the spirit” of NAXOS – an authenticated key exchange protocol first introduced by Microsoft researchers back in 2007 – could prevent Signal’s random number generator from becoming too predictable. \nWhile the audit, “ A Formal Security Analysis of the Signal Messaging Protocol ,” (.PDF) looked at the protocol’s code it did not review any third-party implementations of the protocol. \nThe popular chat app WhatsApp began rolling out Signal protocol support earlier this year. According to Moxie Marlinspike, Open Whisper Systems’ founder, the version is similar to what’s deployed in the Signal app, which means WhatsApp cannot decrypt its users’ communications. \nGoogle embedded the Signal protocol in its Allo messaging app in May but the company caught flak after it was reported the functionality wouldn’t be turned on by default, and only be active in incognito mode sessions.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has updated its custom Android launcher app Arrow Launcher with a couple of new features this week. The software giant has been testing these features in beta for a few weeks now, and they are finally available for everyone to use. With the latest update, Microsoft is bringing some more customization features for icons on Arrow Launcher, allowing users to change the size of app icons which can be quite handy. Previously, Arrow Launcher only allowed users to change the icon pack for apps, but now the icon size can also be configured.\nIn addition to this, Microsoft is also bringing support for app shortcuts to Arrow Launcher. With this feature, users can easily an app’s shortcut right from the homescreen of their Android app. For instance, Cortana for Android has an app shortcut which allows users to easily perform a certain task via voice commands, and you’ll now be able to use that shortcut on Arrow Launcher.\nMicrosoft is also bringing back the widgets page back to Arrow Launcher, which was removed for some unknown reason in the past. Thankfully though, it’s now back and you should be able to pin any widget you want to the dedicated widgets page.\nAs usual, the update also brings some performance improvements and bug fixes, so here’s the full changelog:\nIcon size customization. You’ve asked for it, we’ve delivered. Shortcuts for apps now supported, on the apps page. The widgets page is back! Enjoy a dedicated page, just for widgets. Arrow is more memory efficient than ever. We’ve optimized memory usage even further, for a smoother experience. Bug fixes for wallpaper and other items. If you are an Android user, you can download the latest update for Arrow Launcher from the Google Play Store here. ",

Instead you can do it online, with a slew of social features designed to connect past and future friends. \n\nMicrosoft began rolling out its so-called Holiday Update on Thursday, adding features such as Clubs, Looking For Group and other features to its network of Xbox One consoles and the Xbox app for Windows 10. If you don’t have it already, your box should be getting it soon.\n\nMicrosoft announced some of these features at its E3 presentation in June, introducing them into the Xbox Preview Program a bit later. That latter program has been renamed the Xbox Insider Program, similar to the Windows Insider Program, and is now available to all.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Microsoft has recently rolled out its latest Windows 10 Preview Build 14965 for its Windows Insider Program members. The latest build provides bug fixes plus cool features including a virtual touchpad, better Sticky Notes app, and Windows Ink Workspace changes. ( David Ramos | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has rolled out its Windows 10 Preview for Insiders in the Fast Ring. And it comes with a couple of bug fixes, slightly delayed language packs update, and some new cool features. \nThis is the second build ahead of Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update that will commence in the early part of 2017. The build, with number 14965, brings improvements to Sticky Notes, Registry Editor's address bar, Windows Ink Workspace, Hyper-V and allows controlling external monitors from tablet devices. \nWindows 10 Preview Build 14965 was built in a different way than its predecessors allowing it to be updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. And while Microsoft has released various updates to date, its Windows 10 Creators Update will be its major one following its Windows 10 anniversary release last August. What's New With Windows 10 Build 14965? \nThe new build aims to make using an external monitor easier through a tablet. It enables a virtual touchpad on tablets running Windows 10 so users can now run content directly to a different display without connecting to a mouse. \nPreviously, connecting a monitor like the Surface Pro requires attaching a mouse to use the second display that will behave similar to a standard desktop monitor. Now, it is possible to use the on-screen track pad to control the cursor on the external monitor. \nIt seems like Microsoft has some plans for its Sticky Notes application. In the latest Insider update, the Sticky Notes app will now read flight information in German, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian and French aside from English. \nThe app will also be able to sense any flight information saved to a note and will automatically show latest updates for the said flight. Additionally, it will feature better performance and a snazzier UI/UX. \nSmaller updates were introduced to the Registry Editor and Windows Ink Workspace in this build. The former will have a revamped address bar that allows users to use keyboard shortcuts. The latter will now be able to show more recently used apps in the menu plus a new protractor that can be controlled via the mouse's scroll wheel. \nAdded support for other language packs outside English will be coming shortly as the company needs more time to get them ready for testing. Fixes To Known Bugs \nIt is safe to say that with the latest Windows Insider update comes a few bugs or issues to be encountered. The recent Windows 10 Build also made fixes to common PC issues. • Fixed an issue causing Internet Explorer to crash a few seconds after launching. • Made graphics improvements consequently making the system respond faster and better when pressing WIN + L while playing a game in full screen mode. • Updated ALT + F4 Shutdown dialogue to respond better to DPI changes when connected to a separate monitor. • Fixed an issue where File Explorer crashes when renaming or creating a folder on a shared network. • Fixed an issue with Cortana crashing when typing \"Create an appointment\" then clicking the suggested results. \nMeanwhile, the latest build also provided some fixes to known mobile issues as well. Where To Get Windows 10 Build 14965 \nTo be able to download the latest insider build, users have to join the Windows Insider Program and follow the necessary steps to sign up. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The modern skating classic rose to popularity with the advent of Let's Play videos on YouTube and has made a weird resurgence that most older titles don't see. The fans really do love the game and that is awesome to hear in 2016.\nTo honor the occasion, some of the DLC for Skate 3 is currently being offered for free. The game has also been marked down to $9.99 for Xbox Live Gold members, so anyone who complains about not being able to play the game is just making up excuses. The stars are all aligned for you.",

      "text": "  \nMaxim Lukiyanov, a Senior Program Manager at Azure HDInsight has taken to the Microsoft Azure Blog to announce that the Azure big data teams will hold an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit on November 17th. The AMA comes as a way for the team to reach out and learn from customers and the community as to how the service can be made better. \nOverall, the session will run on Thursday, November 17th, 2016 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM PST on r/Azure. Folks from the Azure big data engineering team will be there to answer questions about products, services, and even the teams themselves. Program Managers and Developers from the Azure Data Lake, HDInsight, R Server, Data Factory and Stream Analytics teams will also be participating throughout the day. Likewise, AMA is a great way to ask literally anything as the usual places to ask questions (such StackOverflow, MSDN, and Twitter) have either character limits, or question limits. \nWith the Ask Me Anything, you will be able to get answers to your questions directly from the team and have natural conversation with those responsible for public Azure products and services. Of course, the team does note that they will not be able to comment on unreleased features and future plans, so please do keep this in mind. \nWill you be joining the AMA session? We’d love to know, so be sure to tell us what you think by dropping us a comment below!  ",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft has released a new Office for Android Insider Preview build, bringing the build number to 16.0.7531.1002. The November update contains a number of new features, and it's actually pretty significant. \nFor one thing, users will now be able to turn datasets into maps in Excel. This is a feature that was announced for Windows PCs back in September at Microsoft's Ignite 2016 conference. At the time, the company would not confirm that it was coming to the mobile applications as well. \nThe company says that 15% of datasets are geographically-based, so now Excel will recommend a map instead of a chart for data that it recognizes as such. \nHere's the full changelog: \nAccessibility built right in into your Office apps We’ve improved on support for TalkBack, your keyboard, and other assistive technology when you’re creating, editing or presenting your docs. \nBox, Egnyte, and 腾讯微云 now work with Office Enjoy more flexibility for storage and access to your Office files with Box, Egnyte, and 腾讯微云. \nTurn data into maps with Excel* Use the new Maps chart type to transform geographical data into professional looking maps in a few steps to visualize and identify insights, trends, and opportunities. *This feature is available with 0365 subscription. \nSharing Notifications for Word, PowerPoint and Excel No need to keep checking your shared documents, workbooks, and presentations. We’ll alert you with notifications when there’s activity. \nInsert and edit Hyperlinks in Excel You can now add hyperlinks to your worksheets and use display text to make them easier to read. Give it a try! \nAs you can see, the maps feature requires an Office 365 subscription. \nIf you're not an Office Insider, you can always sign up by joining the Google+ community . One you do, utilize the various links to become a beta tester for each of the apps. \nYou can download or update your Office apps from the following links:",

      "text": "Listen | Print By AFP 1 hour ago in Technology \nRussia's antitrust authority on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market. \nIn a statement, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service said it had taken the decision after being contacted by the Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky. \nIt accuses Microsoft of reducing to six working days the time for third party software vendors to adapt their antivirus packages to the Windows 10 operating system, compared with two months for earlier versions. \nWhen a Windows user installs the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default. \nWith only a few days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, software developers like Kaspersky do not have the time to provide users with adequate service. \n\"As Microsoft itself develops the Windows Defender antivirus system, which automatically becomes active if the third party software products do not have time to be adapted to Windows 10, such measures constitute an unfair advantage for Microsoft,\" FAS deputy director Anatoli Golomolzine said in the statement. \nKaspersky confirmed approaching the antitrust authority as well as the European Commission in a statement which said the move came \"after months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.\" \nIn August, the FAS started legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in Russia. \nIn the same month, it also hit Google with a $6.75 million fine for abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on phones running the Android operating system.",

The modern skating classic rose to popularity with the advent of Let's Play videos on YouTube and has made a weird resurgence that most older titles don't see. The fans really do love the game and that is awesome to hear in 2016. \nTo honor the occasion, some of the DLC for Skate 3 is currently being offered for free. The game has also been marked down to $9.99 for Xbox Live Gold members, so anyone who complains about not being able to play the game is just making up excuses. The stars are all aligned for you.  ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIt seems software giant Microsoft is going deeper into 3D technology, and I’m wondering how this could tilt the 3D printing landscape.\nIn their most recent OS, Windows 10, the company has just provided a series of interesting 3D software tools. You can see how some of them work in this video:\nIn the video, they show everyday folks using 3D technology in a variety of ways. Someone 3D scans a vegetable using their smartphone, for example. The scanned veggie is then subjected to comedic adaptation by implanting eyes and wings with an easy-to-use 3D modeling system. You’ll even be able to 3D print the models produced in this way.\nThis is all fun, but it’s certainly not going to replace 3D scanners and CAD systems such as Creaform’s or Solidworks, as they are far more robust, precise and business-aligned than Microsoft’s new offerings.\nThat said, there are going to be some effects from Microsoft’s increasing forays into 3D technologies.\nThe first and most important is that a great deal more people will be directly exposed to 3D technology. In the past, while it was possible for everyone to get involved, it required some explicit actions to get their. By including this stuff with their software, many more people will bump into it.\nSecondly, those using the 3D tools will become accustomed to the idea of 3D. I cannot understate how critical this aspect is, because many people find it challenging to “think” in 3D. It takes a kind of mental leap to “get it”. Obviously most readers of this publication have likely done so, but this is not the case for the general public. Now that may change.\nThe result will be many more 3D-enabled people on the streets of the future.\nFinally, there is another effect: trouble of some smaller 3D developers. Those who created systems for providing simple 3D modeling or scanning may suddenly find themselves short customers, because some folks simply found what they needed with Microsoft.\nAnd yes, it’s not a vegetable, it’s a fruit. A fig, I believe.\nRead more at Fabbaloo\nThe post Microsoft’s 3D Plans and How They May Affect Everyone Else appeared first on SolidSmack .\nRead more about CAD, product design and related technology at SolidSmack.com",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft’s Xbox One Backward Compatibility program has been a resounding success by all possible measures. Tons of Xbox 360 titles have made the transition, and it’s essentially a free offering that adds significant value to Xbox One owners. \nToday, the program turns one year old, and Microsoft took to the Xbox Wire to let everyone know. Here’s what they say about it all: \nThis weekend marks one year since the Xbox One Backward Compatibility program launched, bringing your favorite Xbox 360 titles to our Xbox One catalog so you can continue to enjoy the Xbox 360 games you own at no additional cost. It’s already been a big week with the additions of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 to our library, as well as to the EA Access Vault, and the hits keep coming. We’re excited to announce the arrival of the highly-requested fan favorite, Skate 3, to our library of Backward Compatibility titles – available starting today. \nWhen we first launched Xbox One Backward Compatibility as part of the New Xbox One Experience last November, our goal was to continue to put gamers at the center of everything we do. \nWe launched with over 100 titles and have added over 170 more in the last year. Today, you can play more than 280 Xbox 360 games on Xbox One, including my personal favorites, Blue Dragon and Red Dead Redemption – and the library continues to grow. We’re thrilled with the response and engagement we’ve seen from the community with more than 210 million hours of gameplay logged. \nAs we approach our one-year mark on Saturday, November 12, we continue to work with our publishing partners to grow our library of Xbox One Backward Compatibility titles, and we’ll keep the community updated weekly when new releases are available. And don’t forget, all Xbox 360 games available through Games with Gold since we launched the program last year are also playable on Xbox One. \nIf you’re an Xbox 360 owner with a significant library of gaming titles, then the Xbox One upgrade is made all the more appealing given the fact that many of your titles will be playable on your new console. That’s a pure gift from Microsoft to you, and you’re likely grateful for the support. Let us know in the comments if you agree.",

      "text": "  \nOffice Lens , Microsoft’s ubiquitous document scanning app is getting two new features that make it even more versatile, the Office team announced in a blog post today. The first one is called Immersive Reader and may already be familiar to users of OneNote Learning Tools who may have used it to read aloud text in the note taking app . \nHowever, this built-in integration into Office Lens will provide more options with scanned documents, as you can see in the full list of features below: Read aloud—Reads text out loud with simultaneous highlighting that improves decoding, fluency and comprehension while sustaining focus and attention. Font size—Allows the user to increase or decrease the size of fonts. Wide text spacing—Optimizes font spacing in a narrow column view to improve reading fluency for users who suffer from “visual crowding” issues. Back five words and forward one page—Allows the user to move backwards and forwards in the content. Speaking rate—Allows user to control the speed of the voice reading back the words. \nThe Office team said that Immersive Reader is also now available on OneNote Online, Word Online as well as Word for the desktop and you can see how to use it in the video below. \nAdditionally, Office Lens is also improving accessibility on iOS with a new Frame Guide feature that will make it easier for the visually impaired to scan documents with the app. By leveraging’s Apple’s Voice Over technology, the app will guide users by giving voice indications to help them focus on the content they’re currently scanning. You can see how it works in the video below. \nFor now, these new features are only available on the iOS version of Office Lens, and the Office team didn’t say if the Windows 10 and Android versions would also get them in the future. If you want to try it on your iPhone, you can get the app from the download link below.",

      "text": "Microsoft today announced some updates to its Office Lens document scanning app for iOS. \nThe Immersive Reader mode, which provides a comfortable way to read the text of the documents you’ve scanned, is now included in the app, which first launched in April 2015 . The reading mode lets you adjust the text’s font size and sizing and even read the text out loud. Until this point, if you wanted to use the Immersive Reader, you had to import your scanned image into Microsoft’s separate OneNote notetaking app, through which you can view documents on other devices.\nBut the completely new thing in Office Lens is the ability for your iOS device to give you voice commands that tell you how to position the documents in front of the camera so that they can be completely captured. The feature, which Microsoft calls Framing Guide, takes advantage of the VoiceOver accessibility tooling in iOS. You’ll need to enable VoiceOver if you want to try Frame Guide. \nMicrosoft, for its part, is drawing on technology it developed through its Seeing AI research , the Office team wrote in a blog post .\nBox and Dropbox have both introduced mobile document scanning features in the past year.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nWhat’s the best way to make security even more powerful? By learning how to break into it, and that’s just what hackers have done with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. \nThursday marked an exciting day for attendees at the Power of Community conference in Seoul. Pwnfest 2016 is an event is where hackers present their exploits to break into major platforms. Both Junghoo Lee, a South Korean hacker, and Beijing’s Qihoo 360 team broke into Edge’s SYSTEM-level. Lee’s constructed exploit even broke through in just eighteen seconds. The feat earned them each $140,000. Junghoon Lee, aka LokiHardt, shows his successful Edge exploit. Darren Pauli / The Register. \nOf course, it wasn’t necessarily that easy. According to the article, Microsoft’s patch released just on Tuesday threw hackers for a loop right before Pwnfest. In fact, the Qihoo 360 team admitted that three out of four of their vulnerabilities were fixed. But that still didn’t stop the teams from fighting their way through the security. \nThe event is still underway where hackers are testing their exploits against other major platforms such as Google Pixel and Apple Safari. As The Register notes , the hackers should be expected to succeed. Once the vulnerabilities are found, hackers share their findings with the vendors meaning Microsoft Edge will be much more secure thanks to the competition. In this story stream:",

      "text": "\nThis post originally appeared on our sister site, TabTimes . \nGoogle is currently beta testing Android apps running on its Chrome OS with a few Chromebooks, such as its own Pixel, the Acer Chromebook R11 and the ASUS Flip . This week, some people who own the Flip claimed they were blocked from downloading Microsoft’s suite of Office apps for Android. However, Microsoft said in an official statement it does plan to allow access to the Office Android apps for Chrome OS users when it becomes officially available sometime in late 2016.\nSee also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 9to5Google received this statement from a Microsoft spokesperson:\nOur strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.\nSo if your Chromebook can’t currently run those Android apps, it should be able to when the Chrome OS-Android beta period is over. One thing to note is that, per Microsoft’s own rules, any device that has a screen that’s bigger than 10.1 inches will limit the features of those Office apps for free. Users won’t be able to create, edit or print any files or documents from those apps unless they purchase an Office 365 subscription from Microsoft.",

      "text": "5 hours ago I once was a retail buyer and one of my main suppliers was Microsoft. One day, I get a call from my MSFT rep informing me that they had acquired Web TV from Philips and they planned to integrate it with their MSN Internet service. Of course, that would include a major rebrand of Web TV, including an all-new logo. OK, fine.Months go by with little news from MSFT on the new logo. Retailers have long lead times to make merchandising changes, so the delay is getting annoying and it's hurting business. I kept bugging them, but was assured by MSFT that the reason it was taking so long was that they had hired the world's top marketing agency so there were concept meetings, rework sessions, internal approvals, focus groups, open design competitions, more rework, more focus groups, trademark legal filings, etc. that needed to happen, but the wait would be worth it .Finally, eight months after the acquisition, my rep flies in from Redmond for a meeting to unveil the new logo. He's holding a leather folder with a big smile on his face.Him: \"Well, Pope, we know it's taken longer than we all wanted, but here it is, I present to you, THE NEW MSN TV!\"Me: *stunned silence*Him: \"You're the first retailer we've shown it to. What do you think?\"Me: *stunned silence*Me: \"Seriously, are you freakin' kidding me? THIS is what took almost a year? Seriously?!\"Him: \"Well, I...uh...\"Me: \"Mike. You took the standard MSN butterfly logo and put \"TV\" next to it IN THE SAME FONT!\"Him: \"Yeah, but see, we put the words in all lowercase and the 'TV' part is in a different color, so it really pops. See? Nice, huh?\"Me: \"Get out.\"",

      "text": "Bengaluru: Customer support software maker Freshdesk Inc., warehouse automation robots-maker Grey Orange, and advertising technology provider InMobi are among the most “enterprise-ready” start-ups in India, according to a report released by Microsoft Accelerator on Thursday.\nDespite the demands on enterprises to innovate quickly and integrate new solutions, they find it difficult to identify partners they can work with and cannot be sure if their partners would be able to deliver, the report said. \nOn the other hand, there are a large number of start-ups that focus on selling to businesses that find it hard to get access to enterprise clients. To help with this, the report highlighted the companies which had the necessary traction and products to be able to easily work with large and small enterprises.\nIt took into account a company’s customer traction, funding, and size, to compute what it called an “enterprise readiness score”. Microsoft scored 151 companies (which were founded after the year 2000 and headquartered in India) in 10 sectors according to this metric.\nAbout half of the start-ups shortlisted are in healthcare, retail and banking sectors, with the others belonging to sectors like Internet-of-Things, security, ed-tech, data sciences, manufacturing and media.\nIndian start-ups that sell to enterprises have a cost-advantage over their counterparts in western countries, if they make quality products. Enterprises are also increasingly relying on buying services delivered via the Internet, which also gives start-ups based in India a winning chance. \n“Our research shows that contrary to popular belief, the most conservative yet disruptive sectors (such as BFSI) are embracing start-up solutions more openly than others,” said Ravi Narayan, global director, Microsoft Accelerator, in a blog post announcing the findings of the report. BFSI is short for banking, financial services and insurance.\n“This should inspire other sectors to also open up to finding solutions from start-ups. The rapidity of changes in the business environment and global climate can no longer be addressed in enterprises by incremental changes from traditional vendors, but small and nimble start-ups,” he said.\nIn this report, Microsoft Accelerator assesses the maturity of Indian start-up ecosystem, when it comes to being enterprise-ready.\nThe top fintech start-ups according to their scores are MSwipe, TechProcess Solutions and BillDesk.\nStart-ups in manufacturing which are helping traditional companies with industrial Internet-of-Things solutions and automation saw a six-year funding high in 2015 having raised $700 million. Grey Orange, chip-maker Ineda Systems and IoT firm ConnectM are the three most enterprise ready start-ups according to the report.\nIn healthcare, Practo, pharmaceutical company Celon Laboratories, and genomics-based diagnostics solutions Medgenome Labs are the three start-ups with top scores.",

      "title": "Microsoft is partnering with Google to offer the best Office experience on Chromebooks",
      "text": "\nGoogle brought Android apps to Chromebooks a little while ago. Android apps on Chromebooks are still in beta, and some apps aren’t compatible with some Chromebook devices just yet. This also includes Microsoft’s Office suite of apps which are available for download on some Chromebook devices, but some users weren’t able to install them on their Chromebook devices. This resulted in a lot of speculation which made some users think Microsoft was intentionally blocking the installation of its Office apps on Chromebooks. Thankfully though, that does not seem to be the case.\nMicrosoft is aware of the compatibility issue, and the software giant stated that it is “partnering” with Google to deliver the “best experience” for Chromebook users. The company does, however, plan on making its Office apps compatible on all devices (that support Android apps) by general availability:\n“Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.”\nMicrosoft’s Office apps is definitely going to be one of the most important apps on a Chromebook. It is worth noting that the Office apps will not be available for free to some devices for free depending on their device’s display size. Just like Office on any other platform or device, you’ll need an Office 365 subscription if your device has a display bigger than 10.1-inch. As for Chromebooks, most devices have a display larger than 10.1 inches, so most users will have to pay for Office 365 subscription to be able to use the apps on their Chromebook.\nImage via The Verge ",

The service uses Skype to create the audio/video connection for the meeting and so the tools should be familiar to any organizations that use Microsoft services on Office 365. \nOne unique feature in Microsoft Teams is the ability to quickly start up an impromptu meeting directly in any channel with the simple click of an icon in the chat window. It is almost like meeting your colleague in the hallway or at the water cooler and sharing the news of the day. \nThis gallery will show you the various ways meetings are integrated into Microsoft Teams.",

      "text": "| 0 Comments \nBanking, retail, and healthcare companies are the top adopters of startup technologies, while young firms that cater to the banking sector are most likely to raise investments, reveals a new study. \nAccording to the Ecosystem Report on Enterprise Ready Startups 2016 by Microsoft Accelerator released on Thursday, intense focus on optimisation is leading enterprises in banking, retail, and healthcare segments to adopt enterprise technology solutions in a big way. \n“Banking and healthcare have proven to be the most receptive to startup solutions. With the rise of digitisation across sectors, deep technology companies play a pivotal role in empowering these corporates to build innovative ways to engage with customers and address complex business requirements,” the study observed. \nWhile such technology solutions help banks increase customer traction and achieve greater customer satisfaction, companies in the healthcare space are expanding physical reach and affordability through machine learning and data sciences. \nThe report revealed that more than 40 startups catering to the banking sector were founded this year and close to $1.75 billion were raised by startups in this segment in 2016. \n“India already has a billion mobile phone users, as well as a billion citizens with active bank accounts that are linked to their digital identities by way of Aadhaar. The tremendous scope of opportunity these startups can leverage is one of the key reasons these startups are successful in attracting funding,” the study said. \nAs per the report, almost 50% of enterprise-ready startups belong to healthcare, retail and supply chain and banking sectors. Dynamic sectors such as banking, healthcare and IoT (Internet of things) are most receptive to startup solutions as determined by the percentage of enterprise startups in this space. \n“We are very happy to note that Indian enterprises are looking at startups for innovative solutions and expertise for their digital transformation in India. This Ecosystem Report provides insights into how this enterprise-startup partnership has evolved in last few years, underlining the value of collaboration and building the startup ecosystem,” said Ravi Narayan, global director, Microsoft Accelerator. \nThe report observed that data sciences, IT/ITES (Information Technology/Information Technology Enabled Services) and security startup attract maximum customers. Data sciences, IT/ITES and media startups have the nimblest company structures, while retail, supply chain and banking companies have the strongest company structures. \nMicrosoft said the report was based on a survey of 500 enterprise-focused startups that were founded post 2000 and are headquartered in India. The report lists the startups based on their enterprise readiness score, which is measured based on three parameters – customer traction, funding velocity of a startup and size of the company. \nLike this report?

      "text": "\nIn today’s Ask the Admin , I’ll show you how to secure your Skype account by merging it with a Microsoft Account.\nIt’s been some time since Microsoft started linking Skype names with Microsoft Accounts. But recently there have been reports of hackers using stolen credentials to access Skype using legacy named accounts, even where users have linked Skype to a Microsoft Account, which offer hardened security and two-factor authentication. For more information on two-factor authentication, see What Is Multi-Factor Authentication and How Does It Work? on the Petri IT Knowledgebase .\n \n \nThe process of linking your Skype name to a Microsoft Account enables you to log in to Skype using either your legacy Skype name and password, or a Microsoft Account. To make sure that your Skype account is properly protected, I recommend that you merge the Skype name with your Microsoft Account.\nIf you don’t have a Microsoft Account, log in to Skype and add an email address to your Skype account as part of the process that follows. You will be asked to verify the address.\nOpen https://account.microsoft.com in a browser window. If you are currently logged in with a Microsoft Account, log out. Log in using your Skype name and password. If your Skype name is already linked to a Microsoft Account, click Next on the Your Skype account is now a Microsoft account screen. Merge a legacy Skype name with a Microsoft Account (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nThe email address of the Microsoft Account associated with your Skype name will be automatically located, and you will need to enter your Microsoft Account password to merge the accounts and click Next . A Skype alias is created when you merge your Skype name with a Microsoft Account, allowing you to keep signing in with your Skype name if you wish. Assuming your Microsoft Account doesn’t have the same password as your legacy Skype account, if hackers had obtained your Skype password from an online list, they will no longer be able to use it to sign in.\nSponsored If you don’t intend to use the Skype name anymore, you can disable the Skype alias as follows:\nOpen https://account.live.com/SignInPreferences?amru=names%2FManage in a browser window. Click Security & privacy . Uncheck your Skype alias. Click Save to complete the process. Disable a Skype alias (Image Credit: Russell Smith)\nNow you will only use your Microsoft Account email and password to sign in to Skype.\nThe post Merge Your Skype Name with a Microsoft Account appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Over the past 24 hours, top executives at Apple, eBay, Box, and Microsoft have sent company-wide memos urging employees to try to move forward and expressing the belief that people are inherently good. Others, like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, have posted public statements about having to find new ways to work together. It’s the kind of messaging that a company leader would send after a natural disaster, an attack on the nation, or a looming crisis within the company.\n\nOnly this time, the looming crisis is the president-elect.\n\nThe fact that CEOs are compelled to communicate with employees following this year’s election shows how rattled Silicon Valley is. It’s been an \"emotionally-charged election,\" as eBay’s Devin Wenig wrote, an \"...",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nWith Microsoft not releasing a successor to its Surface Pro 4 hybrid tablet during its Windows 10 event last month, Finnish company Eve Technology is taking the opportunity to release its Surface-like Eve V tablet that will launch through an Indiegogo campaign later this month . \nAnd while the company shared an incomplete specs list earlier this month , a new blog post has revealed today the final details about the hybrid’s battery, keyboard, speakers and cameras (via Windows Central ). \nEve Technology actually published a full specs comparison with Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 that you can see below. Compared to the now one-year-old device Surface Pro 4, the Eve V will feature an Intel 7th Get Kaby Lake processor, up to 16GB of Ram, up to 512GV of storage and a 48Wh battery providing up to 12 hours of battery life. Additionally, the 2-in-1 device will feature more connectivity options with 2 full-size USB ports and two USB-C ports, a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello as well as four speakers and 2 noise canceling microphones. The Eve V clearly beats the Surface Pro 4 on paper. \nIn the lengthy blog post, the company also highlighted other interesting features such has a dedicated amplifier for the Eve V’s headphone jack. “This will drive the connected audio device with up to 5x greater performance vs. e.g. Surface Pro 4’s headphone jack,” explained the team. \nMoreover, the company is really proud of the V Wireless Keyboard which will be included with the hybrid tablet. While the detachable keyboard looks pretty similar to the Surface Pro 4 Type keyboard, it can automatically connect wirelessly to the Eve V just a few seconds after being detached. When it’s connected through the pogo pins, the the wireless connection (Bluetooth 4.2) automatically disconnects and the tablet starts recharging the keyboard’s integrated battery. The V Wireless keyboard has backlit keys and the trackpad is “Windows precision touch pad certified.” \nIt’s still not clear how much will cost the Eve V, though the company previously said that that only 500 devices would be available for purchase during the November Indiegogo campaign. Let us know in the comments if you think this hybrid device could be a good successor to Microsoft’s aging Surface Pro 4. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Microsoft's Surface Book is the MacBook Pro we didn't get USA TODAY 32 mins ago Brendan G Nystedt © Reviewed.com The new Surface Book's Performance Base fixes all the flaws of the original.\nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales.\nLast year, Microsoft surprised everyone with its ultimate laptop/tablet combo, dubbed Surface Book . I really enjoyed using it, but lamented its high price tag and it was held back by buggy hardware. It was a beautiful, expensive laptop...one whose screen tears off to become a clipboard-style tablet.\nJust in time for the holidays (and for new MacBook Pros to finally arrive), Microsoft's reinvested in its laptop line by adding the new Surface Book with Performance Base (MSRP $2,399, $3,299 as tested). This Surface Book gets an extra kick in the pants from a faster Nvidia graphics chip in a redesigned keyboard base. The tablet portion hasn't been redesigned, but you'll not only get improved graphics but also longer battery life.\nIf you were iffy about the original Surface Book, then those concerns generally apply here. But, if you thought the first Book wasn't quite powerful enough, the Performance Base version helps shore up those weaknesses, and makes the product even more lustworthy.\nMicrosoft Surface Book with Performance Base - Buy now for $2,799.99\nAbout the Surface Book with Performance Base This new version of Surface Book keeps the beating Intel heart of the current Book, and mates it to a keyboard that has a more powerful Nvidia graphics processor and more battery inside. There are three versions of this laptop, and the one we were able to try is the top-of-the-line model that sells for the eye-watering price of $3,299:\nIntel Core i7-6600U dual-core processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB PCIe solid state drive 13.3-inch 3000 x 2000 IPS touchscreen Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics with 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM (in keyboard dock) WiFi AC/ Bluetooth 4.1 What We Like The kinks are ironed out.\nThe last time I used a Surface Book, the end result was a mixed bag. The model I sampled was prone to glitches—not what you want from a super expensive, premium-grade 2-in-1. And I wasn't the only one complaining, either.\nThankfully, most of these issues have been resolved at this point, and a lot of them were due to Intel's 6th generation chips, which had problems in many competing systems, too. I found the Surface Book with Performance Base perfectly usable, with little issue whether in full laptop mode, or even with the screen torn off and used as a tablet.\nA spec bump in some key areas.\nSome might kvetch that the new, super-expensive Surface Book with Performance Base isn't that different. It still uses a 6th generation Intel Core i7 chip in the display, meaning the detachable tablet portion is unchanged from its introduction late last year. Is that the end of the world? Well, no. Even though Intel's just debuted its latest 7th gen processors, I've found that they don't add a whole lot into the mix. These dual-core i7 processors are solid at this point.\nWhere the Performance Base changes the narrative is in graphics performance and battery life. The original discrete GPU models of Surface Book have a custom Nvidia graphics chip that helped it get a leg-up on its competition but wasn't anything to write home about. The Performance Base swaps that for a spicier Nvidia GTX 965M with 2 GB GDDR5 memory onboard. It won't game or crunch data like a Razer Blade , but it'll give a much-appreciated boost when running through demanding tasks.\nBattery capacity is up around 30%, all stuffed inside the redesigned Performance Base keyboard. In our intensive PCMark 8 Home battery life test, we saw a decent increase of runtime. Up from around four and a half hours, we saw nearly five hours in the test with the Performance Base version. If you're a road warrior who demands a power and battery life that can work as long as you, this new version of Surface Book should be on your list.\nSleek, and still unorthodox as all getout\nBitter about the 2016 MacBook Pros? If you gravitated towards Apple's notebooks because they're beautiful and go against the grain, then meet the hipster laptop of your dreams. Surface Book with Performance Base delivers fast internals in an unforgettable, unique enclosure. If you're looking at paying Apple prices for a notebook, Surface Book might not make you shy like a startled mustang.\nBut the inclusion of a lovely pen ( recommended by our comic artist pal Braden Lamb ), the versatility of using the screen as a standalone device for watching a video or reading, is something that the MacBook Pro can't do. Sure, the Mac has a skinny Touch Bar above the keyboard, but it still doesn't have a full touchscreen like Surface Book. Additionally, the Surface Book lets you log in with your grinning face instead of using a fingerprint, a technology that, when it works, makes the Mac's TouchID sensor seem like it's old hat.\nEven though I'd recommend the HP Spectre X360 and even the cheaper Surface Pro 4 to people on a tighter budget, Microsoft's 2-in-1 solution with this new Performance Base is tailor-made for more demanding professional users.\nNo-compromises on ports and a high-quality keyboard\nPerhaps the most annoying \"updates\" to the 2016 MacBook Pros came in the form of transformed ports and a keyboard that's been reduced to barely moving. Surface Book with Performance Base has none of these drawbacks. It might not have the awesome potential of a Thunderbolt 3 port like competitors from Razer and Dell, but everything else makes it feel ready to get real work done now, today, in the present.\nSurface Book with Performance Base retains the handy SD card reader and twin USB 3.0 ports that professional users expect. The keyboard dock, redesigned to fit a hotter, faster graphics processor, has a new keyboard to match. Redesigned though it may be, it's another A+ Microsoft keyboard—super comfortable and responsive to type on for long sprints.\nWhat We Don't Like Battery life in tablet mode isn't great\nWhile I truly admire the ability to undock the display from the Surface Book, the un-updated bits of Surface Book still smart just a tiny bit. The so-called \"clipboard\" is a cool party trick, but its short 2-hour battery life means you won't be binge watching Netflix on its gorgeous 13.3-inch display. Instead, you'll be limited to short bursts of content, quick batch edits in Lightroom, or a few chapters in a Kindle book.\nI've used the Surface Book clipboard to edit stories with the Surface Pen, and for that usage, Surface Book with Performance Base is as extraordinary to use as before. Journalists who like to red-pen material just like in the good ol' paper days would do well to look into a Surface for editing and notetaking.\nNo Thunderbolt 3 in a year when everyone's added it.\nSo, Apple took away the MacBook Pro's normal USB ports and replaced them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac fans are already bellyaching about needing adapters in order to use their current accouterments.\nThat gives the Surface Book immediate compatibility with today's devices, but there's a catch. I'd imagine, without an extensive redesign, Microsoft was unable to sneak in a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. One of these future-proofed ports would have gone a long way to bridge the gap between today's needs and tomorrow's devices, but I'd imagine that we'll have to wait for the inevitable Surface Book sequel to roll around.\nAs it stands, competing devices from HP , Dell , and Razer all give you the power of Thunderbolt and the flexibility of USB-C, giving them a slight port advantage over the updated Surface Book with Performance Base.\nShould You Buy It? It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. Thanks to its boost in battery and graphics potential, Microsoft has given Surface Book a great shot in the arm. It's the highest-performing 2-in-1 we've tested thus far, and it underscores that Surface wants to win over pro and creative users. It's far from the reinvention that some people were hoping for, and if you were annoyed with the old one, this one has the exact same foibles.\nThe concept didn't need a whole lot more to push it over the edge, and the extra oomph of the Performance Base make it that much more interesting. Of course, you're still looking at a really expensive device. Given that this will trounce a similarly-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro in intensive graphical tasks, the extra price doesn't seem like a big ask.\nThrow in the detachable tablet and the useful Surface Pen, and the unique value proposition makes Surface Book more interesting than what Apple has to offer on its Pro offerings. Of course, quad-core models like the Razer Blade and Dell XPS 15 give you more computing power for your money. Where Surface Book shines is as a device that has few legitimate rivals. Its blend of performance, design, and flexibility are hard to find elsewhere. Even though it costs a pretty penny, Microsoft still has a special laptop in this supercharged Surface Book.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "\nFour months ago, Microsoft announced a new Microsoft Authenticator experience for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 Mobile. The company already released the new Android and iOS apps a while ago, but the Windows 10 Mobile app has been in beta for the past 5 months, and it is finally coming out of beta. If you are a Windows 10 Mobile user, you can try out the new Authenticator app which includes a new user interface, and much more — here’s a full feature list:\nUser experience refresh. We’ve made the app experience incredibly simple while maintaining the highest level of security. Best in breed MFA experience through one-click push notifications. You only need to click the “approve” button in the notification to complete your login. (And in most cases, you won’t even need to open the app to complete the approval.) Support for wearables. You can use an Apple Watch or Samsung Gear device to approve MFA challenges. Certificate based authentication. Support for enterprise customers to sign in through certificates instead of passwords. Interestingly enough, Microsoft is releasing the new Authenticator experience as an update for the old Azure Authenticator app rather than updating the main Authenticator app. Keep in mind that Microsoft did do the same thing for the Android and iOS apps as well.\nNevertheless, if you are interested in trying out the new Authenticator experience, you can download it from the Windows Store below:\nWP-Appbox: Microsoft Authenticator (Free, Windows Store) → \n",

      "text": "Microsoft is rolling into the 2016 holidays with a lot of momentum for its gaming brand.\nXbox One was the top-selling console in the United States in October, according to data-tracking firm The NPD Group and shared by Microsoft. The company also confirmed the system outsold the competition in the United Kingdom and Australia through October. This marks the fourth month in a row that Xbox One has outperformed PlayStation 4.\nMicrosoft provided the following statement from Xbox marketing boss Mike Nichols:\n“Thanks to the passion of Xbox fans worldwide and their continued excitement for Xbox One S, Xbox One was once again the best-selling console in October in the U.S., U.K. and Australia according to NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. Xbox One has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for the past four months, and in the U.K. and Australia in each of the last two months. With over 100 award-winning exclusive games, the fastest and most reliable gaming network with Xbox Live, built-in UHD 4K Blu-ray and 4K video streaming support and HDR for gaming and video, Xbox One S is the ultimate games and 4K entertainment system. New game launches like ‘Gears of War 4’ and ‘Battlefield 1,’ and continued engagement with an exceptionally strong catalog of games on Xbox One, helped increase the number of Xbox Live multiplayer gamers by 52 percent compared to last year. ‘Gears of War 4’ was also the No. 1 platform-exclusive title for October in the U.S. and U.K. according to NPD Group and GfK Entertainment, while ‘Forza Horizon 3’ became the year’s best-selling and highest-rated racing game, further strengthening Forza as the most successful racing franchise on any platform this generation. We are grateful to our community for their continued support and look forward to a great holiday season.”\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nNovember 10, 2016 12:55pm \nWhile Microsoft’s Xbox One operating system continues to have some issues, the company has drastically improved it over the past year in terms of stability and performance. \nNow, with a user interface in place that actually makes sense, it looks like Microsoft next goal is to add new features to the Xbox One. \nThrough the release of the Holiday Update, rolling out in Canada now, Microsoft is making it easier to find friends, games and talk to other players. \nA new Looking For Group (LFG) feature that allows players to quickly find a team of people to play with, as well as a Clubs feature, are coming to the console. LFG allows players to complete quests, achievements and other activities with a group. \nMicrosoft is also rolling out Clubs in this new holiday update, allowing players to create clans with a specific name, similar to a gamertag. This system makes creating a party, sharing clips and jumping into party chat easier with a group of friends. \nClubs is also making its way to Xbox apps for Windows 10 along with the ability to send group messages on Xbox Live, a feature that was part of the Xbox 360 era of Xbox Live but that was strangely not included with the Xbox One at launch. \nAnd finally, a different noise will now sound when a player scores a rare achievement.

      "text": "Venus Montalbo \nA new firmware update for the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 has been released recently. It specifically aims to fix the high-end Windows tablet’s battery draining issues. But it seems like after installing the latest update, some Surface Pro 3 owners are still experiencing battery problems. \nA number of owners of the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 – marketed as “the tablet that can replace your laptop”– have been complaining about how quick the tablet runs out of battery power. For instance, instead of getting about 9 hours when mainly using the Surface Pro 3 for web browsing, some of the units were barely getting one to two hours before they need to charge it again. <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/alpaxt7gGZU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nA firmware update was released back in August to fix the alarmingly unusual rate of battery drain for the device. But weeks later, there were again reports of the same battery glitch but from a different batch of Surface Pro 3 units, according to Pocketnow. Although it took the company months to provide an answer, thankfully, the Redmond-based Windows maker steps up with a firmware update that should end the battery issue permanently. \nExplaining the cause of the Surface Pro 3’s battery conundrum, Microsoft shared the following via the official Battery FAQ ‘s page for the Windows tablet. \n“On a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices , an error condition occurs that causes the full charge capacity of the battery to be misreported to the operating system and device firmware. When this condition occurs, the system no longer charges the battery to its full actual capacity, and the Surface is unable to function on battery power.” \n“Think of this like a fuel gauge in a car, where the car looks to the fuel gauge to determine how much to fill the tank. In this case, if the fuel gauge isn’t working right, the car would also not be able to fill the tank—even though the tank is fine,” it added. [Image by Nigel Treblin/Getty Images] \nSo to resolve this, a firmware update with version number v38.11.50.0 was recently pushed out by Microsoft to correct “the logic in the firmware component that functions as the ‘fuel gauge’ for the Surface Pro 3 battery, so that the actual battery capacity on devices with this particular part is accurately reported.” \nHaving this update should enable the Surface Pro 3 tablet to again take advantage of the maximum charge capacity of the battery. “Once this fix is applied to a Surface Pro 3, the reported full charge capacity will self-correct over the next several charge and discharge cycles,” Microsoft explained. \nHowever, it seems like the battery issues of some Microsoft Surface Pro 3 users were still not resolved by the latest firmware update. Below are some rants online we were able to gather from Twitter and from a Surface Pro 3 discussion thread in Microsoft Community page. If you're still having problems with your Surface Pro 3 battery, you aren't alone. https://t.co/hJSB9Q25mJ \n— Woody Leonhard (@woodyleonhard) November 10, 2016 \n“The 11/7/16 update did not address my LGC battery issue: before the 8/29 update I was getting 5-7 hours of battery life and since then I’m getting 1.5 hours if I’m really lucky.”– Waritch \n“On my Surface Pro 3 i5 256GB with LGC LGC Battery. Battery life drops to nothing when I unplug charger and then device turns off since Several months ago. this problem is very uncomfortable.”– posted by MohammadJavaheri \n“Installed the update yesterday, and there is no improvement over my existing condition. My surface still shuts down instantly when unplugged. Has anyone actually had their issue resolved after installing this?”— posted by BelalK \nIf you are planning to get the Surface Pro 3 update, the firmware should arrive automatically through Windows Update. But if you want to do it manually, you can simply head to the tablet’s Settings menu, look for Update and Security option and then tap Windows Update. Choose the Check for Updates option for the system to start searching for an available firmware. It there’s an update available, it should install automatically on the Surface Pro 3. The Windows slate may prompt for a restart after the firmware gets successfully installed. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] \nHere are other instructions from Microsoft prior to the firmware update installation: \n“Before installing this update, ensure that your Surface Pro 3 is plugged directly in to AC power using the standard AC power adapter (do not use the Surface Docking Station), disconnect any USB devices or external monitors, and check that Windows shows a 40% charge or greater when you hover over the icon in the taskbar before you begin.” \nAside from releasing the firmware update, Microsoft has also started offering a refund for the out-of-warranty charges it made for Surface Pro 3 replacement units . So if you are one of the customers who was affected by this issue and paid for a replacement unit, which according to Neowin, was priced at $450, then you should receive a refund. More details about the refund on the Surface Pro 3’s Battery FAQ page linked in the earlier part of this article. \n[Featured Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images]",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIt's been over five months since Microsoft Authenticator Beta showed up in the Windows Store . The app combines the two-factor authentication process for Microsoft, Azure Active Directory (AD), and more. \nEssentially, it's a combination of the old Azure Authenticator and Authenticator apps that were available for the platform. Authenticator served the purpose of signing into personal Microsoft accounts, but it was a Windows Phone 8.1 app. \nIn August, the company launched Microsoft Authenticator for iOS and Android , promising that it would show up for Windows 10 Mobile later that week . After three months of broken promises, the full app is finally available in the Windows Store as an update to the Azure Authenticator app. \nIf you're using the old Authenticator app for Windows Phone 8.1, it's important to note that you'll need to download a new app. This shouldn't be surprising, as the iOS and Android apps also showed up as updates to the Azure Authenticator apps. \nTo download Microsoft Authenticator or update your Azure Authenticator app, click here .",
