      "text": "RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon's new Seller Fulfilled Prime program allows third-party merchants to make inventory eligible for Prime two-day shipping without using Fulfillment by Amazon, letting vetted sellers ship items on their own via another carrier (i.e. FedEx, USPS). \nThis program will greatly increase the number of Prime-eligible items for sale, as well as overall Prime sales, especially as Amazon reports that 50% of all sold units come from third-party merchants. \nSeller Fulfilled Prime benefits Amazon's overall business in a number of ways. Increases merchant activity: A majority of Prime customers sign up to take advantage of its free two-day shipping, and Seller Fulfilled Prime significantly widens the number of third-party merchants that can reach these millions of shoppers and boost their own sales on Amazon's marketplace. Frees up warehouse space: Bestowing Prime-eligibility on non-FBA members can help Amazon free up dedicated warehouse space for Prime items. This can provide a boon to warehouse efficiency and speed, getting a higher volume of orders out the door in even less time. Boosts inventory and efficiency for the holidays: As Amazon looks to cut back on low-demand items for the holidays, providing the option for Prime shipping outside of its own warehouses can help the company focus on its own shipping speeds, and decrease pressure on its warehouse workers during the high-volume shopping period. However, the company does face the risk that Seller Fulfilled Prime merchants may not live up to the two-day shipping promise, upsetting customers at a time when they most adamantly expect speedy deliveries. \nE-commerce has been on the rise in the last several years, thanks in large part to titans in the industry such as Amazon and Alibaba. E-commerce will truly become the future of retail, as nearly all of the growth in the retail sector now takes place in the digital space. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, forecasts that U.S. consumers will spend $385 billion online in 2016. Moreover, BI Intelligence predicts that number will grow to $632 billion in 2020. \nThis is hardly surprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. Though the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce. \nThe number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016. \nBut all of this shopping online creates its own set of challenges, both for consumers and the companies that are trying to get their products onto shoppers' screens and into their shopping carts. In short, you need a plan. \nAnd to create your ultimate e-commerce battle plan, you need the right intel. \nBI Intelligence is here to help. \nOur team of industry experts has you covered on topics such as: Shopping cart abandonment",

      "text": "If those cheap headphones seem too good to be true, they probably are. Brad Barket/Getty Images\nIf you have a Prime membership, it's pretty easy to default to buying everything you need on Amazon.\nNeed a book? A pair of headphones? A T-shirt? Is it time to restock on the shampoo you're down to the final ounce of? Most of those things are easy to find on Amazon.\nAnd for the most part, you can expect to find pretty good deals on many of the household essentials and day-to-day items that you find yourself searching for on Amazon.\nBut there are at least a few things that you shouldn't buy on Amazon , like clothing, pet food, and school supplies, because you're unlikely to actually find good deals on those items. Does the same logic hold true for tech purchases, too?\nIt turns out that there are a few gadgets and categories of electronics that you're better off shopping for somewhere other than Amazon. If you've read any of our shopping guides before, you've probably caught on to our tendency to recommend that you do copious amounts of research before committing to any expensive electronics purchase.\nThat's no less important if you're shopping on Amazon. In fact, it may be even more important to research what you're getting on Amazon, since there are plenty of tech products that probably aren't as good of a deal as Amazon would have you believe.\nIf you're looking to save money (and avoid buying gadgets that won't work as advertised), you should steer clear of a few tech products on everybody's favorite online shopping platform. Read on to check out the electronics and accessories that we'd recommend skipping on your next Amazon shopping spree.\nView As: One Page Slides 1. Apple chargers and cables Apple Ben Lovejoy reports for 9to5Mac that more than 90% of Apple chargers and cables labeled as \"genuine\" on Amazon are actually fake . It's not just products sold by third-party sellers that are fake — even those sold by Amazon directly are counterfeit items labeled as the real thing.\nThe manufacturers behind these fake chargers and cables are not only deceiving consumers, but are providing accessories that may not have passed necessary safety tests.\nApple offers a support page to help consumers tell the difference between authentic cables and counterfeit ones. But in the future, it's probably better to avoid shopping for Apple cables and chargers on Amazon.\n2. Batteries REUTERS/Anatolii Stepanov Batteries are a pretty important part of many gadgets, but you typically shouldn't buy them on Amazon. If you're buying standard-size batteries, like AA or AAA, they'll be cheaper at your local Costco or Sam's Club than on Amazon.\nThat's probably reason enough not to buy batteries on Amazon. But if you need another reason, How-To Geek reports that cheap third-party batteries for smartphones or laptops aren't worth the savings .\nPoorly manufactured batteries can catch fire or explode, which would not only damage the device in question, but could hurt you and your family or even damage your house or your car. Third-party batteries and counterfeit batteries purchased on Amazon are likely produced as cheaply as possible. So you should skip the aftermarket battery and choose an official model when it comes time to replace the battery in your phone or laptop.\n3. Counterfeit gadgets Fake iPhones are displayed at a mobile phone stall in Shanghai August 11, 2011. REUTERS/Aly Song Few people take to Amazon to purposefully buy a counterfeit product, but as How-To Geek reports, counterfeit products are all too prevalent on the platform. Even products that are \"fulfilled by Amazon\" come from third-party sellers, which means that Amazon hasn't vetted the product.\nCNBC's Ari Levy reports that Amazon's \" counterfeiting issue has exploded \" at a time when more than 40% of Amazon's unit sales come through its third-party marketplace.\n\"Much of the expansion has occurred since Amazon started opening the floodgates to Chinese manufacturers,\" Levy reports.\nCounterfeit chargers and batteries aren't the only things you need to worry about. Counterfeit phones and computers exist too, and How-To Geek recommends avoiding Amazon listings that are sold by third-party sellers. Check reviews for red flags and claims of counterfeit products, and keep an eye out for positive reviews that seem fake.\n4. Big-ticket items WOCinTech Chat/flickr MarketWatch reports that when it comes to expensive, big-ticket items, Amazon isn't always your best bet . That includes some things that we wouldn't typically consider tech products, like power tools and small kitchen appliances.\nThis is also a good reminder that if you're shopping for an expensive item like a computer or a TV, it pays to shop around and make sure that you're getting the best deal.\nAs Catey Hill reports for the publication, Savings.com data has shown that 58% of the time, you can get a better price on electronics at other places that aren't Amazon. That may be because electronics retailers offer deals on certain expensive items to attract customers and to give you a reason to buy from them instead of from Amazon.\n5. Extremely inexpensive devices Brad Barket/Getty Images It would stand to reason that while big-ticket items may not be the best thing to purchase on Amazon, an inexpensive gadget is probably fine. But even (or especially) if you have a strict budget, it's still a good idea to be careful about what you're buying on Amazon.\nLooking for a cheap gadget without doing your research is a sure way to be disappointed. Whether you're looking at smartphones under $50, MP3 players under $20, or earbuds under $5, you may find a great deal.\nBut if you don't read up on reviews and buying guides, you're more likely to find a device that doesn't function as well as its product description indicates. Do yourself a favor and do some research before you snap up a super-cheap gadget on Amazon.\n6. Photography equipment kishjar?/flickr Sure, Amazon occasionally offers a great deal on a good lens or camera body. But if you're really looking for the best deals on photography equipment, Amazon isn't the platform to shop.\nMarketWatch reports that that's because specialty photography retailers offer deals and promotions to stay competitive. You may not need to rule Amazon out completely in this category, since Amazon changes its prices much more frequently than the typical photography retailer.\nBut on the other side of the coin, make sure that you look beyond Amazon when you're comparing prices for the next piece of gear you need for your photography kit.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nRead the original article on The Cheat Sheet .

      "text": "Netflix has had the global streaming-video market more or less to itself for some time now, apart from a few tentative steps made by smaller players such as HBO. But now it is getting a major competitor, and one with even deeper pockets. Amazon is said to be close to rolling out its Prime Video service worldwide.\nThe Wall Street Journal said that the e-commerce giant is expected to expand its video offering into about 200 countries. It is currently only available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan.\nThe impending roll-out was also leaked on Twitter twtr by Jeremy Clarkson, star of Amazon’s new show The Grand Tour and former host of the popular Top Gear car series on BBC. Clarkson and his co-hosts left the British network last year after Clarkson’s contract was not renewed, following a physical altercation with a BBC producer.\nClarkson said in a series of tweets that fans would be able to see his new show in 200 countries starting in December.\nSo. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \n\nNetflix NFLX expanded its global reach in January, launching simultaneously in 130 countries for a total of more than 190 nations and territories. China is one of the only major markets where the service is unavailable. The online rental giant recently announced that it would license its content to Chinese services because the regulatory environment in that country is too hostile to outsiders.\nIn the months following its international launch, Netflix’s subscriber growth was weaker than many analysts expected, and many argued that this was partly because broadband Internet access is not as widespread in many developing countries. But in the most recent quarter, the company added 60% more international customers than it had been projecting.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nAmazon AMZN has been bulking up its Prime Video service for some time, bidding aggressively at places like the Sundance Film Festival and in Hollywood for new movie rights, TV shows, and other content. And with a market value of $380 billion and $18 billion in cash on hand, the company clearly has the financial resources to keep that up almost indefinitely.\nNetflix’s spending habits, on the other hand, have been the subject of some concern among investors and analysts. As the company has moved away from licensing the rights to existing shows and begun creating more of its own content, its costs have skyrocketed.\nNext year, Netflix is expected to spend upwards of $6 billion producing more than 1,200 hours of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and children’s television programs. It has been able to finance all of that using its shares, but if the stock drops, doing this could become problematic. Last year, its cash flow was negative $500 million.\nAmazon gets a head start on Black Friday. Watch: \nAmazon has shown that it is more than happy to lose money for years in pursuit of a market that it believes is worth the investment. And it has a massive source of cash in its Amazon Web Services data-hosting platform, which generates roughly $10 billion in revenue every year.\nAs the e-commerce giant steps up the competition, Netflix could feel increasing pressure to find an acquirer with deep pockets to help it grow. Both Apple AAPL and Disney DIS have been reported as potential buyers , although at $50 billion, it would be a large mouthful for either one.",

      "text": "Search for: Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online A woman walks past a logo of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in Turin March 31, 2014. REUTERS/Giorgio Perottino \nNovember 18, 2016 \nMILAN (Reuters) – Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) <FCHA.MI> said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon <AMZN.O> to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models – the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy’s biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world’s seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \n(This version of the story corrects paragraphs 1 and 5 after company says special online offers would improve existing promotions by up to 33 percent, not that the full price would be cut by a third) \n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \n\nIf you’re a regular reader of Insider Picks, you already know we're big fans of Amazon Prime . We use it for everything .\nFor a yearly fee, members get access to exclusive deals and free two-day shipping on their Amazon purchases.\nNormally, this annual fee costs $99 a year, but on Friday, November 18 only, you can save $20 on your yearly membership and sign up to be a Prime member for just $79 .\nWhile the deal is happening as a promotion for Prime Video’s new show “The Grand Tour” starring “Top Gear” presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, there's really no better time to sign up for Prime than right now, as the holidays fast approaching.\nChances are, if you've made a few purchases through Amazon before, you know the basic perks of becoming an Amazon Prime member :\nFor a yearly fee, you get free shipping, and early access to lightning deals and other Amazon discounts. If you’re a regular Amazon shopper, that annual fee is a solid investment that will not only give you access to the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but also make your future shopping experiences a bit more pleasant.\n \nBelow we’ve detailed some of the lesser-known perks to being a Prime member. If you sign up today, not only will you save money right off the bat, you will get access to all of Amazon's Black Friday and Cyber Monday lightning deals. \nYou can check out the details of this one-day-only offer here .\nFree same-day shipping Amazon \nAs mentioned above, one of the most well known perks of being a Prime member is that you get free two-day shipping on all purchases. What you may not know is that in some cities, you'll have access to free same-day delivery .\nSame-day delivery is currently available in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Fresno, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Nashville, New York City, North & Central New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle/Tacoma, Stockton, Tampa Bay Area, Tucson, and Washington, D.C., with more cities to be added to the list soon.\nAnd if you're not lucky enough to live in one of those cities, two-day delivery is still pretty good.\n \n\n\nPrime Now Amazon \nIf same-day delivery isn't fast enough for you, and you live in one of the metro areas listed below, Prime members also have access to the Prime Now app , which provides free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items, and the option of one-hour delivery if you want to pay a flat fee of $7.99.\nWhether you're in need of gifts, groceries, or meal delivery, Prime Now can get your goods to your door faster than ever before.\nPrime Now is currently available in  Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles & Orange County, Miami, Minneapolis & St. Paul, Nashville, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle & Eastside, and Virginia Beach. \n\n\nPrime Video Amazon \nPrime Video is one of the fastest growing aspects of Amazon Prime. The streaming service is making a play to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, and is doing a good job at it judging by the past two years of awards seasons. With Emmy-winning original series \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" on its roster, in addition to a large library of shows and movies, Prime Video  is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone who has cut their cable cord.\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "print \nBI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon's new Seller Fulfilled Prime program allows third-party merchants to make inventory eligible for Prime two-day shipping without using Fulfillment by Amazon, letting vetted sellers ship items on their own via another carrier (i.e. FedEx, USPS). \nThis program will greatly increase the number of Prime-eligible items for sale, as well as overall Prime sales, especially as Amazon reports that 50% of all sold units come from third-party merchants. \nSeller Fulfilled Prime benefits Amazon's overall business in a number of ways. Increases merchant activity: A majority of Prime customers sign up to take advantage of its free two-day shipping, and Seller Fulfilled Prime significantly widens the number of third-party merchants that can reach these millions of shoppers and boost their own sales on Amazon's marketplace. Frees up warehouse space: Bestowing Prime-eligibility on non-FBA members can help Amazon free up dedicated warehouse space for Prime items. This can provide a boon to warehouse efficiency and speed, getting a higher volume of orders out the door in even less time. Boosts inventory and efficiency for the holidays: As Amazon looks to cut back on low-demand items for the holidays, providing the option for Prime shipping outside of its own warehouses can help the company focus on its own shipping speeds, and decrease pressure on its warehouse workers during the high-volume shopping period. However, the company does face the risk that Seller Fulfilled Prime merchants may not live up to the two-day shipping promise, upsetting customers at a time when they most adamantly expect speedy deliveries. \nE-commerce has been on the rise in the last several years, thanks in large part to titans in the industry such as Amazon and Alibaba. E-commerce will truly become the future of retail, as nearly all of the growth in the retail sector now takes place in the digital space. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, forecasts that U.S. consumers will spend $385 billion online in 2016. Moreover, BI Intelligence predicts that number will grow to $632 billion in 2020. \nThis is hardly surprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. Though the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce. \nThe number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016. \nBut all of this shopping online creates its own set of challenges, both for consumers and the companies that are trying to get their products onto shoppers' screens and into their shopping carts. In short, you need a plan. \nAnd to create your ultimate e-commerce battle plan, you need the right intel. \nBI Intelligence is here to help. \nOur team of industry experts has you covered on topics such as: Shopping cart abandonment",

A new Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sign is pictured after being unveiled at Chrysler Group World Headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan \nMILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI: FCHA ) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon (O: AMZN ) to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \n(This version of the story corrects paragraphs 1 and 5 after company says special online offers would improve existing promotions by up to 33 percent, not that the full price would be cut by a third) Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online ",

      "text": "Amazon’s drive up grocery store in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood is coming together. (GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) Construction crews appear to be close to finishing up Amazon’s mysterious drive-up grocery store in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood, and the project just hit a major permitting milestone.\nA recent report suggested the online retail giant’s pick up grocery locations in Seattle could open by the end of the year, and the Ballard store looks like it’s on track based on a recent visit to the site. The project just this week received a temporary certificate of occupancy from the city, which means major construction aspects of the project are done, and Amazon can begin to occupy the building even though there is still some work left to do.\nA second drive-up grocery location , just south of downtown Seattle, is in progress as well.\nA series of what look like cords coming out of the paneling indicate crews may be getting ready to put up a sign, which would be the Amazon’s first public acknowledgment of the store. It has not commented on the project since GeekWire first discovered it in August. \nCrews were installing green panels throughout the structure this week. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Amazon reportedly has a much grander vision for its grocery business than these two Seattle stores. Business Insider recently viewed the company’s plan to start with a 20-location pilot for Amazon Fresh-branded grocery stores in areas including Seattle, Las Vegas, New York, Miami and the Bay Area. Half the pilot stores will be drive-up locations for picking up online orders, while the other half will be traditional stores where shoppers can browse for items.\nIf that pilot is successful Amazon sees room in the U.S. for up to 2,000 of its AmazonFresh-branded grocery stores over the next decade. By comparison, Walmart has more than 5,000 stores in the United States.\nAmazon isn’t the only company building out a click-and-collect grocery model. Just blocks away from Amazon’s Ballard location, Fred Meyer is getting ready to open its own pick up location , possibly in mid-December. Frequent Amazon competitor Walmart also boasts a pick up grocery feature .",

      "text": "Top Gear to Grand Tour: How the trio ended up at Amazon By Ali Tufail - 18 November 2016 16:45pm Grand Tour trio \nAmazon recently released the trailer for The Grand Tour in preparation for it's debut. As fans around the world patiently wait for the former Top Gear trio to return to their screens, The Drum looks at the events that led to the slow death of Top Gear and gave birth to The Grand Tour. The punch \nThe beginning of it all, Jeremey Clarkson was involved in a ‘Fracas’ with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon . He was accused of verbally and physically abusing the producer, which resulted in the BBC suspending him and cancelling Top Gear till further notice. Rumour Mills \nNot long after the BBC cancelled Top Gear and suspended Jeremy Clarkson, Betfair listed Chris Evans as the most likely person to replace him on the hit motoring show. At the time, Chris Evans categorically denied wanting or being offered the position. #BringBackClarkson \nFans of the troubled presenter weren’t happy with his suspension and took matters in to their own hands. Political blogger Guido Fawkes began a petition to bring him back to the show. The petition crossed over a million signatures, but even that wasn’t enough to convince the BBC. Snickers takes advantage \nAmid the media frenzy, Snickers pulled off a successfull pr stunt at Jeremy clarksons expense. Snickers sent Jeremy Clarkson a box of 48 snickers , with their famous tagline “you’re not you when you’re hungry”, in reference to his bust up with the Top Gear Producer. Retirement hints \nIn his first column since the fracas, Jeremy Clarkson hinted in his column in The Sun that he may be retiring from Top gear. Stating that “We lose one animal and get another. The world turns” Jeremy Saville \nAs Jeremey Clarkson failed to lose fans and fellow celebrities support, an unamed BBC executive was quoted in the Mail on sunday . Comparing him to Jimmy Saville the BBC executive went on to say \"The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way”, former Prime Minister David Cameron was among those to lend his support to Jeremy Clarkson. Lawyer up \nFollowing the damaging quotes from an unnamed BBC executive in the mail on sunday. Jeremy Clarkson instructed his lawyers to pursue a defamation case against the BBC F**k the BBC \nAt a charity fundraiser organised by fellow celebrity Christopher Biggins, Jeremy Clarkson went on an expletive filled rant against his former employer. \nThe troubled presenter was quoted by the Guardian amongst his rant saying “The BBC have fucked themselves, it was a great show and they fucked it up\" Petition Delivery \nOnce the #BringBackClarkson petition crossed a million signatures, it was delivered to the BBC . Fans of the troubled presenter rode on a tank to the BBC headquarters complete with a stig impersonator at the helm. P45 \nThe telegraph reported that an internal BBC investigation in to the Fracas had found Jeremy Clarkson at fault. Unable to excuse his behavior the decision to sack him was taken. The Trio \nAfter the BBC sacked Jeremy Clarkson many speculated that Top Gear would continue with the remaining two presenters. James May put that to rest when he claimed the trio come as a package . Brand Bandwagon \nTrying to make the most of the attention surrounding Top Gear and Jeremy Clarksons dismisall from the BBC, many brands chimed in. \nPaddy Power, Papa Johns, Toyota, PG Tips, Virgin Media, and many more took to social media to capture peoples attention . War of Words \nChris Evans publicly spoke of working on a secret Top Gear film. Jeremy Clarkson and James May quickly took to twitter to ridicule the former radio 2 dj. Netflix steps in \nDaily mail cited sources saying a deal between the trio and Netflix would be closed soon , with an announcement expected within weeks. \nThough the deal never happened, it showed the value streaming companies were placing on the former Top gear presenters. The Finale \nFans finally got to see the final episode recorded by the trio as presenters of Top gear. The finale pulled in over 5 million viewers to the BBC. Amazon Wot Won it \nFollowing months of speculation, Amazon emerged victorious. The internet giant announced that the former Top Gear trio would produce a new motoring show exclusively for Amazon prime. The show would debut in 2016 with a yet to be announced title. Fire stick cheeky ad \nIn his first official appearance for Amazon, Jeremy Clarkson appeared in a commercial to promote the Amazon fire stick . The ad also featured a cheeky reference to his former employer the BBC. Where there's a blame there's a claim \nTop gear producer Oisin Tymon successfully sued Jeremy Clarkson for assaulting him. This resulted in Clarkson paying him £100,000 in damages . Netflix VS Amazon \nAfter Amazon beat it to an exclusive show with the former Top Gear trio, Netflix gained the global rights to BCC’s top gear with new presenters Chris Evans and Matt Le Blanc. We have a name.. \nAfter months of waiting, fans were finally told the name of the new Amazon prime motoring show.

      "text": "Sean Gallup | Getty Images A worker prepares packages for delivery at a Amazon warehouse. If you want an idea of how seriously Amazon is pursuing the idea of shopping by voice, look no further than the way the executive who runs the initiative describes it on his LinkedIn page: \"Amazon 2.0.\" But customers are going to need an incentive to try out this new ordering method. \nSo starting Friday, Amazon is offering a host of deals exclusive to customers who place an order through the Alexa voice service that powers the Amazon Echo and other Amazon voice-enabled devices. \nMore from Recode: \nDraftKings and FanDuel are (officially) merging \nHere's the secret to Starry Internet's plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly \nFull transcript: Recode's April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask \nAmazon first launched voice shopping with a simple use case: Reordering an item you've previously bought. Since then, the company has expanded voice shopping to tens of millions of Prime-eligible items. Amazon envisions a future where its customers can easily place orders on the go via voice, even while driving. Such an evolution of e-commerce could grow into yet another competitive advantage for Amazon. \nCustomers who want to order an item by voice say, \"Alexa, order a [product name].\" Amazon then selects a \"well-priced product\" that is eligible for Prime shipping. The company doesn't disclose all the factors used to choose the specific item, which is made available through a program called \"Amazon's Choice.\" \nThe promotion will run through the end of the day Monday, Nov. 21, and feature deals such as a 32-inch Samsung TV for $119 and an Amazon Tap, a sort of portable Echo, for $50 off. \n— By Jason Del Rey , Re/code.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "5 mins ago \nAmazon Prime Video is about to leapfrog Netflix. \nThe online behemoth is gearing up for a massive global expansion (paywall) that will stretch its streaming-video service from five countries to more than 200. In doing so, its global footprint would overtake that of streaming-video giant Netflix, which expanded very suddenly itself earlier this year to 190 countries . \nNews of Prime Video’s international rollout leaked earlier this week, when Jeremy Clarkson, host of Amazon’s new show The Grand Tour, tweeted: It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere. \n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nAmazon later confirmed that the show would be available in more than 200 countries beginning in December, and launched a mailing list to let fans know when the program premieres in each country. We will be available in 200+ countries in December. Sign-up at https://t.co/hhVK9rx0cv for the latest updates. https://t.co/j7NNlRJwVI \n— The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016 \nAmazon has provided few other details about the expansion, such as what programs besides The Grand Tour will be available and whether subscribers in other countries will also have access to other Prime perks. \nPreviously, Amazon’s streaming-video service was tied to its $99-a-year Prime membership, which offers free and expedited shipping, as well as perks like music streaming. It’s currently only available in six countries—the US, UK, Germany, Austria, Japan, and, most recently, India , which does not yet have Amazon’s video service. Amazon has not revealed how many Prime members it has, but estimates place its subscriber base in the ballpark of 60 million . Netflix had 83 million paid streaming subscribers around the world as of the third quarter of 2016. \nBut, in April, Amazon spun Prime Video into a standalone service, allowing subscribers to access unlimited video streaming for $8.99 a month —$2 less than the cost of a full Prime membership. The move laid the groundwork for Amazon to grow Prime Video in regions where it’s not yet ready to roll out Prime delivery fully. \nIt quietly turned on Prime Video in Australia, for example, ahead of the launch of The Grand Tour , according to local news reports . The service appears to be slightly more expensive there at $10.99 a month. It’s unclear whether that comes with the benefits of a full Prime membership. Read full story ",

( David McNew | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nBlack Friday is dawning upon us and several retailers have announced deals for the holiday season. Amazon has announced some pre-Black Friday deals for this year but customers have to say magic phrases to get these deals. \nOn Friday, Amazon announced that Amazon Prime customers will be able to enjoy the pre-Black Friday 2016 deals from Nov. 18 through Nov. 21. The retailer also announced this is the first-ever voice shopping weekend. \nCustomers can take advantage of these deals only if they own a device with Alexa, Amazon's intelligent personal assistant.

Photo by Laurie Skrivan, lskrivan@post-dispatch.com \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference.",

      "text": "(Corrects paragraphs 1 and 5 after company says special online offers would improve existing promotions by up to 33 percent, not that the full price would be cut by a third)\nMILAN: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount.\nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L.\nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to.\n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference.\nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers.\nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer.\nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalise their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n- Reuters\nEmail More",

      "title": "Activists release rare photos of lost Amazon tribe that’s being threatened by gold miners",
      "text": "By Manuel Rueda \nAnthropologists in Brazil have released a set of rare photos of an uncontacted Amazon tribe in an effort to save the group from the encroachment of illegal gold miners. \nThe aerial photos show a clearing in the jungle where the Yanonami-Moxihatetema indigenous group has built a communal house. The group lives deep in the Amazon and has avoided contact with the outside world for generations. \nActivists said they released the photos, which were shot from a plane in September, in an effort to alert the world about the existence of the group and the risk they’re facing. Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara The Moxihatetema gaze at a plane flying over them \n“The place where the uncontacted Indians live, fish, hunt and plant must be protected,” says Davi Kopenawa, an activist and shaman who is part of another Yanomami group. “The whole world must know that they are there in the forest and that the authorities must respect their right to live there.” \nThe Moxihatetema, along with several other Yanonami groups, live in a large reservation that straddles the border between Brazil and Venezuela. But since its creation in 1992, the Yanomami reserve has suffered from incursions by Venezuelan and Brazilian settlers involved in illegal gold mining. Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara \nNow the miners are getting dangerously close to the Moxihatetema. According to Fiona Watson, a Yanomami researcher at Survival International, there is a mining camp in another jungle clearing just 35 kilometers away from the uncontacted indigenous village. \nIf the Moxihatetema come into contact with the miners they could die off from illnesses that they have no immunity to, such as the flu or malaria. There is also a risk of violent clashes with the heavily armed and roughneck miners. \n“The miners are ranging out from their camp to dredge in the river beds, and the Yanomami have a large hunting range, so it is possible there could one day be a dangerous encounter,” Watson said in an email. Guilherme Gnipper Trevisan/Hutukara The tribe has an estimated 100 members \nTo stop this from happening, activists are calling on the Brazilian government to increase efforts to remove illegal mining camps from the Yanomami reserve. \nThey have some allies within the government. FUNAI, an indigenous rights agency, has a long history of fighting for the protection of vulnerable tribes. FUNAI was the group that photographed the tribe during a patrol flight to look for illegal gold mines in the Yanomami reserve. \nBut there are concerns that Brazil’s new conservative government is not keen on protecting indigenous rights. The government has been pushing for the construction of dams in the Amazon basin and recently cut FUNAI’s budget by 37%, as part of a broader set of austerity measures designed to help Brazil claw back from a long economic slump. Brazil’s President Michel Temer notoriously picked a Cabinet that does not include any women or members of Brazil’s ethnic minority groups. \nSurvival International says FUNAI needs more field agents to arrest miners who illegally intrude into territory reserved for the Yanomami and other indigenous groups. The British NGO is also calling on Brazilian courts to investigate the links between illegal mining operations and local businessmen and politicians. \n“The justice system needs to be more robust,” says Fiona Watson. “The people funding the mining operations need to be unmasked, fined and put on trial because what they are doing is illegal and has terrible consequences.” \nSurvival International says that there are about 100 uncontacted tribes still living in the Amazon. The rainforest sprawls across Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela and Ecuador. \n“All of the (uncontacted groups) are under threat one way or another,” Watson said. “Their lands are being invaded by loggers, miners, settlers or targeted by large infrastructure projects.” Story Tags",

You’ve got Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond … but you don’t have The Stig… or do you?\nIn this new video for the series, the trio of hosts go searching for a new Stig and come up with Ben Collins . Collins is a racing driver who had been with Top Gear and was “outed” by the Daily Telegraph in 2009 as being the Stig. It was never confirmed by Collins or anyone involved in the show, with May flat out denying that the Stig had been revealed.\nThe Grand Tour will debut on Amazon Prime Nov 18th.\nPrevious: The Death That Shook Up The Marvel / Netflix Universe Next: Nemesis43’s Pirate Comic Site Of Choice Sends Out A Press Release",

      "text": "Los Angeles: Amazon.com Inc is preparing to take its video streaming service worldwide in a challenge to Netflix Inc, the world’s largest paid online TV network.\nAmazon, which currently offers the service in only a handful of countries, announced the plans Thursday in a blog post about “The Grand Tour,” a lavish new reality show featuring the former stars of BBC’s popular “Top Gear.”\n“In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon,” the company wrote on its website. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also mentioned the plans on Twitter.\nAmazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, has spent billions of dollars licensing programming and producing original shows and movies as part of its Prime service. Customers who pay $99 a year for free shipping and other benefits get access to a library of new and older content at no added cost.\nThe expansion of the Seattle-based company’s video service is one of the biggest challenges yet to Netflix, which operates in more than 190 countries after completing its international roll-out in January. It is available everywhere except Syria, North Korea, China and Crimea, the company said at the time. \nSally Fouts, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon’s plans earlier Thursday.\nVideo Strategy\nThe online retailer has funded its video service to increase sales of other products such as shoes, laundry detergent and books. People who watch videos on Amazon are likely to stick around and shop for other products as well.\nTo offer video service around the world, Amazon has to obtain global rights and satisfy local regulators. The company began seeking worldwide rights to shows this year, a sign of its plans to expand, according to people familiar with the matter who weren’t authorised to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.\nIt makes sense for Amazon to push its original programming in other markets, but securing the rights to distribute its entire catalogue of movies and shows worldwide would be expensive, said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc\n“They’re not paying FX to run ‘Justified’ in Scandinavia or Gabon,” Pachter said. “The stuff they own, sure, why not.”\nStreaming video services like YouTube and Netflix are popular in developed countries, especially the West. Foreign markets where fewer people have access to fixed broadband internet pose more of a challenge.\nAmazon earlier this year began selling a stand-alone video service to complement the existing product, which is an add-on to its Prime subscriptions. The video service will be introduced in new countries in time to offer “The Grand Tour.”",

      "text": "  Amazon Spot Featuring a Vicar and a Muslim Cleric Shows How Alike We Are After All Advertisement Comment \nAmazon’s beautiful, wordless spot about two old friends who share a cup of tea and find out they share a similar problem is blowing up on social media. Why? Because the two friends happen to be a Vicar and a Muslim. \nIn the ad, both men realize they share a common problem caused by the amount of time they spend on their knees praying. Then, in an act of selflessness, they click on Amazon Prime and buy each other the same set of knee pads. The ad began airing simultaneously in the US UK and Germany on Wednesday and US Today is saying that this may be the first time a Muslim Cleric has been featured in an ad in the United States. Certainly, it’s rare enough to be notable. \nJeff Bezos , Amazon’s CEO, tweeted how much he loved the new ad, but Amazon was also quick to point out that the ad wasn’t inspired by the recent election in the US, and that work on it started back in June. \nIn fact, it’s set in England and stars and actual priest and imam. The priest is Rev Gary Bradley, vicar of Little Venice in north-west London, and the imam is played by Zubeir Hassam, principal of the Muslim School Oadby, in Leicestershire. \nThe filmmakers took advice from both the Church of England and Muslim Council of Great Britain as well as the interfaith Christian Muslim Forum. Then to make it even more authentic, they shot in an actual church and an actual mosque in East London. \nBut despite all the attempts to be respectful, you can expect to see a backlash as people take sides for and against the ad in both the US and the UK. There will be those — hopefully a minority —who would view the display of common humanity in this spot as upsetting merely given the inclusion of an imam. After all, Lowe’s pulled their ads (which didn’t include any Muslims) from the TLC show All American Muslim based on the backlash to the placement alone. \nThe whole inclusion is not only going to rocket this thing to social media stardom, it’s going to overshadow the fact that Amazon kinda, sorta foreshadowed their own delivery force in the spot. \n— Peter Kearns (@pkearns) November 18, 2016 \nThen again, business strategy announcements should always take a back seat to remembering our shared humanity.",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon If you're in the market for earbuds, Amazon's having a one-day sale on a good pair.\nThey're called the ms02 and they're made by a smaller audio company called thinksound. You may not know them yet, but they make a quality product.\nIn fact, they're the updated version of a pair we recommended in a gift guide last year.\nIf you care about aesthetics, the ms02 are a hard headphone to beat; they've got a wooden frame and four-foot kevlar cable. These are far nicer than the average materials used to make earbuds, and if you've only used budget pairs, you'll notice the difference.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the ms02 has gummy tips. If you've had problems with similarly constructed earbuds in the past, you might want to think twice.\nOther than that, it's smooth sailing. These were reviewed positively by one of the members of Head-Fi, the most hardcore online headphone forum. The member who reviewed them praised their sound (warm and full), environmentally friendly construction (all recycled materials), and overall build quality.\nThe review gets more in-depth, but these earbuds are better than your average pair. The reviewer's only gripes were the ms02's cable (it kinks easily) and the lack of additional tips (three extra sizes.) \nTypically these earbuds run around $100, but Amazon is having a sale right now that gets them just under $70. In the headphone world, that can make a really big difference. If you're looking for your first pair of non-budget earbuds, this is a deal you should take advantage of.\nOr, if you're in the process of buying holiday presents, I'd be hard pressed to think of a music lover that wouldn't want these.\nthinksound ms02 In-ear Monitor with Passive Noise Isolation, $69.29 (originally $98.99), available at Amazon   [$30 off] \nHaving trouble figuring out what to get people for the holidays?  You can check out all of Insider Picks' gift guides here.  \n",

      "text": "(Reuters) — Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount.\nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models – the 500, the Panda and the 500L.\nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy’s biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to.\n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference.\nThe manager at the world’s seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers.\nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer.\nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.\n(This version of the story corrects paragraphs 1 and 5 after company says special online offers would improve existing promotions by up to 33 percent, not that the full price would be cut by a third)\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon\nIf you're in the market for earbuds, Amazon's having a one-day sale on a good pair.\nThey're called the ms02 and they're made by a smaller audio company called thinksound. You may not know them yet, but they make a quality product.\nIn fact, they're the updated version of a pair we recommended in a gift guide last year.\nIf you care about aesthetics, the ms02 are a hard headphone to beat; they've got a wooden frame and four-foot kevlar cable. These are far nicer than the average materials used to make earbuds, and if you've only used budget pairs, you'll notice the difference.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the ms02 has gummy tips. If you've had problems with similarly constructed earbuds in the past, you might want to think twice.\nOther than that, it's smooth sailing. These were reviewed positively by one of the members of Head-Fi, the most hardcore online headphone forum. The member who reviewed them praised their sound (warm and full), environmentally friendly construction (all recycled materials), and overall build quality.\nThe review gets more in-depth, but these earbuds are better than your average pair. The reviewer's only gripes were the ms02's cable (it kinks easily) and the lack of additional tips (three extra sizes.)\nTypically these earbuds run around $100, but Amazon is having a sale right now that gets them just under $70. In the headphone world, that can make a really big difference. If you're looking for your first pair of non-budget earbuds, this is a deal you should take advantage of.\nOr, if you're in the process of buying holiday presents, I'd be hard pressed to think of a music lover that wouldn't want these.\nthinksound ms02 In-ear Monitor with Passive Noise Isolation, $69.29 (originally $98.99), available at Amazon [$30 off]\nHaving trouble figuring out what to get people for the holidays?

      "text": "Business Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online A new Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sign is pictured after being unveiled at Chrysler Group World Headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Photo: Reuters Published: 11:20 PM, November 18, 2016 Updated: 1:30 AM, November 19, 2016 \nMILAN - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) <FCHA.MI> said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon <AMZN.O> to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \n(This version of the story corrects paragraphs 1 and 5 after company says special online offers would improve existing promotions by up to 33 percent, not that the full price would be cut by a third) REUTERS",

      "title": "Fiat sets up auto store on Amazon’s Italian site",
      "text": "Amazon.com is once again dipping its toe into the complex world of auto retail — this time in Italy, hand in hand with the champion of that country’s legendary car industry.\nFiat has opened a store on Amazon.it, where it lets shoppers pick among three models — the tiny 500, its larger sibling 500L, and the Panda, a small utility vehicle. \nAll are sold at steeply discounted prices, from 15 percent off a $27,000 500L to 28 percent off a $17,472 500 (a reboot of the classic “cinquecento”).\nThe news, according to Reuters, came out of an online press conference by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in Italy, where a Fiat executive called it a “new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” according to the news agency.\n  The arrangement doesn’t entirely do away with automobile dealers, however. The way it works, according to instructions on Amazon’s site, is the following:\nThe prospective buyer buys a $190 “Welcome Kit” on Amazon’s site, which is expedited to the buyer’s house and contains an offer code. Then Amazon’s call center will contact the buyer to select the dealer where the final transaction will take place. \nThe buyer then shows up at the dealer with the offer code along the Amazon order confirmation. The entire process from click to ignition takes two weeks, according to the Amazon site. \nThe partnership with Fiat underscores how hard it is for the world’s largest e-commerce retailer to overthrow the empire of dealers and auto-makers in the lucrative but highly regulated world of car sales. \nBut it certainly shows how auto makers see Amazon as a key channel to reach new customers.\nAmazon has dabbled in car sales before. In 2000 it backed Greenlight.com, a car-buying service that promised no haggling but relied on a network of dealers. It was accessible through Amazon’s online store, but the experiment was short-lived. Greenlight was later bought by CarsDirect, a service that connects shoppers with dealers.\nLast summer, Amazon launched Amazon Vehicles , a destination on its online store that allows shoppers to browse car specifications and reviews to facilitate car shopping. But it won’t sell cars. The point is to direct customers to Amazon’s online store for parts. \nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .

      "text": "TOP 5335775 \nIf you don’t have Amazon Prime yet, you need to reconsider. The holidays are coming up, and you definitely do not want to be one of those folks who has to give an IOU (“trust me, your gift is on the way!”) come Christmastime. Amazon Prime eliminates that concern with free two-day shipping. Oh, and it also comes with unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV shows. (Do you want to watch old HBO shows like the Sopranos but don’t have HBO? Amazon Prime has you covered). The free shipping, the unlimited streaming of content (which also, by the way, now includes a vast music library), the free unlimited photo storage. It’s honestly pretty silly to go through life these days without Amazon Prime. \nI can see one reason why you would not want to get Amazon Prime, and that is because it costs $99. A hundred bucks is not cheap. But today only, the price is just $79 . Seventy-nine measly dollars for all the stuff I just mentioned! If you buy stuff from Amazon (and you do because it’s 2016 and you almost certainly buy things) then you will make up for this $80 very, very quickly. It’s a no-brainer. \nTo make things even better, Amazon is launching a new original series, “ The Grand Tour ,” from the people who brought you “ Top Gear .” If you like cars, if you like adventure, if you like excitement…you will like this show. Unfortunately, it is only available to Amazon Prime members. Fortunately, you can be an Amazon Prime member today for just $79.",

      "text": "52 shares \nItalian Amazon users will soon be able to purchase their next car while shopping for toothpaste. \nAnnounced today, the deal teams Fiat Chrysler with e-commerce giant Amazon to offer three of Italy’s best-selling cars at discounted prices online — the ‘Panda,’ ‘500,’ and ‘500L.’ “The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, of Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during a press conference. \nAfter picking their options online, buyers will be contacted by an Amazon representative with details on where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the new vehicle — sorry, no one-click ordering or Prime shipping. The vehicle would be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \nResearch shows that half of Italians were willing to buy their next car online, but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer, according to Italia . \nThe deal further details Amazon’s desire to get into the car business. \nLast month, Amazon.fr (France) announced a similar deal, although users were only able to pay the downpayment online. To get the car you’d have to talk to the dealership via phone, and then pay an additional €10,490. Amazon also recently launched its Amazon Vehicles site for US users. The portal is a one-point shopping experience that lets you do everything short of actually buying a car — reviews, comparison tools, and even parts sales. \nUS users hoping for the same seamless car shopping experience are out of luck. Due to a complicated regulatory environment that requires car transactions to be handled through an authorized dealer, we’ll just have to wait. ",

      "text": "Amazon Streaming In Canada? We Could See A 'Stealth Launch' Soon The Huffington Post Canada | By Daniel Tencer Comment ADVERTISEMENT \nAs Canada’s Shomi streaming service prepares to shut down at the end of the month , there is a possibility a new player will arrive: Amazon Prime’s streaming service, which offers movies and original shows such as “Transparent” and “Bosch.” \nThe news of its arrival in Canada was “announced” unofficially on Tuesday in a tweet from Jeremy Clarkson, the British journalist most recently known for hosting “Top Gear.” So. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global. \n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nBut since the tweet, Amazon has steadfastly refused to confirm its streaming service has “gone global,” only confirming to several news sources Clarkson’s show will indeed be available in Canada. \n\"We are excited to announce that 'The Grand Tour' will be able to be streamed from over 200 countries and territories around the world in December,\" a spokesperson confirmed to both CBC News and The Toronto Star . \nBut Clarkson may have just let a large cat out of its bag prematurely. \nRecent events in Australia up the odds of an Amazon video launch in Canada. \nThe service arrived this week in the Land Down Under in what media called an unexpected “stealth launch” — increasing the odds of a similar announcement in Canada. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos on May 31, at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. (Photo: AP/Ted S. Warren) \nBesides the U.S. and now Australia, Amazon streaming is available in Britain, Japan and Germany. \nClarkson was promoting his new Amazon Prime show, “The Grand Tour,” on Twitter and responded to complaints from other Tweeters that Amazon Prime streaming is not available in many countries. \nJournalist and TV personality Jeremy Clarkson. (Photo: Associated Press/Matt Dunham) \nAmazon Prime itself is available to Canadians for $79 a month, but offers only free two-day shipping and some discounts and special offers — excluding Amazon’s video and music streaming services, available to U.S. customers for US$79 a year. \nThe Toronto Star notes there could be licensing issues, as some Amazon original shows have been licensed to other media companies in Canada. \n“Bosch” is being aired on Bell Media’s CraveTV, while the critically acclaimed “Transparent” is available on Shomi — though that service, as mentioned, is shutting down at the end of November.

      "text": "From now until November 21, you can ask Amazon's Alexa for early Black Friday savings From now until November 21, you can ask Amazon's Alexa for early Black Friday savings Posted: Tags : Deals - Deals + Amazon - Amazon + Black Friday. Amazon. Those two names seem to go hand-in-hand these days, and it comes with good reason. Amazon has proven to be one of the premier outlets this year for Black Friday deals, and seeing as how we've been covering Black Friday promotions since the beginning of the month, it seems to have turned into its own little season. The latest Amazon offering for Black Friday is actually a bit of an interesting one. Rather than offering deals on their website, Amazon has announced a slew of new sales that can only be accessed through an Alexa-enabled device - such as the Echo or Echo Dot. In order to access the deals, you'll need to say, \"Alexa, order a....\" and then whatever deal that's being offered. It certainly is a unique way to go about things, and it's yet another move on Amazon's part to try and get people to actively use their Alexa-powered gadgets more and more often. So, exactly what deals are up for grabs? The full list can be found via the source link, as we're only including the deals that relate to the world of tech. With that said, here they are. \"Alexa, order an Amazon Tap\" - final price of $80 for a savings of $50 \"Alexa, order a Samsung TV\" (32-inch 1080p display) - final price of $115 for a savings of $80 \"Alexa, order a Philips Hue Starter Kit - final price of $55 for a savings of $15 \"Alexa, order studio headphones\" (Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones) - final price of $80. The model of headphones isn't specified here, so we're not sure what the exact savings are. While the deals here aren't necessarily door-busters, the best ones look to be the Samsung TV and Amazon Tap. The deals are active now and will be available until Monday, November 21st. And, as an added bonus, spending $10 or more on any of the deals being offered through Alexa will allow you to score a $5 Amazon gift card for free.",

      "text": "An Amazon Echo device interacting with a smart thermostat. (Ecobee Photo) Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa is becoming very skillful these days. She can buy stuff , she can find a lost phone , she can turn on the oven . Now, she can even text people.\nAT&T announced a new Alexa skill this week that lets users program up to 10 contacts into their Alexa-enabled devices and send them messages via voice command. Here’s how it works: first, say: “Alexa, ask AT&T to text (name),” then when Alexa asks for the message, users tell her what they want to say and Alexa does the rest.\n“Amazon Echo is ahead of the curve in terms of voice recognition technology and functionality,” Jeff Bradley, AT&T’s senior vice president for device and network services marketing, said in a statement.\nAs part of the deal, AT&T is selling the Alexa-enabled Echo and Echo Dot through its website, giving Amazon more visibility for its voice-activated devices.\nAT&T’s release doesn’t make it clear if Alexa can read back incoming text messages. Eventually, Amazon wants Alexa to be able to have coherent conversations with people.\nAmazon has been called the “accidental” early winner in the voice-controlled home, leading Google, Apple and others with surprisingly strong sales of Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices. Developers have embraced Alexa, building more than 3,000 skills since Amazon opened it up last year . Developers who want to add to Alexa’s abilities can write code that works with Alexa in the cloud, letting the smart assistant do the heavy lifting of understanding and deciphering spoken commands.",

      "text": "Amazon is the US's largest online retailer, and there aren't many things on this big blue sphere that you can't buy through an Amazon checkout. Automobiles, for a long while, were one of the site's few blind spots, but not anymore.\nReuters reports that the online shopping behemoth has struck a landmark deal with Fiat Chrysler to sell three different models via the web, and for a pretty significant discount over what a dealership charges. The cars, which will initially only be available to Amazon shoppers in Italy, are the 500, 500L, and Panda — the best selling car in Italy as a whole. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \n10 hidden iPhone tricks Apple never told you about All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon Release date for Pokemon Go Generation 2 might have just leaked ",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Video Goes Global News Analysis Tweet Forgetting everything else that's happened in 2016, this year has been bracketed by two major global video announcements. In January, Netflix expanded service to 130 new countries, bringing its reach to 190 nations in total. And now as the year winds to a close, Amazon has announced that it will launch Prime Video service in 200 new countries come December. \nThe announcement comes in the form of a YouTube short with the hosts of Amazon's new show The Grand Tour stating that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally, which means you will be able to watch The Grand Tour in over 200 countries around the world.\" \nThe analyst firm Jefferies was quick to jump on the financial implications of Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN)'s global expansion, estimating in a research note that the company's spending on content rights in 2017 will be in line with Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX)'s roughly $6 billion content budget. While spending is projected to be high, however, the benefit of those content investments is that both Amazon and Netflix can reap the rewards of new revenue from a massive and far-reaching audience. \nConsidered another way, Internet streaming initially trashed the traditional US television model that was built on regional cable franchises. Now, it's going a step further and blasting through national barriers to bring TV competition to a global field of battle. \nThe moves by Netflix and Amazon do help put the consolidation of media and distribution companies into perspective. If old-style pay-TV companies now have to compete internationally, they need the content rights and technology and distribution scale to do so. \nRelated posts:",

      "text": "Rio de Janeiro (AFP) - Members of a remote Amazon rainforest indigenous tribe have shot dead six illegal gold miners with arrows, Brazilian officials said Friday. Brazil's Funai agency, which handles indigenous affairs, said that the killings were carried out by the Yanomami tribe in the Amazonian state of Roraima on the frontier with Venezuela.\n\"The deaths were reported to us by the Yanomami people's association and a team from Funai is preparing to travel there,\" a spokesman told AFP.\nA police spokesman for Roraima state told AFP that \"the causes of the conflict are not known.\"\nThe Yanomami are one of the Amazon's largest relatively isolated tribes, with an estimated population of about 35,000, according to advocacy group Survival International.\nTheir pristine ancestral lands have been steadily encroached upon by illegal gold miners who are blamed for introducing new diseases and polluting the rivers and forest. The Yanomami are also under pressure from cattle ranchers on the fringes of their rainforest territory.\nPolice said they would accompany Funai to the area, probably next week, and that the killings occurred at the start of the month but had only been confirmed now.\n\"We don't know the motive for the conflict because the tribespeople from the village where the deaths occurred told us by radio that they will not explain what happened until we personally go there,\" Junior Hekuari, chairman of the Yanomami association, told G1 news site.",

      "text": "0 November 18, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Deals And Ads: Sam’s Club’s Samsung Pre-Black Friday Nov. 19 Sale Starts Tonight — How Does It Compare To Walmart And Amazon Sales? Phillip Dengler \nBlack Friday 2016 is exactly a week away from today, and numerous national retailers are holding early pre-Black Friday sales. Amazon and Walmart are probably the two most popular stores who are treating their customers to early savings, but Sam’s Club has also been one of the more active retailers. \nLast week, they held their annual one-day sale on November 12, which featured Black Friday prices on a variety of electronics and home items. While Sam’s Club’s official general pre-Black Friday event does not begin until Sunday, they are actually kicking things off early with a selection of electronics deals from premium manufacturer Samsung. The sale begins online at 12:01 a.m. tonight, and traditional brick-and-mortar locations will open at 7 a.m. \nA full listing of the sale items can be found at BestBlackFriday.com , but here are the top deals from the ad. \nDisclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. [Image via Sam’s Club] \nAs the screenshot shows, this sale is entirely made up of Samsung items. While a single-item sale is usually not news worthy, Samsung is probably the most common brand for electronics deals on Black Friday. Select items actual offer better discounts than Black Friday, so it could make sense to purchase them a week earlier in order to avoid the rush. \nPar for the course with Sam’s Club, limited quantities are available on every item, and there are no rain checks. 10.1″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A w/Free 32GB MicroSD Card for $188.84 (reg. $288.84) 8″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A w/Free Pouch for $118.24 (reg. $188.88) Samsung 2.1 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer for $139.88 (reg. $199.88) Samsung 24″ Class 720p TV form $98.88 (reg. $138.88) Samsung 27″ Curved 1080p Monitor for $169 (reg $249) Samsung 40″ Class 1080p Smart TV for $238 (reg. $328) Samsung 4k Blu-ray Disc Player for $189.88 Samsung 55″ Class 4K SUHD HDR Smart TV for $978 (reg. $1,378) Samsung 55″ Class 4K UDH Curved Smart TV + Samsung 2.1 Curved Soundbar w/Wireless Subwoofer for $698 (reg. $1,099) Samsung 70″ Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 Gift Card for $1,248 Samsung 8-Channel 1080p HD Security System with 1TB Hard Drive for $199 (reg. $299) Samsung Blu-ray Disc Player for $44.88 (reg. $64.88) Samsung Level U Pro Wireless Headphones for $39.88 (reg. $99.99) Samsung Radiant Connect Speaker for $79.88 (reg. $129.88) Forget Black Friday, Sam’s Club has a serious one-day sales event this Saturday https://t.co/mTy28wXNCU \n— David Papp (@DavidPapp) November 16, 2016 \nShipping Options \nUnlike other retailers, Sam’s Club does not have a general rule for shipping. Certain expensive items may incur shipping charges, while select cheap items may ship for free. The good news is that the majority of the items in this sale will ship for free. As a general rule, paying shipping charges on any Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Thanksgiving sale is unnecessary. Many retailers, including Best Buy and Target, are offering free shipping on every order with no minimum this holiday season. \nSeeing as most Samsung deals are going to be over $50, the majority will qualify for free shipping. If you come across one that does not, you should look elsewhere because shipping charges can drastically reduce an otherwise great deal. \nComparisons to Black Friday \nUnlike in this sale, Sam’s Club is not offering many Samsung televisions on Black Friday. The closest comparison for televisions is the Samsung 75″ 4K UHD Smart TV (UN75JU641DFXZA) for $1,998 on Black Friday. Tonight’s sale has a Samsung 70″ Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 gift card for $1,248. While these are not the same television, they are still fairly comparable. By shopping tonight’s sale, you can pay more than $700 less, and you will also receive a Sam’s Club gift card valued at $150. \nTonight’s sale also features the 10.1″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A with a free 32GB MicroSD Card for $188.84, which is a savings of $100. On Black Friday, Sam’s Club will have the same exact deal, so this is an opportunity to get it early. \nComparisons to Walmart and Amazon Pre-Black Friday Sales \nAs Amazon announced in a press release earlier this week, they started their “Black Friday Deals Week” sale earlier today. Many of the Samsung televisions are still a few days away, but Amazon claims the “lowest prices on select Samsung TVs.” One deal that is live now is the Samsung UN65KS8500 Curved 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for $1,597.99, which is a discount of $400. The closest comparable deal is the one mentioned above — the Samsung 70″Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 gift card for $1,248. \nWhile there are differences among both televisions, you can get a set that is five inches larger for more than $300 less. For the average viewer, the difference in quality should be fairly negligible. \nWalmart’s pre-Black Friday sale is loaded with Samsung televisions. They are offering the Samsung 40″ 6200 Series Full HD Smart LED TV for $227, which is a discount of $522.99. Sam’s Club’s sale is featuring a Samsung 40″ Class 1080p Smart TV for $238, which is a discount of $90. In this instance, you can get a more expensive Samsung TV at Walmart and pay $11 less. \nRegardless, this sale still has prices that are very comparable to what you will see on Black Friday. The popular opinion is that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best days of the year to get a deal, but careful planning can net you prices just as good by shopping a few days earlier. \n[Featured Image by Scott Olson/Getty Images]",

      "text": "| Last updated 2016-11-18 09:11 p.m. \nAfter nearly two decades reviewing, destroying, racing, and—with varying degrees of success—creating motor vehicles, the former Top Gear trio of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May have become what they most despised: caravanners. \nLongtime viewers of the BBC motoring show will appreciate the irony here: They’ve crashed into RVs in a chase scene, set a campground on fire, and mercilessly swung one at another in a rousing game of Caravan Conkers. But in their reincarnation as Amazon ’s The Grand Tour , the co-hosts are setting out for adventures all over the world in a traveling tent, complete with a small stage with suitcases and trunks denoting their (as Clarkson so delicately put it) gypsy status. The tent isn’t the only familiar vestige of Top Gear : The season opens with a somber Clarkson getting the boot from BBC, so it’s certainly not shying away from their history. There’s a season-preview montage of explosions, racing, shit-giving, and more; the format follows the same combination of short films abroad and in-studio clips; and they’ll tackle sexy supercars and military-grade tanks with equal enthusiasm. And, of course, the co-hosts still can’t help but mock one another for their various shortcomings (a more literal turn of phrase in Hammond’s case) and their audience of Americans and our cultural fascination with the Toyota Prius. The debut episode even ends on a bombshell, just like the good ol’ days. Tossing Jeremy Renner out of an airplane makes one helluva first impression for anybody still on the fence. \nPerhaps most importantly, the quality is every bit maintained—as well it should be for a rumored $242.7 million deal . The close-up shots of supercar bodies, in-car interviews, and gut-rattling audio all help capture the borderline pornographic featurettes on their subjects. A new visual feature also lets viewers get an X-ray view of the cars’ innards. (And, you know, if you want to get to know the beasts too, May’s brought his encyclopedic technical know-how along for the ride.) The hosts suggest that a few episodes of the season might not be traditional “car show” material per se, but kicking things off with the “hypercar holy trinity” of the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and an unregistered LaFerrari was a perfectly well-measured choice by the creators to recapture the old fanbase and lure in new viewers in one fell swoop. And tossing Jeremy Renner out of an airplane makes one helluva first impression for anybody still on the fence. \nCertainly, it’ll take some getting used to: The guys seem more scripted this time around (which isn’t the worst idea when you’ve got a man like Clarkson at the helm). The News segment has been rebranded awkwardly as “Conversation Street,” “Celebrity Brain Crash” ostensibly replaces Star in a Reasonably Priced Car (when they move past an awkwardly long bit about all the celebs dropping dead en route), and the lap times board is digital now. The new test track, surrounded by an old lady and a herd of sheep, hasn’t been properly christened after Michael Gambon or broken in by the Stig (who speaks? and may or may not be NASCAR’s Michael Skinner, aka the Emetic?) … But yeah, we’re nit-picking here. \nWhen the BBC elected not to renew Top Gear in 2015, fans frankly weren’t sure if they’d ever get a chance to see their favorites back on-air. With The Grand Tour , they very much are—now uncensored, thanks to life on the internet—and we can’t wait to follow them from California to Johannesburg to Portugal and beyond. \nNew episodes premiere on Fridays on Amazon Prime.",

      "text": "Reddit \nIf you’ve been on the fence about subscribing to Amazon Prime , then you might like to know that the yearly cost is currently discounted. The sale, which drops the price down to $79 for your first year of Prime, will only last as long as November 18 does. That means when the clock hits 11:59 PM, Amazon Prime’s price jumps back up to $99 per year. \nWhy the single-day sale? Amazon is celebrating the release of The Grand Tour on Prime Video. The Grand Tour brings former TopGear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May back together in a new globetrotting show. Considering the response the first episode has received, it’s no surprise that Amazon wants to get as many eyes watching as possible. \nAfter all, The Grand Tour is only available through Prime Video, so discounting Prime on the same day the show is released might get some folks to take the plunge. Interestingly, $79 per year was the original cost of Prime back when it was introduced in 2005. It stayed that way until 2014, when Amazon decided to increase the yearly price to $99. \nOf course, there are more perks to Amazon Prime than just Prime Video and The Grand Tour. Most notably, Prime offers free two-day shipping on many items across Amazon’s store. Other perks include free access to Prime Music, or a discount on the monthly cost of Amazon Music Unlimited if you prefer on-demand streaming. \nIf you’re thinking of taking advantage of this deal, you’ll want to make your decision quickly. Remember – the sale ends at 11:59 PM ET tonight, meaning you’ve got about 10 more hours to sign up before the price jumps back up to $99 per year. Story Timeline",

      "text": "Reddit \nStarting this morning Amazon is making certain Black Friday shoppers are spending cash as early as possible with “voice shopping weekend.” To do this, they’re running a deal in which Amazon Tap is a bit cheaper than normal, and a few more deals can be found by asking Alexa devices. Users that have an Alexa-enabled device should ask, “Alexa, what are your deals” each day – but make sure not to say “what is YOUR deal,” because that means something different. \nFor those not hung up on the idea that “Alexa, what are your deals” sounds a little too close to “Alexa, what is your deal, you’re sounding extremely grumpy today,” there’s a list of deals. Starting today and running through the 21st of this month, a few deals will pop up in Amazon. \n“This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop,” said Assaf Ronen, Vice President Voice Shopping. “Voice shopping with Alexa takes the hassle out of the holidays, giving customers the ability to order from millions of items simply by saying the word.” \nAmazon suggests that there’ll be an “up to 40% off” deal running on “everyday essentials” as well. There’s a bit of a bonus, too, for users who purchase “an Alexa deal” for $10 or more between here and Cyber Monday. Those users will receive a $5 Amazon gift card “while supplies last”– so maybe they have a stack of cards and literally cannot create any more, I suppose. \nEach of the following items will have sales associated with them with commands for Alexa. For the Amazon Tap deal, users will be able to say “Alexa, order an Amazon Tap.” For a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV, users will say “Alexa, order a Samsung TV.” The same product command sequence works with the BB-8 by Sphero with “Star Wars robot,” with a Philips Hue LED Starter Kit with “Hue Starter Kit”, and Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones with “studio headphones.” \nAlso on this list is a 10-piece All-Clad stainless steel cookware set with “Alexa, order an All-Clad cookware set.” A LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box works with “LEGO Classic Brick Box,” a 48-pack of Amazon Basics AA batteries works with “AA batteries”, and Lindt Lindor Milk Chocolate Truffles work with “Lindor truffles.” The whole collection can also be found at Amazon.com/AlexaDeals as well.

      "text": "One of the things that people are looking forward to when it came to the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dot , which is powered by virtual assistant Alexa, is how other brands, apps, and partners will be able to incorporate skills (voice-driven capabilities) into the smart speaker and their respective products. AT&T is one of the first and also the first carrier that will let you send text messages to your contacts through Alexa using purely voice commands of course.\nStarting November 18, AT&T subscribers will be able to use the Send Message skill on their Amazon Echo or Echo Dot. From the name itself, you could probably surmise that it lets you send text messages from your phone number to a predetermined list of contacts, and all you have to do is ask Alexa to do it for you. You can add up to 10 contacts, obviously those that you text most often, to the skill so you can let the cloud-based voice service do her magic.\nJeff Bradley, AT&T’s senior vice president for Device and Network Services Marketing said that becoming the first carrier to do this is part of their goal to bring simple solutions so their customers can stay in touch. Hopefully, this will spur other carriers to do the same, and even other developers as well to explore the skills feature of Amazon’s home speakers.\nThe AT&T Send Message skill will be available starting August 18. They’re also offering great deals that day for the Amazon Echo ($179) and the Echo Dot ($49) when you buy through att.com or their retail stores.\nSOURCE: AT&T",
