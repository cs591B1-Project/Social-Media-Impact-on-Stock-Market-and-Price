      "text": "More Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) expects the US to appeal a World Trade Organization decision Monday that declared illegal a tax credit offered by Washington state, company representatives said. The WTO decision was a win for the European Union on behalf of Airbus, which had argued that a Washington state tax benefit offered to Boeing to build the 777x jetliner was an unfair subsidy which violates global trade rules. \"I fully expect this case will be appealed,\" said Bob Novick, an outside counsel representing Boeing, adding that a final resolution of the case might not come until early 2019. The US Trade Representative said it is reviewing the WTO decision with Washington state officials to decide how to respond. Novick criticized the rationale behind the decision to strike down the Washington state Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate as wrongly concluding that the law favored the domestic manufacturing of goods because Boeing had not imported the wing for the 777x as it had for the 787 plane. The WTO \"jumped to the conclusion that the somehow the law favored domestic over imported,\" he told reporters in a conference call. Boeing said the WTO rejected the EU claim that the company had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing estimates the total benefit of the disputed Washington state provision at $50 million a year, or a maximum of $1 billion. Boeing has not received any of the benefits yet under the B&O tax break and does not expect to see any until 2020 at the soonest, Boeing officials said. \"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel. The ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen Airbus and Boeing each score points along the way. US Trade Representative spokesman Matt McAlvanah said the agency was reviewing the ruling, but suggested it was ready to fight on behalf of the US aerospace giant. \"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" McAlvanah said in a statement, noting the WTO has deemed illegal $22 billion in EU subsidies to Airbus. \"The US government will continue to hold the EU to account for illegal, market distorting subsidies that have put American workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\" Reblog",

      "text": "U.S. Air Force confirms Boeing’s electromagnetic pulse weapon Advertisement For the last few years, the creative minds of Hollywood had seemingly outpaced the reality of technological and scientific advances in the weapons field. But no longer. Stepping out of the realm of science fiction and into reality is the joint U.S. Air Force and Boeing electromagnetic pulse weapon, capable of targeting and destroying electrical systems without the collateral damage often associated with traditional firepower. As Don Cheadle noted in the ever-relevant Ocean’s 11, this new weapon “is a bomb — but without the bomb.” Known as the “CHAMP,” or Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project, the American military project is an attempt to develop a device with all the power of a nuclear weapon but without the death and destruction to people and infrastructure that such a weapon causes. Theoretically, the new missile system would pinpoint buildings and knock out their electrical grids, plunging the target into darkness and general disconnectedness.

      "text": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. plane maker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state’s main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus.\nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based.\nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.\n \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world’s largest trade dispute.\nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing , but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel.\nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when.\nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited – but later watered down on appeal – should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid.\nThey also zeroed in on “program accounting” methods used by Boeing , which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received.\nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.\nConfident on Appeal \nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid “without delay.”\nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020.\nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.\nInvestors, too, seemed skeptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market.\n“We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,” Bernstein analysts said in a note.\nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly.\nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned.\nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.\nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.\n ",

Boeing said the WTO “rejected virtually all of the European Union’s challenges.”\nHowever, legal experts and aerospace executives expect little, if anything, to change in the battle between Boeing and Airbus.\nThe current dispute centers around Washington state’s $8.7 billion tax incentive program for Boeing,\nwhich was approved in 2013. That package extended existing tax breaks from 2024 to 2040.\nThe tax break, along with a revised labor agreement with its workers, was key to Boeing’s decision to assemble the 777X jet and build its new carbon fiber composite wings in Washington. That jet will be delivered in 2020.\nThe E.U. filed suit in December 2014 and Monday’s ruling declared part of tax break package a subsidy prohibited under WTO rules, and ordered Boeing and Washington state to withdraw the tax incentives within 90 days. Both sides agree that is unlikely to happen.\n“After any appeal,” said Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, “we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.”\nFabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus’s jetliner unit, said, “I have little faith in the U.S. compliance with the WTO rulings.”\nThe office of the governor of Washington state did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nClaims of illegal subsidies between the two airplane manufacturers date back to 2004 when the U.S. claimed Airbus was receiving illegal subsidies from European governments. Europe counter sued in 2005, alleging Defense Department and NASA projects with Boeing supported its 787 development and represented a similar illegal subsidy.\nThe prospect of sanctions against Airbus under earlier rulings has potentially shifted with the election of businessman Donald Trump as U.S. president. President-elect Trump railed against what he called an unfair trade environment for the U.S. and its businesses.\nAirbus Group chief executive Tom Enders called the back and forth WTO disputes “ridiculous” and said a new set of globally applicable rules were warranted to address state support of airplane manufacturing.\nNational, state and local support of aerospace industries is typically the rule, not the exception.\nAlabama gave Airbus a $158 million financial support package to establish a final assembly line for its single-aisle jets in Mobile along the Gulf Coast.\nThe Quebec government earlier this year infused $1 billion in Canadian plane maker Bombardier for a stake in its struggling CSeries jetliner program.

      "text": "See a Boeing Dreamliner built in under 2 minutes The World Trade Organization ruled Monday that Boeing received an illegal subsidy from Washington state to build its new 777X jetliner there, and the U.S. has 90 days to revoke the subsidy. The ruling was the latest round in the rivalry between plane builders Boeing ( BA ) and Airbus ( EADSF ) , which both declared the ruling a victory. \nAirbus, which is built by a European Union consortium, called it a \"knockout blow\" to Boeing. Boeing said the WTO \"rejected virtually all of the European Union's challenges.\" \nHowever, legal experts and aerospace executives expect little, if anything, to change in the battle between Boeing and Airbus. \nThe current dispute centers around Washington state's $8.7 billion tax incentive program for Boeing, \nwhich was approved in 2013. That package extended existing tax breaks from 2024 to 2040. \nThe tax break , along with a revised labor agreement with its workers, was key to Boeing's decision to assemble the 777X jet and build its new carbon fiber composite wings in Washington. That jet will be delivered in 2020. \nSingapore Airlines shops for world's longest jet \nThe E.U. filed suit in December 2014 and Monday's ruling declared part of tax break package a subsidy prohibited under WTO rules, and ordered Boeing and Washington state to withdraw the tax incentives within 90 days. Both sides agree that is unlikely to happen. \n\"After any appeal,\" said Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, \"we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.\" \nFabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus's jetliner unit, said, \"I have little faith in the U.S. compliance with the WTO rulings.\" \nThe office of the governor of Washington state did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nAirbus CEO vows to retake jet production crown \nClaims of illegal subsidies between the two airplane manufacturers date back to 2004 when the U.S. claimed Airbus was receiving illegal subsidies from European governments. Europe counter sued in 2005, alleging Defense Department and NASA projects with Boeing supported its 787 development and represented a similar illegal subsidy. \nThe prospect of sanctions against Airbus under earlier rulings has potentially shifted with the election of businessman Donald Trump as U.S. president. President-elect Trump railed against what he called an unfair trade environment for the U.S. and its businesses. \nAirbus Group chief executive Tom Enders called the back and forth WTO disputes \"ridiculous\" and said a new set of globally applicable rules were warranted to address state support of airplane manufacturing. \nNational, state and local support of aerospace industries is typically the rule, not the exception. \nAlabama gave Airbus a $158 million financial support package to establish a final assembly line for its single-aisle jets in Mobile along the Gulf Coast. \nThe Quebec government earlier this year infused $1 billion in Canadian plane maker Bombardier for a stake in its struggling CSeries jetliner program. China has wholly supported its domestic airliner business to eventually compete with the established players. \nCNNMoney (Seattle)  36 PM ET",

      "text": "GENEVA (AP) -- U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing&apos;s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday&apos;s ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn&apos;t until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today&apos;s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state&apos;s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers&apos; costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that&apos;s only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n---\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n ",

      "text": "Business WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 12:30 AM, November 29, 2016 \nGENEVA - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing <BA.N> develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. \nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus <AIR.PA> criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. \nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.

      "text": "GENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. The Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.",

      "text": "Job Vacancies Kuwait to buy 28 US F-18 jets \nKUWAIT: Kuwait will buy 28 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets to replace a fleet of earlier versions of the US fighter jets, a top official said yesterday. The value of the deal is not expected to exceed $5 billion, the KUNA state news agency reported the head of armament and procurement at Kuwait’s defense ministry as saying. Maj Gen Lafi Al-Azmi said the deal stipulates the supplier will repurchase the old Hornet fighter jets from Kuwait. He added that details of the sale would only be disclosed after it is officially signed. “Given Kuwait’s proximity to turbulent locations, we certainly need effective military equipment,” he was quoted as saying. \nThe US State Department this month said it has authorized the deal, as well as the sale of 72 F-15 Strike Eagle jets to Kuwait’s Gulf neighbor Qatar at an estimated value of $21 billion. In April, Kuwait signed a contract with Italy’s Finmeccanica for the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes for under €8 billion ($8.5 billion). The National Assembly in March approved spending an additional $500 million as an advance payment for the jets. \nThat funding came on top of $10 billion additional defense spending already approved by parliament in January to upgrade the country’s military. Kuwait is a member of the US-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria and Iraq, and is also taking part in a Saudi-led coalition pounding Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. Last year, it bought 24 Caracal military tactical transport helicopters and French light armored vehicles. – Agencies  ",

      "text": "Boeing counters EU’s claim of landmark victory in tax battle By KIRO Radio Staff , Staff report | November 28, 2016 @ 9:27 am A World Trade Organization panel ruled a state tax break Washington offered to Boeing is a \"prohibited\" subsidy. (AP) Tweet \nA World Trade Organization panel ruled a state tax break Washington offered to Boeing is a “prohibited” subsidy. \nThe state extended the business tax reduction to Boeing in 2013 to ensure production of the 777x plane would stay local. The decision found the state promised to give Boeing the prohibited subsidies from 2024-2040. \nTrump: Why Boeing will leave, or stay, in Washington \nProhibited is the WTO’s strictest legal category, and indicates a subsidy that can’t be allowed to stand. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, action would be taken to remove the subsidy, the Associated Press reports. \nThe European Union says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion, according to the Associated Press. EU Trade Commissioner Cecila Malmstrom told the AP the panel ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe European Union is claiming this as a victory in a battle between Boeing and its rival, Airbus. \nMalmstrom said the ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry,” AP reports. \nBut Boeing says otherwise. \nA statement from Boeing says the WTO panel rejected “virtually all of the European Union’s challenges to the Washington state tax incentives.” WTO, according to Boeing, rejected the challenge to six of seven incentives and “most of the challenge to the seventh.” \n“The WTO held only and narrowly that a reduction in Washington state’s Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate for future 777X revenues is inconsistent with the WTO agreements,” the statement reads. “The WTO threw out all of the EU’s other challenges to various incentive programs and left untouched even the B&O tax rate as it applies to revenue from the other Boeing models produced in Washington state–the 737, 747, 767, 777 (current model) and 787.” \nThe entire statement from Boeing can be read below. \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) today rejected virtually all of the European Union’s challenges to the Washington state tax incentives. \nIn today’s case, the EU challenged seven different state tax incentives. The WTO rejected entirely the EU’s challenge to six of the seven incentives and rejected most of the challenge to the seventh. The WTO held only and narrowly that a reduction in Washington state’s Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate for future 777X revenues is inconsistent with the WTO agreements. The WTO threw out all of the EU’s other challenges to various incentive programs and left untouched even the B&O tax rate as it applies to revenue from the other Boeing models produced in Washington state–the 737, 747, 767, 777 (current model) and 787. \nIn total, the EU claimed that Boeing had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totaling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible. The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X rate incentive, and will not until 2020 because the first airplane will not be delivered until then. \n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State, and Boeing,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel. “The WTO found in September that Airbus has received $22 billion in illegal subsidies from the EU and that without these subsidies neither Airbus itself nor any of its airplanes would even exist today. By contrast, in rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \n“The WTO has repeatedly found that Airbus is entirely a creature of government, and they must now bring themselves into compliance with the international laws or risk massive sanctions,” said Luttig. \nIn light of today’s decision and the massive liability that the WTO has found against the EU and Airbus, we expect the EU and Airbus to appeal today’s decision. “After any appeal,” Luttig said, “we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.”",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered ... more Photo: Reed Saxon, AP WTO body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nGENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale , referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 9:58 AM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. Reed Saxon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story GENEVA \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

WTO Rules Against Tax Break for Boeing’s 777X Jet \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. plane maker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state’s main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \n\nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world’s largest trade dispute. \nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing , but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. \nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited – but later watered down on appeal – should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on “program accounting” methods used by Boeing , which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nConfident on Appeal \nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid “without delay.” \nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \nInvestors, too, seemed skeptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market. \n“We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,” Bernstein analysts said in a note. \nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \n",

      "text": "Aircraft: Boeing 777-300ER Seat: 2K (First Class) \nI boarded through door L2, where I was addressed by name and pointed left towards the first class cabin. That first required walking through two rows of business class, which looked quite nice. It’s definitely an improvement over Swiss’ other business class product , as the new seats are much more private. \nSwiss business class 777 \nIn front of that were the eight Swiss first class seats, spread across two rows in a 1-2-1 configuration. \nSwiss first class cabin 777 \nMy first impression was that the cabin was sleek. Very, very sleek. This has to be one of the sharpest looking cabins out there. \nSwiss first class cabin 777 \nI had assigned myself seat 2K, the window seat in the second row on the right side. \nSwiss first class seat 777 \nThe center seats looked great as well, given that there was a partition you could raise for privacy, though at the same time if you’re traveling with someone you could easily have a conversation. \nSwiss 777 first class, seats 2D & 2G \nMy seat was a good width, though also had a lot of wasted space along the window, given that there were probably 8-10″ of paneling by the window. \nSwiss 777 first class, seat 2K \nThe seat featured an ottoman and massive personal television, among the biggest I’ve seen on any airline. \nSwiss 777 first class, seat 2K \nSwiss first class seat ottoman \nOne of the cool features of Swiss’ 777 first class is that rather than having the usual window shades that you manually lower, there’s a button that lowers the blinds. There are two settings — you can either just lower the blinds, or actually make it dark by pushing the same button again. The only downside is that this setup adds an extra layover of glass (or plastic), which makes it tougher to take pictures out the window. \nSwiss 777 windows \nStill, I thought it was a very stylish setup. \nSwiss 777 first class window shades \nThe seats had privacy partitions, though even without them extended, there was a good amount of privacy between seats. \nSwiss 777 first class cabin \nThe seat had a coat closet that extended out of the aisle-side of the seat, which was a good size. However, this feature confused the heck out of me. Apparently the intent is that Swiss’ first class seats are supposed to be fully enclosed, and that comes in the form of you extending the coat closet out, which just looks odd. You’d think they would make the coat closet enclosed, so that it looks like you have a door, rather than just a coat closet that’s separating you from the rest of the cabin. \nSwiss first class coat closet/door \nOn the bottom left side of the seat was a large storage compartment, though it was an awkward shape for storing most things. \nSwiss first class storage compartment \nThen on the front right side of the seat was a massive, beautiful tray table. \nSwiss first class tray table \nThe Swiss first class seat has a buddy seat, so you could easily dine with a companion on one of these tables. \nSwiss first class tray table \nUnderneath that was another exposed storage compartment. This seat has no shortage of storage opportunities! \nSwiss first class seat storage \nAbove the storage compartment were the basic seat pre-sets. \nSwiss first class seat controls \nNext to that was the compartment with the entertainment controller, more advanced seat controls, as well as a USB and 110v outlet, and headphone jacks. \nSwiss first class seat & entertainment controls \nSwiss first class seat controls \nSwiss first class seat headphone jack & power outlet \nMoments after settling in, I was greeted by one of the two very friendly first class flight attendants. She welcomed me aboard with a big smile, and asked if she could maybe get me a glass of champagne and the amuse bouche. She read my mind! \nMoments later she returned with a warm towel, an empty glass, a bottle of champagne, and the amuse bouche, which consisted of trout with sushi rice. For what it’s worth, Swiss serves Laurnet-Perrier Grand Siecle champagne in first class, which is quite good. \nSwiss first class pre-departure champagne & amuse bouche \nThe pre-takeoff amuse bouche offered by Swiss is a nice offering you don’t see on many airlines. \nSwiss first class pre-departure amuse bouche \nI was also offered a bunch of amenities for the flight. \nSwiss first class amenities \nThis included some headphones, which weren’t great quality. While they were fine, I wish more airlines would have proper noise canceling headphones in first class. American offers all their longhaul first & business class passengers Bose headphones, so if they can do it… 😉 \nSwiss first class headphones \nI was also offered slippers. \nSwiss first class slippers \nThen there was Swiss’ amenity kit, which was oh-so-Swiss. There was a wooden comb, tissues, socks, eyeshades, earplugs, a toothbrush and toothpaste, Ricola lozenges, and La Prairie amenities. I’m just disappointed they didn’t include clogs and a how-to-yodel manual. \nSwiss first class amenity kit \nIt doesn’t get higher quality than La Prairie, so kudos to them for offering hand cream, lip balm, face cream, and eye cream. \nSwiss first class La Prairie amenities \nHowever, Swiss doesn’t seem to offer pajamas on daytime flights, which most top airlines have on longhaul flights like this. \nI was also presented with the menu for the flight, and as the flight attendant presented it to me, she emphasized how this month’s menu has cuisine from Canton of St. Gallen. \nSwiss first class menu \nDuring boarding, the other first class flight attendant came by my seat to introduce herself as well, though she explained she would primarily be working in the galley. \nThe first class cabin filled up pretty quickly, and within about 15 minutes all eight first class seats were taken. With the exception of one Swiss guy, everyone else in the cabin seemed to be American. \nThere were two ladies who weren’t traveling together in seats 1A & 1D, and they seemed to enjoy chatting for most of the flight. Their conversations couldn’t have been any more LA. \nShortly before boarding finished up, Captain Bert came through the cabin to welcome aboard first class passengers, telling us that the flight time would be 11hr35min. This is a nice touch I’ve often found on Lufthansa and Swiss, though the pilots are generally quite awkward about it, as they just sort of stand there any say “everything okay?” \nI was amused when he came up to the lady in 1A, and before he could say anything she said “I’ll have more champagne please.” He responded with a smile and said “I will have the crew bring that, but I just wanted to introduce myself as I am the captain…” \nOnce he was back in the flight deck he made an announcement for the entire plane, informing us that we’d be flying over London, Shannon, Greenland, Hudson Bay, and Montana. \nAt 1:10PM it was announced that boarding was complete, at which point the maitre d’cabin made her welcome aboard announcement. \nA few minutes later the safety video was screened. \nSwiss safety video \nAt 1:20PM we began our pushback, and minutes later started taxiing to the runway. \nTaxiing Zurich Airport \nThere were surprisingly few planes taxiing, though we passed a Vueling A320, as well as an Emirates A380. \nVueling Airbus Zurich Airport \nEmirates A380 Zurich Airport \nZurich Airport terminal \nAt 1:35PM we were cleared for takeoff on runway 16, and had a smooth climb out. \nView after takeoff from Zurich \nView after takeoff from Zurich \n10 minutes after takeoff the seatbelt sign was turned off. I quickly checked out the lavatories, located at the front of the cabin. There were two of them, and the one on the exterior side of the plane was larger. \nSwiss 777 first class lavatory \nWhile there was some facial spray and lotion, there wasn’t much else in the way of amenities. \nSwiss 777 first class lavatory amenities \nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff the maitre d’cabin came through the first class cabin to personally welcome each passenger. She was extremely sweet, and gave each passenger a free wifi voucher, valid for 50MB. Unfortunately that lasts me for about 15 minutes of internet use, but it’s better than nothing. \nSwiss first class free wifi code \nSwiss first class free wifi code \nAfter that, the aisle flight attendant working first class came through the cabin to take meal orders. She explained I could eat whenever I wanted, and asked if I wanted lunch right away. I was hoping to get some rest later in the flight, so ordered food right away. \nHere’s the description of their Canton of St. Gallen emphasis: \nThe menu read as follows: \nThe wine list read as follows: \nThe coffee & tea menu read as follows: \nSince they serve an amuse bouche on the ground, they go straight to serving the meal after takeoff. At around 2:20PM my table was set. Swiss’ table setting is gorgeous, with a huge tablecloth, big salt & pepper mills, olive oil, etc. \nSwiss first class lunch service — table setting \nSwiss first class lunch — bread, salt & pepper mills, olive oil, and butter \nEven the bread is beautiful, as it’s a single loaf with three kinds of bread. \nSwiss first class lunch — bread selection \nOnce all tables were set, the crew rolled around a cart with the appetizer selection. The flight attendant did a fantastic job explaining each option in great detail, and then after I made my selection, she plated it beautifully. \nSwiss first class lunch — appetizer \nSwiss first class lunch — appetizer \nI ordered the balik salmon, which was great. \nSwiss first class lunch appetizer — balik salmon \nI also had the scampi with carrot and ginger chutney and cashew nuts, as well as scrambled egg mousse with truffle, chanterelles, and lentil salad. All three items were really great, and exceeded my expectations. At first I didn’t know what I was thinking ordering the scrambled egg with truffle, but it ended up being the highlight, as it was bursting with flavor. It was even served in the actual egg. A+++ for presentation. \nSwiss first class lunch appetizer — scrambled egg mousse and scampi \nAfter that I was offered a soup and/or salad. I decided to order a soup, which was the beef bouillon. It was excellent, including the presentation. \nSwiss first class lunch soup — beef bouillon \nFor the main course I ordered the panko-crusted salmon with coconut risotto, which was again fantastic. The dish couldn’t have been more flavorful. \nSwiss first class lunch main course — panko-crusted salmon with coconut risotto \nAfter that, a cart was rolled down the aisle with a cheese selection. Once again, the flight attendant described each cheese in great detail. I asked for the tiniest sample of everything, which she plated for me. The cheese and presentation were both top notch. \nSwiss first class lunch — cheese course \nLastly I was offered dessert. Typically I have a sweet tooth, so I was going to go with the mousse and ice cream, though I asked the flight attendant for her recommendation, and she said that the Bavarian cream with plum jelly, date and fig crumble, and sorbet, was unique. I took her advice, and at first was a bit disappointed when I saw it, since I don’t love fruity dessert. But this was really good, and exceeded my expectations. \nSwiss first class lunch dessert — Bavarian cream with plum jelly, date and fig crumble, sorbet \nTo finish off the meal I had a foamy cappuccino. Unfortunately the first class cappuccino machine was broken, so the flight attendant apologized for the delay, as she had to go to business class to make it. \nSwiss first class lunch — cappuccino \nOverall the meal was fantastic, with incredible service. The meal was served at a leisurely pace, and the entire meal was done about 2hr50min after takeoff. I loved how the appetizer and cheese courses were presented on trolleys, and also loved the attention to detail. For example, between courses they’d come around with one of those things you’ll only find at fancy restaurants with which they clean crumbs from the table. It’s not often you see that on a plane. \nWhat I haven’t mentioned up until now is the struggle I had with my entertainment system. It simply didn’t work. The flight attendant tried to reset it multiple times, the maitre d’cabin tried to do a hard reset of the system, and then she tried to “send” a movie to my TV. Nothing worked. \nMy entertainment controller was broken, as it said “loading” the entire flight, as did the screen itself. \nSwiss first class seat entertainment controls \nThe crew did everything they could to fix this, and were very apologetic. At one point I said “it’s alright, it’s no big deal,” to which the maitre d’cabin responded “no, no, it’s not alright.” \nUltimately there’s nothing they could do, though. Sometimes technology fails, it’s just unfortunate when it’s on a brand new plane in first class. \nAfter lunch I briefly connected to the wifi. \nSwiss 777 wifi \nAs you can see below, Swiss ordinarily charges for wifi based on data usage, as follows (keep in mind one CHF is roughly one USD): 20MB costs 9CHF 120MB costs 39CHF \nSwiss 777 wifi \nAs a first class passenger I had 50MB of free wifi, which I could access by entering my voucher code. \nSwiss 777 wifi \nUnfortunately 50MB of data lasts me about 15 minutes with decently fast wifi, so I burned through that pretty quickly. \nIt’s unfortunate that Swiss decided to charge for wifi based on usage. Lufthansa, on the other hand, charges a fixed amount per flight, which his much more reasonable. I’d rather have that than to get 50MB of free data on Swiss, which only lasts me a short amount of time. \nEventually I also bought a 120MB data package, which lasted me a bit over 30 minutes. ~$40 for ~30 minutes of wifi? Ouch! On the plus side, at least the wifi was pretty fast, I guess because not many people were using it. \nAfter being up for a bit I asked to have my bed made. Swiss’ bedding is top notch, with an incredible mattress pad, and a blanket that’s both soft and light. \nSwiss first class bed \nAs mentioned above, the seat has a privacy partition. \nSwiss first class privacy partition \nBelow you can see what it looks like on the seat across from me. You could also extend the coat closet for more privacy, though that didn’t occur to me until the end of the flight. \nSwiss first class privacy partition \nThere was also a bottle of water placed at my seat. \nSwiss first class bottled water \nAfter lunch almost all passengers went to sleep, so I found it a bit annoying that the crew left on mood lighting. While I think mood lighting is a great feature in general, most airlines overuse it, in my opinion. I’d much rather have a dark cabin when I’m trying to sleep than mood lighting. \nSwiss 777 mood lighting \nI ended up sleeping for about four hours, and woke up over halfway into our journey. Unfortunately my flight attendant call button was broken, given that it was connected to the entertainment system so I had to go to the galley to order things (which I don’t mind, but I feel bad for the crew, because I feel like I’m invading their privacy). I ordered a coffee, which was good. \nSwiss first class coffee \nI got caught up on work for the next couple of hours (mainly in offline mode, given the cost of wifi). While the service was great during the meal, I was a bit disappointed that the crew didn’t come through the cabin more often between meals, as I rarely saw them. I was also a bit surprised by the lack of snacks between meals. I wasn’t really hungry, but usually on a flight of almost 12 hours you’d have some snacks set up in the galley, or something. Instead there were just chocolates and whole fruit. \nAbout three hours before landing the maitre d’cabin saw that I was awake, and offered me a box of chocolates and a compensation voucher for the entertainment being broken . The offer was for 10,000 Miles & More miles or a 300CHF travel voucher. \nSwiss first class gift for broken entertainment \nAbout two hours before landing the crew came through with the pre-landing snack. Best I could tell there was no printed menu for this, though the flight attendant explained the options, which included a caesar salad, quiche, club sandwich, or burger. I ordered the caesar salad and quiche. Both were very good. \nSwiss pre-landing snack \nI spent the next 30 minutes working a bit more, and finally about 40 minutes before landing at LAX the captain made an announcement informing us that we had begun our descent into Los Angeles, and that we were just passing Las Vegas, which you can see in the below picture. \nView approaching Los Angeles \nAs is the norm when descending into LAX, the views were fantastic. \nView approaching Los Angeles \nWe had some great views of the downtown skyline and the Hollywood sign in the distance as we descended. \nView of downtown Los Angeles \nOn final approach I even saw the famous LAX In-N-Out. \nView on final approach to LAX \nWe had a smooth touchdown on runway 24R at 4:05PM, and from there a 15 minute taxi to our arrival gate. That took a bit longer than usual, given that we taxied from the north of the airport to the south, and then came back around to get to our gate at Tom Bradley International Terminal. That sure is the long way to go. \nWe taxied behind a Norwegian 787 as we approached our gate. \nNorwegian 787 LAX \nWe arrived at our gate at 4:20PM, exactly as scheduled. \nTom Bradley International Terminal LAX \nI bid farewell to the crew and quickly made it through customs and immigration thanks to Global Entry. Swiss 777 first class bottom line \nOverall I was impressed by Swiss first class. The crew, food, amenities, and bed were great. \nAt the same time, there were also some flaws. My entertainment system was broken, which is a big problem on such a long flight. Furthermore, I found the seat design to be unusual, given that the seats are technically fully enclosed, but only when facing the inside of the coat closet. \nThere were also some minor things that could have been a bit better about the product. There were no pajamas. While the pre-landing meal tasted great, it could have been a bit more extensive, with an appetizer and dessert. After all, there were no snacks between meals on this flight, and this is a nearly 12 hour daytime flight. \nSo yes, overall Swiss first class was fantastic, and I’m happy to have had the chance to try it. Is it better than Lufthansa first class , or does it deserve a spot in the world’s top first class products ? Well, I’ll have to put some more thought into that… \nIf you’ve flown Swiss first class (or based on this review), where do you think Swiss belongs on the list of the world’s best first class products?

      "text": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles Pin it Share The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young More By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing <BA.N> develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. It is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus <AIR.PA> faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. Boeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. The WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. It urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. Seizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. They also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. Under the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. CONFIDENT ON APPEAL The European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\". Boeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. They said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. Investors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market. \"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. On paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. Under WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. European officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. In 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. Reblog",

      "text": "A giant autoclave is ready to “cook” parts for the Boeing 777X wings. (Credit: Boeing) In the latest chapter of a years-long legal battle, the World Trade Organization says Washington state’s tax break for production of the Boeing 777X jetliner runs counter to international trade rules .\n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Cecilia Malmström, the European Union’s trade commissioner, said in a statement issued after today’s ruling .\nHowever, U.S. officials and Boeing executives signaled that the battle would continue. The fight over the tax breaks is part of a larger dispute between the Boeing Co. and its European rival, Airbus, with U.S. and EU officials in the middle.\nBoeing’s general counsel, J. Michael Luttig, went so far as to claim that today’s ruling was “a complete victory for the United States, Washington state and Boeing.”\nThe way Luttig saw it, the WTO rejected “virtually every claim made by the EU in this case” and found that Boeing “has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.”\nThe ruling focused on the effect that tax incentives would have once 777X production starts at Boeing’s Everett plant in 2020. The EU complained that Boeing would receive $5.7 billion in subsidies due to the extension of the tax break. But Boeing said the incentives would amount to no more than $50 million a year, or $1 billion through 2040.\nThe WTO said the reduction in Washington state’s business and occupancy tax, known as the B&O tax, violated trade rules because it was contingent on producing the wings and conducting final assembly of the wide-body 777X planes in Washington state. That would constitute an illegal restraint on imports, according to the ruling.\nToday’s ruling is certain to be appealed, just like the other WTO rulings in disputes between Boeing and Airbus. “After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,” Luttig said.\nIn September, the WTO ruled against Airbus in a different dispute involving $22 billion in loan subsidies. If the parallel disputes remain unresolved, there’s a chance that the United States and the European Union could hit each other with billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs.\nBut that’s not likely to happen anytime soon. For now, U.S. trade officials say they’re consulting with Washington state officials on how to proceed. One backup option could be to revise the legislation setting up the tax break, but it’s more likely that the issue will be addressed in a farther-reaching U.S.-European settlement.\n“This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States’ favor,” Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative, said in a statement.",

      "text": "GENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. The Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a long-standing battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesperson Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\n.",

      "text": "Building the IIoT Step-by-Step \nBoeing said it expects the U.S. to appeal the decision. \nAccording to Airbus's own estimates, Washington has given Boeing tax breaks worth $8.7 billion in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040. \nAirbus further claims it has already lost $50 billion in sales as a result of the subsidy regime that gives its arch-rival unfair advantages. \n\"The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State's taxpayers,\" Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said. \n\"This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the U.S .Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behavior,\" he added. \nThe WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line. \nCalling thes ruling \"an important victory for the EU,\" the bloc's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States \"to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.\" \nThe EU has meanwhile also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. \nIn September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programs for Airbus. \nThe WTO did not put a value on those programs but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales, mostly in subsidized loans. \nThe EU has appealed that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had in fact been discontinued. \nMeanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the U.S. remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months. \nCopyright Agence",

      "title": "In new case, WTO rules against state's tax breaks for Boeing 777X plants",
      "text": "SEATTLE -- The World Trade Organization ruled Monday that an extension of a business-tax reduction Washington state granted to Boeing in 2013 for the forthcoming 777X jet is a prohibited subsidy.\nThe term \"prohibited\" signifies the WTO's strictest legal category, denoting a subsidy that cannot be allowed to stand. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, action to remove the subsidy would be required.\nYet even then, in a testament to the excruciating frustration of the WTO process, legal experts on both sides of the case say the outcome will almost certainly leave Boeing's bottom line untouched -- and Washington state's tax coffers none the richer.\n\"You can remove a subsidy in a hundred different ways that don't in any way impact the benefit Boeing might get,\" said Bob Novick, a former general counsel to the U.S. trade representative and now an outside counsel to Boeing on the WTO dispute.\nA lawyer on the European side of the case, who asked not to be identified because he spoke before the ruling is being officially made public, agreed that Boeing, which has a large presence in Washington state, is unlikely to suffer financially.\nMonday's ruling is new. It's a separate case from two original WTO lawsuits: one filed by the U.S. in 2004 over the Airbus \"launch aid\" and a countersuit Europe filed in 2005 over the state tax breaks to Boeing as well as research grants it got from NASA and the Department of Defense.\nThe European lawyer recalled that when the WTO initially ruled in 2010 that government loans to Airbus to launch its A380 superjumbo jet were prohibited subsidies, Boeing crowed about the outcome and demanded that Airbus either repay or restructure the loans.\nThat A380 ruling was reversed on appeal a year later. Now, Boeing's biggest tax break is on the same chopping block.\n\"The tables are turned. Boeing's been tagged,\" said the European lawyer. \"But nothing is actually going to change.\"\nMichael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, agrees.\n\"After any appeal,\" Luttig said, \"we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives.\"\nAnd while an Airbus press release hyped the ruling as \"a knockout blow to Boeing's record-breaking subsidies\" and demanded that the Washington state tax breaks \"be withdrawn immediately,\" Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier conceded that he has \"little faith in the US compliance with the WTO rulings.\"\nThe latest ruling certainly means Boeing and Washington state will have to do something if the ruling withstands appeal.\nThe problem is a clause that was inserted into the 2013 tax-break legislation to protect jobs in the state: It says the extension of the business and occupation tax reduction out to 2040 will be terminated if the state determines \"that any final assembly or wing assembly ... has been sited outside the state of Washington.\"\n\"That's what killed them,\" said the European lawyer.\nThe WTO interpreted that to mean the law expressly favors local production over imports -- the definition of a prohibited subsidy.\nFor example, the 787 Dreamliner's wing was built in Japan, yet this clause would punish Boeing if it outsourced the wing of the 777X.\nOf course, that clause was inserted because of the state's experience in providing similar tax relief to win local assembly of the 787. (There was no similar clause in the 2003 legislation that established the original aerospace tax breaks for the 787.)\nBoeing did build that previous jet in Washington state and took the tax breaks and then five years later decided to put a second 787 assembly plant in South Carolina.\nThe biggest Dreamliner, the forthcoming 787-10 model, will be exclusively built in South Carolina.\nSo next time around, in 2013, state legislators required that, to qualify for the tax breaks, Boeing must build the 777X in Washington state and only Washington state.\nBut that contravened the WTO ban on governmental support that explicitly stipulates work has to be local, and so triggered Monday's ruling.\nIn the 2005 case against the U.S., the trade body ruled the original 2003 tax breaks illegal, requiring some action to fix the adverse effects on Airbus. But they were not found to be \"prohibited\" and so don't have to be withdrawn.\nIn the parallel U.S. case against Airbus at the WTO, the specific loans it used to launch new airplanes were found illegal because the terms of the loans were too favorable. But the appeal process established that they are not \"prohibited.\"\nSo Airbus was required only to fix the terms of those loans. In September, the WTO ruled that it had failed to comply even with that, a finding that Airbus is currently appealing.\nThose original cases have dragged on for more than a decade with no perceptible change in behavior by either of the airplane makers.\nThe new 777X case is in WTO terms a \"fast track\" case because it's narrowly targeted: It pertains only to the Washington state subsidies for the 777X and must determine only if they are prohibited or not.\nBut \"fast track\" is a relative term.\nAfter this initial finding, Boeing will appeal. If it loses on appeal, then there is a compliance phase, then a ruling on whether it has complied, and a potential appeal to that ruling.\nEven if Boeing lost at every step, the process would probably take at least two more years to play out, said Novick, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative.\nStill, it should be over long before the first 777X is due to be delivered in 2020.\nLast year, Boeing saved $106 million from the business and occupation, or B and 0, tax-rate reduction on all its jet programs.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom claimed Monday that the new ruling \"makes illegal\" the B and O tax reduction portion of Washington state's incentive package for all Boeing airplanes delivered through 2040 and estimated the impact at $5.7 billion.\nBoeing came up with a much lower estimate of the maximum potential damage, about $1 billion.\nThat's based on its assessment that the ruling, if it withstands appeal, would affect only 777X deliveries and that the tax reduction would therefore be worth \"no more than $50 million a year\" over 20 years.\nIf Boeing were to lose its appeal at the WTO, and the B&O tax break for the 777X were finally confirmed as \"prohibited,\" $50 million a year is hardly insignificant. Yet Boeing believes there are ways of avoiding any hit to its bottom line at all.\nFor example, Boeing has already built the huge facilities for making the 777X fuselage and wing in the Seattle-area city of Everett. It's spending $1 billion on the composite wing center alone.\n\"The facilities are on the ground. We've spent the money,\" said Ted Austell, Boeing vice president for trade issues.\nThose facts on the ground establish that the state has all the 777X work it asked for. So the Legislature could perhaps choose to excise the incriminating clause from the law and settle for a verbal guarantee that Boeing isn't going to go to another state and build another $1 billion facility -- which wouldn't make economic sense anyway.\nSince 2013, state legislators have been pushing for more accountability from Boeing, not less. But as Austell put it, \"Sometimes governments use these WTO decisions to do what's politically unpalatable.\"\nAustell added that if the state needs job guarantees, Boeing could write those into its labor contracts with the unions. The WTO has no role in adjudicating contracts, only laws.\nThe European lawyer points out one more reason why Boeing doesn't have much to fear.\nThe 2003 agreement between Boeing and the state of Washington that set up the original tax-break regime -- of which the 2013 agreement for 777X was merely an extension -- states that \"in the event of a change in law, or any other act, event or circumstance,\" that would materially diminish the benefit to Boeing, then the state must make the jet maker whole with some other commitment \"having economic effect equivalent\" to the tax breaks.\nGiven that, the European lawyer said that even though Boeing has lost this round, he sees no useful final outcome. Instead, he sees the entire process as damaging all concerned because it highlights for countries like Canada, China and Russia that the WTO rules against government subsidies are toothless.\n\"It only shows the inability of the U.S. and Europe to stand together to defend their traditional place in the market,\" he said.\nHe added that aircraft-manufacturing companies in China are surely paying close attention to the Airbus-Boeing dispute and must enjoy \"watching two kids slugging it out in the sandbox as (they) prepare to take both of their lunch moneys.\"\nIn a statement Monday, Airbus CEO Bregier cited the same competitive threats and said the WTO fight \"will only encourage other aerospace producing countries to feel totally free to subsidize their local industries.\"\nAnd Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders said only some kind of settlement between Europe and the U.S. will hold off that looming competition.\n\"This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ,\" Enders said. \"I continue to think that the only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nYet Boeing for now insists upon its pound of flesh.\nEven though it's just lost this first round in the new 777X case, Boeing won the last round in September in the original case against Airbus, which after a dozen years finally has an endpoint in sight.\nIf Airbus loses its appeal in that recent ruling saying it has not complied with the court's requirements to fix its launch-aid loans, then by the middle of next year the U.S. could be authorized to instigate trade sanctions against the European Union.\nNovick eagerly anticipates that outcome as justifying the long WTO fight.\n\"When the U.S. receives the authorization to take countermeasures, nobody is going to be calling it toothless,\" Novick said.\nOutside experts remain skeptical.\nBainbridge Island-based aviation-industry analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net says a trade war with Europe would hurt not only Airbus and Boeing but U.S. suppliers such as GE, Honeywell and Spirit AeroSystems that supply both plane makers.\nEven with an incoming Trump administration seeming to want to flex its trade-deal muscles, Hamilton said he expects \"common sense will prevail\" and that the WTO process will eventually fizzle out.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed ",

Kuwait confirms plans to buy 28 Boeing F-18 jets \nMilitary official reaffirms warplanes deal 10 days after US State Dep't notified Congress of possible sale By Monday, 28 November 2016 6:20 PM \n(Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images) \nKuwait plans to buy 28 Boeing F-18 Super Hornets, a military official said on Monday, 10 days after the US State Department notified Congress of the possible sale of 40 of the warplanes to the Gulf Arab state. \nMajor General Lafi al-Azmi, chief of the military's Armament and Procurement Authority, also said Kuwait planned to return a number of outdated F-18s in its inventory as part of the purchase deal, the official Kuwait News Agency reported. \nHe added that details of the sale would only be disclosed after it is officially signed. \n\"Given Kuwait's proximity to turbulent locations, we certainly need effective military equipment,\" he was quoted as saying, in apparent reference to wars in Iraq and Syria. \nThe fighter aircraft are increasingly important to Kuwait amid rising regional tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose struggle for regional pre-dominance underpins wars and political tensions across the Middle East. Kuwait, an ally of Saudi Arabia, is also part of a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. \nBoeing, Northrop Grumman Corp, Raytheon Co and General Electric Co are the prime contractors for the proposed sale.",

      "text": "Boeing tax package ruled illegal by WTO Posted: Updated: By CNNMoney Big rumblings are going on at America's airplane capital -- the Boeing Co. aircraft factory north of Seattle. (Credit: From Boeing) SEATTLE - \nThe World Trade Organization ruled Monday that Boeing received an illegal subsidy from Washington state to build its new 777X jetliner there, and the U.S. has 90 days to revoke the subsidy. \nThe ruling was the latest round in the rivalry between plane builders Boeing and Airbus, which both declared the ruling a victory. \nAirbus, which is built by a European Union consortium, called it a \"knockout blow\" to Boeing. Boeing said the WTO \"rejected virtually all of the European Union's challenges.\" \nHowever, legal experts and aerospace executives expect little, if anything, to change in the battle between Boeing and Airbus. \nThe current dispute centers around Washington state's $8.7 billion tax incentive program for Boeing, \nwhich was approved in 2013. That package extended existing tax breaks from 2024 to 2040. \nThe tax break, along with a revised labor agreement with its workers, was key to Boeing's decision to assemble the 777X jet and build its new carbon fiber composite wings in Washington. That jet will be delivered in 2020. \nThe E.U. filed suit in December 2014 and Monday's ruling declared part of tax break package a subsidy prohibited under WTO rules, and ordered Boeing and Washington state to withdraw the tax incentives within 90 days. Both sides agree that is unlikely to happen. \n\"After any appeal,\" said Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, \"we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.\" \nFabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus's jetliner unit, said, \"I have little faith in the U.S. compliance with the WTO rulings.\" \nThe office of the governor of Washington state did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nClaims of illegal subsidies between the two airplane manufacturers date back to 2004 when the U.S. claimed Airbus was receiving illegal subsidies from European governments. Europe counter sued in 2005, alleging Defense Department and NASA projects with Boeing supported its 787 development and represented a similar illegal subsidy. \nThe prospect of sanctions against Airbus under earlier rulings has potentially shifted with the election of businessman Donald Trump as U.S. president. President-elect Trump railed against what he called an unfair trade environment for the U.S. and its businesses. \nAirbus Group chief executive Tom Enders called the back and forth WTO disputes \"ridiculous\" and said a new set of globally applicable rules were warranted to address state support of airplane manufacturing. \nNational, state and local support of aerospace industries is typically the rule, not the exception. \nAlabama gave Airbus a $158 million financial support package to establish a final assembly line for its single-aisle jets in Mobile along the Gulf Coast. \nThe Quebec government earlier this year infused $1 billion in Canadian plane maker Bombardier for a stake in its struggling CSeries jetliner program. China has wholly supported its domestic airliner business to eventually compete with the established players. \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Associated Press Monday, November 28, 2016 comments GENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.",

      "title": "Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state",
      "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state.\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed.\nHere is reaction from Washington state officials:\n—Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement:\nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is.\nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed.\nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world.\n—Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\"\n\"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said.\n—Sen. Reuven Carlyle , a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\"\nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\"\n\"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said.\nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\"",

      "text": "GENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale , referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 2:51 PM Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state The Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story OLYMPIA, Wash. \nThe World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state. \nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed. \nHere is reaction from Washington state officials: \n—Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement: \nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is. \nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed. \nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world. \n—Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\" \n\"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said. \n—Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\" \nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\" \n\"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said. \nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\" Related content",

      "text": "U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nBoeing's 747 jumbo snags a $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso Boeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\n(Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) The ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\nAssociated Press",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 4:51 PM Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state The Associated Press   OLYMPIA, Wash. \nThe World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state. \nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed. \nHere is reaction from Washington state officials: \n—Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement: \nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is. \nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed. \nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world. \n—Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\" \n\"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said. \n—Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\" \nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\" \n\"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said. \nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\" Related content",

WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the US planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. It is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. Boeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. The WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. It urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between US and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. Seizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited – but later watered down on appeal – should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. They also zeroed in on \"programme accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. Under the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. Confident on appeal The European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\". Boeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. They said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark US retaliation within a year. Investors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 per cent, in line with the market. \"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. On paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. Under WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. European officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. In 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.

      "text": "GENEVA (AP) -- U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing&apos;s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday&apos;s ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn&apos;t until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today&apos;s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state&apos;s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers&apos; costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that&apos;s only for the 777X.\"\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state&apos;s economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n---\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n ",

      "title": "WTO Rules Against Boeing in Trade Battle Between U.S. and EU -- 2nd Update",
      "text": "By Robert Wall and Doug Cameron\nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co., determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules.\nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers.\nThe WTO said the U.S. should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, though the U.S. can appeal the ruling.\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.\nBoeing general counsel J. Michael Luttig said the company expected \"every aspect\" of the Washington state incentives to persevere after any appeal.\nThe wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE. The two sides settled a previous disagreement in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage.\nSince then, the U.S. and EU have successfully challenged subsidies to the other's large commercial airplane maker. The case has seen repeated appeals.\nAt stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO's subsidy concerns are addressed. Those tariffs could be placed on goods and services unrelated to aircraft or aircraft parts. The winning side isn't obliged to impose tariffs, and the penalty stage could be delayed again if the EU and U.S. make changes to the way the benefits are provided.\nEach side has accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government assistance, and the two have sparred repeatedly over the value of state aid. The EU said the latest prohibited subsidy that has to be withdrawn immediately amounts to $5.7 billion. The U.S. said the value is $50 million.\n\"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative said.\nThe government is consulting with Washington state representatives to decide how to respond, he said.\nThe tax benefit was conferred for production of the 777X widebody plane, an updated model Boeing is developing. The plane, which can seat more than 400 passengers, is due to enter service around the end of the decade.\nThe WTO in September determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus in an earlier case. Next year it is expected to pass similar judgment on the U.S.\nAirbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders renewed his call or Boeing to return to the negotiating table: \"The only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the U.S. is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nHe said the financial backing being provided to other plane makers in Canada, Russia and Asia made it critical to establish a \"global framework.\"\nBoeing said its position hadn't changed and that it wouldn't engage in talks until the EU had come into compliance with WTO rules.\n--Viktoria Dendrinou contributed to this article.\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 28, 2016 12:43 ET (17:43 ",

      "text": "By Robert Wall and Doug Cameron\nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co., determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules.\nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers.\nThe WTO said the U.S. should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, though the U.S. can appeal the ruling.\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.\nA Boeing official said the company expects an appeal will lead to the WTO's judgment being overturned.\nThe wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE. The two sides settled a previous disagreement in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage.\nSince then, the U.S. and EU have successfully challenged subsidies to the other's large commercial airplane maker. The case has seen repeated appeals.\nAt stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO's subsidy concerns are addressed. Those tariffs could be placed on goods and services unrelated to aircraft or aircraft parts. The winning side isn't obliged to impose tariffs, and the penalty stage could be delayed again if the EU and U.S. make changes to the way the benefits are provided.\nEach side has accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government assistance, and the two have sparred repeatedly over the value of state aid. The EU said the latest prohibited subsidy that has to be withdrawn immediately amounts to $5.7 billion. The U.S. said the value is $50 million.\nThe tax benefit was conferred for production of the 777X widebody plane, an updated model Boeing is developing. The plane, which can seat more than 400 passengers, is due to enter service around the end of the decade.\nThe WTO in September determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus in an earlier case. Next year it is expected to pass similar judgment on the U.S.\nAirbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders renewed his call or Boeing to return to the negotiating table: \"The only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the U.S. is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nHe said the financial backing being provided to other plane makers in Canada, Russia and Asia made it critical to establish a \"global framework.\"\nViktoria Dendrinou contributed to this article.\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 28, 2016 11:14 ET (16:14 ",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 6:22 PM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. Reed Saxon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story GENEVA \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "View Comments Print By -   \nOLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state. \nWhat happens next isn’t entirely clear. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed. \nHere is reaction from Washington state officials: \n-Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement: \nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state’s economic future and it still is. \nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU’s arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed. \nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world. \n-Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus’s complaints about the subsidies are “the pot calling the kettle black.” \n“They’re not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,” he said. \n-Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO “categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union’s case.” \nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state “is pretty modest compared to the central argument.” \n“If that’s the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that’s little league versus the majors in terms of scale,” he said. \nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn’t some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that “the ability to continue to solidify Washington state’s role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.” \n ",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state.\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed.\nHere is reaction from Washington state officials:\n—Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement:\nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is.\nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed.\nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world.\n—Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\"\n\"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said.\n—Sen. Reuven Carlyle , a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\"\nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\"\n\"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said.\nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\"",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support   would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for   Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically with . \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "GENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. The Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.\nRaf Casert And Jamey Keaten, The Associated Press",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US \nPosted 44 minutes ago   RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN, Associated Press \nGENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels. \n ",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Posted: By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

November 28 at 5:09 PM AEROSPACE WTO: Boeing received illegal tax breaks \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a long-standing battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on the condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe E.U. said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation E.U. over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nE.U. Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the E.U. and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020. “Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the E.U. in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \n— Associated Press world ECONOMY OECD raises forecast for global growth \nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development lifted its global growth forecasts for 2017 and predicted expansion in 2018 will reach its fastest pace in half a decade as President-elect Donald Trump’s planned fiscal stimulus will provide a boost to major economies. \nWorld gross domestic product will now expand 3.3 percent next year, up by 0.1 percentage point from September’s forecast, the OECD said in a semiannual report. The Paris-based organization sees the global economy expanding 3.6 percent in 2018, the fastest pace since 2011. \nThe S&P 500 Index has risen to a record high and bond yields have increased since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Trump’s promises of spending on infrastructure as well as tax cuts should lift U.S. demand, spurring investment and boosting overall output once he takes office in January, increases that should also spill over into the rest of the world, according to the OECD. \nForecasts increased for all major economies in 2017. \nThe United States will grow 2.3 percent in 2017 and 3 percent in 2018, while the euro area will expand 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, the OECD predicted. Growth will now be 6.4 percent and 6.1 percent in China and 1 percent and 0.8 percent in Japan, it said. \n— Bloomberg News Also in Business ● Deutsche Lufthansa AG lost a German court bid to prevent pilots from resuming strikes Tuesday in a labor dispute that has caused almost 4,500 flight cancellations this month. The Munich Labor Court denied the airline’s request for an injunction preventing the two-day walkout at the mainline Lufthansa brand, putting the pilots on track for their longest-ever work stoppage at the carrier. The company is appealing, according to a court statement. \n— Bloomberg News Coming Today ● 8:30 a.m.: Commerce Department releases third-quarter gross domestic product. ● 9 a.m.: Standard & Poor’s releases S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices for September and the third quarter. ● 10 a.m.: The Conference Board releases the Consumer Confidence Index for November. \n— From news services",

      "text": "GENEVA â U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nComment on this story Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\nCasert reported from Brussels.",

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.

Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "The US has been given 90 days to drop a special tax exemption for the giant aerospace company Boeing because it amounts to an unlawful subsidy. The World Trade Organization (WTO) made the order after investigating a complaint from the European Union. The tax cut was provided by the state of Washington in 2013 to ensure that wings for Boeing's new 777X jetliner were made only there. The tax cut was \"prohibited\" under its rules, said the WTO. The WTO decided that the measure, giving Boeing a special and very low \"business and occupation\" tax rate, was unlawful because it hinged on the aeroplane company being required to use local rather than imported materials - the wings - which in turn would distort trade. \"The Panel has found that the European Union has demonstrated that the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme... is a subsidy contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods [and is] prohibited,\" said the WTO in its ruling. \"Accordingly, taking into account the nature of the prohibited subsidy found in this dispute, the Panel recommends that the United States withdraw it without delay and within 90 days,\" it added. However an EU complaint about six other tax measures was rejected, although they were still deemed to be subsidies. 'No benefit' Boeing downplayed the impact of the WTO ruling against it. \"In total, the EU claimed that Boeing had received $8.7bn in subsidies. This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totalling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible,\" Boeing said. The aerospace company added: \"The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X (tax) rate incentive, and will not until 2020, because the first airplane will not be delivered until then.\" However the EU Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, adopted a different interpretation of the WTO ruling. Global rules? \"The panel has found that the additional massive subsidies of $5.7bn provided by Washington state to Boeing are strictly illegal,\" she said. \"We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay\". Tom Enders, chief executive of Boeing's big rival Airbus, which in September was on the receiving end of a similar WTO ruling about EU subsidies - a complaint initiated by Boeing - held out an olive branch. \"I continue to think that the only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said. Either side in the Boeing subsidy dispute - the EU or the US - can appeal against the WTO ruling. -BBC ",

      "text": "By Robert Wall and Doug Cameron\nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co., determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules.\nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers.\nThe WTO said the U.S. should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, though the U.S. can appeal the ruling.\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.\nBoeing general counsel J. Michael Luttig said the company expected \"every aspect\" of the Washington state incentives to persevere after any appeal.\nThe wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE. The two sides settled a previous disagreement in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage.\nSince then, the U.S. and EU have successfully challenged subsidies to the other's large commercial airplane maker. The case has seen repeated appeals.\nAt stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO's subsidy concerns are addressed. Those tariffs could be placed on goods and services unrelated to aircraft or aircraft parts. The winning side isn't obliged to impose tariffs, and the penalty stage could be delayed again if the EU and U.S. make changes to the way the benefits are provided.\nEach side has accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government assistance, and the two have sparred repeatedly over the value of state aid. The EU said the latest prohibited subsidy that has to be withdrawn immediately amounts to $5.7 billion. The U.S. said the value is $50 million.\n\"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative said.\nThe government is consulting with Washington state representatives to decide how to respond, he said.\nThe tax benefit was conferred for production of the 777X widebody plane, an updated model Boeing is developing. The plane, which can seat more than 400 passengers, is due to enter service around the end of the decade.\nThe WTO in September determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus in an earlier case. Next year it is expected to pass similar judgment on the U.S.\nAirbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders renewed his call or Boeing to return to the negotiating table: \"The only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the U.S. is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nHe said the financial backing being provided to other plane makers in Canada, Russia and Asia made it critical to establish a \"global framework.\"\nBoeing said its position hadn't changed and that it wouldn't engage in talks until the EU had come into compliance with WTO rules.\n--Viktoria Dendrinou contributed to this article.\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 28, 2016 12:43 ET (17:43 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "World   Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By Raf Casert and Jamey Keaten (Associated Press)  00am FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA — US plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled yesterday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. World   \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the US government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called yesterday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the US company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support US business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing By Reid Wilson - 11/28/16 11:49 AM EST © Getty The World Trade Organization ruled Monday that a huge tax break given to the aerospace giant Boeing by Washington state violates trade agreements between the United States and the European Union. But, in a nuanced decision, the WTO said the improper incentives amounted to just a fraction of what Boeing's main competitors claimed, leaving billions in incentives and credits in place until 2040. ADVERTISEMENT Boeing received the tax breaks in 2013 as part of a negotiation between the company and Washington officials that guaranteed thousands of jobs would stay in the Puget Sound region, where Boeing was founded. The company pledged to keep active a line producing the 777X aircraft in exchange for tax breaks initially valued at $8.7 billion through 2040. The deal amounted to the single largest package of breaks and credits ever given to a company by a state government. The European Union filed a complaint with the WTO in 2014, challenging provisions of the legislation granting breaks to Boeing as a state subsidy that violated international agreements. On Monday, a panel convened by the WTO said it agreed that the tax breaks amounted to a subsidy from Washington's government. The panel also said one provision, which allows Washington to raise taxes on Boeing if the company moves parts of its production line out of state, gave an unfair advantage to domestically produced goods over imported goods. Trade agreements under the WTO do not allow local, state or national laws that favor domestic production over imported goods. But the WTO panel rejected the EU's challenges to six other incentives contained within the original law. Boeing hailed the decision as a \"complete victory.\" Boeing and its main commercial aviation competitor, Airbus, have been engaged in behind-the-scenes wars over government subsidies for more than a decade. Airbus, a France-based group of European defense and aviation firms, fought its own battle with the WTO over loans from the United Kingdom and France in 2010, when the company began producing its A380 jumbo jet. That decision was reversed on appeal. Boeing is likely to appeal Monday's decision as well. \"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said in a statement. If Boeing were to lose on appeal, Washington's legislature would likely be required to amend the initial 2013 law granting the company incentives. But because the WTO ruled against most of the European Union's claims, the vast majority of the tax breaks will be allowed to stand. Most Popular Annoyed Dems dismiss recount as ‘...

      "title": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US",
      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Posted: By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "View Comments \nWASHINGTON: The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the US planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state’s main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world’s largest trade dispute. \nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. \nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between US and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. \nSeizing on previous US. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited – but later watered down on appeal – should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on “program accounting” methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nConfident on appeal \nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid “without delay”. \nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark US retaliation within a year. \nInvestors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market. \n“We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,” Bernstein analysts said in a note. \nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \n- Reuters",

      "text": "WTO Rules Boeing Received Illegal Tax Break WTO Rules Boeing Received Illegal Tax Break Jackie Reddy November 28, 2016 \nThe body deems that this incentive gives Boeing an unfair advantage against overseas aircraft manufacturers, but the company says that it intends to appeal. \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) has determined that aircraft manufacturer Boeing has received an illegal tax break from the state of Washington. It has been reported that the monies were received as part of an $8.7 billion aid package that was used as an incentive to assemble the both the 777X aircraft as well as its wing within the state. \nThis ruling is the latest development in what has become an ongoing point of contention between the European Union (EU) and the U.S. over government subsidies toward the cost of building new craft. \nOn Monday, Bloomberg reported that a WTO panel ruled that, “An incentive cutting a state levy on gross receipts by 40 percent is a prohibited subsidy that must be removed.” The WTO said that the tax break, which will come into effect when the first 777X rolls off the assembly line in 2020, gives the U.S. manufacturer an unfair advantage over overseas manufacturers. \nThe European Commission, the executive body of the EU, also said that Boeing would stand to gain $5.7 from the tax break. The manufacturer protested that it would be gaining only $1 billion in funds. \nCommenting on the findings in a statement , EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said, “Today’s WTO ruling is an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry. The panel has found that the additional massive subsidies of USD 5.7 billion provided by Washington State to Boeing are strictly illegal.” \nShe added, “We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.” \nIt is expected that the U.S. will counter the decision. In a statement , J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, said that “After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate.” \n[Photo: Wolterk/iStock] Click to add a comment \nYou must be logged in on the FORUM to post a comment Login Leave a Reply",

      "text": "• Extends the WTO’s earlier condemnation of massive illegal subsidies to Boeing to 26 billion USD in the form of wholly non-refundable corporate welfare. This is the single largest state-level instance of corporate welfare in US history.\n• The subsidy package condemned by today’s report is large enough to fund the entire development of the 777X and has already cost Airbus $50 billion in sales.\n• This is only the second time in the WTO’s 20+ year history that a country has been found to have provided prohibited subsidies contingent on domestic content.\n28 November 2016 Press Release Today’s report from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Panel (DS487) confirms that the United States has ignored international trade rules by permitting illegal subsidies to Boeing, this time targeted at the 777X aircraft. The Panel found Washington State’s multi-billion dollar subsidy regime for Boeing to include “prohibited” subsidies, which in the Panel’s words belong to “a special category… which Members have deemed to create such trade distortions that they are proscribed,” because they are “specifically designed to affect trade.”\n“The United States and Boeing picked this fight at the WTO, and today’s ruling is yet another blow for that strategy,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus Group. “Those prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn immediately following today’s historic ruling, meaning that Boeing must give up these massive tax subsidies.”\nThis ruling adds to the previous findings by the WTO in 2012 that federal, state, and local governments in the United States are providing huge and WTO-inconsistent subsidies to Boeing (DS353), now mounting up to a total of 26 billion USD of pure grants which Boeing has no plans to repay. “The earlier WTO rulings had already confirmed that B787 was the most highly subsidized aircraft in the history of aviation,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. “Today’s report leaves no doubt that Boeing has gone even further. The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State’s taxpayers. We estimate the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry in the region to be $50 billion so far, and that’s only for the 777X. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) should take immediate action. This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the U.S. Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behavior.”\nAmong those subsidies found to be WTO-inconsistent in 2012 – due to the significant competitive harm caused to Airbus – was the very same Washington State tax incentive regime found today to include a “prohibited” subsidy. “Instead of complying with that 2012 ruling, the United States has doubled-down on illegal conduct,” explained John Harrison, General Counsel, Airbus Group. “By extending the tax incentives through the year 2040, increasing their value by nearly $9 billion, making them available to a new Boeing aircraft, and adding an illegal contingency, the United States and Washington State are further defying WTO compliance.”\nIndustry specialists suggest that the nearly $9 billion in subsidies provided by Washington State is largely sufficient to cover the entire cost of design and production of the 777X, essentially giving Boeing a “free ride” by offsetting entirely the costs of developing and bringing the aircraft to market.\nConsidering today’s ruling, together with the 2012 ruling in the original dispute, Boeing has caused at least $95 billion in commercial harm to Airbus, opening the door to trade sanctions against the US in an equivalent amount. As Harrison explains: “The WTO has for the first time in these disputes identified prohibited subsidies to Boeing for the 777X, condemning as the worst form of trade violation a full aircraft development illegally financed by taxpayer money. And that is supposed to be good for American business and workers? Unlike the loans to Airbus – the interest rates of which were considered in the WTO dispute against the European Union – Boeing plans no repayment of any kind.”\nHarrison added that: “The United States has no other option than to direct that Washington State repeal the legislation or amend it in a way that makes it WTO-compliant. That would obviously take away any incentive to keep producing the 777X in Washington State and it will certainly not benefit Boeing’s balance sheet.” The Panel has declared that the US must end the prohibited subsidy regime in Washington State within 90 days. This is on top of the ongoing US failure to comply with the original WTO ruling against Boeing subsidies - for which the public panel report is expected in the next several months.\nAirbus once again congratulates the European Commission and the Governments of France, Germany, the UK and Spain for their success at the WTO, and is grateful for the years of effort they have invested in setting the record straight.\n“We hope this outcome will lead those at Boeing who advocate continuing this trade dispute to reconsider,” Tom Enders concluded.\nMore on WTO\nRelevant references to the report :\nQuote: s From the DS487 Panel Report\nPara. #\nQuote:\nPurpose Behind Washington State Aerospace Tax Measures\n7.63\n“ The mechanism for achieving the objective of encouraging the aerospace industry [in Washington State] is, in the words of both pieces of [its] legislation, the provision of tax ‘preferences’, ‘exemptions’, and ‘incentives’”.\nFinancial Contribution & Subsidy Findings\n7.157\n“Accordingly, the Panel finds that each aerospace tax measure constitutes a financial contribution [to Boeing] within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1)(ii) of the SCM Agreement because ‘government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected’”.\n7.162\n“For tax-based financial contributions such as the aerospace tax measures, the relief from taxation otherwise due is not generally available to market participants, nor does it exist as a general condition in the marketplace. ... Indeed, the ‘market conditions’ that are relevant as the benchmark in this context are the competitive conditions that exist in the absence of the challenged financial contribution. Judging the conferral of a benefit by reference to such market conditions, it is clear that the financial contributions of foregone government revenue otherwise due from certain Washington State taxpayers – through a reduced tax rate, credits against business taxation, or exemptions from otherwise applicable tax liability – makes the recipients ‘better off’ than they otherwise would have been, in the marketplace, absent those contributions”. (emphasis added)\n7.165\n“Having concluded that there is a financial contribution by the Washington State government under each of the aerospace tax measures at issue, and that a benefit is thereby conferred, the Panel finds that each of the aerospace tax measures at issue constitutes a subsidy within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement”.\nProhibited Subsidy Finding\n7.363\n“[T]he use of imported wings would lead to the loss of the [subsidized] B&O aerospace tax rate. In contrast, if the manufacturer were to use wings made in Washington State by another producer, this would not activate the Second Siting Provision [and therefore would not impact the subsidized tax rate]”.\n7.364\n“In particular, the only decision by Boeing to source wings which it would then ‘use’ in producing the 777X that would not trigger the Second Siting Provision [and the loss of the subsidy] would be to source such wings within Washington State, which by definition would be domestic wings”. (emphasis original)\n7.367\n“The loss of the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme if Boeing used 777X wings produced outside of Washington State, even if it maintained production of such wings in Washington State, makes the B&O aerospace tax rate for that programme contingent upon the use of wings made in Washington State”.\n7.367\n“Accordingly, pursuant to ESSB 5952, and as a result of the Second Siting Provision, the B&O aerospace tax rate subsidy for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme is contingent de facto not only on the production of that aircraft and its wings in Washington State, but additionally on not using 777X wings other than those made in Washington State. Since wings made in Washington State are domestic goods and any imported wings would by definition be made outside of Washington State, it follows that the Second Siting Provision makes the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme contingent upon the use of domestic wings over imported wings”. [MC1]\nConclusions and Recommendations\n8.1(a)\n“Each of the seven aerospace tax measures at issue in the present case constitutes a subsidy within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement”.\n8.1(c)\n“With respect to the First Siting Provision and the Second Siting Provision in ESSB 5952, considered jointly, the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme is a subsidy de facto contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods within the meaning of Article 3.1(b) of the SCM Agreement”.\n8.5\n“The Panel has found that the European Union has demonstrated that the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme, pursuant to ESSB 5952, is a subsidy contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods, prohibited under Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement”.\n8.6\n“Accordingly, taking into account the nature of the prohibited subsidy found in this dispute, the Panel recommends that the United States withdraw it without delay and within 90 days”.\nTags :\nAvailable translations\nLire cet article en français\nL'OMC FRAPPE UN GRAND COUP ET REND UN JUGEMENT HISTORIQUE CONTRE LES SUBVENTIONS RECORDS OCTROYÉES À BOEING Diesen Artikel auf Deutsch lesen\nWTO FÄLLT VERNICHTENDES HISTORISCHES URTEIL ÜBER REKORDSUBVENTIONEN FÜR BOEING Leer este artículo en Español\nLA OMC ASESTA UN GOLPE DECISIVO A LAS EXTRAORDINARIAS SUBVENCIONES DE BOEING CON UN FALLO HISTÓRICO",

      "text": "GENEVA â U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nComment on this story Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\nCasert reported from Brussels.",

Members Sign In Boeing offered illegal tax breaks in US, WTO says By Raf Casert Associated Press November 29, 2016 \nGENEVA — US plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. Advertisement \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to ‘‘prohibited’’ subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on the condition that Boeing keeps production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.

Advertisement \n‘‘We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,’’ said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a ‘‘conservative estimate’’ and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling ‘‘an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.’’ \n‘‘We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,’’ Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the US company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n‘‘Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,’’ Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. ‘‘In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.’’ \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, ‘‘and that’s only for the 777X.’’ \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support US business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the ‘‘prohibited subsidy’’ involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. Loading comments...",

He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.” \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were “the right thing to do for our state’s economic future,” noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "November 29, 2016, 11:18 AM \nBy Associated Press \nGENEVA — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. FILE – In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) | Manila Bulletin \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n“We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,” said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a “conservative estimate” and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.” \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were “the right thing to do for our state’s economic future,” noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.",
