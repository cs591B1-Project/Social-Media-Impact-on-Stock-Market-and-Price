He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)",

He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips) - Reuters",

      "text": "print \nTOKYO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace. \nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies. \nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation . \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years.

      "text": "Business Toyota chief shifts gear, to boost electric vehicle division Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda speaks during their joint news conference with Suzuki Motor Chairman and CEO Osamu Suzuki in Tokyo. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 7:  \nTOKYO - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace. \nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies. \nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years.

The state says the company has added 79 new positions in Indiana since relocating and now has 182 full-time employees. \nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp. offered the company up to $100,000 in performance-based training grants that hinge on fulfillment of the job-creation plans. \nTMHU recently constructed a restaurant-style dining hall, which opened in July, and is now building a new wellness center, the Toyota Recreational Complex. \nTMHU's facility is connected to the plant operated by Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing Inc., where the majority of Toyota forklifts sold in North America are built. \nToyota Forklifts has been the top-selling lift-truck brand in North America since 2002. It generated revenue of $8.2 billion in 2015.",

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor The Japanese automaker is getting serious about its push to launch a pure EV by 2020. \nToyota is forging ahead with its plans to launch a long-range electric vehicle by 2020, installing company president Akio Toyoda as head of the newly-formed electric car division . \nAccording to Automotive News Europe , Toyoda will lead EV planning, along with Toyota’s executive vice presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \nSpokeswoman Kayo Doi said: “By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars. The president will directly oversee the department’s operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.” \nToyota has long led the way in petrol/electric hybrids, launching the Prius in 1997. In recent times it has also been heavily investing in fuel cell vehicles, which resulted in the Mirai that Toyota’s as “the ultimate eco car”. \nBut as many countries around the world, including the United States and China, push manufacturers to produce greater numbers of pure-electric vehicles, Toyota has relented. A research and development team is expected to be in place by the start of next year, with the ambitious target of turning around an EV with a range of at least 186 miles (300 kilometers) within three years. \nPrius chief engineer Koji Toyoshima is also being moved to the EV division, to head the engineering team. He will also join the four-person task force that is being set up to accelerate the development process by engaging in “unconventional work processes”. The rest of the task force will consist of one person from each of the other companies in the Toyota group - Denso Corp., Aisin Seiki Co., and Toyota Industries Corp. \nEarlier this month it was revealed that Toyota is also in discussions with Mazda about collaborating on EV development . According to reports, Toyota would provide its advanced battery technology to Mazda in exchange for Mazda's highly efficient Skyactiv combustion engines.",

      "text": "  \nAn SUV driver fled the scene Wednesday morning after causing a Toyota 4Runner to crash down an embankment off Riverside Drive. \nJust after 8:30 a.m., Sinan Othman was headed to work in downtown Macon when an oncoming SUV veered into his left lane. \nOthman swerved into the right lane, but the white vehicle with gold trim, kept coming toward him. \n“I tried to avoid him... my car started spinning, I went off the edge, flipped a couple of times and I hit that tree,” Othman said, pointing down the wooded embankment. \nAs Othman continued to avoid a collision, his Toyota started spinning and went off the road, down a slope and flipped into a tree. \nOthman could not open the doors or his moonroof, and had to crawl through the SUV to get out the back hatch. \nA scratch on his left elbow and a scraped knuckle was the only visible evidence of the crash. \n“I think I’m really, really lucky,” Othman said after being checked in the ambulance. “I’m a bit shaken, but physically, I feel good. ... Somebody was looking out for me today.” \nBibb sheriff’s Lt. Randy Gonzalez was headed to the office when he drove up on the wreck. \nAn elderly white man was behind the wheel of the vehicle that ventured across the center line, Gonzalez said. \nDeputies are looking for a white SUV, possibly an Expedition or Explorer, with gold trim. \nIts driver narrowly missed other vehicles traveling behind Othman, before continuing north on Riverside. \n“Several of the other drivers that were also hit, stopped to render aid and assist him,” Gonzalez said.

      "text": "View photos\nA view of a Toyota logo on a glass at a dealer in Sao Paulo, Brazil, November 6, 2016. Picture taken November 6, 2016. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker More TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace.\nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies.\nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi.\n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company.\n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\"\nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations.\nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation.\nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles.\nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car.\nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years.\n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)",

      "text": "11/30/2016 Entry Description Columbus – Toyota Material Handling, U.S.A., Inc. (TMHU), a full-line material handling solutions provider of forklifts and related equipment, announced plans to strengthen its workforce in Columbus, creating up to 71 new high-wage jobs by 2019. “Indiana’s economy is built for growing companies like TMHU,” said Governor Mike Pence. “TMHU chose to bring its headquarters here as our state was developing one of the nation’s top climates for job creation, putting Hoosiers at the helm of one of the top businesses in the heavy equipment industry. Today, as TMHU announces that it is adding even more high-wage jobs for Hoosiers, Indiana stands as one of the top-ranked economies in the nation.” TMHU relocated its headquarters from Irvine, California, to Columbus in 2012 after investing $4.6 million to expand its office here. The company has added 79 new positions in Indiana since relocating and is now investing in employee-focused initiatives to further strengthen its workforce. Toyota recently constructed a new restaurant-style dining hall, which opened in July, and is now building a new wellness center, the Toyota Recreational Complex, to provide more health and wellness opportunities to its employees through a basketball court, track, fitness equipment and group exercise classes. TMHU, which currently employs 182 full-time associates, plans to primarily hire for salaried professionals working in a corporate environment. New positions are expected to pay an average salary of more than double the state average wage. Interested applicants may apply online at www.toyotaforklift.com/careers . “Relocating TMHU’s headquarters to Columbus was a great move for us,” said Tracy Stachniak, director of human resources and training and development at TMHU. “Indiana offers a robust economy, Midwest hospitality and an attractive overall lifestyle. It’s a great place to work and live.” TMHU is physically connected to Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. Inc., a zero-landfill manufacturing facility where the majority of Toyota forklifts sold in North America are built. Both operations as well as two additional Toyota sister companies make up Toyota’s 126-acre campus in Columbus, which employs a network of more than 1,400 Hoosiers. Founded in 1967, TMHU is the material handling division of its sister company, Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM). A subsidiary of Japan-based Toyota Industries Corporation, the company manufactures and distributes forklifts, reach trucks, order pickers, pallet jacks, tow tractors and AGVs. TMHU celebrated its 25th anniversary of operating in Indiana just last year, after locating its first North American forklift manufacturing facility in Columbus in 1990. Toyota Forklifts has been the top-selling lift truck brand in North America since 2002, generating revenue of $8.2 billion in 2015 and sales growth of 8.2 percent over 2014.“Columbus, Indiana, is proud to be home to the highest concentration of Japanese investment in Indiana,” said Columbus Mayor Jim Lienhoop. “TMHU and TIEM each have great reputations as being a place that people want to work, and this latest investment further strengthens their standing in and around south central Indiana as being a preferred employer of choice.” Today’s announcement continues a trend of investments from across the Toyota brand of companies in Indiana. In May, Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb joined executives at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton – where it has announced expansions three of the last four years – to celebrate the automaker’s 20th anniversary of assembling cars in southwest Indiana. And in July, auto supplier Toyota Boshoku Indiana announced plans to expand in Indiana, adding 160 new jobs in Princeton this year to produce vehicle seats and doors for the new Toyota Highlander. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation offered TMHU up to $100,000 in performance-based training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. In August, the city of Columbus approved a tax abatement in support of a separate $3 million investment by TIEM. TMHU is the 12th Japanese company just this year to announce job creation plans in Indiana. Together, these companies plan to create more than 900 new Hoosier jobs. Among all states, Indiana has the largest amount of Japanese investment per capita, with more than 53,000 Hoosiers working at upwards of 260 Japan-owned business facilities across the state. ###",

      "text": "Copy this link Reuters \nToyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace. \nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies. Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest auto-maker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi.  ",

The “Classic Man” emcee performed at a pop-up concert at Terminal West in Atlanta.\nWhile at the plush venue, which features high-end lighting and sound, as well as an outdoor roof deck overlooking the historic train tracks of West End, Atlanta, HelloBeautiful sat down with the 31-year-old for an interview.\nDraped in a color-block shirt and khaki pants, Jidenna discussed a number of things, such as his musical influences, his peer group, his goals, and the difference between a good artist and a great artist.\n“Picasso said that good artists copy and great artists steal,” Jidenna noted. “Now to steal is different than copying because when you copy, you’re merely imitating. But when you steal it, you take it and make it your own — this is mine, now we’re going to keep it at my place. So for me, it’s like an absorption process. I mean, when I look at anything, I don’t think I’m the first to do most things. I think we recycle as a people. I’d be hard-pressed to find somebody who invented something that didn’t already exist in some form before you.”\nAs for Jidenna’s musical influences, the Nigerian-American musician said, “I look at Lauryn Hill, Nelly, I look at Travi$ Scott, I look at Young Thug, Drake. There’s a lot of people using melody and rhythm in a way that is interesting.”\nAt the event, which was filled wall-to-wall with fans, Jidenna performed his new hit song, “Little Bit More.” The pop-up concert also featured a first for both HelloBeautiful and Toyota, as they entered into the realm of a virtual reality video experience.\nThis embed is invalid\nToyota Jidenna 15 photos Launch gallery Toyota Jidenna 1.

This is not for me. If it was for me, I’d be in my bedroom and making all the music that I want to hear.”\nIn addition to speaking with HelloBeautiful regarding his art form, Jidenna shared his behind-the-scenes routine prior to any performance.\n“Vocal warmups, body warmups to get myself warm, but the biggest thing is the zone. The zone is beyond all the physical matters.“\nSo exactly what is the zone for the 31-year-old? “For me, it’s imaging the show the way I want it to go [and] prayer with the band always,” he explains.\nLike any artist who prides himself on giving fans his all, Jidenna hopes to transform concertgoers’ lives.\nThis embed is invalid\nToyota Jidenna 15 photos Launch gallery Toyota Jidenna 1.

      "text": "  COLUMBUS, Ind. (Nov. 30, 2016) – Toyota Material Handling, U.S.A., Inc. (TMHU), a full-line material handling solutions provider of forklifts and related equipment, announced plans to strengthen its workforce in Columbus, creating up to 71 new high-wage jobs by 2019. “Indiana’s economy is built for growing companies like TMHU,” said Governor Mike Pence. “TMHU chose to bring its headquarters here as our state was developing one of the nation’s top climates for job creation, putting Hoosiers at the helm of one of the top businesses in the heavy equipment industry. Today, as TMHU announces that it is adding even more high-wage jobs for Hoosiers, Indiana stands as one of the top-ranked economies in the nation.” TMHU relocated its headquarters from Irvine, California, to Columbus in 2012 after investing $4.6 million to expand its office here. The company has added 79 new positions in Indiana since relocating and is now investing in employee-focused initiatives to further strengthen its workforce. Toyota recently constructed a new restaurant-style dining hall, which opened in July, and is now building a new wellness center, the Toyota Recreational Complex, to provide more health and wellness opportunities to its employees through a basketball court, track, fitness equipment and group exercise classes. TMHU, which currently employs 182 full-time associates, plans to primarily hire for salaried professionals working in a corporate environment. New positions are expected to pay an average salary of more than double the state average wage. Interested applicants may apply online at www.toyotaforklift.com/careers . “Relocating TMHU’s headquarters to Columbus was a great move for us,” said Tracy Stachniak, director of human resources and training and development at TMHU. “Indiana offers a robust economy, Midwest hospitality and an attractive overall lifestyle. It’s a great place to work and live.” TMHU is physically connected to Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg. Inc., a zero-landfill manufacturing facility where the majority of Toyota forklifts sold in North America are built. Both operations as well as two additional Toyota sister companies make up Toyota’s 126-acre campus in Columbus, which employs a network of more than 1,400 Hoosiers. Founded in 1967, TMHU is the material handling division of its sister company, Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM). A subsidiary of Japan-based Toyota Industries Corporation, the company manufactures and distributes forklifts, reach trucks, order pickers, pallet jacks, tow tractors and AGVs. TMHU celebrated its 25th anniversary of operating in Indiana just last year, after locating its first North American forklift manufacturing facility in Columbus in 1990. Toyota Forklifts has been the top-selling lift truck brand in North America since 2002, generating revenue of $8.2 billion in 2015 and sales growth of 8.2 percent over 2014.“Columbus, Indiana, is proud to be home to the highest concentration of Japanese investment in Indiana,” said Columbus Mayor Jim Lienhoop. “TMHU and TIEM each have great reputations as being a place that people want to work, and this latest investment further strengthens their standing in and around south central Indiana as being a preferred employer of choice.” Today’s announcement continues a trend of investments from across the Toyota brand of companies in Indiana. In May, Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb joined executives at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton – where it has announced expansions three of the last four years – to celebrate the automaker’s 20th anniversary of assembling cars in southwest Indiana. And in July, auto supplier Toyota Boshoku Indiana announced plans to expand in Indiana, adding 160 new jobs in Princeton this year to produce vehicle seats and doors for the new Toyota Highlander. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation offered TMHU up to $100,000 in performance-based training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. In August, the city of Columbus approved a tax abatement in support of a separate $3 million investment by TIEM. TMHU is the 12th Japanese company just this year to announce job creation plans in Indiana. Together, these companies plan to create more than 900 new Hoosier jobs. Among all states, Indiana has the largest amount of Japanese investment per capita, with more than 53,000 Hoosiers working at upwards of 260 Japan-owned business facilities across the state. About TMHU Proudly manufactured in the United States, Toyota Industrial Equipment offers a full line of material handling solutions including forklifts, automated guided vehicles, fleet management services and tow tractors. Toyota’s commitment to quality, reliability and customer satisfaction, the hallmark of the Toyota Production System, extends throughout more than 220 locations in North America.

About IEDC The Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) leads the state of Indiana’s economic development efforts, focusing on helping companies grow in and locate to the state. Governed by a 12-member board chaired by Governor Mike Pence, the IEDC manages many initiatives, including performance-based tax credits, workforce training grants, public infrastructure assistance and talent attraction and retention efforts.

      "title": "Woman in LA parking lot fight 'repeatedly rammed other vehicle in to flee for her life'",
      "text": "Yaya Shabazz was behind the wheel of the white Toyota SUV seen in a video at the weekend repeatedly ramming another car in South LA She claims the other women ran up the back of her and they all pulled over Women in the BMW attacked her and she smashed into them to escape Both women have now filed police reports saying they were assaulted \nBy Dailymail.com Reporter \nPublished: 09:48 EST, 30 November 2016 | Updated: 11:42 EST, 30 November 2016 \n'They were beating on me': Yaya Shabazz claims she was acting in self defense \nOne of the two women involved in an epic 'demolition derby' fight in South Los Angeles at the weekend claims she was trying to escape the parking lot where the brawl occurred because she feared for her life. \nHorrifying video shows Yaya Shabazz being kicked and hit by two women while lying helplessly on the ground. \nThe casino worker then gets up and starts ramming her white Toyota into a BMW, driven by one of the attackers. \nShabazz claims she slammed into the other vehicle because she wanted to escape the parking lot after the fight. \nShe also believes people wanted to shoot her. \nInitially, Shabazz thought she was pulling into the parking lot to exchange insurance information with the group of women, after a small collision nearby, but the confrontation soon turned violent. \nVideo of the car-smashing showdown between the two SUVs surfaced on Monday after the fight on Sunday. \nShabazz told KTLA that she was attacked by two women after the BMW ran into a stop sign down the street. The cars then pulled into the parking space in the 8400 block of South Western Avenue, where she claims she was set upon. \nVehicular violence: Incredible footage shows two women smashing into each other with their cars after a fight broke out in a parking lot in Los Angeles. Shabazz is in the car on the right \nSmash and run: At the end of the video, the white SUV driven by Shabazz delivers one last blow to the BMW (left) before both cars drive off in opposite directions (right) \n'We had a collision before we made it to the parking lot. They hit me from behind. And I though we were going to pull over the exchange insurance information,' she said. \nHowever, according to Shabazz, the women in the BMW were not interested in talking, with a brawl starting straight away. \n'She pulled me out of the car and they were beating on me,' she said. \nShabazz, a Las Vegas casino worker, said she was alone at the time and in a neighborhood she was not familiar with. She also claims that one of the women had a hammer. \n'I had people yelling at me. I had people saying they were going to shoot me, I had people saying she was going to hit me with a hammer,' she said. \nShabazz mounted the curb and knocked out a fire hydrant as she took off down the street, which she claims was an accident \nGeyser: The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was called to the scene to fix the broken fire hydrant \nThe video shows the woman reverse and then smash into a silver BMW SUV, driven by the woman she was seen fighting moments earlier. \nIt's not long before the Beamer retaliates, and rams with the white SUV as well. \nShabazz claims she was just trying to get out of the car park. \n'The moment i backed up, my back window busted, and I didn't know what it was. I panicked. I freaked,' she said. \nThe cars collided several more times as they maneuver back and forth in the small parking lot. As soon as they appear to be trying to leave the parking space, they run back into each other, causing more damage to their cars. \nFinally the SUVs head into the street, where the white SUV driven by Shabazz is seen delivering one more crunching blow to the silver SUV. \nShabazz then rips past the silver car, severely crushing the passenger door, before knocking out a fire hydrant as the female driver tries to take off down the street. \nShe told KTLA that hitting the fire hydrant was a mistake. \nBrawl: The fight started between a group of women in the parking. The woman on the left is Shabzz, while the woman on the right was the driver of the BMW \nThis iis Yaya Shabazz on the ground, being kicked by another woman \nThe fire hydrant is seen spewing water all over the road and sidewalk as the two cars leave the scene, with the person filming heard commenting: 'Stupid b*",

      "text": "Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda is taking the helm of a battery-powered vehicle project, accelerating the Japanese auto giant's effort to catch up to General Motors Co., Tesla Motors Inc. and Nissan Motor Co. in electric-car development.\nToyota, well-known for its leadership in hybrid vehicles that use batteries to assist conventional engines, has long been skeptical of the pure electric-vehicle market, investing instead in hydrogen fuel-cell research. Mr. Toyoda, who in the past also took over leadership of branding efforts at the Lexus luxury division, will lead a newly formed EV Business Planning Department alongside other executives.\nThe electric push follows Mr. Toyoda's move to boost autonomous-vehicle research efforts with a $1 billion investment and hiring spree in Silicon Valley. The world's largest auto maker in sales and profit, Toyota has considerable financial resources to pour into future engineering projects; meanwhile, its top rival, Volkswagen AG, faces billions of dollars in fines and settlement costs related to emissions-test cheating in the U.S.\nMr. Toyoda, grandson of Toyota's founder, envisions making cars that drive themselves on highways by 2020. Toyota, however, is likely to engineer cars that still keep drivers engaged in the operation of a vehicle—a strategy that departs from Alphabet Inc.'s Google car project.\nWhile Google's pioneering work on autonomous cars has led to a frenzy of investment in driverless-vehicle research, electric-vehicle research also is thriving. Auto makers need to respond to emissions and other regulatory pressures that overshadow the current lack of strong demand for battery-powered vehicles like Nissan's Leaf or BMW AG's i3 small cars.\nEven though Toyota has been more bullish on fuel cells—a technology that is not yet viable despite being under development for decades—the company appeared to have interest in diving into EVs several years ago.\nToyota was an early investor in Tesla, investing $50 million in the company in 2010—well before the launch of Chief Executive Elon Musk's popular Model S electric sedan. Toyota had an agreement to buy batteries from Tesla, but that ended amid disagreements between Messrs. Musk and Toyoda related to the merits of fuel-cell technology compared with batteries.\nToyota still plans to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by 2020, in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. But it faces challenges. Delays in construction of hydrogen refueling stations in California, for instance, are hampering sales of its Mirai fuel-cell car.\nToyota recently said it would set up a new unit to build a battery-powered car and get it to market as quickly as possible. The move comes as sales of the Prius hybrid are declining in the U.S. and regulators in major auto markets around the world are pushing for more pure EVs as a way to lower vehicle emissions in the coming decade.\nElectric vehicles currently represent less than 1% of global light-vehicle market share, but sales are growing due to hefty government subsidies in China, the U.S. and certain European markets, such as Norway. The incentives are particularly rich in China, where sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have soared more than 80% in 2016 to 337,000—just a fraction of the 22-plus million passenger cars likely to be delivered in that market this year.\nOther than Tesla, most auto makers have thus far offered electric cars with limited capabilities. Nissan's Leaf, for instance, can drive about 100 miles on a charge and GM's Chevrolet Volt travels about half that distance before kicking over to a gasoline engine that is also on board.\nConcerns about range, combined with relatively high prices and limited charging infrastructure, have affected demand. The U.S. government's $7,500 EV tax credit is designed to ease those concerns, but with gasoline prices low buyers are flocking to heavier and more capable pickups, sport-utility vehicles and crossover wagons—leaving battery-powered vehicle sales just a sliver of the 17.5 million light vehicles expected to be sold in the U.S. this year.\nGM will launch its 200-mile-range Bolt for $30,000 in California and Oregon next month, but it is unclear when that car will be widely available in the U.S. Volkswagen, Daimler AG and others have recently signaled sizable financial commitments to electrified vehicles, including a $4.5 billion push by Ford Motor Co. through 2020.\nOthers also hope to replicate Tesla's success. Silicon Valley startup Lucid Motors Inc., formerly known at Atieva, said this week it will invest more than $700 million to build an EV factory in Arizona with production is slated to begin in 2018.\nThat follows an ambitious plan by Faraday Future Inc., which is building a factory in Nevada.\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com and John D.

(AP) — Toyota Material Handling plans to hire more workers in Indiana for its business providing forklifts and related equipment. \nThe state announced Wednesday that the plans include creating up to 71 new jobs by 2019 at its facility in Columbus. \nThe business relocated its headquarters from Irvine, California, to Indiana in 2012 after investing $4.6 million to expand its office in Columbus. The state says the company has added 79 new positions in Indiana since relocating and is working to further strengthen its workforce. \nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp. has offered up to $100,000 in performance-based training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. \nToyota recently constructed a restaurant-style dining hall, which opened in July, and is now building a new wellness center, the Toyota Recreational Complex. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE: Quote ) and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. Continued... ",

      "text": "4 hours ago by Mark Kane 12 Comments Toyota i-Road at the 2015 LA Auto Show \nToyota is earnestly starting to believe in the future ofÂ plug-in electric vehicles, and is now starting to play catch-up, as rumors ofÂ anÂ âin-houseâ team to develop all-electric cars Â in a hurry are confirmed. Toyota Prius Prime \nThis month,Â Toyota will establish an in-house venture company – in fact a virtual organization ( independent of other internal structural organizations ) consisting of four persons from: Toyota Industries Corporation Denso Corporation TMC \nHopefully joining technological know-how and resources will result in compelling EVs from Toyota in the next few years, as vehicles like the i-Road (above) not necessarily propositions we were waiting for, more like science fair projects \n“In the development of EVs, the venture company will draw on the technological knowhow and resources of the Toyota Group. Its small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products. \nBased on its thinking to provide the right vehicle at the right place at the right time, TMC has long taken a multi-angled approach to introducing environment-friendly vehicles and has developed hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), EVs and others. It has put special focus on FCVs, which, in terms of cruising range, hydrogen fueling times and other aspects, offer convenience on par with that of current gasoline-powered vehicles, making them, in TMC’s view, ideal as a form of “ultimate eco-car”. \nHowever, differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations. As such, along with its promotion of FCVs, TMC has decided to create a structure that will allow it to commercialize EVs at an early stage, as an alternative means of achieving zero emissions.” Parhaps an electrified Toyota Aygo in the future? \nTMC President Akio Toyoda, commenting on the establishment of the virtual venture company, said: \n“Over these past few years, which we have positioned as years for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future, we have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary and have begun work to established an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets. The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.”",

      "text": "Toyota to launch Prius in second week of January Last Updated: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 13:54 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nToyota's eco-friendly saviour of the planet, the Prius, will kick off its second innings in India with the onset of the new year. Sources close to the Japanese automaker have confirmed a probable launch in the second week of January. The hybrid saloon is a monumental cornerstone in Toyota's journey of being among the world leaders in automobile technology. \nIndia got its first taste of the Prius in 2010, when the hybrid was first unveiled to the masses at the Delhi Auto Expo. Over the years, it had limited takers, thanks to its high sticker price. Dial in the fact that our market isn't as environmentally savvy as a few in the west, and you know the Prius isn't something that will fly off the shelves in India. \nTrivia: The Prius had an exorbitant price tag even in 2010. Ex-showroom prices started at Rs 26.5 lakh! \nToyota isn't hoping it will be a sales blockbuster either. The Prius will be a halo product for the Japanese brand, serving as a reminder of their technological prowess. It draws power from a 1.8-litre petrol motor paired with an electric powerhouse, that pump out 121PS of power put together. The party trick for the Prius has always been fuel-efficiency; which should be around 25kmpl for the new generation. \nWe do not expect the price to be anything close to what we would call affordable, and it is safe to assume an ex-showroom price of around Rs 30 lakh after accounting for the taxes and duties that are levied on fully imported cars. That said, what you get for the price, is the world's best-selling hybrid saloon that is in its best avatar yet. \nThe positioning of the Prius keeps it free from competition, at least in India. The prices are likely to overlap with popular D2 segment sedans such as the Skoda Superb and its own sibling - the Toyota Camry Hybrid. Would you choose the Prius over a conventional big sedan? \nSource: CarDekho.com ",

      "text": "Vehicles like the Toyota Rav4 Hybrid have helped automakers meet increasingly strict fuel economy requirements t some in the industry fear it may harder to keep up in the future. Fuel economy rules put in place by the Obama administration back in 2012 call for cars and SUVs to have much higher fuel economy by 2025. Those rules were supposed to be revisited this year so regulators could, if it was deemed necessary, loosen them up. The EPA announced Wednesday that it doesn't think easing the requirements will be necessary. Auto industry groups say they were caught off guard by the announcement. They had been expecting more time to discuss the matter. \n\"This was totally unexpected,\" said Jared Allen, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealer's Association, said of the announcement. \"Really, really out of the blue.\" \nThe EPA has until April 2018 to make a final determination about changing the requirements. Wednesday's announcement was only a \"Proposed Determination.\" The agency will now take comments from the industry and the public on this proposal, but only until Dec. 30, 2016. \nSome in the industry say the agency may be trying to take a hard stand on fuel economy now before the Trump administration, seen as friendlier to industry, takes over in January. \nDJ Khaled unveils new Ford EcoSport on Snapchat \"My sense is that EPA sees trouble ahead for the idea of continuing to increase emissions standards,\" said Jeremy Anwyl, a long-time auto industry consultant and the CEO of the web site Trucks.com. \"This is their way of getting their position on the record.\" \nThe fuel economy regulations are set and overseen jointly by the National Highway Traffic Administration and the EPA. These two federal agencies also co-ordinate with the California Air Resources Board which sets standards for several states. \nThe EPA regulates emissions including those of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Emissions of carbon dioxide vary with the amount of fuel burned, which is why the EPA is involved with fuel economy standards. \nThe EPA said it has found that, so far, automakers have been able to meet increasing fuel economy standards without making new cars unaffordable. Industry sources counter that was only because automakers had technology at their disposal that could quickly be added to new cars under development but, from here on out, the requirements will rise at a steeper rate and the technologies needed to meet them will become more expensive. \nGloria Berquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said that in an era of low gas prices people have been gravitating to more fuel efficient vehicles. \nWhen these rules were first enacted, all cars and SUVs, combined, had originally been projected to deliver Corporate Average Fuel Economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. With gas prices much lower than had been expected, the EPA has already lowered that projection to 50 and 52.6 miles per gallon by then. The altered projections did not change the underlying requirements. They only reflected the expectation that, with lower gas prices, consumers would tend to buy larger vehicles. \n  6:41 PM ET",

He will head the company’s electric vehicle planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi.\n“By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,” said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company.\n“The president will directly oversee the department’s operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.”\nToyota tm is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division’s engineering team.\nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota’s strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company’s efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. Toyota announced this month its plans to establish the in-house venture company , which will consist of four people. Each member of this in-house venture company will come from a different Toyota company, including Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Denso Corporation, and Toyota Motor Corp.\nToyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit.\nWhy Toyota and Volkswagen Are Investing In Ride-Sharing Apps\nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen vlkay , and Tesla Motors tsla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles.\nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate “green” car.\nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15% greater range and battery life in the next few years.",

      "text": "Your browser does not support iframes. \nIn August, HelloBeautiful and Toyota presented Front Row featuring Jidenna. The “Classic Man” emcee performed at a pop-up concert at Terminal West in Atlanta.\nAt the plush venue, which features high-end lighting and sound, as well as an outdoor roof deck overlooking the historic train tracks of West End, Atlanta, Jidenna shared why he believes his work is a service to music aficionados.\nThe Nigerian-American musician said, “I think of my work as a service to people the same way like a firefighter or a police officer or a judge or sanitation worker or a plumber goes to work and serves the people. This is not for me. If it was for me, I’d be in my bedroom and making all the music that I want to hear.”\nIn addition to speaking with HelloBeautiful regarding his art form, Jidenna shared his behind-the-scenes routine prior to any performance.\n“Vocal warmups, body warmups to get myself warm, but the biggest thing is the zone. The zone is beyond all the physical matters.“\nSo exactly what is the zone for the 31-year-old? “For me, it’s imaging the show the way I want it to go [and] prayer with the band always,” he explains.\nLike any artist who prides himself on giving fans his all, Jidenna hopes to transform concertgoers’ lives.\nThis embed is invalid\n\nToyota Jidenna 15 photos Launch gallery Toyota Jidenna 1.

      "text": "Your browser does not support iframes. \nIn August, HelloBeautiful and Toyota presented Front Row featuring Jidenna. The “Classic Man” emcee performed at a pop-up concert at Terminal West in Atlanta.\nWhile at the plush venue, which features high-end lighting and sound, as well as an outdoor roof deck overlooking the historic train tracks of West End, Atlanta, HelloBeautiful sat down with the 31-year-old for an interview.\nDraped in a color-block shirt and khaki pants, Jidenna discussed a number of things, such as his musical influences, his peer group, his goals, and the difference between a good artist and a great artist.\n“Picasso said that good artists copy and great artists steal,” Jidenna noted. “Now to steal is different than copying because when you copy, you’re merely imitating. But when you steal it, you take it and make it your own — this is mine, now we’re going to keep it at my place. So for me, it’s like an absorption process. I mean, when I look at anything, I don’t think I’m the first to do most things. I think we recycle as a people. I’d be hard-pressed to find somebody who invented something that didn’t already exist in some form before you.”\nAs for Jidenna’s musical influences, the Nigerian-American musician said, “I look at Lauryn Hill, Nelly, I look at Travi$ Scott, I look at Young Thug, Drake. There’s a lot of people using melody and rhythm in a way that is interesting.”\nAt the event, which was filled wall-to-wall with fans, Jidenna performed his new hit song, “Little Bit More.” The pop-up concert also featured a first for both HelloBeautiful and Toyota, as they entered into the realm of a virtual reality video experience.\nThis embed is invalid\n\nToyota Jidenna 15 photos Launch gallery Toyota Jidenna 1.

      "text": "Google Play (Android) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.toyota_ms.TcSpNavi Toyota has been providing T-Probe traffic information-Toyota's proprietary traffic congestion information based on big data collected from vehicles equipped with on-board data communication modules (DCM)-on the paid1 T-Connect smartphone app which suggests routes to avoid traffic congestion (2,500 yen annually).At the same time, the route history map which helps to support relief activities in the event of a disaster has been made available on Toyota's website free-of-charge. This feature is also based on information collected from big data, and displays the vehicle's route history. The route history map is also compatible with smartphones.The newly launched TC Smartphone Navigation app will further improve visibility and operability of the existing navigation function. In addition, the app will display T-Probe traffic information and route history map throughout the driving journey. In order to provide safe and convenient mobility support services to a wide-range of customers, this service will be offered free of charge. The aim is to accumulate customer experience with the daily utilization of these information, where data utilization in the event of a disaster has been enhanced.In addition, aerial photographs of disaster areas2 are made available in the route history map display in the case of large-scale disasters with this new application. Next summer, a navigation route search function which will incorporate the route history map will be added to further strengthen disaster countermeasures.In addition, TC Smartphone Navigation will openly link with various external service providers in the future. As a first step, we will promote linking with services provided by akippa Inc., a parking lot sharing service provider to offer search and reservation services, as well as navigation service to a reserved parking lot. Furthermore, we plan to further link with services developed by Park24 Co., Ltd. in the future.Toyota will continue to improve the TC Smartphone Navigation to support safe, convenient, and an attractive mobility life for our customers.TC Smartphone Navigation featuresToyota's proprietary navigation functionsIn addition to displaying Toyota's proprietary real-time traffic information through T-Probe, the route is guided by easy-to-view maps and easy-to-understand audio, such as enlarged views of intersections, and the reading aloud of the names of intersections.Completely free of chargeUse of the app is completely free, with no basic charges.Link ups with parking lot sharing services. Parking spaces can be reserved from the app.Together with the recent changing environment relating to the usage of vehicles, this is a parking lot sharing service that is being developed for use as a service that allows for the usage at monthly and individual parking lots nationwide.Using a smartphone, the TC Smartphone Navigation will first start to link with search and reservation services that are provided by akippa Inc. In the future, we plan to also link up with services that are being developed by Park24 Co., Ltd.When a disaster occurs, you are able to view the route history map that informs you of the traffic situation at the affected area.The route history map is based on the information which Toyota has gathered from DCM-equipped vehicles, so as to provide useful information for the relief and recovery activities of affected areas. The route history and T-Probe traffic information (congestion) etc. have also been released in real-time.Together with the launch of the new app, we have improved the route history map so as to provide easy-to-understand information in the event of the occurrence of a disaster. In addition to the route history and traffic control information3 that are available during normal conditions, congestion information and aerial photographs of disaster areas can also be displayed in the case of large-scale disasters. It is also possible to select and view the display area when disasters occur in multiple areas.Future improvement of the various functionsIn addition to the parking lot sharing service, we will link up with various service providers in the future.We plan to improve functions with the aim of providing customers with satisfaction that goes beyond driving of their vehicles, which enhances all aspects of their daily lives.Outline of the TC Smartphone Navigation Official Name: TC Smartphone Navigation Development and Operation: Toyota Motor Corporation Provided By: Toyota Media Service Corporation Supported Devices: iPhone, Android Service Area: Japan Supported Language: Japanese Start of Service: December 1, 2016 Pricing: Free (1) Regarding navigation functions of the T-Connect smartphone app, new sales will stop after December 1.(2) Pasco Corporation will provide aerial photographs.(3) Toyota Media Service Corporation provides information from the Japan Road Traffic Information Center (JARTIC) / Vehicle Information and Communication System Center (VICS Center).About ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

This feature is also based on information collected from big data, and displays the vehicle's route history. The route history map is also compatible with smartphones. \nThe newly launched TC Smartphone Navigation app will further improve visibility and operability of the existing navigation function. In addition, the app will display T-Probe traffic information and route history map throughout the driving journey. In order to provide safe and convenient mobility support services to a wide-range of customers, this service will be offered free of charge. The aim is to accumulate customer experience with the daily utilization of these information, where data utilization in the event of a disaster has been enhanced. \nIn addition, aerial photographs of disaster areas2 are made available in the route history map display in the case of large-scale disasters with this new application. Next summer, a navigation route search function which will incorporate the route history map will be added to further strengthen disaster countermeasures. \nIn addition, TC Smartphone Navigation will openly link with various external service providers in the future. As a first step, we will promote linking with services provided by akippa Inc., a parking lot sharing service provider to offer search and reservation services, as well as navigation service to a reserved parking lot.

Parking spaces can be reserved from the app. \nTogether with the recent changing environment relating to the usage of vehicles, this is a parking lot sharing service that is being developed for use as a service that allows for the usage at monthly and individual parking lots nationwide. \nUsing a smartphone, the TC Smartphone Navigation will first start to link with search and reservation services that are provided by akippa Inc. In the future, we plan to also link up with services that are being developed by Park24 Co., Ltd. \nWhen a disaster occurs, you are able to view the route history map that informs you of the traffic situation at the affected area. \nThe route history map is based on the information which Toyota has gathered from DCM-equipped vehicles, so as to provide useful information for the relief and recovery activities of affected areas. The route history and T-Probe traffic information (congestion) etc. have also been released in real-time. \nTogether with the launch of the new app, we have improved the route history map so as to provide easy-to-understand information in the event of the occurrence of a disaster. In addition to the route history and traffic control information3 that are available during normal conditions, congestion information and aerial photographs of disaster areas can also be displayed in the case of large-scale disasters. It is also possible to select and view the display area when disasters occur in multiple areas. \nFuture improvement of the various functions \nIn addition to the parking lot sharing service, we will link up with various service providers in the future. \nWe plan to improve functions with the aim of providing customers with satisfaction that goes beyond driving of their vehicles, which enhances all aspects of their daily lives. \nOutline of the TC Smartphone Navigation Official Name: TC Smartphone Navigation Development and Operation: Toyota Motor Corporation Provided By: Toyota Media Service Corporation Supported Devices: iPhone, Android Service Area: Japan Supported Language: Japanese Start of Service: December 1, 2016 Pricing: Free \n(1) Regarding navigation functions of the T-Connect smartphone app, new sales will stop after December 1.(2) Pasco Corporation will provide aerial photographs.(3) Toyota Media Service Corporation provides information from the Japan Road Traffic Information Center (JARTIC) / Vehicle Information and Communication System Center (VICS Center). \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "  5:38 pm Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda and other top executives will directly oversee the company's newly-formed EV unit .The company recently formed a skunkworks team to bring an electric vehicle to market, but an official statement claimed the initiative was staffed by just four workers. The quartet is said to include single individuals from Toyota Motor and Toyota Industries, along with representatives from suppliers Aisin Seiki and Denso.The initial statements suggested the division may have been exploring electric powertrains as a potential hedge against hydrogen technology and hybrids, however the leadership choices point to a more serious commitment to launching battery-powered vehicles.\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" a Toyota spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters . \"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\"Further reflecting the seriousness of the project, Prius chief engineer Koji Toyoshima has been assigned to lead the EV engineering efforts and join the four-person strategy team.Toyota's hydrogen-powered Mirai has struggled to gain traction as refueling infrastructure remains scant in California and virtually nonexistent in the rest of the country. A $ 349 discount lease program helped spark a surge in sales last month, but the year-to-date total barely surpassed 800 units through the first 10 months of the year. \n ",

      "text": "Toyota Material Handling to hire more workers in Indiana Updated 5:15 am, Wednesday, November 30, 2016 COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) — Toyota Material Handling plans to hire more workers in Indiana for its business providing forklifts and related equipment. The state announced Wednesday that the plans include creating up to 71 new jobs by 2019 at its facility in Columbus. The business relocated its headquarters from Irvine, California, to Indiana in 2012 after investing $4.6 million to expand its office in Columbus. The state says the company has added 79 new positions in Indiana since relocating and is working to further strengthen its workforce. The Indiana Economic Development Corp. has offered up to $100,000 in performance-based training grants based on the company's job creation plans. Toyota recently constructed a restaurant-style dining hall, which opened in July, and is now building a new wellness center, the Toyota Recreational Complex.

      "text": "Toyota CEO Appointed Head of EV Division, Toyota EV Due by 2020 / Home / News / Industry Akio Toyoda, who is the head honcho of Japan’s biggest automaker, happens to be a motorsport enthusiast. He once took a Lexus LF-A prototype racer to the 24h Nurburgring. Be that as it may, Akio isn’t clueless as to what the automotive industry is heading toward. Hence, Toyota’s board of directors appointed Toyoda as the head of the brand’s newborn EV skunkworks. Effective December 1, 2016, the EV Business Planning Department is overseen by Akio Toyoda and three other high-ranking officials within the company: Mitsuhisa Kato, Shigeki Terashi, and Koki Konishi. Important personnel changes at the sub-executive managerial level were also made. Not much is known about what sort of battery-powered EVs Toyota will be working on, save for a deadline: 2020 . According to previous reports, the Aygo city car is a candidate for electrification. But whatever the future may hold, it’s a certainty Toyota won’t settle for that. If the company wants to take on the likes of the next-gen Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model 3, and an upcoming flurry of all-electric vehicles from the Volkswagen Group, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, it needs a cohesive range of electric vehicles. Whatever the future holds, the engineering side of the Toyota EV division is headed by Koji Toyoshima, the chief engineer of the Prius and the Prius Prime . The pressing question is, why did the board of directors appoint Toyota's most talented managers and engineers? To my mind, the answer is simple. Having focused on hybrids and plug-in hybrids, Toyota is very far behind the EV competition. Thus, engineering needs to be top notch is Toyota’s upcoming EV lineup wants to duke it out with the big boys. Regarding managerial roles, Akio Toyoda and the other three higher-ups will enable the EV unit to make haste. With these guys around, the electric vehicle division is sure to deliver its first-ever finished good before the 2020 deadline. Editor's note:",

      "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. today appointed its president to lead the company's newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace.\nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi.\n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company.\n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\"\nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations.\nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius gasoline-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corp.\nThe change comes as the U.S., China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies.\nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co., Volkswagen Group and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles.\nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car.\nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years.",

      "text": "Twitter 0 \nToyota, the Japanese automaker is considering its global hatchback – Toyota Yaris – for the Indian car market. Adding to it, the automaker also plans hybrid versions of its popular cars – Innova, Fortuner & Corolla Altis. If media reports are to be believed, the Etios and Liva hatchback have been failed to live up the company’s expectations in India. With the Toyota Yaris India sub-compact car, the Japanese maker is aiming to compete against Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. \nSpeaking to HT, Akito Tachibana, MD Toyota Kirloskar Motor said that it is very difficult for Toyota to develop India-specific vehicle. He further confirmed that the company would launch the Yaris, but it would be tweaked to suit Indian road conditions. If launched, the sub-compact car will take on the likes of Hyundai Elite i20, Maruti Swift/Baleno and Honda Jazz. Also Read- Toyota Vios Sedan Is Coming To India Toyota Yaris India Launch Date \nThe company has recently updated the Etios & Liva hatchback in India, and both models are expected to continue in the market to at-least 2 years. As far as the launch of the Yaris is concerned, we expect it to go on sale by the end of 2017 or early 2017. A possible debut at 2018 Delhi Auto Expo can’t be ignored. Toyota Yaris India Price (Expected) Minimum Maximum Rs 9 lakh \nTo be positioned against the Hyundai i20 & Maruti Baleno, the Toyota Yaris is expected to be priced in the range of Rs 6 lakh – Rs 9 lakh.

      "text": "Finance Ministry approves state guarantee for Toyota alliance’s Suez wind farm Toyota, Orascom, GD France alliance to sign contracts with Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company in January Jobzella Email \nThe Ministry of Finance approved the government’s guarantee of payment in case of dispute over the establishment of the Gulf of Suez wind farm with a capacity of 250 MW. \nThe plant was agreed to be constructed by the so-called Toyota alliance, consisting of Toyota, Orascom, and GD France. \nBased on the ministry’s decision, the state will be responsible for providing official financial guarantees to pay the companies’ dues if the Ministry of Electricity failed to pay the price of produced energy. Such guarantees are always provided for projects agreed to be implemented by the private sector. \nSources at the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) said that the company has agreed to issue a financial guarantee for the Gulf of Suez wind farm. They added that the alliance was informed by the Ministry of Finance’s decision regarding the financial guarantee and holding arbitration in case of dispute. The sources revealed that the new farm’s contracts will be signed in January 2017. \nLamia Youssef, head of the feed-in-tariff division at EETC, said that the Ministry of Electricity had agreed with the alliance to buy the produced energy at 4.7 cents per kilowatt. \nThe Ministry of Electricity will buy energy produced from the station for 25 years at a price that was agreed upon in accordance with the offer made in the tender. Furthermore, the ministry will sell the produced energy to the distribution companies. \nThe Ministry of Electricity had negotiated with GD France, Toyota, and Orascom after its negotiations with Lekela Power-Actis, which presented the lowest prices, were stalled, because the company did not complete the procedures and requirements announced by the ministry. \nThe ministry seeks to produce 20% of new and renewable energy of the total national electricity grid by 2020, as part of the ministry’s plan to diversify its sources of energy production and sustainable development in the sector. \nThe Ministry of Electricity announced that it would not contract directly with any company to build renewable power plants. Instead, it will propose competitive tenders and the company which offers the lowest prices will win the tender.",

The Rav4 EV has an EPA rated range of 113 miles, and Toyota sold this electric car without a ‘Level 3’ DC quick charging port. Using the standard ‘Level 2’ charging port would require about 5 hours to add 100 miles of range to the battery on a public charging station. So even starting with a full battery, a 400 mile trip would require about 15 hours of charging along the way. This seriously hamstrings the car, keeps it tethered to the garage, and effectively makes it useless for long trips…. unless you have a tremendous amount of patience. \nIn my opinion, an effective EV needs to be able to charge on both standard ‘Level 2’ and DC quick chargers. For the average person Level 2 charging will take care of the bulk of our charging needs for commuting to work and driving around town, while DC quick chargers will be very useful for longer trips and weekend excursions. This post relates an example of how DC quick charging makes traveling in an EV much easier. Editor’s Note: Steve also has a blog where you can learn more about his adventures with the Toyota RAV4 EV ( something of a rarity these days ) – here . \nA Quick Word on Levels for those unfamiliar with charging an EV here’s a quick primer: ‘ Level 1 ‘ charging is when you plug into a 110 volt outlet that you’d normally use for a lamp. Charging my Rav on a 110V outlet adds about 3 miles of driving range per hour of charging, would take over 40 hours to fully charge the battery, or 16 hours just to cover my daily 50 mile roundtrip commute. Nice to have that option, but not surprisingly I don’t use Level 1 charging. ‘ Level 2 ‘ charging uses 200 – 240 volts and up to 40 amps for the Rav4 EV. A typical public charging station provides 208 volts and 30 amps, for about 6 to 7 kW of power. This yields about 20 miles of range per hour of charging, and is perfectly fine for the vast majority of my driving needs: commuting to work, running errands, etc. During a typical work week I charge every other day for 4 or 5 hours on Level 2. Many people who drive EVs charge their cars in the garage overnight while they sleep, so they wake up fully charged and ready to go. ‘ Level 3 ‘ charging, or DC quick charging, comes in various forms. For example, the Nissan Leaf has a CHAdeMO port, the BMW i3 and Chevy Spark have the J1772 Combo port, and Tesla cars have their own proprietary charging port. See the corresponding charging plugs below. DC Plugs \nDC charging stations for CHAdeMO and CCS currently provide a maximum of up to 400 volts and 125 amps, for 50 kW of power. Tesla Superchargers can provide up to 400 volts and 300+ amps for a max 135 kW of power. For a Nissan Leaf with the 24 kWh battery, Level 3 charging can provide about 60 miles of driving range in 30 minutes. \nDC Charging Added to the Rav4 EV \nThe lack of a Level 3 DC charging port on the Rav was a major oversight and a serious limitation. Thankfully, Tony Williams of Quick Charge Power devised a solution to address this shortcoming. Tony sells a CHAdeMO charging port, called JdeMO, that allows Rav4 EV owners to charge their cars on the network of CHAdeMO DC chargers. I purchased JdeMO for my Rav and Tony installed it in September 2015. JdeMO changed everything for me. The 2012 Rav4 EV comes equipped with a ‘Level 2’ charging port that charges the car on AC current at a maximum of 240 volts / 40 amps. That requires roughly 5 or 6 hours to fully charge the battery from empty. Higher power DC current can charge cars much faster. I bought a third party DC charging port, called JdeMO, that was designed, manufactured and installed by Tony Williams of Quick Charge Power. I can now charge at up to 380 volts and 125 amps. MUCH FASTER! \nThe capacity of the battery pack in the RAV4 EV is 41.8 kWh, it’s a bit larger than battery packs in other non-Tesla EVs. As a result the Rav4 EV with JdeMO can hold ~45 kW charge rate for a full 30 minutes charge session. On 125 amp CHAdeMO chargers, over 22 kWh will be sent to my battery pack in 30 minutes, yielding over 80 miles of range (depending on travel conditions – your mileage may vary). A 30 minute DC charge session sent over 22 kWh to my battery pack through the JdeMO port. \nTravelogue: 400 Miles to Monterey and Back \nThe trip to Monterey for me is 180 to 200 miles each way, depending on the route. I drove through Walnut Creek, Pleasanton and San Jose on the way down, and on the way home drove along the coast through Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay to San Francisco, across the Golden Gate Bridge and back to the Central Valley. And let me take a moment here to say that it’s just an absolutely beautiful drive – I highly recommend this road trip for everyone. \nThere were over 30 CHAdeMO charging stations along the route each way, so I had lots and lots of choices for charging spots. Please note that we’re just talking about CHAdeMO charging stations here. If I had included Level 2 charging stations on the map below you’d barely see anything on the map but the green icons that mark the location of Level 2 charging stations. My plan was to stop once on the way down and eat lunch while charging, and to make several short charging stops on the way home while taking in the sights along Route 1. My route as plotted on the Plugshare.com website. CHAdeMO charging stations are indicated by the orange icons. There were over 30 charging stations each way. \nI charged at home before leaving, and started the trip with the battery pack at about 90% state of charge (SOC), ~36 kWh in the pack, and the Guess-O-Meter (GOM) estimating 135 miles of driving range. NOTE 1: For a brief explanation on the GOM, scroll down to the bottom. NOTE 2: I have the MyEV data logger that records SOC at the beginning and end of each trip, as well as mileage and duration of each trip. All data in this post on SOC, mileage and time spent driving were pulled from the data logger. I charged to about 90% at home before starting the trip. My ‘Guess-O-Meter’ estimated 135 miles of driving range and I reset the trip odometer to ‘0’. \nThe first leg was uneventful. After driving 95 miles in 1h:45m my first stop was at Lucky’s in Fremont. This is an EVgo charging station that has 4 dual CHAdeMO/CCS chargers and one level 2 charger. From what I’ve read it’s one of the busiest, non-Tesla charging stations in the US. The chargers are located in a shopping mall complex that has a coffee shop, a grocery store, restaurants and other places to eat or shop. We ate lunch while charging. Nobody was waiting behind me so when my 30 minute charging session finished I charged for an additional 10 minutes while getting the kids back into the car and ready for the next leg. The 40 minute charge sent over 27 kWh to the battery pack, bringing the SOC up from 28% to 90% with the GOM estimating 134 miles of range (see NOTE on the GOM at bottom). After driving 95 miles I charged at Lucky’s DCQC in Fremont with a Leaf and Spark EV. 40 minutes of charging brought my battery pack from 28% to 90% SOC. \nOn the second leg we hit lots of traffic in San Jose, so the 85 mile trip to Monterey took 2h:15m. We arrived in sunny Monterey with about 12 kWh remaining in the pack and the GOM estimating 45 miles of driving range. After driving 180 miles, with one 40 minute DC charge / lunch break, we arrived in Monterey with about 12 kWh in the pack and the GOM estimating over 40 miles of driving range. \nWe checked in to our weekend digs, and could smell the fresh ocean breeze so first thing first we went for a walk on the beach. But enthusiasm for taking a swim was dampened by the 52 degree water, so instead we took in the local culture. We took a walk on the beach and took in the local culture. \nThe next two days we visited the major spots in Monterey: the Mission, the Aquarium, the Presidio, and also spent time wandering around the streets finding good restaurants, cafes, little museums, and a museum housing a permanent collection of over 500 works by Salvadore Dali. We visited the Mission, the Presidio, museums, and what trip to Monterey would be complete without a trip to the aquarium? \nAfter 2 days our short stay in Monterey had come to an end and it was time to head home. I was ready to get back on the road – it’d been a long time since I drove along Route 1 between Monterey and San Francisco and I looked forward to driving that route in an EV. \nMy plan was to leave Monterey with a full charge, and stop in Santa Cruz, Pacifica, and San Rafael for a short charge if needed, and stop anywhere else in between that looked interesting. The planned route was about 200 miles. There is a CHAdeMO charger in Monterey, and I originally planned to use that to start the trip home. But to my surprise I found a public parking garage near the hotel with two Level 2 charging spots that were actually available. So I charged there twice for a total of 6 hours over Saturday and Sunday. This added maybe 30 kWh to the battery and we left Monterey with a full charge. Note: instead of charging for those 6 hours I could have charged at the Monterey CHAdeMO and had way more than enough to get to Santa Cruz. We left Monterey with a full charge and the GOM guessing that we could drive 142 miles. \nThere was lots of traffic on the highway from Monterey to Santa Cruz, so driving 40+ miles took almost 90 minutes. By this time my son needed a bathroom break and I wanted some fresh coffee. So I stopped at the Whole Foods in Santa Cruz and charged for 20 minutes, bringing the SOC back up to 94%, while we took a quick break before getting back on the road. For the next hour the road was clear and driving along Route 1 was amazing like always. We stopped at the Pigeon Point lighthouse, Half Moon Bay, and a few other spots along the way to buy fresh produce and take in the view. Driving an electric car on Route 1? Priceless. \nOur next stop was Pacifica, which was 70 miles from the charger in Santa Cruz. The CHAdeMO charging spot in Pacifica at the Linda Mar shopping center might be my least favorite of those I’ve used, so we didn’t linger. But that 15 minute stop gave us another 11 kWh of energy and brought the battery pack state of charge from 50% up to 75%. \nWe drove through San Francisco, stopped by the old apartment in the Inner Sunset, and continued across the Golden Gate Bridge as sunset approached. Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge heading north out of San Francisco. \nWe pulled in to San Rafeal at dinner time, stopped at a plaza with many shops, stores and restaurants and charged for 25 minutes while having a quick dinner. We arrived in San Rafael with the battery pack at 50% SOC and after the 25 minute DC quick charge added 18 kWh, we left with a 90% SOC and the GOM estimating over 130 miles of driving range. Dinner and electrons in San Rafael. \nFrom San Rafael it was a short 70 mile drive home. We left with the sun at our back and returned to the Central Valley. The last leg on our way home as we venture back into the Central Valley. \nWe arrived home after a great weekend visiting some incredibly beautiful places. We made this 400 mile California road trip in the 2012 Rav4 EV, a pure battery electric car outfitted with a DC charging port – which it should have had from the beginning (I’m looking at you Toyota). \nI’ll conclude this post as I started: An effective EV must be able to charge on both standard ‘Level 2’ and DC quick chargers to be a truly useful car. I’ll probably get push back on that, so yes, Level 2 charging serves the vast majority of our driving needs. But DC quick charging turns a commuter car into a car the average person can use for many more occasions. Gasoline powered cars can’t make long distance trips, or any trips for that matter, without relying on the existing network of gas stations. DC quick charging stations are the gas station of the future. \nADDITIONAL NOTES: \n1. Driving with Children My children are 5 and 7 years old. I bring this up because of some complaints I’ve read about EVs in the past, that their ‘paltry’ range makes them impractical, and that traveling with children in an EV is impossible. I’m pretty sure this particular complaint was lodged by somebody who does not have children. It’s not traveling in an EV that’s hard for children, it’s traveling in any car. True to form my 5 year old son asked if we were there yet 5 minutes after we started the trip…. we hadn’t even left my town! But to finish this point: stopping every 90 minutes or so is actually good for young kids, it’s definitely good for my son who needs a chance to run around, burn off some energy, stretch his legs, take a potty break, and get a snack or bite to eat while we quick charge the car. This refreshes him and makes the trip much easier for me. As the kids get older they’ll probably be ready for longer stretches of driving. By then the 200 mile EVs should be on the market, and hopefully I’ll be driving one of them! \n2. Charging and Driving Summary: \n400 miles; 11h: 15m driving; 1h: 40m DC charging. The 11 hours 15 minutes driving over 400 miles works out to an average speed of 35 MPH, but a good bit of that was sitting in traffic in San Jose on the way down, and then Santa Cruz, and Half Moon Bay on the way back, as well as scenic driving on Route 1, and some slow driving around Monterey and San Francisco. A total of 1 hour 40 minutes charging at 4 CHAdeMO chargers; average charge stop 25 minutes. Started the trip with about 36 kWh in the pack and picked up 67 kWh from DC quick chargers. Charged for 6 hours on a level 2 charger near my hotel in Monterey where I think I picked up another 30 kWh. Got home with 16 kWh remaining in the pack. So: 36+67+30 = 133 kWh -16 kWh still in the pack when we got home = 117 kWh to drive 400 miles . That makes for about 3.4 miles per kWh. Not bad for the 4000 pound Rav and a family of 4. Compared to gas: One gallon of gas has the equivalent of 33.5 kWh of energy, therefore I used the equivalent of 3.5 gallons of gas to drive 400 miles = 114 MPGe. Electric motors are much more efficient than gasoline engines. \n3. Another Way of Summarizing the Trip: 95 miles driving – 40 min stop for DC charge and lunch in Fremont; (+27.3 kWh) 85 miles driving – Arrived in Monterey 6 miles driving around Monterey; 6 hours Level 2 in Monterey public garage (+30 kWh) 41 miles driving – 20 min stop for DC charge and break in Santa Cruz; (+10 kWh) 70 miles driving – 15 min stop for DC charge and break in Pacifica; (+11 kWh) 33 miles driving – 25 min stop for DC charge and dinner in San Rafael; (+18.2 kWh). 70 miles driving – home. \nNOTE: I did not optimize charging time. I could have driven longer on some legs. For example I could have skipped the charging station in Pacifica, but choose charging breaks based on my kids needs. \n4. Costs I charged at EVgo stations on this trip. EVgo has a plan that costs $14.95 per month, plus 10 cents per minute charging. The 100 minutes of charging cost me $10. If I didn’t use CHAdeMO again that month (which I will of course, but lets say I don’t) that would be $24.95 dollars to EVgo, plus $6.50 to PGE for the 36 kWh at home before starting the trip, equals $31.45 to drive 400 miles, or about 7.8 cents per mile. If I had used the CHAdeMO station in Monterey instead of the free public garage that would have been another $3 for a grand total of 34.45 = 8.6 cents per mile, BUT if I had used a CHAdeMO in Davis instead of my garage to start the trip we’d be back down to $31.00 = 7.7 cents per mile. Long story short: DC charging is not too expensive. NOTE: the more I use EVgo chargers each month, the lower the price per mile. \n5. RAV4 EVs with JdeMO There are now over 100 of us driving 2012-2014 Rav4 EVs with the JdeMO port. Some, like Tony, are driving thousands of miles each month powered by JdeMO. My experiences are in no way unique, but I just happen to like sharing! \n6. A Word on the GOM The GOM in the RAV4 EV bases its estimate on your past couple of days driving. I live in the Central Valley where it’s warm and flat, ideal driving conditions for any car in terms of efficiency. That’s why my GOM typically gives estimates that are higher than the EPA rating of 113 miles. I averaged 3.4 miles per kWh on this trip. The EPA rating of 113 miles total driving range is based on averaging 2.7 miles per kWh, which is probably just about right for the average person driving in average conditions around the year.",

      "text": "  9:28am EST November U.S. auto sales seen rising about 4 percent by analysts Toyota Prius automobiles are shown for sale at a dealership in Carlsbad, California, U.S. May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT \nDETROIT Hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said. \nMajor automakers in the U.S. market report sales on Thursday, offering an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ( FCHA.MI )( FCAU.N ) to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14 percent drop from last November. FCA restated its U.S. sales earlier this year, bumping up last November's count by 13,000 vehicles. \nToyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) is expected to outsell Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) by about 8,000 vehicles. Forecasts show Ford sales flat to up 1 percent and Toyota's sales up 3 percent to 5 percent. Usually, Ford is second in U.S. sales behind leader General Motors Co ( GM.N ), and Toyota is generally third. \nGM sales are seen rising between 8 percent and 12 percent. \nIncentives, or discounts on new vehicles, are at historic highs, making some investors wonder whether the auto sales boom will continue. Consumer discounts cut into company profits. \nBut major automakers say that trucks and SUVs, which have higher profit margins, are easily outselling passenger cars, leading to higher overall selling prices. Therefore, the companies are keeping discipline in matching supply with demand, major automakers have said. \n(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",

      "text": "Posted: Dec 1 2016, 8:36am CST | by M. Affan , in News | Cars & Vehicles Toyota to Dedicate an Entire Unit for Making EVs \n  It looks like Toyota has gotten really serious about EVs. \nToyota recently announced that they are going to dedicate a Virtual Organization for electric vehicles. This announcement really is a push towards EVs. Don't Miss: How to Find NES Classic at Target Stores \nWe have heard a lot of announcements from Toyota that were based on the plug-in platform. After that Toyota followed its momentum in building the hydrogen fuel vehicles. \nHowever the hydrogen fuel vehicles introduced by Toyota have failed to gain immense popularity up till now. This would have happened due to the probability of low knowledge of consumers about the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the power associated with it. \nToyota has gained immense popularity in the division of hybrids for sure. Its Toyota Prius has gained a lot of momentum and popularity since its debut many years ago. \nThus it is time for the company to step into the world of EVs as many other companies are investing in this domain too. The new leader who will be leading the EV project of Toyota from front is Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the pioneer of Toyota, according to AutomotiveNews . \nAkio is the CEO of Toyota Motor Corporations since the year 2009. Thus if the CEO is going to lead this EV sun unit then this means that Toyota has certainly gotten serious about the making of electric vehicles. \nKoji Toyoshima, who is the brain behind the engineering side of Toyota Prius Prime is going to be working in the EV development as well. This will be a big step for EV development too. \nToyota has recently announced that they will be introducing hydrogen space in its semi-trucks which shows their dedication to the new modules of energy in upcoming vehicles. Toyota might have to work hard and fast though in order to catch up with other EV building companies. You May Like",

      "text": "9   0 Comments The Chevrolet Volt (foreground) found itself in the Bolt EV’s shadow at the LA Auto Show this month (InsideEVs/Warren M) \nWith 2,531 Chevrolet Volts sold in November, the 53 mile extended range car from GM once again ran away with the best selling plug-in hybrid crown for the month. The result was not only a 27.8% improvement from the 1,980 sold a year ago, but a new 2016 high for the model (previous best was 2,406 sold in July). \nThe impressive result also means that the Volt has now won the “best selling PHEV” title 43 times out in the past 4 years (48 months). Truly a dominant showing. Not since early 2015 has the Volt not been the best selling PHEV in the US (it was bested by the Ford Fusion Energi at the time) \nThe Ford Fusion Energi was actually the last PHEV to wrestle the monthly title away from the Chevy ( in March of 2015 ), but that was due to an odd circumstantial “blip” on the radar more than anything else. \nThe only real threat ever to the Volt’s dominance in the past was the first generation of Prius plug-in , a plug-in hybrid that went out of production in the first half of 2015. \nLooking back as an illustration of the rivalry, when the last gen Prius was still in volume production it outsold the Volt (9,300 – 8,615) for the first six months of 2014, and the 2,692 Toyota sold in May of 2014 is a level that GM has seen not since itself since August of 2013. \nWe mention this because of two reasons: the all new, 2017 Toyota Prius Prime arrived last month in the US in a big way, and, the original Toyota Prius PHV sucked* \nAnd by sucked, we mean big time. Woof! The original 2012 Toyota Plug-In Prius \n\nThe 2017 Prius Prime has more than double the range of the first model ( or quadruple if you are a stickler for EPA figures ) at 25 miles , and has a starting price of just $27,100 (+$850 DST). The new 2017 Toyota Prius Prime is better in every way to the 1st gen…or even the traditional hybrid (other than that token 5th seat thing) \nAnd thanks to the Toyota’s new 8.8 kWh battery, the federal incentive moves from $2,500 in the original plug-in Prius to $4,500 in the Prime….giving the Prime an effective MSRP of $22,600 (+DST), or over $1,000 less than the base hybrid model Prius. Basically, the new plug-in Prius doesn’t suck anymore. \nIn fact, it is superior in almost every way (including price) to the standard Prius. \nAs an illustration of how strong a seller the new Toyota Prius Prime might be, despite only arriving mid-month in limited quantities, 781 were sold…the largest volume “debut month” for any plug-in vehicle. Ever. \nWith those factors in mind, can the 2nd generation Volt that has struggled itself with regaining past sales glory, hold off the Toyota? Perhaps adding to the Volt’s challenge is the arrival of the all-electric, 238 mile Bolt EV at dealerships beside it starting this month. Will the arrives of the Chevrolet Bolt EV (seen here with Motor Trend CoTY hardware) help or hinder Chevrolet Volt sales going forward? (InsideEVs/Tom Moloughney) \nAlso of interest with GM and plug-ins this month: The Cadillac ELR gives way to the CT6 PHV in 2017 *- The Cadillac ELR , which has been out of production ~10 months now, managed to sell 5 copies *- Replacing the ELR this Spring, is the “imported from China” Cadillac CT6 Pluig-In Hybrid , with 30 miles of range and a pricetag starting at $76,090 ( details ) *- The Chevrolet Bolt EV managed to pick up two “Car of the Year” awards from the LA Auto Show in November ( CoTY from Motor Trend and “ Green” CoTY from the Green Car Journal ) , and also a “Top 10” Best Car nod from Car & Driver *- GM also confirmed what every already knew on the roll-out of the Bolt EV: that much like with the 2nd generation Volt, the first all-electric offerings will head to California (and Oregon) first , with the nationwide release sometime thereafter",

      "text": "Toyota Prius automobiles are shown for sale at a dealership in Carlsbad, California Thomson Reuters\nBy Bernie Woodall\nDETROIT (Reuters) - Hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said.\nMajor automakers in the U.S. market report sales on Thursday, offering an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending.\nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales.\nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14 percent drop from last November. FCA restated its U.S. sales earlier this year, bumping up last November's count by 13,000 vehicles.\nToyota Motor Corp is expected to outsell Ford Motor Co by about 8,000 vehicles. Forecasts show Ford sales flat to up 1 percent and Toyota's sales up 3 percent to 5 percent. Usually, Ford is second in U.S. sales behind leader General Motors Co , and Toyota is generally third.\nGM sales are seen rising between 8 percent and 12 percent.\nIncentives, or discounts on new vehicles, are at historic highs, making some investors wonder whether the auto sales boom will continue. Consumer discounts cut into company profits.\nBut major automakers say that trucks and SUVs, which have higher profit margins, are easily outselling passenger cars, leading to higher overall selling prices. Therefore, the companies are keeping discipline in matching supply with demand, major automakers have said.\n(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)\nRead the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

Toyota sold 197,645 vehicles, while Nissan sold 115,136. \n“We expect to see the industry set a new sales record for November,” said Bill Fay, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota brand, in a statement. \nA record November could keep the industry in the mix for possibly breaking the full-year sales record set in 2015 at 17.47 million vehicles. \nAnalysts at Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue Book had projected Toyota November sales increases of 4.4% and 2.9%, respectively. They predicted Nissan increases of 4% and 8.3%. \nToyota's namesake brand recorded a 5.3% increase, while its Lexus luxury brand declined 1%. Nissan's namesake brand roe 8%, while its Infiniti luxury brand rose 3.4%. \nThe industry-wide demise of cars and rise of crossovers, pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles continued for foreign automakers in November. \nNissan's crossovers, trucks and SUVs were up 22.2% for the month, but cars fell 5.5%. For Toyota's flagship brand, car sales declined 6.2%, but the rest of the lineup increased 14.7%. \nStandouts for Nissan included the Rogue crossover, which is one month away from breaking Altima mid-size car's yearly ranking as Nissan's best-selling vehicle. Rogue sales rose 18% to 26,629 units. \nFor Toyota, the Highlander SUV was strong, recording a 66.7% increase to 21,241 vehicles. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .

      "text": "International Business GM, Ford, Toyota post strong November US auto sales Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. Posted 01 Dec 2016 22:30 Updated 01 Dec 2016 23:25 Toyota Prius automobiles are shown for sale at a dealership in Carlsbad, California, U.S. May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake A \nDETROIT: Hefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. “The U.S. auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4 percent, Ford jumped 6.6 percent, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3 percent. \nMarket leader GM's sales rose 10.2 percent to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the U.S. market was nearly US$35,800, about US$4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. \nToyota Motor Corp narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co, by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford sales rose 5 percent, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3 percent gain over the year earlier. \nUsually, Ford is No. 2 in U.S. sales behind and Toyota is third. \nFord said retail sales rose 10 percent as fleet sales fell 9 percent. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8 percent in November. \nNissan Motor Co beat expectations with a 7.5 percent rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14 percent drop from last November. \n(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",

In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4%, Ford jumped 6.6%, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. \nMarket leader GM's sales rose 10.2% to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the US market was nearly US$35,800, about US$4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. \nToyota Motor Corp narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co, by fewer than 100 vehicles.

      "text": "/ Home / News / Rumors Toyota has serious plans regarding electric cars, and it appears that its first model of this kind will be available to the public sometime in 2020 . Toyota’s most recent move in the field of electric cars involves naming its CEO, Akio Toyoda, as the head of the EV division. This may seem like something that is purely administrative, but appointing the company’s CEO to lead a new department is a big move in this industry, especially when considering that the person who was named is leading one of the largest automakers in the world. The most recent appointment in Toyota’s chain of command shows that the Japanese corporation is serious about this field, and the future EV will be more than a “small scale experiment.” All the rumors regarding a future electric model from Toyota point to development based on the Prius . Because the popular hybrid model from Toyota has received an all-new generation recently, it is expected of Toyota to build upon that model when the electric vehicle is concerned. Evidently, Toyota is not going to try to sell an electrified 2016 Prius in 2020, but the platform of the Prius might become the base for the first production EV from Toyota. It is interesting to see Toyota enter this field today. It already markets the world’s first production hydrogen FCV , which is available in multiple markets. Toyota has acknowledged that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles might not take off too soon, so EVs will be made as a safety net, along with the segments that the brand sees “fitting” for this category of vehicle. Toyota’s officials have previously explained that they do not see hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as suitable for crowded cities, where EVs are a better proposition. At the same time, Toyota wants to build an electric car with a generous range, which would enable the user to drive several days with a single charge, while also offering an adequate range for longer distances. Toyota’s first electric car is expected to come with the company’s state-of-the-art battery technology. We are referring to the Lithium-Ion units that are in continuous development, and that should offer more capacity when compared to existing units of the same size. The year 2020 should bring a Toyota electric car in showrooms at an estimated price of $40.000 before any incentives, and with a range of over 372 miles (600 km).

      "text": "Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors posted U.S. sales increases in November as a rise in incentive spending helped nudge the industry back on track toward another record year.\nA 10 percent gain at GM and a 4.3 percent rise at Toyota Motor Corp. marked their strongest advances this year. Nissan Motor Co. climbed 7.5 percent, while Ford Motor Co. ended a four-month skid. The Volkswagen brand soared 24 percent. Fiat Chrysler was the exception among the first companies to report, tumbling 14 percent as fleet deliveries shrank.\nContinued demand for light trucks amid low gasoline prices helped boost automakers’ results, as did two additional selling days compared with November of 2015. Incentive spending last month, including Thanksgiving holiday deals, was up 13 percent vs. a year-earlier but down from October, according to TrueCar data. (See table below.)\nWhen other automakers release results later today, U.S. light-vehicle sales in November are forecast to rise about 3.8 percent from a year earlier, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.\nWhat’s more, November is shaping up to leave the industry in a better position to top last year’s 17.47 million. Sales through October were 0.3 percent behind their year-earlier pace after three straight monthly declines.\nIf the industry manages to eke out an annual gain, 2016 would mark the first time in a century that U.S. sales topped year-earlier levels for seven straight years. Sales rose every year in a nine-year stretch through 1917\nCompany by company \nGM's 10 percent increase reflected increases of 8.1 percent at Chevrolet, 14 percent at GMC, 16 percent at Buick and 14 percent at Cadillac.\nGM said sales to retail customers rose 7.9 percent to 197,609 in November while rental shipments jumped 27 percent.\nVolume dropped at FCA on sharply lower fleet shipments, a 12 percent decline at Jeep and a 47 percent decrease at the Chrysler brand. It was the third straight monthly decline at Jeep.\nDeliveries rose 12 percent at Ram but slipped 21 percent at Dodge and 15 percent at Fiat. FCA said overall retail demand dropped 2 percent and fleet volume was off 42 percent last month.\nSales advanced 7.5 percent at Nissan last month, with deliveries rising 8 percent at the Nissan division and 3.6 percent at Infiniti.\nToyota's corporate increase reflected a 5.3 gain at the Toyota division. Deliveries slipped 1 percent at Lexus.\nHonda Motor Co. ended a three-month losing streak with a 6.5 percent increase.  Honda division volume was up 7.9 percent, offsetting a 5.1 percent decline at Acura.\nFord posted a 5.1 percent rise in November volume. Sales rose 4.5 percent at the Ford division and 19 percent at Lincoln. Ford's retail sales rose 10 percent while fleet shipments dropped 9 percent.\nStrong SAAR \nThe seasonally adjusted, annualized sales rate is projected to remain strong but drop to 17.7 million vehicles, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg. That would be down slightly from this year’s highest rate -- October’s 17.98 million -- and the 18.07 million pace in November 2015, the second-strongest month of last year.\nGM today estimated the November SAAR at 17.9 million units.\nThe early launch of Black Friday sales events helped offset declines in fleet sales in November, said Eric Lyman, TrueCar’s chief industry analyst.\n“The retail sales environment remains strong for new car sales,” Lyman said. “Incentives are also down slightly [from October] as automakers begin to address supply side imbalances with planned reductions in vehicle production.”\nSteady economic and job growth and the recent rise in U.S. equity prices have also encouraged consumers to make big-ticket purchases, analysts say.\nIncentive spending by automakers averaged an estimated $3,475 per vehicle in November, TrueCar estimates.\n‘Plateau’ \nMike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. new-vehicle dealership group, said there is some relief among dealers and automakers now that the presidential election, and the uncertainty that the campaign cast over consumers, is over.\n“I still think we're in a plateau,” Jackson said this week. “There is a point of diminishing returns when whatever you give at the front end in incentives comes off residual values at the back end. We're right at that tipping point.”\nJessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, said luxury vehicles and light-truck demand in December will determine whether the industry hits a new milestone.\n“November sales have the industry well-positioned to set a new annual sales record this year, but a new record is far from guaranteed,” said Caldwell.\n“Expect to see a flood of ads for holiday season sales events in the coming days and weeks, especially for luxury brands, trucks and SUVs. If we see any year-over-year lifts in these segments in December, then it's a good bet that the industry will top last year's record-high sales.\"\nNick Bunkley contributed to this report.",
