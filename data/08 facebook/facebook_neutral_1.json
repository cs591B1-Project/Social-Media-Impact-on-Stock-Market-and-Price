And what was the second time?” \n“You were seriously ill back then, and we had too little money to pay for heart surgery. I went to a surgeon and he carried out an operation for free, as you remember.” \nHenry made a long face. \n“I remember. You saved my life, so, I forgive you.

      "text": "The internet is as open as people make it.\nOften, people limit their Facebook and Twitter circles to likeminded people and only follow certain subreddits, blogs, and news sites, creating an echo chamber of sorts. In a sea of biased content, Wikipedia is one of the few online outlets that strives for neutrality. After 15 years in operation, it’s starting to see results.\nResearchers at Harvard Business School evaluated almost 4,000 articles in Wikipedia’s online database against the same entries in Encyclopedia Brittanica to compare their biases. They focused on English-language articles about US politics, especially controversial topics, that appeared in both outlets in 2012.\n“That is just not a recipe for coming to a conclusion,” Shane Greenstein, one of the study’s authors, said in an interview. “We were surprised that Wikipedia had not flailed, had not fallen apart in the last several years.”\nGreenstein and his co-author Feng Zhu categorized each article as “blue” or “red.” Drawing from research in political science, they identified terms that are idiosyncratic to each party. For instance, political scientists have identified that Democrats were more likely to use phrases such as “war in Iraq,” “civil rights,” and “trade deficit,” while Republicans used phrases such as “economic growth,” “illegal immigration,” and “border security.”\nIn its initial years, Wikipedia’s crowdsourced articles were tinted very blue, slanting more toward Democratic views and displayed greater bias than Britannica.”Wikipedia content, it’s true, starts out as a little bit of a loud Democrat, as I sometimes joke,” said Greenstein. However, with more revisions and more moderators volunteering on the platform, the bias wore away. In fact, the upper quartile of the Wikipedia’s sample had enough revisions that there was no longer any difference in slant and bias from its offline counterpart.\n“In comparison to expert-based knowledge, collective intelligence does not aggravate the bias of online content when articles are substantially revised,” the authors wrote in the paper. “This is consistent with a best-case scenario in which contributors with different ideologies appear to engage in fruitful online conversations with each other, in contrast to findings from offline settings.”\nMore surprisingly, the authors found that the 2.8 million registered volunteer editors who were reviewing the articles also became less biased over time. “You can ask questions like ‘do editors with red tendencies tend to go to red articles or blue articles?'” Greenstein said. “You find a prevalence of opposites attract, and that was striking.” The researchers even identified the political stance for a number of anonymous editors based on their IP locations, and the trend held steadfast.\nWikipedia was not surprised by the study’s findings. “When you have that space of discourse, people who are dedicated to knowledge will come to more balanced perspectives over time,” Juliet Barbara, a representative at the site’s parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, tells Quartz. That’s not to say there aren’t vicious edit wars, but more often, both sides eventually come together.\nIn a bid to keep hateful discourse off the platform, the online knowledge database lays down ground rules . “Wikipedia does not agree on ‘one single truth’ on a topic,” Barbara said. She believes that Wikipedia users are dedicated individuals who make it a point to detect bias and get rid of it. Another equalizing rule is that opinion can’t reside on the platform—everything has to be backed up by reliable sources.\nToday, Wikipedia is less overtly blue or red and instead looks purple with “a slight blue leaning to it,” says Greenstein. Though he hasn’t done such an analysis, he says New York Times editorials would look somewhat similar.",

      "text": "His penis is so big that women only use him for sex Naij.com 17 minutes ago 899 Facebook \nWhen you ask most men, they will tell you how much they wished they were well-endowed but this man would rather have less than he was blessed with. A young man decided to seek advice through a publication. He is worried that, because of his size, women use him only for sex. Please read and don’t forget to share your views. \n“ I am well-known locally for being well endowed – and girls just use me for one-night stands. I am 23. It all began when my ex-girlfriend showed her mates a photo I’d sent to her. It was a stupid thing to do and I bitterly regret it now. I naively thought she would delete it. As soon as the rumours began about my size, girls flocked towards me. \nAt first, all the attention was fantastic. But, in the end, my girlfriend got fed up and it caused the break-up of our relationship. I began sleeping around once I was single but it’s been difficult to keep any girl interested in me after we have slept together. \nREAD ALSO: What women should not do before sex but after it \nThe last girl I met at the gym seemed different. She is 21, didn’t know me and we hit it off. We met a few times on dates. I was determined to do things differently, so we didn’t have sex right away. I thought if I took things slowly she would get to know me and like me for myself, rather than because of my penis size. \nREAD ALSO: 7 things women do when man accidentally see them naked \nI got really close to her and I thought she might be The One but she, too, disappeared after we’d had sex. I have seen all sorts of messages about me and my size that she’s been spreading on social media. I am unsure if women move on so quickly because of my performance in bed or simply because they have used me. \nI am so insecure that I have looked into penis reductions. I am unsure whether or not I’ll ever find love while my manhood remains so big. I used to think my size was an asset but now I wonder if it will wreck my life forever. My biggest fear is that I will end up alone, once all these girls have had their day and moved on to have families with other men .” \nIf you have been in a similar situation or know the solution, please share your experience with the young man.

      "text": "6 mins ago \nThe internet is as open as people make it. \nOften, people limit their Facebook and Twitter circles to likeminded people and only follow certain subreddits, blogs, and news sites, creating an echo chamber of sorts. In a sea of biased content, Wikipedia is one of the few online outlets that strives for neutrality. After 15 years in operation, it’s starting to see results. \nResearchers at Harvard Business School evaluated almost 4,000 articles in Wikipedia’s online database against the same entries in Encyclopedia Brittanica to compare their biases. They focused on English-language articles about US politics, especially controversial topics, that appeared in both outlets in 2012. \n“That is just not a recipe for coming to a conclusion,” Shane Greenstein, one of the study’s authors, said in an interview. “We were surprised that Wikipedia had not flailed, had not fallen apart in the last several years.” \nGreenstein and his co-author Feng Zhu categorized each article as “blue” or “red.” Drawing from research in political science, they identified terms that are idiosyncratic to each party. For instance, political scientists have identified that Democrats were more likely to use phrases such as “war in Iraq,”“civil rights,” and “trade deficit,” while Republicans used phrases such as “economic growth,”“illegal immigration,” and “border security.” \nIn its initial years, Wikipedia’s crowdsourced articles were tinted very blue, slanting more toward Democratic views and displayed greater bias than Britannica.”Wikipedia content, it’s true, starts out as a little bit of a loud Democrat, as I sometimes joke,” said Greenstein. However, with more revisions and more moderators volunteering on the platform, the bias wore away. In fact, the upper quartile of the Wikipedia’s sample had enough revisions that there was no longer any difference in slant and bias from its offline counterpart. \n“In comparison to expert-based knowledge, collective intelligence does not aggravate the bias of online content when articles are substantially revised,” the authors wrote in the paper. “This is consistent with a best-case scenario in which contributors with different ideologies appear to engage in fruitful online conversations with each other, in contrast to findings from offline settings.” \nMore surprisingly, the authors found that the 2.8 million registered volunteer editors who were reviewing the articles also became less biased over time. “You can ask questions like ‘do editors with red tendencies tend to go to red articles or blue articles?'” Greenstein said. “You find a prevalence of opposites attract, and that was striking.” The researchers even identified the political stance for a number of anonymous editors based on their IP locations, and the trend held steadfast. \nWikipedia was not surprised by the study’s findings. “When you have that space of discourse, people who are dedicated to knowledge will come to more balanced perspectives over time,” Juliet Barbara, a representative at the site’s parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, tells Quartz. That’s not to say there aren’t vicious edit wars, but more often, both sides eventually come together. \nIn a bid to keep hateful discourse off the platform, the online knowledge database lays down ground rules . “Wikipedia does not agree on ‘one single truth’ on a topic,” Barbara said. She believes that Wikipedia users are dedicated individuals who make it a point to detect bias and get rid of it. Another equalizing rule is that opinion can’t reside on the platform—everything has to be backed up by reliable sources. \nToday, Wikipedia is less overtly blue or red and instead looks purple with “a slight blue leaning to it,” says Greenstein. Though he hasn’t done such an analysis, he says New York Times editorials would look somewhat similar. Read full story",

Just horrible.\n‘You have not responded to previous sentences. If you were an older man than you are, I would be thinking five years for assaulting this girl in this cowardly fashion.\nTeacher suspended after telling door staff ‘my dad own’s your f**king ass’ ‘You are dealing with a younger person, and some of the offending was in front of a child who at the time was between two and three years old.’\nBrackpool admitted three counts of assault by beating, one count of causing actual bodily harm and one count of causing a person fear and distress through harassment, and was jailed for 32 months.\nThe judge also handed him an indefinite restraining order.",

      "title": "Pacquiao vs Vargas: Manny Pacquiao Wins By a Landslide!",
      "text": "November 6th,   \"Pacquiao vs Vargas: Manny Pacquiao Wins By a Landslide!\" Facebook \nBill Dwyre * — While most senators around the world, in every country where there is that kind of government, were home on their couches Saturday night, making sure to take their pain pills and Geritol, the Honorable Manny Pacquiao was beating up a guy in Las Vegas. \nPacquiao, who retired from boxing for a while so he could learn the ropes of governing, is back. He has won a record eight division titles in his now 59-6-2 career, and has now won the won the World Boxing Organization (WBO) welterweight title for a third time. His victim this time was young titleholder Jessie Vargas, who talked a good game with his new trainer, Dewey Cooper, but could not match the speed and fire power of a man 10 years his senior and five inches shorter. \nWith the exception of the unbeaten Floyd Mayweather Jr., who beat Pacquiao handily, and Juan Manuel Márquez, who caught him with a great punch, recent history against Pacquaio was repeated. Before a crowd of 16,132 in the Thomas & Mack Center, Pacquiao handled the 27-year-old Vargas as he has handled so many over the years. \nHe was faster and quicker and more elusive. In the second round, he caught Vargas with one of his classic left hooks and put him down. Vargas, who called that one “a flash knockdown,” went down two more times in the fight, but both were ruled slips, even though Vargas touched his glove to the canvas on one and his knee the second time. \nVargas fought valiantly, but by the fifth round, his face was puffy and his right eye was starting to close and, is so often the case against Pacquiao, he seemed mystified. Fighting Pacquiao is a little like walking into a room full of diving bats. They come from all angles and never stop. \n“This fight was like playing a game of chess,” Vargas said. “He was very sharp and very fast.” \nAnd this came as a surprise? \nIn the run-up to the fight, Vargas and his new trainer spoke loudly and carried big sticks. But all too often, Pacquiao opponents talk big and leave beaten. \nAfterward, trainer Dewey Cooper, a former UNLV football player and kickboxing champion, said, “Let’s give credit to Pacquiao. This just adds to his incredible achievements.” \nA disappointed Vargas was also dignified in defeat. \n“His speed surprised me,” he said. “The knockdown in the second round woke me up. \n“I apologize to my fans if I let them down. But fighting Manny Pacquiao has elevated my game.” \nThe unanimous decision was tainted a bit by the 114-113 score from veteran and usually reliable Dave Moretti. The other two judges had it 118-109, or 10 rounds to 2. Moretti gave Vargas five of the first six rounds (10 points a round) and had to give him eight points for the second round because of the knockdown. He also gave him the 12th round, meaning he had the fight a draw had not Pacquiao knocked down Vargas in the second. \nNot uncharacteristically, Top Rank Boxing’s chief executive Bob Arum, who never minces words, said that judging such as that should disqualify that judge from future fights. \nArum also criticized the judging in the loss of another Filipino veteran, Nonito Donaire, who was upset by unbeaten Las Vegas challenger, Jessie Magdaleno, in a WBO junior featherweight title fight. One judge had Donaire winning just two rounds. Donaire said afterward he not only was stunned that he didn’t get the decision, but it never occurred to him afterward that he wouldn’t. \nThe two other judges had it a closer 116-112 for Magdaleno. \nIn the other two undercard title fights, China’s Olympic star, Zou Shiming, showed some dazzling speed and won a unanimous decision and a WBO flyweight title over Thailand’s Prasitak Phaprom, and Mexico’s Óscar Valdez continued his march toward stardom and main events spots with a seventh-round knockdown of Japan’s Hiroshige Osawa. It was Valdez’s first defense of his WBO featherweight title. \nNow, literally and figuratively, the beat goes on for the Senator from the Philippines. \nThe hot topic of discussion before the fight was how in the world Pacquiao could make every senate session and every important committee meeting (he is on 15 committees), while properly preparing for a fight. Now, that being proven as no problem, the discussion moves to that which always keeps the motors running in boxing. \nWho is next? \nPacquiao, who uncharacteristically did not meet the press afterward — he was getting 16 stitches in his head for a late-round head butt — teased the media by inviting Mayweather to the fight. The unbeaten and retired (cough, cough) Mayweather sat ringside, attracted lots of attention and, by his very presence, stirred the pot that they will fight again. Pacquiao never commits to anything or anybody after a fight, deflecting all that to Arum. But that sort of multi-million-dollar extravaganza, even when it failed badly in aesthetics the first time with a lopsided Mayweather victory and a shoulder injury in mid-match by Pacquiao, may be on the horizon again. \nIt is boxing. You won’t know for sure until you show up at the arena and the lights are turned on. \nFor senator Pacquiao, it was a great night. He showed up in the U.S. a couple of weeks ago, looking delighted that he had figured out how to handle both jobs. And now, he will fly home Sunday and throw some verbal punches on the senate floor, when sessions resume Tuesday. \nIn was also a great night for Pacquiao’s promoter, Arum, who was presented with several intriguing possibilities for big future paydays for himself and Pacquiao. His biggest meal ticket, recently retired, is back out there again. \nFor this one, Pacquiao took home $4 million — before pay-per-view revenue comes in. Half of that will likely go to the poor and needy in his country. \nThe only loser on the Pacquiao team was trainer Freddie Roach, who had a $100 win-by-knockout ticket on his fighter from a Vegas sports book. Somehow, we think Roach will be fine. Share the post \"Pacquiao vs Vargas: Manny Pacquiao Wins By a Landslide!\"",

      "text": "California woman who sold food as part of community Facebook group facing possible jail time Calif. woman who sold food on Facebook facing possible jail time NEW  17 PM \nA California woman faces possible jail time for selling her homemade ceviche through a community food group on Facebook, according to a report. \nAn undercover investigator caught Stockton single mom Mariza Ruelas selling the classic Latin American seafood dish by requesting a batch through the group, according to court documents obtained by KTXL-TV . Ruelas called the investigation “a waste of time and resources” in a Facebook post Friday. \nProsecutors said she violated state law by selling food prepared in a facility not subjected to inspections. Ruelas told the TV station she was just participating in a group called “209 Food Spot” which organized potlucks, recipe-sharing and occasional small sales among the members. \n“It was just, like, unreal that they were saying that you could face up to a year in jail,” Ruelas said. \nFacebook launches new food delivery service \nRuelas said she refused an offer by San Joaquin County prosecutors of three years of probation if she agreed to plead guilty to one of the charges. She expects to stand trial soon on the misdemeanor rap of operating a food facility and engaging in business without permits. Mariza Ruelas told a local TV station she simply sold some food occasionally through a community Facebook group out of Stockton, Calif., called \"209 Food Spot.\" (fox40) \nCounty authorities filed the same charges against nearly a dozen other members of the group, which took its name from the area code for the Bay Area suburb. The undercover county investigator reached out to Ruelas Dec. 3 for what the court documents spelled “cevechi.” \nA voicemail reached Sunday morning in the office of the San Joaquin County District Attorney said no one was available until its regular business hours the following day. \n“I don’t make the laws, I enforce them. And the legislature has felt that this is a crime,” San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Kelly McDaniel told the TV station . “Food prepared in a facility that is not inspected creates a risk to the public.” \nOhio cop given counseling after racially charged Facebook post \nMcDaniel said investigators sent the group a warning before moving toward enforcing the law. Yet Ruelas wrote on Facebook that the District Attorney’s Office had not posted any warnings to the group. Court documents revealed that an undercover investigator had contacted Ruelas Dec. 3 to request a purchase of Ruelas' homemade ceviche. (fox40) \nShe said other people charged in the sting did agree to plea deals, but they were different from the one she turned down. Her proposed plea bargain carried a longer term than those of the others, as well as 80 hours of community service and a $235 fine, she said. \nRuelas explained the situation to a commenter who asked if she could simply buy a permit to sell food like her ceviche, which she serves with shrimp, onions, lime and an avocado over a tortilla. \n“It was just some cooking me and my daughters would do for fun on a weekend we didn't have anything to do,” Ruelas replied. \n“Never tried to be in business. Never tried making an extreme amount of money. I just enjoy cooking. Not something I want to do daily lol or even weekly.”  ",

I enforce them. And, the legislature has felt that this is a crime,” said San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Kelly McDaniel.\nShe said selling any food not subject to health department inspection puts whoever eats it in real danger, not to mention it undercuts business owners who do get permits to make their food.\nShe said the 209 Food Spot Facebook group was sent a warning before charges were handed down.\n\"Food prepared in a facility that does not inspect it creates a risk to the public,” McDaniel said.\nWithout a father in their life, Reulas said the thought of having to leave her kids scares her.\nEvery court appearance takes a toll on her youngest son, 6-year-old Justice.\n\"The night before, he always asks like 'Are you going to come back?'” Reulas said.\nOf the people charged, Reulas is the only one whose case is headed to trial because she was the only person charged who refused to accept a plea from the district attorney.",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 05, 2016 If newly created metallic hydrogen stays stable when brought back to regular pressure as predicted by theory then eventually the world will radically change Twitter On October 5th 2016, Ranga Dias and Isaac F. Silvera of Lyman Laboratory of Physics, Harvard University released the first experimental evidence that solid metallic hydrogen has been synthesized in the laboratory. It took 495 GPa pressure to create. The sample is being held in the cryostat in liquid nitrogen. If as predicted by theory the metallic hydrogen remains metastable when the extreme pressure is removed then the world will eventually be greatly changed. Even if the metallic hydrogen had to be kept at liquid nitrogen temperatures, it could still be handled and used for the expected amazing properties. Researchers have ideas on how electron injection could reduce the pressure needed to initially create the metallic hydrogen. Then the engineering challenge will be creating enough of the metallic hydrogen for applications. But the key is having it exist after the pressure is taken off. If as predicted by theory the metallic hydrogen is a room temperature superconductor [and the pressure was not needed] then even relatively small amounts [kilograms per week] of the metallic hydrogen would have very useful applications. Picture of the tiny amount of metallic hydrogen created in the lab Superconductors can make engines smaller and more powerful. Room temperature superconductors would be easier to handle than superconductors that need to be cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperatures. Ceramic superconductors have had a lot of problems for applications because of brittleness and other issues. Room temperature metal superconductors with very high critical current could make superstrong magnets. Powerful magnets could be used to solve challenges getting to commercial energy generation from nuclear fusion.",

      "text": "Worried about your privacy on Facebook? You should be, if this is the future of insurance [OPINION] November 6th, 2016 Science \nCharlie Brooker’s Black Mirror has virtually predicted the future, once again. \nThe ongoing TV series by the British writer takes a dark and often cynical view of 21st-century living. It particularly focuses on the dangers of rapidly advancing technologies and our reliance on social media and the internet. The programme rose to prominence and became a source of regular discussion following its eerie prediction of 2015’s ‘Piggate’– as portrayed in the first ever episode , ‘The National Anthem’. The storyline aired in 2011, four years before the scandal broke . Life imitating Art \nIt’s not the only time Black Mirror has portrayed events with curious similarity. Episode one of the new series, Nosedive, predicted a world where social media interactions and public profile directly decide everything about our lives. Including the opportunities and services we receive on a daily basis. \nSkip forward a couple of weeks and one of the UK’s largest car insurers, Admiral , has revealed it’s ‘trialling’ an application that decides the insurance premiums of first-time car owners, based upon analysis of their Facebook profiles. The controversial scheme was given the fairly nontransparent name of ‘firstcarquote’. Admiral described it as “a new way of getting fair insurance for young drivers”. Algorithms that decide how much you pay \nThe Admiral website explained: \nWe’ll look at your Facebook profile to help us get a better understanding of the type of driver you are. There’s a proven link between personality and how people drive, and our clever technology allows us to predict who is likely to be a safe driver. \nIt’s a worrying precedent. We already live in a world where corporate aspirations frequently infringe upon the rights of citizens; where democratic opposition and peaceful demonstrations are often quashed with brute force, or simply ignored. Many service providers hold a monopoly or ‘captive audience’, providing products we legally have to purchase. It seems unthinkable that basic living costs could be calculated through social evaluations by the very companies that will profit. Whether decided by the opinion of an employee, or an algorithm the company has specifically designed behind closed doors, the huge potential for abuse cannot be ignored. Certainly, were the UK ever to move to a privatised American-style insurance based healthcare system, the severity of such profiling could well be the difference between life and death. \nAccording to Graham Ruddick, writing for The Guardian , Admiral’s surveillance didn’t include personal photos. But countless apps, shops and service providers allow users to register an account quickly and easily by logging in with a Facebook profile. And once we’ve granted them access, we often forget about them. They don’t forget about us. They’re there, peeking at our lives through the window we’ve left open. Big Brother is watching \nThe insurance and financial industries already profile their customers, adjusting their prices with impunity. The car insurance industry has gone a step further; several companies have introduced the equivalent of an aeroplane ‘black box’ to monitor and silently police drivers. But now, an industry leader seeks access and analysis of our personal likes and interests – the films and music we like, the social events we attend, our choice of language, even our political affiliations. Is that not a step too far? One cannot help but draw comparison to the bleak and dystopian future predicted by George Orwell’s novel 1984 . In that world, the police state sees everything and conformity is a necessity for survival. \nSome companies already trawl through the online activity of employees, as a means to inform recruitment and disciplinary procedures. A man recently lost his job for ‘liking’ a photograph on Facebook. Invasion of online privacy also became an issue in the recently attempted Labour leadership coup. Party officials cited the opinions and online profiles of countless, mostly Corbyn supporting, members to justify exclusion. Many strange examples came to light, but none more bizarre than that of Catherine Starr. She lost her membership allegedly because she publicly posted: “I f**king love the Foo Fighters”. It’s already happening \nAs grotesque as the idea of ‘social scoring’ depicted in Black Mirror might seem to liberal Western audiences, China is in fact already in the process of enacting something similar with its Social Credit Scheme (SCS). A report for The New Scientist by Hal Hodson claims: \nWhere you go, what you buy, who you know, how many points are on your driving licence, how your pupils rate you. These are just a few of the measures which the Chinese government plans to use to give scores to all its citizens. \nRogier Creemers, a student of Chinese media policy and political change at Oxford University commented : \nAll behaviour will be integrated into one comprehensive assessment of you as a person, which will then be used to make you eligible or ineligible for certain jobs, or social services. \nIt’s a terrifying prospect, particularly for the world’s largest contiguous population. You cannot help but wonder how the nation’s many ‘undesirables’ will fare in a system so deliberately tipped against them. Facebook – protecting the rights of its users? \nIn this instance, Facebook has ruled that Admiral’s use of private data would be a breach of its privacy rules. The company has been instructed to desist. But Admiral might well not be the last to ‘test the water’. It is but one of many companies with access to our social profile. It might be time for all of us to think more carefully about what we’re allowing them access to. And that includes Facebook itself. Some have proposed that Facebook only acted in this case to preserve its own exclusive right to know everything about us, not to protect our privacy. \nEither way, it seems a major step towards invasive character profiling. If such practices ever became legally permitted and normal for profit-making organisations, market economies would be wide open to extreme prejudice and discrimination. Particularly if trade agreements such as TTIP and the proposed Investment Court System (ICS) were ever to grant big businesses greater powers. For many, exploiting the personal situations of customers would simply seem an efficient way of maximising profit. Furthermore, privacy is hardly likely to be high up the list of priorities for Theresa May in post-Brexit Britain. After all, she became infamous in her role as Home Secretary for pioneering the erosion of civilian privacy, with her ‘Snooper’s Charter’. \nAs well as actively enabling discrimination, if social media did ever become a deciding factor for living costs and opportunity, citizens would undoubtedly experience overwhelming pressure to conform and be seen as ‘squeaky clean’. \nWhich is not a world away from the entirely fake, vacuous, and prejudiced society portrayed in Nosedive : \nFeatured image via Pixabay .

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) (Photo: The Associated Press) \nPARIS (AP) — Andy Murray celebrated his rise to No. 1 by beating American John Isner 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-4 Sunday to win the Paris Masters for the first time. \nIt was his career-best eighth title this season, his 14th in Masters overall, and ended Isner's bid for a first Masters title. \nMurray, who officially replaces Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings on Monday, now leads Isner 8-0 in their career meetings, dating back to their first match at the Australian Open six years ago. \nHe recently beat Isner 6-1, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, but this was a very different match and thoroughly contested by the big-serving American. \n\"John played unbelievable tennis,\" Murray said on court, moments after his win. \"We played last week and the difference was huge.\" \nUsing 18 aces and hitting plenty of inside-out winners on his massive forehand, Isner generated considerable pressure. \nBut he was also erratic, wasting six break points overall. \nIn the second set, he was 4-3 ahead and 40-0 up on Murray's serve, but again failed to punish the Briton — last year's runner-up to Djokovic. \nBut in a rare dip, Murray double-faulted during the tiebreaker and Isner profited to take the set. \nIsner saved break points on his first two service games of the third set, hanging on as Murray restored his superiority. \nThen, serving to stay in the match, the 2.08-meter American double-faulted to trail 0-30. He won a tough first point and then hit yet another ace to make it 30-30. \nIsner sank a difficult volley into the net, giving Murray a first match point. With Isner on second serve, Murray dominated a brief rally, pinging a pass down the line that Isner patted into the net with the ball close to his body. \nIt was a hard-fought victory and Isner stood with his head down at the net, waiting to congratulate Murray. \nMurray has won four consecutive tournaments, taking his career tally to 43. \nNext up is the season-ending ATP finals in London, beginning next Sunday. \nMurray will cross the English Channel to try and take the title there, having secured his top ranking here. \n\"This has been an incredible journey to get to the top of the rankings,\" Murray said, thanking his family back home. \"I'll keep working hard to get better.\" \nThe 31-year-old Isner, playing in the third Masters final of his career, ends the year without a title. \nHe lost his other final this season to Australian Nick Kyrgios at Atlanta, Georgia, in August. \nSome small consolation is that he finishes the year with the most aces: 1,159 — the fourth time he has achieved this. \nMurray broke Isner twice, the first time to move 4-2 up in the first set. \nIsner fought back, a booming forehand winner giving him two break points in the seventh game. \nMurray saved the first one with a lob — an achievement against such a tall player — and volley. He rescued the second by pushing Isner back and forcing an unforced error. \nServing for the first set, Murray won the first point with an extraordinary backhand retrieve from a speedy Isner forehand that he somehow turned into a cross-court winner. \n\"That was pretty spectacular from him,\" Isner said. \"He always clamps down on me when I have a bit of an opening. He's a match for everyone, especially me.\" \nIn the second set, Isner got a deserved ovation in the eighth game when he won a 20-stroke rally. \nShowing nimble footwork that belied his size, he traded shots with Murray, winning the point with a superb drop shot and then a forehand winner from Murray's retrieve. \nIsner was playing his best tennis of the match and had Murray 0-40 down. \nMurray recovered but gave Isner another chance at deuce. \nIsner sent a forehand slightly too long and just about restrained himself from smashing his racket. That, and other missed chances, summed up his match. \n\"It was very close and I had a few opportunities,\" said Isner. \n\"My game is the best it's been all year. There's no question about that,\" he said. \"It's important to take that into the offseason and do the right things.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Above: Questions to ask as you build a chatbot. Image Credit: Sgutterstock.com/Brian A Jackson \nRecently, Converse.AI participated in Bot World, a dedicated UK event that brought together brands, developers and pioneers of the hottest tech trend. \nWe hosted and moderated a panel session featuring Facebook, Sage and Twilio on the Top Considerations When Building A Relevant Bot . \nThe conversation was engaging and thoughtful and I wanted to share the most important highlights on the most important pieces you should be focusing on when thinking of building a bot . What should I avoid doing? \nThe answer to this one was clear: Don’t spend 12 months building something that you think is perfect — it won’t be. The nature of a conversational interface is such that you will be constantly surprised how humans can interact with your bot. No matter how long you build and train, users will always react differently to what you expect, and someone will always be able to trip your bot up. And that’s OK! \nThe beauty of using a bot is that, unlike an app or a website, even if the bot doesn’t work properly, you can still get clear feedback on how it’s gone wrong, and they can be easily changed in minutes so updating them based on user feedback is almost instant. \n“The agility cycle is really fast: much faster than apps!” says Jon Heaton, a Partner Engineer at Facebook . What should I make sure I do? \nWhile you are iterating and tweaking your bot, it’s still really important to have a human voice when necessary. Bots are great at assisting with communication for businesses but they still require the ability to integrate a human in the loop to make sure the user experience is still as smooth as possible. \n“You and your employees are the only ones that know your customer journey completely, so use that knowledge and experience,” says Chris Book, a marketing manager at Twilio . \nWhether you reach a manual call center or are messaging an automated bot, both bots and humans will have certain processes to go through or hoops to jump through. While the phrase “Computer says no” became a comedy catchphrase, there are limits to what the bot will be able to do on its own, so make sure that the users expectations are managed. Only humans will be able to apply common sense, which can be taught to the bot when you are training it. \n“You have to set expectations on its capabilities and limitations the very first time someone uses the bot,” says Kriti Sharma, a mobile product manager at Sage . \nSo the overall advice here is to start small, iterate and grow. Consider your users expectations at every stage and make sure you are taking them into account with every use of the bot. NLP vs Buttons, which is better? \nWhen Facebook launched their bot manifesto at F8 back in April , it became clear to them very quickly that people were not grasping the full concept of a conversational interface. \nThere are now over 30,000 bots on Facebook Messenger , by far the most popular platform for building bots! They have rolled out many features that enable people to use a combination of buttons and text based features as well as NLP. The advice given by the panel was to use a combination of these make sure the users familiarize themselves with the bot interface as quickly as possible. \nAs with every step of building your bot, the key here is building with your users in mind combined with the overall desired outcome of the bot. \nNLP is useful, buttons are useful, but certain scenarios will suit different approaches better. Long form text bots will require NLP whereas simple question bots like ordering a pizza may benefit from more buttons. Of course, a combination of these is most likely, and you will almost always need to handle some language input such as addresses for pizza deliveries or notes to the chef, as its rarely completely disabled. \nIntegrations with third parties for familiarity can also help with adoption. For example, an integration with PayPal or Stripe to take payments can help users feel confident and secure when sending card payments through a bot. It’s not just about the features that you include; functionality and usability are really important. What does success look like? \nAll of the considerations that were discussed last week focused on the customer experience and adoption curve. The message that came out was that the most important part of your business is your customers and their experience of interacting with you. Your top considerations when building a bot shouldn’t include the technological challenges. These have almost all been solved for you. Choose a bot building platform that means you can build something your customers will love, that will also take care of the innovation and enhancements for you. \nThe main focus for you as a bot builder should be making sure the personas and personality and overall usability of the bot is right. To do this, you need to consider how you are going to add context and personality to your bot that your end user will respond well to. All of this ensures you are creating a more friendly conversation for the user and they will most likely return to use your bot in the future. \n“We all have a responsibility to rid the world of crappy bots!,” says Sharma. \nOutbound interaction with customers at specific points of their engagement cycle is not new. It’s also not what a bot is. It’s not just responding to inbound messages but also about being able to push messages to customers at the right time, with the right message. \nBots can be used to initiate conversations based on previously collected data such as offering a taxi when you know someone has landed after a flight they booked through your bot or sending reminders or asking about upgrades or extended stays when they have booked a hotel. The key is to make sure the message is relevant and welcomed by the end user, and don’t forget, you may well still need human escalation for outbound messages as well. \nGetting the balance right between adding value through messaging vs ‘spamapocalypse’ is the true test of a successful bot!

      "text": "Is Facebook secretly building a phone? CNET 4 hrs ago Sean Hollister © Provided by CNET James Martin/CNET On a cloudy day this May, in the dull fluorescent light of a plain white Google conference room, Rafa Camargo, Richard Wooldridge and Blaise Bertrand told CNET their plan to disrupt the phone market.\nAra, a Lego-like phone with modular parts , would let buyers snap on a better camera, additional batteries or any other creative hardware a developer might dream up. It was set to be the first phone entirely designed by Google, the three men claimed.\nThen the Ara project was abruptly shelved .\nBut now, all three of those men work for Building 8 -- a secretive new division of Facebook. There, they've been joined by an impressive list of heavy hitters that reads like a who's who of the tech world: Motorola, Tesla, Apple and Amazon, in addition to that contingent of Google ex-pats.\nSo what, exactly, is this superteam of designers, engineers and manufacturing experts working on? Nobody outside of Menlo Park knows for sure, but the hires -- and at least one under-the-radar acquisition -- seem to indicate two things: it's mobile, and it may be modular.\nWhatever it turns out to be, building hardware at this scale represents a major shift for Facebook. The company's first attempt at hardware -- a 2013 joint venture with HTC that became known as the \" Facebook phone \" -- was a fiasco, discounted to 99 cents mere weeks after its debut. Since then, though, the company has doubled down, first with its $2 billion purchase of VR headset maker Oculus in 2014, and now with what appears to be a far more ambitious hardware endeavor with Building 8.\nWhat's Building 8? Originally, it sounded like Building 8 was a skunkworks where Facebook could prototype a whole bunch of new technologies -- like 360-degree video cameras -- and figure out the fastest way to get them into consumers' hands, usually through partnerships.\nThat's what Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer suggested to the The Wall Street Journal , and it's what was widely assumed when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he'd hired Regina Dugan to lead Building 8. Dugan is the former head of both the US Department of Defense's DARPA research arm, and Google's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) research lab.\nZuckerberg suggested, in an April 2016 blog post , that Building 8 would pursue \"augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, connectivity and other important areas\" -- which sounds pretty sciencey, to be sure.\nBut the division's job postings and recent hires tell a slightly different story -- beginning with the Building 8 mission statement you'll find at the top of each job post .\nHere's the mission statement in full:\nBuilding 8 brings together world-class experts to develop and ship groundbreaking products at the intersection of hardware, software, and content. We have a clear mandate to ship products at scale. In particular, seemingly impossible products that define new categories that advance Facebook's mission of connecting the world. The B8 team will apply DARPA-style breakthrough development at the intersection of ambitious science and product development. It will operate on aggressive, fixed timelines, with extensive use of partnerships in universities, small and large businesses. Building 8 is all about shipping hardware, it seems. And could \"seemingly impossible products\" include an ambitious modular phone like Ara?\nFacebook didn't reply to a request for comment.\nPhone experts wanted CNET analyzed nearly 50 Facebook job postings, past and present, and dug through dozens of employee profiles on LinkedIn to see the big picture. It soon became clear: Facebook isn't just building a lab in hopes of spinning out a few new startup companies.\nInstead, Facebook is hiring over a dozen different heads of what appear to be a dozen distinct departments within Building 8 -- including industrial design, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, device software, applications and services, manufacturing, supply chain and even customer service. Many of those heads of product are being asked to hire their own teams from scratch.\nIn other words, Facebook appears to be building an organization that could conceptualize, design, produce, ship and sell hardware, and even deal with customers after the fact. (Who needs customer service and return policies for prototypes?)\nOnly two of Facebook's new department heads are devoted to \"skunkworks\" and \"partnerships,\" respectively, and few of the job postings ask for experience across the wide range of disciplines you might expect for a research lab.\nBut many of them ask for people with mobile experience -- Android in particular.\nFor instance, this posting for a lead electrical engineering systems architect specifically asks for experience with mobile processors, antennas and thermal design, and these two for a camera software engineer and a kernel software engineer each require five years of experience working with mobile processors and an \"understanding of Android Frameworks.\"\nThe heads of product software, product engineering and hardware each need experience leading teams that have brought \"smart phone (Android, iOS) and/or consumer electronics\" to market.\nThere are also strong hints that the new head of software applications and services will be tasked with developing Android apps for the hardware Building 8 will make.\nTwo other jobs specifically mention Facebook's intent to build \"compelling consumer-facing products on the Android platform,\" and yet another hints that Facebook may sell accessories to go along with its products.\nKey talent According to their LinkedIn profiles, many of Building 8's recent hires reinforce the idea that Facebook is pursuing hardware in a big way:\nNathan Kelly , Building 8's new head of global supply chain, previously helped build supply chains for Sonos, Tesla, HP/Palm, Microsoft and Sony Ericsson, according to his LinkedIn profile. Rich Heley , the new head of manufacturing, spent a decade at Apple figuring out how to mass produce aluminum enclosures for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac -- all the way back to the first MacBook Pro -- then spent three years at Tesla, finishing as VP of product technology. Furhan Zafar previously directed the supply chain for Motorola's Moto Maker -- an effort that let buyers pick different phone backs and different accent colors for their phone's buttons and grills before they shipped to customers. Tim McCune , Building 8's new head of systems engineering, spent 17 years at Motorola and a brief stint at Apple as well. Richard Wooldridge , the new COO of Building 8, wasn't just the logistics behind Google's modular Ara handset -- he also spent four years leading the global supply chain at Motorola, including Moto's effort to build a factory in the US for the first Moto X phone. Rafa Camargo , Building 8's new head of product engineering, led development on Google's Ara phone, after a year and a half at Amazon's Lab126 hardware group working on the Amazon Fire Phone and 13 years at Motorola on such iconic projects as the Droid, Razr, even the StarTAC flip phone. Viresh Rustagi , the new head of device software at Building 8, was the head of software for Google's Ara as well -- after a two-year-plus stint managing a software dev team for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets and set-top boxes, and 12 years working on software for mobile processors at Broadcom. Blaise Bertrand , Facebook's new head of creative, spent three years designing for Motorola and 12 at noted design firm IDEO, in addition to seven months at Google ATAP working on the Ara phone.\nThese high-level execs are just the start. Building 8 has also snapped up a number of former Apple employees, including an executive recruiter, and is currently hiring three other recruiters and a recruiting manager to expand its collection of talent.\nIt's also worth noting that, for now, all of these hardware efforts appear to be separate from the ones inside Facebook proper: the company already had its own VP of hardware and supply chain to help build its data centers and networking infrastructure. Oculus, the Facebook virtual-reality subsidiary, has its own separate hardware team too, plus its own research arm based in Seattle.\nWill Google's modular phone live on? Even if Facebook just hired four key members of the Google Ara team to lead its manufacturing and supply chain efforts, and even if it has a number of other mobile experts on the payroll, we can't say for sure they'll be working on a phone.\nAll of Facebook's new expertise could go towards anything else that uses mobile processors, radios and the Android OS -- such as headsets , tablets, watches, smart home and other internet-of-things devices. Or something entirely new.\nAnd even if it is a phone, it isn't necessarily a modular one. Having failed to convince Google, the team may have given up on that idea.\nBut perhaps not: In September, one month after the Ara team jumped ship, Building 8 bought a hardware startup called Nascent Objects -- which just so happened to be developing a modular consumer electronics platform, too.\nAt the time of the acquisition, Building 8's Dugan implied that Nascent's tech would be used for fast prototyping : \"Imagine designing, building and delivering a hardware product in just weeks. Instead of months, or even years,\" Dugan wrote on her Facebook page. \"Together, we hope to create hardware at a speed that's more like software.\"\nBut perhaps Dugan meant that Nascent's modular tech could help consumers build their own hardware -- the same idea behind the Ara modular phone.\nBack in May, in that Google conference room, the ambition behind Ara was huge. \"We want to create a hardware ecosystem on the scale of the software app ecosystem,\" said Camargo .\nWooldridge promised his team would provide hardware and technical support, and help indie hardware designers get their snap-on modules certified by federal regulatory agencies, so that even a \"bedroom student\" could add a new feature to their phone.\nBertrand explained how fashionable it could be, and how attractive for big brands, to have decorative phone pieces that a user could change on the fly.\nNow, they're all together again, inside a company that -- unlike Google -- wouldn't be disrupting its own business by competing with existing Android hardware partners. (Facebook is a must-have app on more than a billion people's phones, but the company doesn't make any mobile hardware yet.)\nPlus, they're leading a division with access to \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" over the next few years, according to Zuckerberg.\nThe ultimate pivot It's possible that Facebook's hardware ambitions never see the light of day. Consider Apple's secretive Project Titan program, which reportedly staffed up and spent millions on a self-driving car initiative that, so far, has only produced several rounds of layoffs and strategy changes. Reportedly.\nBut it seems, at least, that Facebook is following the same path as its arch-rival, Snapchat. Until a few months ago, Snapchat's social app was its only product. But the company recently rebranded itself as a camera company and surprised the world with Spectacles , a Snapchat-specific hardware product it had developed in secret (after stealthily hiring its own group of wearable tech experts).\nFacebook has a bigger user base than Snapchat, more money and more hardware experts. If the company unveils its own phone -- or mobile accessory -- in the next year or two, it wouldn't be too surprising.\nDisclosure : Sean's wife works for Facebook as a business-to-business video project coordinator.\nIf you can speak anonymously about Facebook's Building 8 projects, please contact me at sean.hollister@cbsinteractive.com.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Joshua Beal. ( Facebook )\nA 25-year-old black man was shot and killed during a road rage incident that also involved two off-duty Chicago police officers, an off-duty city firefighter and members of the man’s family, who were in a funeral procession.\nJoshua Beal was in Chicago for his cousin’s funeral when the shooting occurred Saturday at 111th and Troy streets in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood of the city, the Chicago Tribune reports. \nPolice said the off-duty sergeant was in uniform on the way to work when he encountered the road rage incident involving Beal’s family, the off-duty firefighter and the other off-duty , the newspaper reports. A police spokesman said the sergeant was fired upon and returned fire.\nOfficer involved shooting – 111TH & TROY. Off-duty officer was fired upon and returned fire. PIO en route\n— Anthony Guglielmi (@AJGuglielmi) November 5, 2016 \n\nBeal, of Indianapolis, Indiana, was taken to a local hospital, where he died, the newspaper reports.\n“Chicago police gunned my baby down like a vicious animal,” Tiffaney Boxley, Beal’s mither, told WGN-TV. “They shot him twice in the back and three times in his front.”\nThe off-duty police officer and the off-duty sergeant, who have not been identified, have both been placed on paid administrative leave, officials said. One of the officers was taken to the hospital after the incident, but was not seriously injured, police said.\nThe off-duty firefighter involved in the incident has also not been named.\nThe shooting is being investigated by the city’s Independent Police Review Authority.\n“While it is still very early in the investigation, we can confirm that early ballistic evidence suggests that multiple firearms were discharged. It is our hope that people will wait until all evidence is brought to light before making any conclusions about what happened yesterday evening,” IPRA spokeswoman Mia Sissac told the Chicago Tribune. \nPolice said both officers fired shots during the incident, according to the Tribune.\nHere’s what you need to know:\n1. A Video Recorded by a Witness Shows a Chaotic Scene Before 13 Shots Are Fired JUST IN: Officer involved shooting at 111TH & TROY. Police say an off-duty officer was fired at and returned fire. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/w4e3tTa3f2 \n— Audrina Bigos (@AudrinaBigos) November 5, 2016 \n\nVideo recorded by a witness to the Saturday incident has been obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times and other media outlets. \n“I heard a whole lot of yelling. They said, ‘you ran me off the road.'” the witness, Britnie Nelson, told WGN-TV. “As I’m looking I see the officer shoot the man; the gun went off 13 times.”\nThe recording shows a chaotic scene before and after the shooting, but the shooting itself is not seen. But at least 13 shots can be heard off camera.\nYou can watch the video below:\n\nThe video shows several vehicles stopped in the middle of 111th Street near Troy Street. People can be heard yelling at each other as Nelson approaches. \nA man in a red shirt approaches part of the crowd with what appears to be a gun in his hand. Another man can be seen telling people to back off and get on the ground. The man in the red shirt then appears to tuck his gun into his pants or a holster.\nThe video then pans back and forth a few times, and briefly shows a man in a white shirt appearing to point a gun before lowering it.\nThe video then stops and is restarted after an unknown amount of time passes. The camera is pointing at the ground, with yelling still heard in the background. Screaming is then heard, followed by several shots.\nCrying can then be heard as a woman says, “they killed him somebody got hit, they killed him, they shoot.”\nThe crying woman is asked where she is going and she says, “back to the funeral.”\nThe other woman says, “they just killed our own people. … The police.” \nA still photo from the scene appears to show a man pointing a gun. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Sun-Times it appears to be Beal in the photo, but investigators have not yet confirmed that.\nPhoto appears to show Joshua Beal pointing gun at police before being shot and killed Saturday.CPD, IPRA analyzing. pic.twitter.com/Betph09nhJ \n— Dana Rebik (@DanaRebikWGN) November 7, 2016 \n\nThe witness, Britnie Nelson, says she is not related to or otherwise connected to Beal and was just in the area at the time of the shooting.\n“I felt bad because I never seen so much chaos,” Nelson told the Chicago Tribune . “It should’ve never happened in the first place. They come to lay someone to rest, then this person dies for no reason.”\n2. Police Say the Off-Duty Officer Fired After Seeing Beal With a Gun, While Beal’s Family Says the Cop Cut-Off the Funeral Procession Bullet holes in car at 111th & Troy. Police say off-duty officer was fired at, returned fire. Male transported in critical @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/gW1LH1gWTn \n— Audrina Bigos (@AudrinaBigos) November 5, 2016 \n\nThe police and Joshua Beal’s family have put forward differing versions of what happened leading up to and during the shooting.\nAccording to DNA Info Chicago, the shooting happened about 3 p.m. Saturday, police said in a statement. A vehicle that had just left a funeral service was stopped in traffic in front of a Chicago Fire Department station. An off-duty firefighter confronted the driver of the vehicle, telling him he was blocking a fire line, police said in the statement.\nAccording to police, the driver got out of the car and a fight broke out. An off-duty police officer was in a local barber shop and saw the fight, came out and joined the melee, the Chicago Tribune reports. \nPolice said an off-duty sergeant, who was in uniform and was driving to work, then also saw the fight and a man with a gun.\n“The Sergeant stopped, exited his vehicle, displayed his weapon and announced his office,” police said in the statement, according to DNA Info. “As the incident continued to escalate and the offender failed to drop his weapon, shots were fired striking the individual multiple times.” \nPolice said both off-duty officers identified themselves as being with the Chicago Police Department. Beal was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead at 3:44 p.m.\n\nBut Beal’s family has told reporters a different story of what happened. They say the road rage incident started before the family’s funeral procession was stopped in front of the firehouse.\nHis sister, Cordney Boxley, told the Chicago Tribune that she believes her 17-year-old sister was cut off and ran off the road by a police officer in an unmarked car.\n“He just came out of nowhere cut me off, and was behind my little sister and tried to run her off the road,” Boxley told WGN-TV. \nThey say Beal pulled out a gun after seeing the officer holding his sister at gunpoint.\nBeal’s cousin, Casey Fisher, told a similar story to WXIN-TV. \n“His sister and the police officer was having words but he didn’t say he was a police officer or anything,” Fisher said. “He was plain clothes and called her a bitch and things like that. She got out the car. They arguing. He put a gun to her head.”\nHe said the officer fired twice while Beal was on the ground trying to hide under a car. \n“He tried crawling under the car to try to protect hisself,” Fisher told the news station. “And then the cop came and shot him two more times while he was on the ground.”\nFisher said Beal’s brother tackled the off-duty officer to the ground after the shooting.\nBeal’s 28-year-old brother, Michael Beal, was arrested at the scene, the Chicago Tribune reports . He was charged with attempting to disarm a police officer and aggravated battery of a police officer. \nHe is accused of tackling the off-duty sergeant and putting him in a chokehold after the shooting, police told the newspaper. Protesters say Beal’s brother remains in jail.\n3. Beal’s Family Says He Has a License to Carry a Gun, but Police Say He Was Not Legally Allowed to Carry It in Chicago Joshua Beal. ( Facebook )\nJoshua Beal’s family told CBS Chicago that he had a license to carry a gun.\n“My brother is one who is licensed to carry his gun wherever he goes. This man never identified himself, never said anything. He just started shooting through the windshield of my brother’s car,” Cordney Boxley told the news station.\nBeal’s family has said he tried telling the officers he had a permit to carry the gun.\nPolice spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the Chicago Tribune that Beal did not have a concealed carry permit in Illinois. Guglielmi said even if he had a permit to carry in Indiana, it would not have applied in Chicago.\nBeal’s family have also said he did not fire at the officers.\nGuglielmi told the Tribune investigators are working to determine whether Beal’s gun was “fired or may have misfired” during the incident.\n4. He Is a Father of 2 Who Was Described by His Mother as a ‘College Graduate, a Business Owner & a Family Man’ Joshua Beal with his two sons. ( Facebook )\nJosh Beal previously lived in Chicago and lived in Indianapolis at the time of his death, his family says. \nBeal graduated from Ivy Tech Community College in December 2015 with an associate’s degree in business administration, according to a photo of his diploma he posted on his Facebook page in September. His family told reporters he planned to enroll in Franklin University and hoped to one day own his own business.\nHis mother called him a “college graduate, a business owner and a family man,” according to WFLD-TV. \nHe was a father of two young sons, ages 4 and 2, with his longtime girlfriend. He proposed to her two months ago, his family told the Chicago Tribune. \n“He wasn’t in no gang,” his mother, Tiffaney Boxley said. “He was a good kid. He was good person. You took a child who took care of his family.”\nShe said her son had a “promising future.”\nJoshua Beal in a photo posted to Facebook in 2010. ( Facebook )\nBeal was in Chicago to be a pallbearer in his cousin’s funeral, his family told the Chicago Tribune. \nHis cousin, Marcus Washington, 26, was fatally shot in Indianapolis on October 27, according to the Tribune. Like Beal, Washington previously lived in Chicago and was being buried in his former home city on Saturday.\n“The police are going to pay for this,” Miranda Macklin, a family member, told the Tribune. “Justice will be served.”\n5. #JusticeforJoshua Protesters Have Clashed With Residents of the ‘Pro-Police’ Mount Greenwood Neighborhood Where Beal Was Killed \nProtesters using #JusticeforJoshua and #JoshuaBeal have used social media to spread the word about the shooting. They also gathered in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood where the shooting occurred.\nBut they have clashed there with Mount Greenwood residents, who held counter protests, holding signs with #BlueLivesMatter and other messages supporting the Chicago Police. More than 80 percent of the neighborhood’s residents are white, according to census data. \nSome residents told the Chicago Tribune the neighborhood is “very pro-police” and they believe the shooting was justified.\n“It’s always like ‘The police did this, the police did that, oh my God, they shot him for no reason at all,’” one woman, who did not give her name, told the Tribune. “Really? You really think it was unprovoked?”\nFacebook Live videos posted by Black Lives Matter Chicago show tense interactions between protesters and residents.\nThis embed is invalid\n“There was no protest,” Activist Kofi Ademola told DNAInfo Chicago. “We were there to check on the family to make sure they were safe. Next thing we knew, we were surrounded by a bunch of angry white people. Nobody said anything to them.”\nAdemola said residents told them to get out of the neighborhood and go back home.\n“A young white guy [walked] up with a baseball bat,” Ademola told the news site. “The police took the baseball bat from him. White people are driving by and yelling at us ‘n—– go home!’ Get the f— out of here! Blue Lives Matter.’ More of them got out of the car and chanted ‘CPD! Blue Lives Matter.'”\nScott Michael Greene: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Scott Michael Greene, 46, has been identified as the suspect in the ambush-style killings of two police officers in Iowa.\nClick here to read more Tom Cleary is a reporter and editor for Heavy.com .

(Photo: Isaac Brekken, Associated Press) \nLas Vegas — The birdie putt was still a foot away from the hole when Rod Pampling raised his right arm and thrust it in the air as the ball tumbled into the cup. \nHis victory Sunday in Las Vegas was a long time coming. \nPampling left nothing to chance by holing a 30-foot putt on the final hole at the TPC Summerlin to close with a 6-under 65 for a two-shot victory in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, his first PGA Tour title in 10 years. \n“Sometimes you amaze yourself at what you can do under the gun, which hadn’t been for a long time,” Pampling said. “And it was great.” \nThe 47-year-old Australian last won on the PGA Tour at Bay Hill in 2006. He lost his card and spent two full seasons on the Web.com Tour, and then had to return to the Web.com Tour Finals at the end of last season just to get his card back. \nHe was No. 451 in the world ranking. \nAnd now Pampling is headed to Kapalua for the Tournament of Champions in January, and he’ll be returning to the Masters for the first time in 10 years. \n“It’s extremely rewarding,” Pampling said. “Winning Arnold Palmer’s event is still on top. But coming back from what we’ve had the last few years, to get a win under the belt, it’s phenomenal. Amazing.” \nBrooks Koepka closed with a 67 to finish second. \nLucas Glover, going for his first victory in five years, was tied with Pampling with two holes to play until he made a bogey from the bunker on the par-3 17th, and he closed with another bogey when winning was out of reach. He shot a 69 to finish third. \nFrancesco Molinari of Italy had a career-best 61 and tied for fourth with Geoff Ogilvy (68) and Harris English (67). \nFor someone who had gone so long since he last won, Pampling kept his poise even when it looked as though the final round was getting away from him. He began the back nine with two bogeys in three holes — a three-putt on No. 10, missing the green with a pitching wedge on No. 12 — and fell one shot behind Glover. \nPampling bounced back with a 12-foot birdie putt, and an 8-iron to 18 feet for birdie on the 14th to catch Glover. Pampling made a 12-foot birdie on the next hole to keep pace, and his biggest shot might have been for par. \nTied for the lead on the par-5 16th, he pushed his drive well right into rough so deep that Pampling asked to identify his ball, and it was a good thing — it wasn’t his ball. His ball was a foot to the right, buried so badly that he could only muscle it some 30 yards behind another tree, and he had to lay up short of the water. From 121 yards, Pampling hit wedge into 6 feet and saved par to stay tied. \n“That was the turning point for Rod, and that was awesome,” Glover said. “He played great.” \nGlover’s tee shot on the 17th was about a foot away from being good, but it caught the lip of the bunker and left a difficult shot with the green sloping away from him. He missed a 12-foot par putt and never caught up. \nPampling finished at 20-under 264 and will be exempt up until his 50th birthday when he is eligible for the PGA Tour Champions. \n“After this week I still think I have a couple of more wins, so I’m looking forward to the next few years and just see what we can do.” Pampling said. \nThe victory was the third of his PGA Tour career for Pampling, who also won the now-defunct International in 2004. It puts him in the Masters for the first time since 2007, along with the PGA Championship for the first time since 2009. \nHe became the fifth Australian to win on the PGA Tour this year, joining Jason Day, Adam Scott, Greg Chalmers and Aaron Baddeley. \nOgilvy had his best finish since he tied for second in the Deutsche Bank Championship two years ago. Keegan Bradley closed with a 66 and tied for seventh. Bradley tied for sixth two weeks ago in Malaysia, giving him consecutive top 10s for the first time since March 2013. \nAaron Wise, the NCAA champion from Oregon, tied for 10th and earned a spot in the field next week in Mexico. \nTour Champions \nScott McCarron won the Dominion Charity Classic to get a top-five spot next week in PGA Tour Champions finale, beating Tom Byrum with a 6-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a playoff. \nMcCarron will start next week in Arizona second in the points to two-time defending champion Bernhard Langer, with all of the top five in the reset standings — Colin Montgomerie is second, followed by Joe Durant and Miguel Angel Jimenez — in position to win the season title with a victory at Desert Mountain. \nMcCarron and Byrum each shot 3-under 69 to finish at 13 under on the James River Course at The Country Club of Virginia. Byrum missed a 15-footer before McCarron holed the winning putt. \nThe 51-year-old McCarron won the Principal Charity Classic in Iowa in June for his first senior victory. He won three times on the PGA Tour. \nLPGA \nShanshan Feng needed every bit of the three-stroke lead she took to final hole at chilly Taiheiyo Club to finish off her second straight LPGA Tour victory. \nThe 27-year-old Chinese star closed with a double-bogey 6 to beat Ha Na Jang by a stroke in the TOTO Japan Classic, the last of six straight events in Asia. Feng closed with a 2-under 70 for a 13-under 203 total, the double bogey her only dropped shots since the fourth hole Friday. \nThe winner last week in steamy Malaysia, Feng has finished no worse than a tie for fourth in her last seven events. She started the run with the Olympic bronze medal in Rio, tied for fourth at Evian in France, opened the Asia trip at home in China with a fourth-place tie, was second behind Jang in Taiwan and tied for third in South Korea. \nPlaying two groups ahead of Feng, Jang birdied 16 and 17 in her third 68. The South Korean player has three victories this year, beating Feng by a stroke in Taiwan. \nFeng shot a tournament-best 64 on Saturday to take one-stroke lead over second-ranked Ariya Jutanugarn into the final round. Jutanugarn missed a chance to wrap up the LPGA Tour player of the year award with a victory, shooting a 74 to drop into a tie for 10th at 8 under. The Thai star leads the tour with five victories and also tops the money list. \nEuropean Tour \nDenmark’s Thorbjorn Olesen held on to win the Turkish Airlines Open for his fourth European Tour title. \nSeven strokes ahead entering the round, Olesen closed with a 2-under 69 for a three-stroke victory over England’s David Horsey (65) and China’s Li Haotong (65). \nAfter Horsey cut the lead to a shot, Olesen birdied the 12th, 14th and 15th. He finished at 20-uner 264 at Regnum Carya and earned nearly $1.2 million. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE ",

      "text": "Video Buy AP Photo Reprints NEW YORK (AP) — TVs are so last century. News outlets are using Facebook Live, Snapchat, YouTube and other tools to offer live coverage of Election Day in ways not possible four years ago. It's a fitting close to an election season that has played out on Twitter and Facebook as much as it has on the nightly news, with debates live-streamed online and candidates barbing on social media. Here's your online guide for Tuesday. All times are Eastern. ___ FIND YOUR POLLING PLACE AND MORE Unless you're one of the millions of Americans who have already voted, it's a good idea to find out where to cast your ballot, preferably before Tuesday. Googling \"how to vote\" will take you to localized results that include the times the polls are open and any requirements such as an ID. You can also enter your address to locate your polling place. Facebook's elections tool will show you what's on your ballot and where various candidates stand on key issues. The information comes from the nonpartisan group Center for Technology and Civic Life, which also generates some of the data for Google searches such as \"what's on my ballot.\" To get started, go to https://www.facebook.com/elections/yourplan (you'll need a Facebook account). ___ SNAP AWAY Snapchat users will be able to see \"live stories\" on the app — showing people at the polls, election results, acceptance and concession speeches and election night celebrations. In the U.S., users will see overlays they can add to their snaps. ___ FACE-OFF ON FACEBOOK NowThis, a news outlet aimed at millennials, will have video coverage on its Facebook channel. Comedian Jordan Carlos will host the stream, called \"No Sleep til POTUS.\" CNN will have live coverage with reporters in battleground states, as well as drone shots of voting locations and international reaction throughout the day. Each hour from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. will be streamed from a different location. After 6 p.m., the network will continue Facebook Live streams from various locations, including watch parties and, again, battleground states. The Washington Post is planning live programming on its Facebook page beginning at 7 p.m. The show will include commentary and updates from Post reporters, including those at campaign headquarters for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The New York Times will also stream election coverage on its Facebook page, beginning at 4:30 p.m., from locations such as polling stations, college campuses and election viewing parties. Other news outlets with live streaming plans include Univision, PBS NewsHour, the Daily Caller, ABC News and Vox. ___ TWITCH ALONG WITH TWITTER Twitter is partnering with BuzzFeed News for a live stream from BuzzFeed's New York headquarters. The stream will begin at 6 p.m. Twitter says segments will include critiques of traditional news outlets and how they are covering the election, as well as live reports from BuzzFeed journalists at various locations throughout the U.S. and elsewhere. Go to http://election.twitter.com . You don't need an account.",

(Photo: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports) \nFORT WORTH — Carl Edwards took the lead with a crucial speedy pit stop and held on for a virtual must-win at Texas Motor Speedway Sunday night to earn a berth into the NASCAR Chase for the Sprint Cup final. \nEdwards’ No. 19 Toyota team used an 11.8-second pit stop on Lap 255 to beat leader Martin Truex Jr. off pit road. He held on through two subsequent restarts to claim Joe Gibbs Racing’s first win of the Chase after the four-driver team claimed 11 in the 26-race regular season. \nNext up on the schedule: the Can-Am 500 at Phoenix International Raceway next Sunday. \nThe AAA 500 was halted because of rain with 41 laps left with Joey Logano, another driver needing a win, second, followed by Truex, Chase Elliott, and Chase drivers Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Matt Kenseth. \n\"I actually enjoyed it,\" Edwards said on pit road after NASCAR called the race. \"Obviously this is what we had to do. The guys got me off pit road first and that's what won it for me. We've got a shot at the championship at Homestead and that's all we wanted.\" \nEdwards, who entered the race last of eight title-eligibles in the standings — 32 points out of the fourth and final transfer spot — had attempted to pass Truex since Lap 204 as reports of impending rain crackled over team radios. He narrowed the margin to as little as .365 seconds but Truex was able to hold the lead. \nTeam Penske’s Logano dominated the first half of the race, taking the lead from pole-sitter Austin Dillon on the first green flag lap and holding it for 165 of the first 167. Logano entered the race with 159 laps led in 16 previous Texas starts, 108 of which came in a 2014 spring win. \nTruex, who won two first-round playoff races but was eliminated in the second, passed Logano for the lead by pitting a lap earlier on Lap 147. Logano slumped to third as Edwards assumed second. Truex eventually pulled out to as much as a 2.6-second lead before a caution on Lap 254. \nDefending series champion Kyle Busch struggled early in the race, running 16th on Lap 100, a spot better than his older brother and another former champion, Kurt Busch. \nThe race began after an almost five-hour delay because of rain and an extreme length of time required to dry the 1.5-mile track.

      "text": "By Tommy Werner \nPublished November 07, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print How do you fondue?  (iStock) \nOn a recent excavation in Jutland, a team of archaeologists uncovered an ancient trash pit dating back to the Bronze Age. An excavated clay pot from the pile contained a few burnt deposits that raised some eyebrows on the dig team. Mads Christian Christensen of the Danish National Museum analyzed a charred sample from the pot with a team of chemists and found trace amounts of dairy lipids. \nThat lead Christensen to the “cautious conclusion that the pot may have included bovine fat,” he wrote in a an email.\nIn other words, somebody had really, really burned the cheese 3,000 years ago. Here's how to melt cheese and avoid making a mistake that'll last thousands of years.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract When it comes to melting magic, all cheeses are not created equal.  (iStock) \n\nPick the Right Kind of Cheese \nThere’s a reason you’ll never see “Parmesan Fondue” on a menu. For one, it’d be way too salty. Second, while Parmesan melts into strands when it’s on top of pasta, it doesn’t melt into that kind of gooey mass that makes a swoon-worthy melted cheese sauce. Low-fat and low-moisture cheeses such as Parmesan or Romano burn the easiest. For even melting and a fondue party for the history books (in a good way), save the hard cheeses for grating over dishes and choose a cheese with more moisture and lower melting points. I'm talking about the classics you'd see on a gooey grilled cheese, like Cheddar, Swiss, or Gruyère.\nPick the Right Vessel \nClay may have been the Bronze Age Danes’ only choice of pot at the time, but you have plenty of better options for melting cheese. And even though clay does get more non-stick with repeated use, there's plenty of modern conveniences you can choose for easier use. Pick a nonstick pan or skillet (Our Test Kitchen recommends ceramic or porcelain-enameled, not teflon) that’ll keep stray, sticky strands of cheese from sticking to side and becoming prone to burning (or make clean up feel like it’s taking a millennium).\nTurn the Burner Down \nAs those poor cheese-melting Bronze-agers huddled around their clay pot of cheese (likely over a fire), they didn’t have the modern luxury of dialing back the heat. According to Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking, too-high temperatures (in cheddar or Swiss's case, 150°F) cause cheese to melt too quickly, creating a situation where the cheese’s protein bonds break easily and the cheese's moisture evaporates too rapidly. This results in melted cheese that gets stiff, charred, and caked onto the pot as it cools (much like the charred nugget Christensen analyzed). Here's the how to melt cheese the slow and steady way: use low heat—introduce a double-boiler, even—to avoid overcooking. If you want to speed up the melting a little more, try grating the cheese instead of cranking the temperature—the thin and uniform shape will melt faster and more evenly.\nAdd Booze! \nWine is more than just a flavoring agent—it's also good for keeping cheese from getting stringy or seizing up as it melts. In On Food and Cooking, McGee points out that the water in wine keeps the cheese’s proteins moist and diluted (which prevents the cheese from clumping), while the tartaric acid in the wine helps with the separation of the cheese proteins. Beer provides a similar effect (heyyyy beer cheese!).",

      "text": "PHNOM PENH (AFP) - A Cambodian opposition senator was sentenced to seven years in jail on Monday (Nov 7) for posting a doctored document on social media about the contested border with neighbouring Vietnam.\nAnti-Vietnamese sentiment is strong in parts of Cambodia and is often stirred up by the opposition to undermine the country's strongman ruler, Mr Hun Sen.\nThe courts, which critics say are easily bent to Mr Hun Sen's will, have hit back with charges and prosecutions accusing opposition members of whipping up dissent.\nSenator Hong Sok Hour was arrested last year, days after Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen accused him of committing treason by posting a doctored version of an old treaty about the border on opposition leader Sam Rainsy's Facebook page.\nThe version of the 36-year-old treaty he posted said the two countries would \"dissolve the borderline\" - an inflammatory concept to Cambodians.\nA court on Monday found the senator guilty of \"falsifying public documents, using fake public documents, incitement causing unrest to national security,\" Judge Ros Piseth said, sentencing him to seven years in prison.\nHis lawyers could not be reached immediately for comment.\nMr Rainsy, who is in exile in France, was also charged separately in the case.\nLast month, the same court sentenced an outspoken opposition lawmaker who has criticised Hun Sen's government over its handling of the border issue to two-and-a-half years in jail for posting allegedly fake maps on his Facebook page.\nThe two countries have shared a testy relationship since Vietnam's troops invaded to oust Cambodia's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 before withdrawing a decade later.\nMr Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for three decades, is highly sensitive to criticism that he is too soft on Vietnam over the disputed areas of the shared border.\nRights groups have accused Mr Hun Sen's administration of arresting scores of critics and tying up other opponents in legal cases before national elections in 2018.\nThe opposition's deputy leader, Mr Kem Sokha, has been holed up for months in his office, sleeping on a makeshift bed, to avoid arrest by authorities.\nHe was sentenced to five months in jail in September for refusing to appear in court over an alleged sex scandal prosecution that the opposition say is politically motivated.\nTopics:  CAMBODIA SOCIAL MEDIA COURT TRIALS More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4gGq Copy",

After informing everyone on Facebook through the \"'X' is now single\" post, you also have to contend with sneaky sub-tweets and obvious attempts on Snapchat's Story feature to get under your skin. But, hey, you're free to find someone new to fill the empty void in your life. All is well, right? Right?! Well, maybe so, but that apparently doesn't stop us from relentlessly checking up on our ex's social media.

A total of 2,747 Britons aged 18 and over were surveyed for the study, all of whom shared their home with a partner, housemates or family members. It found that 81% of respondents enjoy challenging themselves with a potentially groggy nap, while 61% admitted to snacking on some unhealthy food. Wedged in between those habits, though, were the 64% of those polled who admitted to checking on ex-partner's social media profiles. © Getty Images Carlina Teteris It can be tempting, sure. Especially when it's right in front of you during otherwise mindless scrolling. Eventually, you'll realise the only option is to hide all of their posts and spend your alone time getting frustrated on Tinder instead. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

Woman dies during church deliverance service (photo) \n“Trouble started when the complainant noticed that her daughter was pregnant and she mounted pressure on her to disclose who was responsible for the pregnancy,” Oyeyemi said. \n“The mother, who could not believe what she heard, reported to the police. The Divisional Police Officer, Adigbe division, Onatufeh Omoh, detailed detectives to arrest the randy pastor,” he said. \nHe said that the victim told the police that the pastor allegedly lured her into his car on the day she marked her birthday and forcefully broke her virginity. \nMary said the suspect had been having sex with her since then. \nREAD ALSO: How famous gay Nigerian Bisi Alimi married his lover dressed in agbada (photos) \nOyeyemi said the state commissioner of police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has also ordered the immediate transfer of the case to the Anti- Human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Eleweran, for further investigation. \nOyeyemi: “The CP also reiterated his earlier warning to parents to always keep an eye on their children in order to prevent them from becoming victims in the hands of people with devilish intentions.”",

      "text": "Lecturer in Sociology, University of Tasmania Disclosure statement \nSian Lincoln is affiliated with The British Sociological Association (britsoc.co.uk) and the Association of Internet Researchers (aoir.org). \nBrady Robards is affiliated with The Australian Sociological Association (tasa.org.au) and the Association of Internet Researchers (aoir.org).

Republish this article \nRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. \nDespite suggestions that young people are losing interest in the platform, its 1.5 billion users still puts Facebook at the centre of social media. The site was launched in 2004, and so those meeting Facebook’s minimum age requirement of 13 will, in 2017, be the first generation for whom Facebook has always existed. \nWe are now able to reflect on the long-term use of Facebook, which has enjoyed unrivalled longevity and growth . Those who joined in their early teens are now in their twenties and have “grown up” on Facebook, documenting their life through text, images, videos, and geo-location data such as “check-ins”. We spent two years interviewing these twenty-somethings to explore how they had documented their experiences of growing up on Facebook. \nTheir Facebook profiles have become effectively an archive of their lives. As our participants scrolled back through their Facebook timelines with us, they recounted the experiences they had posted to the site: exam results, new romantic relationships, breakups , losing a job, travel, and so on. Sometimes seemingly banal disclosures would remind them of more complex stories that were not immediately obvious. A photo of one participant sleeping on her father’s couch, for example, reminded her of a painful breakup with a partner. For another, the gaps in his timeline elicited stories about his gender transition that led him to switch to a new profile. \nAs our participants delved into their past many reflected on points in their lives where they were making critical decisions about their futures such as graduation, launching their careers and starting their own families. Some were in their final year of university study and were looking for a job. Today, Facebook profiles have become almost as important as a CV. And, much like the preparation and polishing of a CV, young people are cleaning up their Facebook profiles – prioritising stories about travelling or voluntary work and making the embarrassing details about nights out with friends private or erasing them altogether in an attempt to present a more professional, measured, mature identity. Job-seekers now perfecting Facebook timelines, not just CVs. Antonio Guillem/Shutterstock Putting the best face forward \nFor many, Facebook has shifted from being the site on which to document carefree student days to a space where a more professional identity can play out. Recruiters have for some time examined social media profiles, something that raises important privacy questions . Facebook even now offers its own, work-focused Facebook app, Workplace , showing the company’s desire to expand into more areas of our lives. \nTwo participants in our study were final year medical students. Coached in a job-seeking seminar, they were told that the recruitment team would carry out web searches on the candidates, including Facebook pages. This was an incentive for them to tidy up their profiles, and reflect on how many years of Facebook posts might be interpreted by potential employers and patients. \nThe sociologist Anthony Giddens uses the expression “the reflexive project of the self” to explain how personal identity is not fixed in stone, but an ongoing project that we constantly work on. This concept is particularly applicable to social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter because it captures the way these services are embedded into young peoples’ lives, and their professional development. \nBy polishing their Facebook profiles they can revise their past – removing pictures or posts that no longer play a role in who they are, or who they wish to portray themselves to be. Entire events that once seemed significant can be removed, having since been diminished into the realm of teenage naivety as priorities, networks, and identities change. Competing versions of identity \nThese erasures raise important questions. When in decades to come those who have grown up using Facebook are running for public office or moving into positions of power, how might we think differently about what constitutes a professional identity, and its relationship with our younger selves? Will future prime ministers be embarrassed by a love-struck selfie documenting a one month anniversary of their first relationship? Will future CEOs be deemed inappropriate for their jobs because of a flippant post made decades earlier? Should they? \nSports stars and politicians are often shamed and sometimes ruined for things they say on social media. Gymnast Louis Smith and footballer Joey Barton have found themselves in trouble for their questionable social media posts. Cheerleader Caitlin Davies’s career was ruined after a photo of her drawing offensive graffiti on an unconscious man was shared on Facebook. \nThe issue is that the hundreds or thousands of posts that make up twenty-somethings’ social media profiles are disclosures written and shared in the past, often forgotten and buried – until uncovered by someone scrolling back through them. In another case, the UK’s first youth crime commissioner Paris Brown resigned following the uncovering of apparently racist and homophobic comments posted on Twitter as a younger teenager. \nMight this kind of scrutiny intensify as entire lives recorded on social media are dredged up and put under the microscope? Or perhaps our attitudes will change, and they will be appreciated for what they are – moments in time, often from long ago. \nFor either the carefully edited approach to Facebook or the forgotten posts that come back to haunt their creators, it will be interesting to see the impact on future generations. What, for example, will a child think on scrolling through the Facebook timelines of parents who grew up using social media? Might the edited, polished version of their lives that they have put forward on Facebook stand in place of memory, and so eventually become the recorded story of their lives, however carefully curated and managed?

Follow @rawstory \nA Memphis man recorded a viral video of another driver hurling racial slurs and Donald Trump’s name at him during a road rage incident. \nBrandon Levston said the other driver apparently became angry after he would not allow him to speed up and stop him from changing lanes, reported WMC-TV . \nWhen he later pulled his car over, the man walked up to his vehicle shouting Trump’s name before launching into a racist rant. \n“Hey, Trump! Trump all the way,” the man says, approaching Levston’s vehicle as he records the encounter. “Trump! Because, hey — check this out. Check it out, because I got you. Black lives don’t matter — there ain’t no proof. Just because you say something don’t mean nothing.” \nLevston said the man began voicing his political views after he started recording the encounter. \nThe white man complained that Levston had sped up and gone around him, causing him to slam on his brakes at a traffic light. \n“That makes you a n****r,” the man says. “That proves — check it out — that proves that black lives don’t matter.” \nThe man walks back toward his car, where a woman shouts from the passenger seat. \n“Hey, let me handle this,” the man says, shutting the driver’s side door. “Be a woman.” \nThe man, who pointed out he had children in his car, then tells Levston that he would have “smashed” him if he hadn’t been recording the encounter. \n“A minute ago you were telling me I was threatening your family in traffic, but you don’t think you’re threatening your family by threatening a complete stranger when you don’t have the slightest clue what could be in their car?” Levston says. \nLevston said he was shocked by the encounter, which he hoped would motivate others to vote. \nThe white man’s identity has not been confirmed, but Levston’s video has already been viewed more than 2 million times. \nWatch the (not safe for work) encounter posted online by WMC-TV : About the Author Next on Raw Story >",

      "text": " Share Share on Facebook 2 Comments \nThis is what we need to do next year. We need to let go of Baalke and O'Neil. We need to cut or trade Antoine Bethea, Tramaine Brock, Ahmad Brooks, Michael Whilhoite, Tank, Blaine Gabbert, Bruce Ellington (injury prone) and Kap. Yes Kap. We need to go out and get Nick Foles and Thad Lewis will be his back up. We can keep Ponder as back up or they can battle it out for back up. We need to go out in free agency and get a stud NT and bring back Ian when he's healthy. Use Ian as a back up or to rotate out with the new NT. I think we should go out and get Calais Campbell if he is cheap so he can mentor AA and Buck. We need to get Myles Garrett from Texas A&M with our first pick, hopefully Cleveland wins a couple games and we get first pick. Myles is our Von Miller or Aldon Smith. Next we need to draft a stud ILB - Bamas Rueben Foster, Vandys Zach Cunningham or LSU's Beckwith. Next pick up OLB Wisconsins Vince Biegel. For WR, I think QP can be a 3rd or 4th stringer. Let's see what Eric Rogers can do next year, maybe Smelter and Streater. Keep Kerley. I think Ryan Switzer from UNC will be a Cole Beasley or Wes Welker type. He can also be a return man. I don't think we need to go out and get a 1st round WR. If you look at the Packers, Patriots, Steelers, Saints - they don't have big name WR's. It's the QB play. Don't get me wrong a stud WR will make for a more dynamic offense but we have more holes to worry about like our front 7. Our secondary is young and we don't need to draft any secondary players maybe free agency if we need some veteran presence. I like Dujuan Harris and if Hyde can stay healthy we are good. Keep Shaun Draughn. Cut or trade Mike Davis. For offensive line, maybe we could pick up a 6th or 7th rounder back up C like we did with Trent Brown and trade Marcus Martin. I also think we need a TE to compliment McDonald who has finally emerged. I think one in free agency. I don't know if any of you have seen this guy in college but he could be a project either a 7th or UDFA, Phazahn Odom. He's from Fordham. He's 6'8\" 245. I think he would be a nightmare mismatch in the redzone. Bulk him up and see what he could become. \nNow for my 2018 Draft pick. If we can get most of what I wrote above then these are the two I want in 2018. Do whatever it takes. Lamar Jackson from Louisville or Jake Browning from Washington. And my other pick Alvin Kamara from Tenessee. Unless he comes out early and goes into the 2017 draft. He's a RB, but I thought he was a receiver. He's awesome! If you haven't seen him play, watch tape on him. He can be a returner or a receiver. Whatever it takes. Get these 2. Nick Foles can start in 2018 while one of the two learn the system and by the end of the season or next we have our QB of the future. \nI had to get this off my chest. I am a die hard niner fan and it's killing me to see what the niners have become when just a few seasons ago we were super bowl contenders. What do you guys think?

      "text": "\nUndercover sting nabs California mother selling ceviche through Facebook group The Washington Post 1 hr ago Samantha Schmidt © Courtesy of Mariza Ruelas Mariza Ruelas never expected a plate of ceviche would lead her to the court house and maybe even a possible jail sentence.\nFor more than a year, undercover investigators in San Joaquin County, California tracked the sales of food — such as homemade tamales, tortillas and cakes — through a community Facebook group, a sting that Mariza Ruelas called a “waste of time and resources and taxpayers’ money.”\nRuelas, a single mother of six, first came across the Facebook group about two years ago when she needed a last-minute cake for her daughter’s quinceañera, the Hispanic coming-of-age celebration on a young woman’s 15th birthday.\nThe community forum, 209 Food Spot, allowed Stockton, Calif. residents to share recipes, organize potlucks and occasionally sell or exchange food items.\nAs a hobby, about once a month, Ruelas began offering up her own dishes — a tray of rice and beans in exchange for a birthday cake, her staple chicken-stuffed avocados to those who requested it, she said in a phone interview with the Post.\nThen, in July, she received a letter in the mail: she was being summoned to court. Ruelas, along with several other group members, faced citations for two misdemeanors — operating a food facility and engaging in business without a permit. An undercover investigator had ordered a ceviche from her through the Facebook group in October 2015 as part of a sting.\nAt least a half-dozen other members accepted a plea deal of one year of probation, a $235 fine and 40 hours of community service. Ruelas was offered a deal with twice the community service, three years of probation and the $235 fine, so she refused to accept it, she said.\nThe single mother of six is headed to trial and faces up to a year in jail for her misdemeanors.\n“We didn’t see any harm in that,” she said, of selling and exchanging meals through the group. “There wasn’t anybody selling it daily. A lot of times, they were just getting back what they put into the ingredients.”\nShe hadn’t ever looked into obtaining a permit, Ruelas said, because she only sold or exchanged food items once or twice a month at most, as a hobby on occasional weekends. It was an activity she enjoyed sharing with her children, ages 6 through 20, who would help prepare and deliver some of the dishes with her.\nSometimes, during the holidays, Ruelas and her children would donate the meals to the homeless, Ruelas said.\n“The purpose wasn’t to sell food,” Ruelas said. “We wanted to bring something positive to our community.” She mentioned Stockton’s high crime and soaring homicide rates.\n“They took the time to be investigating for over a year now,” she said of her case. “But they can’t solve all these unsolved murders?”\nKelly McDaniel, the San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney, told the local Fox affiliate that the 209 Food Spot Facebook group was sent a warning before charges were filed. She added that selling any food not subject to health department inspection is a danger to the public and undercuts business owners who purchase permits to cook and sell food.\n“People are assuming that I was taking from other businesses,” Ruelas said. “It’s not something that I was trying to make a business out of.”\nRuelas has been out of work for two years, for personal reasons and to care for her children. After paying rent, electricity, water and other monthly bills, she only has $200 per month left for food and necessary shopping, she said. Simply paying the $235 fine for her misdemeanors would be a blow to her family’s finances.\nAlthough she rarely earned much of an income from the food sales through the Facebook group, she occasionally received useful items — such as clothes for the kids — in exchange for food. When a neighbor knew she needed furniture for her home, he offered to give her family couches in exchange for a home-cooked meal.\n“I have two kids that are going to have a birthday party next week and I have no idea what I’m going to do about it,” she said.\nOn Sunday, Ruelas posted a message from her 17-year-old daughter, Mariyah, on Facebook. She said she didn’t want to be home when her mother made phone calls to her lawyer or to reporters about the case. It scared her, she wrote, thinking about her mom going to jail and leaving her and her siblings without a parent.\n“That’s just sad,” Ruelas wrote in the Facebook post. “I need this done already so we can just breathe.”\nMore from Morning Mix\nTrump’s staff reportedly keeping him off Twitter in final days, much to Obama’s amusement\nA ‘colossal failure’ by prosecutors: Juror defends verdict in Oregon standoff trial\n‘Hello Rafael, would you like to sit with me today.’ A child’s simple — and timely — gift.\nGo to MSN Home",

Story from HENRY-FORD-HEALTH-SYSTEM How to Build a Better Sandwich By Antigone Senn, RDN 6:46 a.m. EST November 7, 2016 This story is provided and presented by our sponsor. A nutrient-rich, solid sandwich packs enough punch to easily serve as breakfast, lunch, or dinner – and a half-sandwich makes a perfect snack. (Photo: Shutterstock) \nSandwiches are a staple of many Americans’ daily diets, and it’s no wonder: Throwing one together makes busy mornings easier. Plus, a sandwich is an ideal way to package a meal’s worth of nutrition into one tidy bundle. A solid sandwich packs enough punch to easily serve as breakfast, lunch, or dinner – and a half-sandwich makes a perfect snack. \nSandwiches are quick, convenient and they’re a seamless way to get a variety of flavors and nutrients in one bite. But while some sandwiches are stellar nutrition-wise, others can devastate a diet as soon as you sink your teeth into them. (Grilled cheese and double meat, we’re looking at you!) Some kid-approved sandwiches, for example, are often loaded with sodium and void of veggies. \nSo, before you bite into your next afternoon delight — or pack that school lunch — here are six suggestions for better sandwich building: Go for the grain. When it comes to bread, whole grain varieties always beat white bread. Whole grains contain more nutrients and fiber than processed breads, therefore are healthier and keep you feeling full for longer. Look for whole or sprouted grain, spelt, oat and rye bread, wraps or tortillas and check the label for sodium content. Quick tip: If you’re concerned about sodium and calories (both of which can be high in bread), consider serving your sandwich open-face with one slice. Or ditch the bread altogether and wrap your favorite fillings with a gigantic lettuce leaf instead. Choose innovative spreads. Rather than smearing your bread with mustard, ketchup and mayo, experiment with bolder-flavored and more nutrient-rich options such as hummus, guacamole, olive tapenade and tzatziki. Quick tip: Skip the spread altogether or opt for thinly sliced avocado and cracked black pepper instead. Focus on healthy fillers. Lean protein including chicken, low-sodium turkey breast and fish are solid choices. For vegetarians, nut butters, portabella mushrooms, tofu and tempeh are nutritious options. Quick tip: Watch the cold cuts. Even lean turkey can be loaded with fat and sodium. And ditch the cheese atop your lean protein, or at least tear the slice in half and pair the second half with a piece of whole fruit or raw veggies for a satisfying afternoon snack . Pile on the veggies. Fresh vegetables such as lettuce, tomato, peppers and cucumbers add color, crunch and texture to your sandwich – and deliver important nutrients like vitamin C and antioxidants. A bonus: Most veggies are loaded with fiber, which help keep hunger pangs at bay. Quick tip: If you’re packing your sandwich in the morning, put veggies in a separate container or baggie and add to your sandwich at lunchtime. That way, you won’t have to bite into soggy bread. Add seasonal extras. Eating the identical sandwich most days? Avoid the same-old by selecting seasonal extras like thinly sliced apples in the fall, mushrooms in the winter, nectarines in the spring and strawberries in the summer. That burst of flavor and texture elevates an otherwise drab dish. Quick tip: Use fresh fruit instead of jam for peanut or almond butter sandwiches. Almond butter and sliced bananas or strawberries is a kid (and Elvis) favorite! ​ Pay attention to portions. Most sandwiches are loaded up with spreads, fillers and other extras. To keep your sandwich from turning into a calorie bomb, aim for 3- to 4-ounce portions of protein (including meat and cheese) and go lighter on condiments. Quick tip: Slice your sandwich in half, especially if you’re purchasing your afternoon meal at a restaurant or deli where portions sizes are already over-the-top. Store the second half in the fridge and you’ll have a ready-made meal the next day. \nAntigone Senn, RDN (Photo: Henry Ford Health System) \nAntigone Senn is a registered dietitian nutritionist who specializes in nutrition counseling and health coaching at Henry Ford Health System’s Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. \nFor more tips on healthy eating, staying active and more, visit henryfordlivewell.com and subscribe to receive a weekly email with our latest posts. 2 CONNECT EMAIL MORE",

Video by Dave Berman/FLORIDA TODAY. Posted Nov. 4, 2016. \nThis has been an election campaign like no other in history, and we plan coverage like never before as votes and reaction come in from around the nation and from our own backyard. \nWhat is the same, though, is that the experts are saying Florida might again get to decide the next president of the United States. Not only is everyone watching Florida, but specifically, Central Florida, which explains why so many people with U.S. Secret Service protection have spent so much time campaigning here. \nIt has been unusual, with charges and counter charges accusing everyone else of being corrupt and even that the election results will be rigged. Even the media’s behavior has been called into question. \nWhat to expect from us \nI want you to know exactly what you can expect from FLORIDA TODAY and floridatoday.com . Backed by the power of the USA TODAY NETWORK, our team is working hard to bring you the best and most complete election results. \nIt all begins at 7 a.m. Tuesday with the opening of polls in Brevard County and continues around the clock until America elects a new president and Florida elects a U.S. senator. We’ll begin to have local results shortly after polls close at 7 p.m., but keep in mind Florida has two time zones. Some statewide results will not be released until after 8 p.m. Eastern time (7 p.m. Central) to account for that. Buy Photo \n'I Voted' 2016 Presidential Election sticker. (Photo: BOB GABORDI/FLORIDA TODAY) \nLocally, our journalists will roam around Brevard voting places throughout the day, talking with voters and posting updates online. We’ll keep you in the loop, but we ask that you do the same for us: \nIf you see or hear something out of the ordinary, we ask that you call 321-242-3623 and speak to a reporter or use the hashtag #321vote to alert us. We ask that you send photos and videos, too. \nTuesday night, you’ll be able to track Brevard and national election results as they come in on floridatoday.com . Follow our charts and color-coded maps as states around the country make their decisions on the presidency. \nWe’ll have a reporter in Tallahassee, too, staying in touch with key state elections officials, the governor’s office, Florida Department of Law Enforcement and generally looking for problems at polls, complaints and elections issues. \nWhile FLORIDA TODAY reporters keep a close watch on what is happening in Brevard, ­our USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida team will have reporters with U.S. Senate candidates Marco Rubio and Patrick Murphy. \nWe will have reporters watching for the results and irregularities from every county. As soon as we know something – really know something – we’ll post updates on floridatoday.com and FLORIDA TODAY’s Facebook and Twitter accounts. Subscribers to FLORIDA TODAY apps will get push alerts of breaking news. Got a smartphone? Download Florida Today's apps \nWe also have reporters assigned to cover the hotly debated Amendment 1 and Amendment 2 ballot issues and the other amendments as well. \nTaking advantage of technology that worked extremely well to help keep you informed during Hurricane Matthew, our team will break news using Facebook Live video as well as on floridatoday.com. Those breaking news reports will come from local reporters and our partners around the state and at USA TODAY. When news happens, we’ll go live that minute. \nFrom 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., our Matt Reed will be live on WEFS television with results and analysis that will simultaneously stream live on floridatoday.com. \nEvery half hour, USA TODAY will talk to reporters from around the country in key battleground states live on FLORIDA TODAY’s Facebook page. Here’s the schedule for talking with Florida reporters: \n7:30 p.m.: Isadora Rangel from Treasure Coast Newspapers \n9:30 pm.: Jeff Burlew from the Tallahassee Democrat \n10 p.m.: Matt Reed from FLORIDA TODAY . \nAt some point after that, Reed and elections editor John McCarthy will go on Facebook Live and floridatoday.com to wrap up the local election and tell you what we know nationally. \nBecause this is so vital and as a service to our community and nation as all eyes turn to Florida, we’re opening access to floridatoday.com to all on Tuesday and Wednesday, as will all news sites in the USA TODAY NETWORK across the nation. Election night deadlines; free digital access \nFor print readers, we’ll start the presses as late as possible to try to get the results in our Wednesday morning newspapers. We have added additional trucks and are pulling out all the stops, but even so, with an election predicted to be as close as this one is predicted to be, we can’t guarantee that will happen, just as we couldn’t in the 2000 election. \nBut there will be no guesswork, no jumping the gun. There will be no “Dewey Defeats Truman” banner headlines here. Our promise to you includes this: Whenever history is made, you can count on us to bring it to you. But we want to record it, not make it. \nNow be sure to vote. History awaits your decision. \nBob Gabordi is executive editor at Florida Today.

      "text": "Facebook threatens LinkedIn with job opening features Posted Oryx nano antennas allow autonomous cars to see farther, better \nFacebook might muscle-in on LinkedIn’s recruiting business with ways for business Pages to promote job listings. The new Jobs features could give companies another reason to drive traffic to their Facebook Page beyond marketing their products in the News Feed, while also allowing them to pay the social network to get their open position in front of more candidates. \nToday TechCrunch spotted a Jobs tab on its Page, and now Facebook confirms it’s experimenting with a slew of recruiting features. A Facebook spokesperson tells me “Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates.” \nThe new features could compete with LinkedIn, as well as developers like Work4, Workable, and Jobscore that build “Jobs” tab applications that businesses can embed in their Facebook Pages. Perhaps Facebook was prepping for these new features when it added Profile Tags last year that mimic LinkedIn’s endorsements feature. \nA new Facebook option in the status update composer allows Pages to formally share a job opening with related details like job title, salary, or if it’s full-time vs part-time. The special formatting could differentiate job postings from other content and attract eyeballs amongst the crowded News Feed. \nThese job postings will also show up in a Jobs tab of the Page, creating a dedicated landing place where companies can send job seekers. Businesses would get the added benefit of potentially gaining new followers whether or not someone inquires about the open position, compared to a relatively static Careers page on company’s website. \nJob postings will include an “Apply Now” button that launches a standard job application flow, but pre-populated with information from a user’s public profile. That could help people quickly apply for multiple jobs without typing in redundant information. \nSubmitted applications will be received by the Page as a Facebook Message. Though this could bolster Facebook’s push to get businesses using its chat feature, it also might be clumsy for companies to mix job applications in with the customer support requests they typically get via Facebook messages. The potential option to forward job applications to the email address of the company’s recruiter might work better. \n\nBusinesses will also be able to pay to show their News Feed job postings to more people, directly competing with some of LinkedIn’s ad offerings. Facebook’s opportunity here combines its ubiquitous reach, personal data, and engagement. \nPretty much everyone has a Facebook profile, which are often filled with extensive information about their past jobs titles, employers, education, and interests. Recruiters can target job posting ads with all this data so they reach people with the right credentials. And since people browse Facebook constantly, those users are likely to eventually see the ads. \nFor comparison, not everyone has a LinkedIn profile. It has 467 million members compared to the 1.79 billion on Facebook. Many LinkedIn users only visit when they’re updating their profile about a new job, or are actively looking for one. But Facebook could reach people not even thinking about a job, yet could be convinced to apply for the chance at a higher salary. \nThat’s the same reason Facebook has been able to build giant brand and performance advertising businesses despite Google’s traditional dominance. You might search on Google when you know what you want to buy, or on LinkedIn if you know you want a job, and their ads can help with demand fulfillment. Facebook offers demand generation, drumming up interest people didn’t know they had. \nWith Microsoft’s $26.2 billion cash acquisition of LinkedIn expected to go through soon, Facebook may be looking to capitalize on the confusion or product stagnation. 0",

      "text": "  Mind , Wellness By AGENCY \nA person’s Facebook activity might be a window into their health and even predict their odds of dying in the short term, a new study suggests. \nResearchers stop short of saying that using the social networking website will either hasten or delay illness or death, but they conclude that how a person interacts on the site might say a lot about their level of risk. \n“We can’t say using Facebook is good for you, but I think the study provides evidence that it’s probably not bad for you,” said James Fowler, the study’s senior author, from the University of California, San Diego. \n  that people with more friends and social ties in their community tend to live longer, Fowler and his coauthors, which include a representative from Facebook, write in the Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences . Social connections may promote healthy behaviours, improve immunity and reduce inflammation, the research team writes. \nBut past studies focused on real-life interactions, and it’s been less clear if the same was true for online social connections. \nFor the new study, the researchers used data on about 12 million Facebook users who joined before October 2010. The users were in their 20s through 60s. The more you add people on your Facebook the better your health. Oddly, this doesn’t include sending out friend requests. \nThe study team then tracked deaths and causes of death in the next couple of years by matching subjects to deaths on the state’s public health records in 2012 and 2013. \nIn one analysis, the researchers found that Facebook users were 12% less likely to die during that time. \nFor their other analyses, researchers focused solely on Facebook users and analysed online activities like sending and accepting “friend requests,” posting photos and “liking” other people’s updates. \nPeople who were popular and accepted the most friend requests were about 34% less likely to die than those who accepted the fewest requests. \nThere was no benefit in sending the most friend requests, though. This is a little disappointing since seeking out new friendships may not lead to health benefits, Fowler said. \nHaving an active social life offline may also have a lower risk of dying. Researchers found that people who posted the most photos and the fewest “status updates” were about 30% less likely to die over the study period than the average Facebook user. \nBut there was no decreased risk of death for those with the most online-only activities, such as writing wall posts or messages. \n“We didn’t see any relationship between Facebook ‘likes’ and health,” said lead author William Hobbs, of Northeastern University in Boston. \nThe findings suggest real-life interactions drive any possible decrease in a person’s risk of death, according to the researchers. Their analysis suggests the lowest risk of death was among people tagged in the most Facebook photos and those who engage on the website a moderate amount. \nKnowing the signs of healthy behaviour or risk might lead to ways of using Facebook to identify people at risk and promote healthy interventions, according to Fowler. \nFor instance, knowing that certain activities on Facebook are tied to an increased risk of death from causes like suicide or heart disease can help researchers design programs that will flag the risk and allow a user’s friends to intervene, he said. \n“These are really inexpensive interventions that can reach hundreds, thousands and possibly even millions of people,” said Dr Michael Thase, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. \nSimilar programs could possibly be run through other social media, too, said Thase, who wasn’t involved with the new study. \n“The monitoring function that’s possible with social media – to know risks – is a good thing,” he said. – Reuters/Andrew M.

      "text": "The nation’s eyes are fixed on Maine’s 2nd District Danielle McLean | BDN Find on Facebook Posted Nov. 07, 2016, at 6:09 p.m. \nLEWISTON, Maine — A Democratic congressional candidate’s visit to Lewiston’s iconic political hotspot and late stumping in the city by a surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton highlighted the elevated role Maine’s 2nd District plays in this year’s national election calculus. \nBut for Joseph and Anne Rafferty of Turner, who were sitting in a corner booth at Simones’ Hot Dog Stand, the classic downtown campaign stop co-owned with their daughter, the Democrats’ late courtship proved unconvincing. They hope that Republican nominee Donald Trump will be elected Tuesday. \n“He’s unique. He’s exciting. We’ve had 30 years of Hillary,” said Anne Rafferty of the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. “We’ve had enough of the Clintons. It’s time for a change.” \nMany in Maine’s toss-up 2nd District feel that way, and it’ll be one of the most heavily watched battleground areas in the nation on Tuesday in a Democratic state that hasn’t given any of its four Electoral College votes to a Republican since 1988. Story continues below advertisement. \nClinton held a statewide polling lead in October, and FiveThirtyEight gave her a 79 percent chance of winning three statewide electors. But as of 5 p.m. Monday, Trump had become a 51 percent bet in the more rural and conservative 2nd District, where his strong September polling lead shrunk in October. \nThe New York City billionaire visited Maine five times in the campaign, capping the courtship with an October rally at a Christian school in Lisbon, which borders Lewiston, Maine’s second-largest city. \nThe city is a southern 2nd District stronghold with a rich Democratic history. John F. Kennedy appeared in the downtown City Park on the Sunday before Election Day in his successful 1960 presidential campaign. \nBut Lewiston has had a recent conservative streak. Trump endorser Gov. Paul LePage was born in Lewiston, winning it in his 2010 and 2014 elections. U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin lost it in 2014 but became the first Republican to win the 2nd District in 20 years. He’s facing a nationally targeted rematch against Democrat Emily Cain, who campaigned at Simones’ on Monday. \nThe backdrop to this rise is an influx of African immigrants , most of them from Somalia. More than 7,000 have come to the Lewiston area since 2000. \nAt times, the sharp demographic change caused political tension: In 2002, then-Mayor Larry Raymond wrote a letter discouraging further immigration because of a strain on city resources, and 10 years later, Mayor Robert Macdonald got national attention for telling immigrants in a BBC documentary to “leave your culture at the door.” \nMacdonald backed Trump in late 2015 . He won a third term last December during the nominee’s political rise . Trump has called for “extreme vetting” for Muslim immigrants . He invoked Maine’s Somali population at an August rally in Portland alongside a riff on crimes committed by immigrants, even though Lewiston’s crime rate fell by 23 percent between 2005 and 2014 . \nAlso central to Trump’s push in Maine is his party-bucking stance against free trade agreements that have been blamed for domestic manufacturing job losses. National Republicans largely back such agreements, but opposition to them is bipartisan here, with the Maine House of Representatives unanimously passing a resolution against the Trans-Pacific Partnership earlier this year. \nBoth Trump and Clinton oppose it, but Clinton made statements in support of it during her stint as secretary of state, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, backed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which a 2003 study for the Maine Legislature said could have cost the state hundreds of jobs. \nPeter Navarro, a University of California economist who serves as a top policy adviser to Trump, said Trump “revolutionized the Republican Party” with his trade stance standing in contrast to his primary opponents and Clinton’s record. \n“So, this is Maine’s time,” Navarro said. “This is the chance to elect Trump and be heard on this issue, and I’ll tell you what — those electoral votes are going to matter on Election Day.” \nBut former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who ran against Clinton in the Democratic primary and was on a campaign swing for her from Portland to Bangor via Lewiston on Monday, called Trump a “hypocritical bottom-feeder” who “cries crocodile tears in front of closed factories” while manufacturing many of his products overseas . \n“Hillary Clinton believes in building an economy that works for everybody, where people can actually get ahead when they work hard,” O’Malley said. \nThe parties were hard at work across Maine on Monday: The Maine Democratic Party said 1,500 volunteers are at work in the 2nd District, with 100 out of the Lewiston office. In the afternoon at the Maine Republican Party’s regional office in Auburn, 15 people worked the phones. \nAt Simones’ for lunch, Terry Klitsch of Lewiston said she’ll vote for Clinton because Trump has “stomped on a lot of little people, and I’m a little person.” Stan Staples of Lewiston also is with Clinton, because “she knows what she’s doing” and Trump wants to “put people down and fight.” \nBut Marc Oshansky of Auburn was in the restaurant wearing Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat, citing the controversy over Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state. It reached another climax on Sunday with the FBI standing by a July decision not to recommend charges . \n“I have a hard time overlooking what she’s done, and I just don’t know how well she’ll do,” Oshansky said. \nOn Monday, an African immigrant was walking in the downtown park now named for Kennedy. He said doesn’t have a home here yet, but he is staying in Auburn and can’t vote. If he could, he said he’d back Clinton. \n“Hillary wants immigrants,” he said in French, the language of the immigrants who changed Lewiston in the 1800s. “But Trump, he does not need immigration.” \nThen, he left without giving his name to meet people on Bates Street wearing a Maine wardrobe staple: A blue backpack from L.L. Bean.",

      "text": "Is Facebook replacing the front porch? Monday Nov 7, 2016 at 7:16 PM Residents tend to turn to their smartphones or computers to get street-level news. But that doesn't mean newspapers and other media, and face-to-face conversations are endangered. By Christina McCune Independent staff writer \nHow will you find out who voters select today as America's next president? \nWill you watch this newspaper's website for updates? Will you be glued to the TV or radio all night? Will you have your thumb hovering over your smartphone, swiping between Facebook and Twitter? Or will you wait until the next morning to read the results in the newspaper? \nAnd, after you learn the news, will you hit social media hard with your comments and emojis of jubilation or anguish? \nFrom worldwide to national and down to neighborhood news, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media and apps are great tools for getting information out quickly to a large audience. So, even at the street level, it makes sense that, when Fido jumps the fence, it's more efficient to post a picture of your pet's furry face on Facebook than to hang up photocopied posters around town. \nOn Facebook, \"You know darn well that someone's going to respond to you right away,\" says Ken Roberts, of Canal Fulton, who oversees Voice of Canal Fulton and other Facebook pages with his wife, Margarita. \"If you can put 'My dog is lost' to 5,000 people, someone is going to see that dog.\" \nFacebook is 24/7, says Roberts, and a good way to access and spread information. \n\"People want to talk,\" he said. \"They want their opinion to be heard. They want to be seen as somebody, and without Facebook, it's hard for people to do that.\" \nThere are numerous social media outlets available and Facebook alone has millions of pages available for nearly every community, topic, hobby, business, and organization. Settings range from public, closed and secret groups. Type the name of your city, village or township — or maybe even street — into Facebook's search field and pages are bound to pop up. \nPeople can throw out any topic on Facebook for others to provide their reactions and comments, but Roberts contends: \"Any real story always comes from the newspaper.\" \n'Celebrate the neighborhood' \nAdam Earnheardt, associate professor and chairman of the Department of Communication at Youngstown State University, uses an app called Nextdoor to bolster friendships with his neighbors. Of course he talks to them in person, but an app or online community helps to further that connection. It's akin to a social gathering that publicly acknowledges the neighborhood, Earnheardt explained. \nAccording to nextdoor.com, the \"private social network for your neighborhood\" is used by more than 117,000 neighborhoods. \nThe app, says Earnheardt, connects neighbors and, \"you can also find out other things, too. If you're looking for an ambitious teenager to cut your grass, that's a good solution. If you're looking to promote a garage or yard sale locally, that's a good option. If you're looking for a babysitter ... Those are good reasons why we might use those apps.\" \nEarnheardt said apps and social media won't stop people from putting up yard sale signs and taking out ads in newspapers. \n\"In one way, the view might be that it, in some ways, disconnects us,\" he said. \"Why would we turn to social media when it's easy to knock on someone's door and talk to them? At the same time, you're able to celebrate the neighborhood. If a kid does well in school or something interesting is going on, it's a way to promote that with pictures and videos and for people to share it and leave comments. I would go a step further and say it's a really nice way to welcome people to the neighborhood. If you've got a new person, with an app like Nextdoor, when you take over that cake for the new neighbors, put in a piece of paper: 'We're also on Facebook or Nextdoor app.'\" \nSome people can say something on a computer they would not say face to face, Roberts said. \nEarnheardt said social media is still fairly new and people are still learning the ropes and figuring out the norms. Posted rules and expectations can be helpful on some group sites as far as types of comments or acceptable language. Administrators are helpful to keep an eye on posts and sometimes users monitor each other. People soon learn which posters to trust when the same person continues to post inaccurate information, Earnheardt said, similar to \"the boy who cried wolf.\" \nAccording to Facebook.com, which was founded in 2004, there were 1.18 billion daily active users on average in September. \nAnd when some of those billions misbehave on Facebook, \"other people will tell them to back off or calm down,\" Roberts said. \"Some people, their only goal is to stir the pot. No matter what you say, no matter how positive, they are going to stir the pot. ... You get a lot of different people involved. Some go there just for the data, to see what's going on. It's not an answer for everything, but it does allow at least people to connect.\" \nRoberts' wife, Margarita, offers a fun page, \"Everything Free in Canal Fulton,\" which is similar to pages in other cities around the world. Literally overnight, hundreds of people began joining the public page. People post free items or let people know they're searching for something, or ask about free items placed at the ends of driveways. Margarita Roberts noted that people on that page have been humble and respectful and followers continue to grow even from surrounding cities. \nJeremy Graber, owner of EnviroCellular, launched \"Voice of Canal Fulton\" in 2010 as a digital newspaper. The page now has more than 5,000 followers. \n\"I launched it like a networking opportunity for people in the community and businesses to network with each other,\" Graber said. \"It just grew from there. It covers a wide variety of topics.\" \nGraber puts a spotlight on local business and issues pertaining to the community are addressed. A lost cat was posted recently, as well as someone inquiring whether others heard what sounded like gunshots in the area. \n\"The page wouldn't be anything if it weren't for the 5,000 members interacting,\" he said. \"... With digital media taking off the way it does, people from here could be on vacation and punch up the newspaper and see what's going on, or they can get in there and send out a shout out like how was the event Saturday night?\" \nThe good and the bad \n\"Facebook is like a sociological slice of society,\" Roberts said. People respond in different ways, but for something like a lost dog, \"it's like a gigantic citywide neighborhood watch.\" \nSgt. Brian Muntean, who posts on the Massillon Police Department Facebook page, has amassed a huge following. Numerous police and fire departments have Facebook pages now. Muntean started one for Massillon after he saw Chief Doug Swartz had started one in Canal Fulton that was popular. \n\"I figured we'd have about 500 followers,\" Muntean said, \"and half of them would be cops. We have about 24,000 people who follow our page. Seeing that we have about 33,000 citizens, that's a pretty good ratio. I would certainly say that's a reflection of our community wanting to be involved/informed as to what is going on around them.\" \nLike anything, Facebook can be good and it can be bad, Muntean said. \n\"It can be a wonderful tool for law enforcement agencies,\" he said. \"It is a great way to get accurate information to the masses quickly and from anywhere at any time. It's also a wonderful way for law enforcement agencies to educate the public. A well-informed populace is a wonderful thing. I feel that it's essential for law enforcement agencies to educate those whom they serve.\" \nMuntean posts a variety of crime-related posts and other items from sports to the weather. This week, he has put in a callout for photos from people for Veterans Day. \n\"I try to keep our Facebook page interesting,\" he said. \"If we were to simply post non-stop crime-related posts, it would flood the Facebook feed daily, because MPD gets nearly 30,000 calls for service every year. I try to post things that affect people's daily lives, keep them interested, and balance it with law-enforcement related topics. \n\"I have to say that our citizens really are something,\" he noted. \"When we call them for back-up, they're there. No matter what it is. They're on it. Every time. We only have 44 full-time officers, but we have 25,000 citizens on stand by.\" \nWhile Facebook can be a useful tool in helping to solve crimes or get information out, it's also difficult to tell sometimes whether information being posted on community pages, such as crime watch Facebook pages, is accurate. \n\"The various pages related to local crime are a wonderful thing,\" Muntean said. \"It tells me that everyday citizens want to help make their communities better. That being said, it's absolutely essential that the information that is put out is accurate. Nothing is worse than misinformation being spread by the masses.\" \nHe advises those who post on Facebook to make sure their information is true. \n\"That also goes for people who comment on such pages,\" he said. \"I know some of our officers do frequent those pages. It's kind of like the digital equivalent of 'the little old lady who watches the neighborhood.'\" \nReach Christina at 330-775-1133 or christina.mccune@indeonline.com. \nOn Twitter: @cmccuneINDE",

      "text": "  \"Jason Sosa vs. Stephen Smith this Saturday\" Facebook \nBy Scott Gilfoid: WBA World super featherweight champion Jason Sosa (19-1-4, 15 KOs) will be looking to score a knockout this Saturday night when he faces #11 IBF fringe contender Stephen Smith (24-2, 14 KOs) at the Salle des Etoilles, in Monte Carlo, Monaco. \nSosa, 28, wants to get an impressive knockout over the 31-year-old Smith. Sosa has got the perfect opponent for him to get a highlight reel KO on Saturday night in my view, because Smith likes to slug it out, even when it’s not in his best interest to do so. \nIf Smith’s trainer doesn’t have him on his bike this Saturday night, we could see him get royally smashed in two or three rounds. Sosa is a wrecking machine right now, and there isn’t anyone that has been able to stand up to him and beat him at his own game in the last five years of his boxing career. \nThe only guy that got the better of Sosa was Tre-Sean Wiggins, who stopped him in the 1st round in September 2010. It would be interesting to see how Wiggins would do against Sosa now, because he’s improved a great deal since that loss. Wiggins’ career has failed to take off unfortunately \nSmith hasn’t done much to deserve a second world title shot after his 12 round unanimous decision loss to International Boxing Federation World super featherweight champion Jose Pedraza last April. Smith has fought once since that time in beating Argentinian journeyman Daniel Eduardo Brizuela by a 7th round knockout last May. \nThis is the same Brizuela who was knocked out in just one round in his last fight by knockout artist Matias Carlos Adrian Rueda (27-1, 24 KOs) last Saturday night in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Rueda can really punch. He’s a dangerous guy, but flawed. Oscar Valdez blasted Ruedas out in two rounds last July to capture the vacant World Boxing Organization featherweight title. \n“It could come down to a war,” said Sosa to skysports.com. “We’ll see how he comes out and then we will adjust and go from there. We try to stay pretty, not just box in your face. We want to go for the stoppage; we want to look impressive and sharp. It’s the first defense so we want to look very good.” \nI’d be very surprised if Smith comes out trying to slug with Sosa. Smith and his trainer have had enough time to study Sosa’s past fights to know that it’s not going to work if they try and punch with him. Sosa got the better of former WBA featherweight champion Nicholas Walters in the slugging department in their fight last December. \nWalters was forced to start boxing Sosa after the 6th round of that match, because he was getting nailed repeatedly by heavy shots. Walters did a good job of rallying to get a draw out of the fight, but he clearly failed at trying to KO Sosa. Smith isn’t in the same class as Walters or Sosa in the power and slugging department. That’s why I would be highly surprised if Smith even tries to punch with him early on. I do think Smith will revert to his normal brawling style of fighting by the 4th or 5th round, because his brawling style is too well ingrained at this point in his career. He’s not going to be able to change his basic nature to want to punch it out with his opponents. \n“I fought Nicholas Walters, a world champion and one of the most feared at 126lbs, then I fought Fortuna who had never been stopped and I ended up knocking him out, so I do believe I have fought better competition than Smith,” said Sosa. \nSosa fought well in scoring an 11th round knockout over Javier Fortuna last June to capture his WBA title. Sosa had to get up off the canvas in the 5th round to come back to KO Fortuna in the 11th. Sosa showed a lot of heart and determination to keep slogging ahead after things looked bleak for him in the 5th round. \nSosa had to put a lot of pressure on Fortuna to get the KO, because he was moving all around the ring. I Smith tries to use a lot of movement on Saturday night, I see him failing to win the fight because Sosa does a good job of cutting off the ring to get the knockout. Sosa never gave up in that fight, as he was trailing on all three of the judges’ scorecards by the scores of 96-91 95-92 and 94-93 at the time of the stoppage in the 11th. \nAlso on the Sosa vs. Smith card is heavyweight contender Luis “King Kong” Ortiz facing Malik Scott for the vacant WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight title, super middleweight contender Martin Murray facing Dmitri Chudinov in a 12 round fight, and WBA World bantamweight champion Jamie McDonnell defending his title against Liborio Solis.

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nThe Breakers have suffered a major setback in their Australian national basketball league campaign with American import Ben Woodside ruled out for a couple months with a serious foot injury. \nWoodside was injured in overtime during last weeks win over Melbourne rupturing ligaments in his right foot and will be out for a minimum of six to eight weeks. Ben Woodside will be missing from the Breakers lineup for up to eight weeks. Photo: Photosport \n\"It is not good news for Ben and right now we are all feeling for him. I guess everyone kind of knew when he suffered the injury that it was a relatively serious one, he was in a lot of pain and it was clear that he was going to be out for some time,' said coach Paul Henare. \nThe club has moved quickly to find an international replacement with Henare hoping to have another import on court by Friday night for the side's next game against Brisbane. \n\"Knowing that Ben was going to be out for a number of weeks we have already set the wheels in motion to find a replacement,\" said Henare. \n\"We have already had a response from our agent and are working through a number of options and believe we will sign a quality player. \n\"This league can be over before you blink an eye, we are already a quarter of the way through the season, every game is vital so we cannot waste any time in seeking a replacement.\" \nHenare said Woodside was a major loss. \n\"Ben has quickly become one of the leaders in our group and the chemistry that he was building with the rest of the team was exactly what we expected when we signed him. \nWoodside said the injury has come at the worst possible time. \n\"Just as we were finding our chemistry as a group, just when we were moving in the right direction and we were establishing a real understanding.\" \nA decision on whether Woodside will remain with the club is yet to be made.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \n(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday, it was testing a feature that would let page administrators create job postings and receive applications from candidates, a move that could pressure LinkedIn Corp's (LNKD.N) recruiting business. \n\"Based on behavior we've seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we're running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,\" a company spokesman told Reuters. \nLinkedIn makes most of its revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on what's often known as the social network for business. \nTechnology news website TechCrunch first reported the news on Monday. ( http://tcrn.ch/2fwHLSB ) \nWith Facebook's jobs features, companies could drive more traffic to their Facebook pages while allowing them to pay the social network to get their job openings in front of more candidates, TechCrunch said. \nIn October, Facebook launched Marketplace to allow people to buy and sell items locally as the social media network tries new ways to keep its users engaged. \n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler) U.S. oil prices steady ahead of election, but oversupply still weighs Reuters - 21 minutes ago By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable early on Tuesday after posting strong gains the previous day, with investors piling money into financial markets in expectation that Democrat ... … More » Dollar steady ahead of U.S. presidential election Reuters - 34 minutes ago The dollar steadied in Asia on Tuesday, keeping gains made in the previous session on the growing prospect of a victory for U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after the FBI cleared her of any possibility of criminal charges in … More » Asian shares, dollar, ride high as Clinton looks more likely to win election Reuters - 35 minutes ago Asian shares rose in early Asian trade on Tuesday ahead of the U.S. presidential election, with investor sentiment buoyed by improving prospects for Democrat Hillary Clinton to win.

Post to Facebook Randy Moss caught a salmon with one hand before MNF Of course he did.  //usat.ly/2fxMJwl   Randy Moss caught a salmon with one hand before MNF Andrew Joseph 8:24 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 \nScreenshot (Photo: Vine) \nRandy Moss made some great catches in his NFL career, but that was with a football. At some point, that stops being impressive, so Moss needed to step up his game to prove to everyone that he still has it . \nThat time came before Monday night's Bill-Seahawks game in Seattle. \nESPN had the famous fish throwers from the Pike Place Market visit CenturyLink Field and put the crew's fish-catching skills to the test. \nMoss fared quite well. \nHow's that for a one-handed catch of a flying salmon? Very impressive, indeed. \nIt's worth pointing out that Moss has been spectacular at these pregame challenges on Monday Night Countdown . A couple weeks ago, he was the only one to make 28-yard field goal . He was wearing dress shoes. \nNow, he's making highlight grabs on salmon tosses. The dude is good at sports. Yes, fish catching is sports. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fxMJwl Most Popular",

Post to Facebook Randy Moss caught a salmon with one hand before MNF Of course he did.  //usat.ly/2fxMJwl   Randy Moss caught a salmon with one hand before MNF Andrew Joseph 8:24 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 \nScreenshot (Photo: Vine) \nRandy Moss made some great catches in his NFL career, but that was with a football. At some point, that stops being impressive, so Moss needed to step up his game to prove to everyone that he still has it . \nThat time came before Monday night's Bill-Seahawks game in Seattle. \nESPN had the famous fish throwers from the Pike Place Market visit CenturyLink Field and put the crew's fish-catching skills to the test. \nMoss fared quite well. \nHow's that for a one-handed catch of a flying salmon? Very impressive, indeed. \nIt's worth pointing out that Moss has been spectacular at these pregame challenges on Monday Night Countdown . A couple weeks ago, he was the only one to make 28-yard field goal . He was wearing dress shoes. \nNow, he's making highlight grabs on salmon tosses. The dude is good at sports. Yes, fish catching is sports. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fxMJwl Most Popular",

      "text": "News LeBron James campaigned for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland on Sunday. (Image via Facebook). \nFBI: Nothing to see here… More than a week after FBI Director James Comey wrote a letter to members of Congress saying the bureau was reopening its investigation into emails related to Hillary Clinton, he told lawmakers on Sunday that it has not changed its opinion from July . While Comey criticized Clinton’s use of a private email server this summer, he said at the time she should not face criminal charges. Global financial markets were up on the news . Obama lets it fly at Florida campaign stop. President Obama was even more critical of Donald Trump than usual at a Sunday campaign stop in Florida, telling the crowd , \"If someone can’t handle a Twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear codes.\" The president singled out Trump’s misrepresentation of Obama’s handling of an event protester on Friday. Polls show Clinton lead. The final NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll showed a four-point lead for Hillary Clinton, the same as the previous week. Bloomberg’s final poll has Clinton leading Trump by three points nationally, though it surveyed voters before Comey announced the FBI was sticking with its earlier decision to not recommend charges against Clinton. Nate Silver’s verdict : Clinton is ahead, but it’s a close race. Philly transit strike over. Southeastern Pennsylvania’s SEPTA mass transit system has reached an agreement with its employee union, meaning trains and buses will be running on Election Day. Democrats had feared that a transit strike in the critical state could have dampened turnout. LeBron takes to the stump. Basketball superstar LeBron James campaigned for Clinton on Sunday in Cleveland, and Khizr Khan stumped for the former secretary of state in New Hampshire. Clinton is striking a broad tone about bringing the country together in the final hours of her campaign, and her team is forking over millions to run a two-minute ad nationally with unifying themes.",

      "text": "BRUSSELS (REUTERS) - Britain's privacy watchdog said on Monday (Nov 7) that Facebook has agreed to suspend using data from British users of its WhatsApp messaging app after the watchdog said consumers weren't properly protected.\nThe watchdog said the social media giant faces action if it uses such data without valid consent.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had said in August that it would monitor WhatsApp's new privacy policy, after WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, said it would share user data with its parent company.\n\"We're pleased that they've agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes,\" the head of ICO, Elizabeth Denham, said in a statement. \"If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, they may face enforcement action from my office,\" she said.\nThe regulator said it had also asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to better explaining to customers how their data would be used and to give them ongoing control over the information.\nHowever, the companies have so far not agreed. \"We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook hasn't agreed,\" Ms Denham said.\nFacebook and WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe two companies have also come under scrutiny from the wider group of the EU's 28 data protection authorities, who last month requested that the popular messaging service pause sharing users' data with its parent company until the appropriate legal protections could be assured.\nMs Denham said she did not think users had been given enough information about what Facebook would do with their data and that WhatsApp had not obtained valid consent.\nEnforcement action could ultimately lead to fines. Such fines are small compared to the revenues of the companies concerned. However, a new EU-wide data protection law coming into force in 2018 would change that with fines of up to 4 per cent of global turnover.\nMs Denham said she would keep pushing the issue along with other privacy watchdogs, notably the Irish authority which has the most sway over Facebook since the US company's European headquarters are in Ireland.\nTopics:  BRITAIN FACEBOOK SOCIAL MEDIA More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4gft Copy",

      "text": "I chat with a lot of women on Facebook, but few of them agree to meet me. I don’t know them personally, but they agree to my friend requests, so I don’t know why they can’t also agree to meet in person. I am not a creep, so this is weird. If they don’t want to meet new people, why do they accept friend requests from new people? Aren’t these double standards?\nThe ratio of creeps to normal people online is debatable, but I suspect it is past experiences with the former that make most people wary when it comes to meeting new people. Why do you need to meet people you don’t know without an introduction anyway? Can’t your friends introduce you to new people so you both have a common point of contact? Your behaviour does sound mildly creepy, to be honest. These are people you don’t actually know; yet you think it’s perfectly acceptable to ask them out and expect them to agree immediately. Try and look at this from their perspective. And to be perfectly honest, if you were to send me a friend request out of the blue and then ask for a meeting, I’d turn you down too.\n\nIs it normal for someone in a relationship to refuse to share her mobile password details? My girlfriend and I have been together for a year now, but she refuses to give me her password, despite my asking for it often. Does she have something to hide? I have given her my mobile password without a fuss, even though she hasn’t asked for it. What do I do? \nI suspect she hasn’t asked for it because she recognises the notion of personal space, while you clearly do not. Being in a relationship with you does not obligate her to turn over her sense of privacy just to make you feel better. If she doesn’t want to give you her password, that is her prerogative. Accept it, respect her decision and grow up.",

      "text": "Facebook takes on LinkedIn with new job opening features Reuters Email Author \nFacebook Inc said on Monday, it was testing a feature that would let page administrators create job postings and receive applications from candidates, a move that could pressure LinkedIn Corp's recruiting business. \n\"Based on behavior we've seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we're running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,\" a company spokesman told Reuters. \nLinkedIn makes most of its revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on what's often known as the social network for business. \nTechnology news website TechCrunch first reported the news on Monday. \n\"With Facebook's jobs features, companies could drive more traffic to their Facebook pages while allowing them to pay the social network to get their job openings in front of more candidates,\" TechCrunch said. \nIn October, Facebook launched Marketplace to allow people to buy and sell items locally as the social media network tries new ways to keep its users engaged.

      "text": "Facebook wants to replace LinkedIn as the essential platform for job seekers Saqib Shah Pin it Share Facebook has its sights set on LinkedIn's crown with the test launch of a job openings tab for business Pages. Thanks to its massive audience, the social network could turn out to be a real threat in the online recruitment space. More Facebook has its sights set on poaching LinkedIn’s 467 million users with the limited launch of its latest feature aimed at businesses and job seekers. The new test sees select Facebook Pages receive access to a “jobs” tab which can be used to advertize new positions, and actively recruit workers. The section, first spotted by TechCrunch , marks the start of an experimental stage that could eventually see the company roll out a number of new recruitment features. If LinkedIn wasn’t worried about the social network in the past, it has every reason to be now. More: Facebook battle-testing the placement of Instant Games within Messenger “Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” said a Facebook spokesperson. Facebook broke down the new features for Digital Trends in an emailed statement. Page admins that have access to the jobs tab can now create a job posting using the Page composer. Job post details can include job title, job type (i.e. full-time, intern, part-time), salary info, and more. Job posts will appear along with other Page posts in the News Feed of followers, and within the jobs tab itself. Facebook users can apply for a job by clicking “apply now,” which opens a standard application document complete with pre-populated information from the user’s public profile — meaning it would be handy to update your bio with your work history, if you haven’t done so already. Once submitted, the application will be received by the employer as a message. The advantage of using the feature for businesses of all sizes is quite straightforward: access to an audience of 1.75 billion monthly active users. Whereas Facebook stands to reap extra revenue from employers looking to promote their openings in order to attract more eyeballs. It could also potentially lead to more activity on the site, with users adding more personal info to their Facebook profiles (in the vein of a resume), and businesses running multiple accounts to separate customer service from recruitment. Additionally, the messaging aspect could prove a boon for Facebook Messenger. Despite boasting a huge user base of 1 billion members, Messenger could still do with a boost when it comes to its bot platform . It wouldn’t be hard to imagine bots handling the initial application process (for corporations at least), providing another use case for the burgeoning technology. ",

      "text": "  \"Stephen Smith: Sosa Style Is Perfect for Me\" Facebook \nStephen Smith believes Jason Sosa’s style is perfect for him to become the WBA World Super-Featherweight champion when they clash for the title in Monte-Carlo on Saturday November 12, live on Sky Sports. \nSmith challenges for World honours for the second time in 2016 having travelled to Connecticut in April and provided IBF king Jose Pedraza with a stiff test. The Puerto Rican came out on top on points to retain his crown but ‘Swifty’ banked the valuable experience from his first World title fight \nSosa climbed off the canvas in the fifth round to stop Javier Fortuna in the 11th round and claim the title in China in June, and Smith says he can force the champion into mistakes that he will capitalise on to conquer the world at the second attempt. \n“This is chalk and cheese to the Pedraza fight,” said Smith. “Jose is a tall, distance fighter who moves a lot and switches, relies on his skills, and it was always going to be a cagey fight and one that I had to take the fight to him as he’s the champion and that’s how it played out. \n“Sosa is short, strong, known as a big puncher, so I have got to force him into mistakes and use my skills to get him onto my shots. It’s a good fight and one that’s more suited to me, I prefer a style like Sosa than Pedraza. \n“Sosa KO’d Fortuna when he was behind on the cards so you have to have respect for his punch power. I watched his fight with Nicholas Walters and saw a few things and I thought Walters won the fight. He’s got some good results on his CV but the performances aren’t that great. \n“I think I hit as hard as anyone in the division, I’m confident in my power and I believe that if I land flush on him I can really hurt him. I have to use my ability and skill first and foremost though, make him miss and make him look stupid at times. \n“I’ll stick to the game plan and do what I am told, if I land on him he’ll know he’s been hit and I am confident I can hurt him without looking for it. Sosa might come to look to KO me as Pedraza couldn’t and that might play into my hands too. I hope he thinks he can do that – I’d welcome that.” \nSmith’s clash with Sosa is part of a huge night of action in Monte-Carlo as the most feared Heavyweight on the planet, Luis Ortiz, makes his European debut against Malik Scott for the WBA Inter-Continental title. WBA World Bantamweight king Jamie McDonnell defends his crown against Liberio Solis. It’s the fifth defence for the Doncaster ace, who followed his stoppage win over Javier Chacon with a pair of impressive wins over Tomoki Kameda in Texas last year and stopped Fernando Vargas in nine rounds at The O2 in London this April. Martin Murray is targeting World title action in 2017 but faces a stiff test in the shape of former interim WBA Middleweight champion Dmitry Chudinov.

      "text": "Facebook recently began testing a new camera feature that makes photos and live video look like famous works of art.\nAt first glance, the effects look cool, though not hugely different from those you would get on a number of other image editing apps. You'd be forgiven for dismissing the feature as yet another attempt by the social network to compete with Snapchat.\nBut, behind the scenes, the feature represents one of the company's most significant AI advancements and one that will could help power more artificial intelligence applications.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook's mobile business is bigger than ever\nThe feature, which Facebook is currently testing in Ireland but plans to roll out more broadly \"soon,\" is officially called Style Transfer. Part of a new camera feature in the main Facebook app, it allows you to add stylized filters designed to look like famous works of art to photos and live video.\nWhat sets Style Transfer apart from other photo and video apps, though, is how these effects are able to make their way into the camera in real-time. It uses a type of machine learning called a neural network, which is trained to recreate the styles of famous artists.\nStyle Transfer in action. The feature is rolling out more broadly \"soon.\"\nImage: facebook\nNeural networks are how a lot of AI advancements are made but training a system like this typically requires more power than what a smartphone can deliver. And training a neural network to work locally on a phone in real-time is even more difficult. Competing photo app Prisma also uses local neural networks to enable its photo and video editing but its app takes several seconds to process and apply each filter.\n\"This is a pretty big leap in terms of power of what you can do,\" Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said during a press event in San Francisco.\nAnd while photo and video filters in themselves may not be that interesting, regardless of how they are created, Schroepfer notes that Style Transfer represents just the \"tip of the iceberg\" of what's possible. Eventually, the core technology behind the feature, a new AI framework called Cafe2 Go, will help enable more applications powered by AI and computer vision.\n\"We can create gesture-based controls, where the computer can see where you're pointing and activate different styles or commands,\" Schroepfer writes in a blog post of the tool's potential. \"We can recognize facial expressions and perform related actions, like putting a 'yay' filter over your selfie when you smile.\"\nThat's right, filters that can automatically add themselves to your selfies. While at this point it's still a theoretical update rather than an actual feature, it offers an interesting look at how Facebook could use AI to transform sharing.\nWho knows, it might even help them finally beat Snapchat.\nBONUS: Snapchat's new Spectacles",

      "text": "Facebook plane squadrons will fly 'months at a time' in global connectivity push Facebook's CTO says the company is betting big on connectivity, intelligent machines and immersive technology. | Topic: Tech Industry ZDNet \nLISBON, PORTUGAL: In the next decade, Facebook plans to go beyond social networking in order to boost global Internet connectivity, develop artificial intelligence technology and make virtual reality accessible to everyone. \nSpeaking at the technology conference Web Summit 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer (CTO), revealed Facebook's three long-term goals, set out to take place over the next 10 years. \nThe executive said that Facebook's 10-year-old vision centers on \"the most important problems we are trying to solve.\" \nThe first problem is how to connect everyone around the world to the Internet. It is estimated that 4.1 billion people have no access to the web, and Facebook wants to make sure \"their voices are brought to the Internet.\" \nIn order to do so, Facebook wants to explore how to expand Internet connectivity through both rural and urban areas. The tech giant is not only experimenting with satellites -- despite the failure of the AMOS 6 satellite due to bring the Internet to underserved parts of Africa and being blown up instead in the recent SpaceX disaster -- but wireless technology which does not require miles of cables to be laid. \nOne particular project which Facebook is developing is the creation of a plane able to fly at high altitudes for long periods of time. These solar-powered planes are made of carbon fiber alloys and have the wingspan of a Boeing 737. Each one weighs less than 1000 pounds. \nFacebook says these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are designed to fly \"for months at a time\" and teams of these planes will eventually fly to provide suburban area Internet connectivity. \nRather than laying cables, these UAVs will provide a \"backbone in the sky\" for web connectivity, according to Schroepfer. \nThese UAVs are due to be tested soon in San Jose, California. In the meantime, the technology behind the endurance planes is being made available as part of the open-source Open Compute project and Telecom Infra project. By releasing this research to the open-source community, Facebook says that this can \"dramatically reduce the cost of providing internet access across the world.\" \nFacebook's second long-term goal is to build \"truly intelligent machines capable of managing the mass of information we post online,\" according to Schroepfer. \nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) is already used by Facebook in image recognition and facial detection processes, the company says that AI usage does not have to purely focus on knowledge, but also \"for creation.\" \nThe company hopes that it can eventually create machines which have the same creative spark as humanity. The same neural nets used by us to be creative, perhaps, one day will be used in AI, in order to help us create everything from art to applications in the medical industry. \nThis is not the end of the social network giant's goals, however. Facebook also believes that there is an \"exciting future\" in shifting these neural networks from servers to devices in our pocket, making AI available to all for everything from creative media editing to voice assistants. \nIn the next 10 years, Facebook also plans to promote the research and development of virtual reality (VR) technology. The executive says that Facebook ultimately wants to make VR technology \"cheaper, easy to use and highly distributed,\" and 2016 is the year to do it as component technology \"has caught up\" with the company's software -- and plans. \n\"Like AI, we needed to wait for all the component technology to catch up with us,\" the executive said. \nAccording to Schroepfer, in order to reach these lofty goals for a technology which is still in its infancy when it comes to the consumer market, the tech giant is developing a VR device which does not need any external equipment or a PC to function. \nFacebook's headset, simply dubbed Standalone for now, carries cameras on board which track the position of the user so movements coincide with the virtual world. In addition, the company is working on Touch, a set of virtual reality controllers which focus on hand movements. \nThe devices are currently in prototype stage and will not be on the open market anytime soon. \nSchroepfer commented: \"The future is the ability to connect with the people you care about no matter whether you are a few or hundreds of miles away [...] and experience anything with anyone at any time.\" \nThis week, the social media giant agreed to pause the collection of data belonging to WhatsApp users in the United Kingdom following an investigation conducted by the Information Commissioner's Office. The UK watchdog was concerned about a lack of clarification in relation to recent privacy policy changes, and as such, the social media giant will not collect any more information until data protection safeguards are in place. \nDisclaimer: Web Summit 2016 sponsored the trip to Lisbon, Portugal.",

      "text": "Facebook wants to help you find your next dream job By David Gilbert on Nov 8, 2016 The secret to Facebook’s huge success in recent years was partly its gamble that the smartphone would become our main computing device . Its next big plan is to move Facebook beyond the consumer and make it a serious work tool.\nThe company has already launched Workplace , a Slack competitor that promises the familiarity of a Facebook-like interface but without the annoying cat video updates to distract you from your work. Now the company wants to help you find your next job, and that could spell big trouble for LinkedIn .\nFacebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it will allow businesses to create alerts for vacant positions and set up a dedicated jobs tab on their business page, allowing them to direct potential candidates to all available job listings. Businesses will also be able to promote those positions using targeted ads based on people’s experience, location, education, etc.\nApplicants will be able to apply for jobs directly from Facebook and even auto-populate applications with details from their Facebook profile, saving time if the user is applying for numerous jobs.\nThe company believes that because users put so much information about themselves on the social network already, it is the perfect place to help you find your next job — even if you are not actively looking for one.\nLinkedIn is still seen as the de facto social network for recruitment, making the most money from recruiters, but its 470 million users typically only use the site when updating their profiles with a new position or when they are actively seeking work.\nFacebook’s almost 1.8 billion users are much more regular visitors. As a result, job adverts will be seen by potential candidates who may not be looking for a job at that particular time, but who could be an ideal fit for the company recruiting.\n“Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” a company spokesman told Reuters .\nCover: Lukas Schulze/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images",

Check  //newspr.es/2faDYK9   Join the Conversation To   Today is your day to make a difference The News-Press Editorial Board , mailbag@news-press.com 4:36 p.m. EST November 7, 2016 Election 2016 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAn election cycle for the ages ends today. \nAt some point over the next 24 to 36 hours, we should have a new president of the United States, the balance of power could tip one direction or the other in the U.S. Congress, history will be made on the Lee County school board as it increases from five to seven members and our environment should get a positive endorsement from the electorate through the Conservation 20/20 referendum. \nToday is election day - a day we have been waiting for with plenty of anticipation and relief. On the biggest of stages, will Hillary Clinton become the nation's first woman president? Or will Donald Trump shock the world and move into the White House? Florida figures to play a vital role in outcome. \nIt could be an historic day for Lee County voters as well. A record-breaking 60 percent of the electorate (255,811) has already cast ballots by mail or in early voting. If 29 percent of the remaining registered voters show at the polls today, the 89 percent would beat the previous mark of 88.37 percent set in 1992. Should just 12 percent vote today, the turnout would match the average of 72.62 percent voter turnout since 1976. \nA review of our local, state, federal endorsements: \nLEE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD \nDistrict 2: Jeanne Dozier \nAs the board expands from five to seven members this year, Dozier's knowledge of policy, procedure and classroom curriculum will be important. \nDistrict 6: Jane Kuckel \nFormer board member Kuckel remains our choice for the newly created at-large seat. Her opponent is Don Armstrong, another former board member. Kuckel brings not only that past experience but also a strong knowledge of policy adoption and academic knowledge to the seat. \nDistrict 7: Cathleen Morgan \nWe endorsed veteran board member Morgan over Chris Quackenbush for the new at-large seat. Her leadership has been crucial in helping reverse poor decisions, including opting out of state testing. As board chair, she initiated more board workshops to help improve working relationships and planning. \nLEE COUNTY SHERIFF: Mike Scott \nAs was the case when we endorsed him in the primary, his administrative and community experiences, outweigh his opponent's. His opponent in the general election is James Didio, a former Lee deputy who is non-party affiliated. \nLEE COUNTY COMMISSION \nDistrict 5: Frank Mann \nThe incumbent remains our choice over Democrat Diane Zigrossi and NPA Sonny Haas. If elected, this will begin Mann's 13th year – and third consecutive term — as a commissioner. \nSUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS: Tommy Doyle \nSupporting a need for change, a fresh perspective and business experience remains our reasons to endorse Doyle over incumbent Sharon Harrington. \nFLORIDA HOUSE \nDistrict 76: Ray Rodrigues \nIf elected, this would be Rodrigues' third term. Rodrigues' opponent is Charles Messina, who is non-party affiliated. \nDistrict 79: Matt Caldwell \nThe three-term representative is seeking his final term. He is running against Democrat John Scott and Matt Miller, who is non-party affiliated and a prior candidate for this seat. Caldwell has experience and leadership on many Southwest Florida issues. \nU.S. SENATE: Marco Rubio \nRubio is our choice to continue another six years in the U.S. Senate over his challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. But what we expect from the 45-year-old Rubio, is this: show up for work, embrace global warming and marriage equality. We support Rubio's positions on reinvesting in the space program and in higher education. \nCONGRESS: U.S. House of Representatives \n19th District: Francis Rooney \nRooney agrees with most scientists and environmentalists, supporting storing water and filtering of harmful pollutants that flow from Lake Okeechobee and rerouting water away from the Caloosahatchee. He supports developing policies at the federal level to promote small business creation and growth. His opponent is Robert Neeld, a Democrat. \n17th District: Tom Rooney \nRooney, seeking his fourth term in a district that includes parts of Lee and Charlotte counties, is in a unique position, representing agricultural interests in the communities he represents in DeSoto, Charlotte and Glades counties, as well as taking a leadership role in securing funding for Everglades restoration and water quality efforts throughout the state. His opponents are Democrat April Freeman and John Sawyer, who is non-party affiliated. \nLee County Health Board (District 5): Jessica Carter Peer and Minnie Jackson \nAmendment 1: No on solar \nAmendment 2: Yes on medical marijuana \nBREAKOUT \nCONNECT WITH US ON ELECTION DAY Go to Facebook.com/TheNewsPress for our Election Day coverage all day and into the night.

Yet when readers screencapped their ad preferences, they found that Facebook had used metadata to make inferences for these exact categories. @sidneyfussell I am a gay African American wizard, obviously. pic.twitter.com/OQrJMGunaF \n— Academic Vixen (@Vixen_PhD) October 29, 2016 @sidneyfussell it's definitely scary. I share posts from groups like https://t.co/EaFVuffV0x and such–maybe that's an indicator? \n— Academic Vixen (@Vixen_PhD) October 30, 2016 \nTechnology companies don’t need their users to disclose private information. Just with our clicks, we’re already revealing everything there is to know. \nThe ethical issues surrounding Facebook’s metadata analysis run much deeper than the social network. When in 2013, Edward Snowden leaked classified documents to the press unveiling pervasive dragnet surveillance programs within the NSA, President Obama was careful to emphasize that the government doesn’t retain the content of communications, just the metadata. “The only thing taken, as has been correctly expressed, is not content of a conversation, but the information that is generally on your telephone bill,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein said . \nBut, the New York Times editorial board outlined how powerful metadata collection can be : \n“Using such data, the government can discover intimate details about a person’s lifestyle and beliefs — political leanings and associations, medical issues, sexual orientation, habits of religious worship, and even marital infidelities.” \nSpeaking to The Atlantic about social media companies’ use of metadata , Gabe Rottman of the American Civil Liberties Unionsaid , “What both types of information collection [government and social media] show is that metadata—data about data—can in many cases be more revelatory than content. You see that given the granularity with which private data collection can discern very intimate details about your life.” \nBut the problem with metadata is that it can also be misleading, resulting in incorrect assumptions about people. We saw that too in the responses for our call for people’s Facebook ad preferences profiles. In many cases, Facebook had misidentified users as African American: On @sidneyfussell 's suggestion, I took a look at what 'ethnic affinity' Facebook had assigned me (under ad settings) and..? @shaft pic.twitter.com/pMxra9XvLk",

The app is essentially a new camera feature in the main Facebook app, which allows you to add stylized filters that make photos and live video look like famous work of art. And when you first look at the app, it would instantly remind you of Prisma’s artsy filters or Snapchat ’s comic effects. However, today Facebook released a roadmap, where it explains that this new feature will prove as a breakthrough for Facebook in artificial intelligence-based application and will help it make more progress in the area.

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 08, 2016 US Air Force testing electrical brain stimulation to boost alertness and reduce stress of drone and fighter pilots and found a 30% boost in performance Scientists from the US Air Force and Wright State University (WSU) have demonstrated that it is possible to stimulate the brain using electricity in order to improve an individual's effectiveness in high-pressure situations, particularly when piloting aircraft and remotely-controlling drones. There was a 30% boost in performance. The US military has found over the past few decades that during highly stressful military operations whereby people need to multitask and process a huge amount of information at once, there comes to a point whereby human operators of specialized equipment can no longer take on any new information and process it effectively to make good decisions quickly. The stimulation technique enhanced working memory so that the participants were able to store areas of the screen that had already been observed during the test so that the individuals' brains could focus purely on the remaining tasks they needed to complete. The group that had been consistently zapped by the electric current during the test were better at completing tasks relating to communication and following a target, but the technique did not have a big effect on their scores on the monitoring and resource management tasks. Frontiers of Human Neuralscience - The Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on Multitasking Throughput Capacity Multitasking has become an integral attribute associated with military operations within the past several decades. As the amount of information that needs to be processed during these high level multitasking environments exceeds the human operators’ capabilities, the information throughput capacity reaches an asymptotic limit. At this point, the human operator can no longer effectively process and respond to the incoming information resulting in a plateau or decline in performance. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a non-invasive brain stimulation technique known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to a scalp location over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) to improve information processing capabilities during a multitasking environment. Methods: The study consisted of 20 participants from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (16 male and 4 female) with an average age of 31.1 (SD = 4.5). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups, each consisting of eight males and two females. Group one received 2mA of anodal tDCS and group two received sham tDCS over the lDLPFC on their testing day. Results: The findings indicate that anodal tDCS significantly improves the participants’ information processing capability resulting in improved performance compared to sham tDCS. For example, the multitasking throughput capacity for the sham tDCS group plateaued near 1.0 bits/s at the higher baud input (2.0 bits/s) whereas the anodal tDCS group plateaued near 1.3 bits/s. Conclusion: The findings provided new evidence that tDCS has the ability to augment and enhance multitasking capability in a human operator. Future research should be conducted to determine the longevity of the enhancement of transcranial direct current stimulation on multitasking performance, which has yet to be accomplished.

      "text": "Got a Job Listing? Put it on Facebook 6 hrs ago 0 \nA new Facebook feature aims to take on business social network LinkedIn. \nAs TechCrunch reports, Facebook is experimenting with recruiting tools, including a \"Jobs\" tab, available to select Page administrators. \n\"Based on behavior we've seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we're running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,\" the company told TechCrunch. \nThe pilot program allows Page managers to share job openings—with details like title, salary, and hours—on followers' News Feed. Tap the \"Apply Now\" button to fill out a job application, which comes pre-populated with information from a user's public profile—former job titles, employers, education, interests. Submitted inquiries are sent to the Page via a Facebook message. \nAs TechCrunch points out, LinkedIn's 467 million members—many of whom visit only when updating their profile or looking for a new job—barely hold a candle to Facebook's 1.79 billion regular users. \nNeither company immediately responded to PCMag's request for comment. \nFacebook has dipped its toe into the job search business before: In November 2012, the network launched the Social Jobs Partnership, which tapped into listings from BranchOut, the DirectEmployers Association, Work4Labs, Jobvite, and Monster.com . \nBut LinkedIn isn't the only firm in Facebook's crosshairs. In October, the social media giant took on Craigslist with a new version of Marketplace—an in-app destination to discover, buy, and sell your junk locally. Last week, it moved in on Steam's territory when it launched Gameroom, free to players worldwide on Windows 7 and above. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com . Tags",

      "text": "Facebook has its sights set on poaching LinkedIn’s 467 million users with the limited launch of its latest feature aimed at businesses and job seekers.\nThe new test sees select Facebook Pages receive access to a “jobs” tab which can be used to advertise new positions, and actively recruit workers. The section, first spotted by TechCrunch , marks the start of an experimental stage that could eventually see the company roll out a number of new recruitment features. If LinkedIn wasn’t worried about the social network in the past, it has every reason to be now.\nMore: Facebook battle-testing the placement of Instant Games within Messenger\n“Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” said a Facebook spokesperson.\nFacebook broke down the new features for Digital Trends in an emailed statement. Page admins that have access to the jobs tab can now create a job posting using the Page composer. Job post details can include job title, job type (i.e. full-time, intern, part-time), salary info, and more. Job posts will appear along with other Page posts in the News Feed of followers, and within the jobs tab itself.\nFacebook users can apply for a job by clicking “apply now,” which opens a standard application document complete with pre-populated information from the user’s public profile — meaning it would be handy to update your bio with your work history, if you haven’t done so already. Once submitted, the application will be received by the employer as a message.\nThe advantage of using the feature for businesses of all sizes is quite straightforward: access to an audience of 1.75 billion monthly active users. Facebook itself, of course, stands to reap extra revenue from employers looking to promote their openings in order to attract more eyeballs.\nIt could also potentially lead to more activity on the site, with users adding more",

      "text": "4 hrs ago This Is How Facebook Defines “Journalism” The social network is the world’s newspaper, but its e-learning courses remind us that it doesn’t really care about journalism Casey Moore Facebook has a fake news problem . The site is constantly inundated with entirely false stories — which is why I was surprised to learn that it had recently launched an e-learning course for journalists. For Facebook to offer such a class sounded to me like a vegan offering a seminar on veal tenderizing. I enrolled. I immediately found the clumsiness I expected. “Complete all in order,” its directions specified, only to hastily clarify: “Complete all in any order.” The course didn’t have any other similar blunders, but it was simply a jargon-addled snooze: “You can monetize Instant Articles views through your direct-sold ads, branded content, Audience Network, our ad network solution, or all three,” the course told me. “You can upload and boost your 360 photo by clicking on the Boost Post button on the bottom right of your Page post. You can also choose the Boost your Post Ad Objective in the Ads Create Tool.” None of this information was wrong; it just wasn’t journalism. This is not an oversight. It’s simply Facebook revealing, once again, how loosely it conceptualizes “journalism” — to the company, everything and anything is journalism, as long as it’s shareable, ideally through Facebook’s native storytelling tools. BuzzFeed reported earlier this month that some young Macedonian rascals had cultivated a digital advertising cottage industry by promoting at least 140 “sensationalist” American political-news sites on social media. The perpetrators wanted to make money getting clicks through shareable and only incidentally frequently made-up stories, and they succeeded. “Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters,” BuzzFeed wrote . This type of click-chasing, epistemologically flexible publisher has a symbiotic relationship with Facebook. “Unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created,” The New York Times Magazine wrote , describing how the intensely partisan, nontraditional, and un-fact-checked viral powerhouses do business. “Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don’t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.” Fake news is so abundant that The Guardian publishes a regular column devoted to debunking viral lies on Facebook. Officially, the social network strives to be an impartial conduit, and it has an interest in distancing itself from the mantle of editorial oversight. As recently as this summer, Mark Zuckerberg denied that Facebook is a media company. And when contract workers of Facebook’s Trending feature were accused of editorial bias, the ensuing backlash was vehement enough to prod the company into making an adjustment, but look at what the change was: Facebook canned its Trending editors and chose to rely more heavily on an algorithm. It wants to be the stadium, not the umpire. While the miasma from the Trending scandal and the continued glut of fake news is a bad PR look for Facebook, it appears that the criticism of their role in media has only led the company to become more firmly entrenched in its stance that it is not an arbiter of truth, and it’s not likely to flip-flop. “Ultimately, the problem isn’t just that Facebook doesn’t have the resources to pay for an army of well-paid, nuance-trained American editor-moderators (because, well: it does). It’s that doing so would undermine Facebook’s entire project,” a Select All piece on Facebook’s fake-news problem argued . “Facebook is built to engage its users, and to reward those users who produce engaging content. Every buzzkill debunking, every warning of caution, makes the site as a whole less engaging.” This is a good point: Fake news sites will succeed on Facebook as long as there is an appetite from users to click on these stories, and it is absolutely not in Facebook’s interest to assume responsibility. Perhaps it goes without saying at this point, but Facebook’s journalism course did not go over fact-checking. I’ll tell you what it did go over: video! The emphasis of the webinar was on Facebook Live and 360 Video (the only major topic that wasn’t video-oriented was how to publish Instant Articles). Facebook has decided that video is where journalism is going, and regardless of whether people prefer to consume news, opinion, and entertainment in video format , Facebook’s overwhelming dominance as a traffic engine for the media means that the media will follow Facebook, not the other way around. And some of Facebook’s newest media darlings are already casting themselves in the company’s video-centric and facts-optional molds. I recently noted that Mark Zuckerberg’s “likes” include hyper-coiffed, hyper-partisan right-wing talking head Tomi Lahren . The 24-year-old pundit incubated at Glenn Beck’s TV network TheBlaze, but Facebook is where she has found fame, through viral rants against Colin Kaepernick and President Obama. Tomi Lahren is a young, conservative, viral, incendiary talking head. Is she the next Ann Coulter or something scarier? theringer.com Lahren is a video-based commentator, not a reporter, and she is upfront about this distinction. “I’m not a journalist,” Lahren announced on CNN this year. No wonder Mark “not a media company” Zuckerberg likes her! She’s an especially appropriate figurehead for Facebook’s concept of journalism — clicky, pretty, and glad to use Facebook’s video tools. The disinformation peddlers will not be stopped by the company that profits from it. Facebook is highly unlikely to develop a moral prerogative to root out lies, but the company’s fake news problem may be affected by Facebook’s goal for journalists — the switch to video, particularly video hosted directly on the site. The next election may well spur a similar burst of fake news, but if the social network gets its way, it’ll be on native Facebook video, not links to outside sites. And while Facebook’s e-course didn’t give me any journalism tips, it did reaffirm my suspicions that if I make it to 2024, I’ll be feebly watching Tomi Lahren attack Cory Booker on an Oculus-exclusive newscast beamed directly into my unemployed eyeballs.",

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nHere’s an excellent deal for international travel — multiple airlines are offering flights from many US cities to Barcelona (BCN) and Madrid (MAD) from just $406 round-trip! Flights from New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Boston are all eligible for this fantastic offer, though keep in mind not all of these flights are nonstop. In fact, passengers from Philadelphia will have to complete one leg operated by Amtrak from Philadelphia’s 30th Street train station to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) before boarding a flight to Spain. These discounted fares are available for departures from December 2016 through April 2017. Considering itineraries such as these normally sell for upwards of $800, this represents a fantastic deal to some of Europe’s most dynamic cities.\nAirline: American, Delta, United, TAP Portugal\nRoute: US cities to BCN and MAD\nCost: $406 round-trip in economy\nDates: December – April 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nNew York (JFK) to Barcelona (BCN) for $406 round-trip on TAP Portugal in February: \nNew York (JFK) to Barcelona (BCN) for $406 round-trip on TAP Portugal.

      "text": "Facebook may have LinkedIn in its sights. The social network confirmed to TechCrunch yesterday (Nov. 7) that it has been experimenting with letting employers post job listings on their own Facebook business pages. TechCrunch queried Facebook after it noticed job-listing options on its own Facebook business page, including fields for salary, job title and full-time or part-time status.\nCredit: aslysun / Shutterstock \nInterested job candidates will be able to hit an \"apply now\" button that will pre-populate fields with information from their own Facebook profiles. Employers will get a Facebook Messages for each submitted application.\nThis all makes sense, as many Facebook users have extensive employment information attached to their personal profiles. (However, there's no hint of a corresponding professional section for Facebook personal pages that would approximate a LinkedIn profile.) It would also make it easy for recruiters to give applicants a cursory social media once-over. Add in Facebook's healthy advertising platform, and the job-listings feature may have some serious reach to pinpoint potential employees.\nMORE: Why I Stopped Using Facebook, And You Should Too \nAccording to LinkedIn's own numbers , it has 467 million users, while Facebook claims more than 1 billion . If the Facebook job-listings feature takes hold, LinkedIn could be in trouble. Yet some Facebook users may be resistant to tying up work and play. Otherwise, they'll have to be extremely careful about posting photos of drinking and partying and status updates that include political diatribes and crude jokes.\n\nMicrosoft acquired Linkedin for $26.2 billion earlier this year.\n[via TechCrunch ]\nSee Also : Best Messaging Apps \nHow to Check If Your LinkedIn Was Hacked Facebook Live Video vs Periscope: What's Right for You? 10 Offbeat Social Networks About the author Andrew E.

      "title": "Facebook testing Prisma-like stylized art filters for video",
      "text": "\nFacebook is currently working on a new feature for video that will allow users to add stylized art filters to those clips, similar to what the popular Prisma app does for photos. The company says it is testing the feature in a few countries at the moment.\nSee also: More than 1 billion users access Facebook on mobile daily July 28, 2016 Facebook says this “style transfer” feature for video is the result of a new machine intelligence technology the company developed called Caffe2Go. Normally, the processing for creating these kinds of filters would require sending the data to a high-end server, but the company says Caffe2Go allows it to be processed locally on a smartphone. In a blog post, Facebook stated:\nWith the speed and quality optimizations made in the style-transfer technology, run on the Caffe 2 framework, a real-time image processing system is possible on the mobile experience.\nThere’s no word yet on when these filters will be rolled out for all of Facebook’s users. Prisma, which is currently working on adding filters for short videos for the Android app, demonstrated how it could also add this feature to live videos on Facebook in late October. As with Caffe2Go, the processing for Prisma’s filter is handled on a smartphone. Again, there’s no word on when this feature will be added to the Prisma app on Android.\nWould you be interested in adding these kinds of art filters to your videos?",

      "text": "A woman poses with her daughter at the grave site of Susan B. Anthony in Rochester, N.Y., on Tuesday, in a frame grab from Facebook. (WROC News 8 via Facebook) I voted two weeks ago by mail from my home in Seattle, but thanks to a Facebook live video today, on Election Day, I was transported across the country to the city I grew up in to witness an emotional gathering at a historic location.\nThousands of voters in Rochester, N.Y., were standing in line Tuesday morning to place their “I Voted Today” stickers and pose for pictures at the grave marker of Susan B. Anthony in the city’s Mt. Hope Cemetery. The co-founder of the National Woman Suffrage Association, who fought for women’s rights, died in 1906, 14 years before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave women the right to vote.\nWROC News 8 , the CBS affiliate in the city, was live streaming for hours from the grave site, with no plans to stop as voting continued throughout the day. Video captured long lines and many folks posing with children in front of the modest tombstone. Moms visiting with their daughters spoke about the historic significance of voting to potentially make Hillary Clinton the first female president of the United States.\nThousands tuned in to the Facebook video and the reporter behind the camera gave a running commentary as he chatted with voters — while battling some connectivity issues and worrying about battery life. Shortly before 1 p.m. ET, CSPAN took the feed live as the video showed flowers in front of the grave, numerous stickers on the stone and a line stretching back into the cemetery.\n\n“I’m voting for the first woman president. As a woman I can vote because of the sacrifices she made,” Jillian Paris, of the Rochester suburb of Brighton, said in a story in the Democrat & Chronicle . She affixed her sticker to Anthony’s marker at about 7 a.m., shortly after sunrise, the newspaper said.\n“I am shocked at the number of people who are here today. I never expected this,” Janice Schwind of Rochester told the D&C after making it through the line. “I thought I could come in, threw my sticker on there and run off to work. I’m an hour late so far.\n“It’s making me all choked up to see all the people,” she said.",

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nFor all of those who have yet to book Thanksgiving travel — this one’s for you.

A glue gun would also be handy.\nMore This woman is saving thousands of homeless women this winter with her care packages \nGreggs' Christmas menu is here and it's as magical as always \nThis girl's aunt wore a fake moustache so she could take her to the father/daughter dance \nTech heads, note that ‘with a pinhole size of about 300 microns, the exposure time on a bright day (it’s 100 ASA/5 seconds)’.\nHowever, we all know that the most important piece of info in this story is the type of potato – it was a Creme Gold.\nColin getting busy with his Spud Cam (Picture: Colin Lowe / Facebook) This isn’t the first unconventional camera that Colin’s made – he’s also taken some epic photos with… a boab nut.\n\nClassic Colin.\nMORE: These adventure photo contest winners will make your life seem really inadequate \nMORE: Photographer accidentally captures the most epic wedding photo with his drone \nMORE: Flirtatious seal really knows how to work it for the camera ",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES (AFP) - The humble pantsuit is getting its moment in the sun.\nA secret Facebook group called \"Pantsuit Nation\" that began as 50 Hillary Clinton supporters who decided to wear the outfit to the polls to show their support for the Democratic nominee has blown up into an online phenomenon in recent days.\nThe invitation-only group now has 2.2 million members and counting.\nAccording to US media reports, Pantsuit Nation was started by Libby Chamberlain, a Clinton supporter in the northeastern state of Maine.\n\"We talked about how beautifully and stoically Hillary embodies women's fight for equality, and how the pantsuit is an emblem of that struggle,\" she told CNN.\nUS elections: More coverage here US elections: Live blog US elections: Top stories on The Straits Times US election: Full coverage by The Straits Times Clinton has been variously skewered and celebrated for her ubiquitous pantsuits, and in the waning days of the bruising presidential campaign, it's become a quirky symbol for the former secretary of state, first lady and senator.\nPop star Beyonce traded her usual curve-hugging costumes for a pantsuit when she performed at a Clinton rally in Cleveland on Friday. Her backup dancers wore pantsuits in blue, the color of the Democratic Party.\nThe Facebook page brings together Clinton fans who share personal and often touching stories about why they are voting for her.\nOne pregnant woman posted a photo from a polling site, saying she was in labour but made sure to vote before going to the hospital to deliver her daughter.\nThe popularity of the Pantsuit Nation page has now spawned a website ( www.pantsuitnation.org ), accounts on Twitter and Instagram and a public Facebook page.\nRelated Stories: uselectionscoverage2016-optb.png Related Story US election: Full coverage by The Straits Times 40452655.1_40455098_-_06_11_2016_-_usa-election_clinton-profile.jpg Related Story All you need to know about US presidential election 2016 40432718_-_04_11_2016_-_pixprofile.jpg Related Story Road to the White House: The journeys of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, in pictures interactive-template-2.jpg Related Story Interactive: How the US president is elected, the key states to watch and why battleofthetweets.png Related Story US Elections: Whose tweets attack more, Clinton's or Trump's?
