      "text": "Refurbished iPhones now available on Apple's website You can pick up a 6s or 6s Plus and save some cash. Staff Writer, Macworld Nov 8, 2016 2:20 PM \nYou’ve long been able to pick up a refurbished Mac or iPad on Apple’s online store , but never an iPhone. That changes today. \nApple just added refurbished iPhones, which it has typically used as replacements for broken devices, to its online store, so you can pick up a relatively new unlocked phone for a lower price. \nThe 7 and 7 Plus are too new to be included in the refurb store, but you can pick up an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus for as low as $449—that’s for the 16GB 6s. The 16GB 6s Plus is $529, and the 64GB 6s Plus is $589. Apple doesn’t actually sell those models in its regular store anymore, since bumping up storage space to 32GB and 128GB with the launch of the iPhone 7. \nA brand new 32GB 6s is $549 and the 128GB model is $649. A new 32GB 6s Plus goes for $649, while the 128GB version retails for $749. So you can save about $100 buying a refurbished phone, albeit with reduced storage. The phones come with Apple’s standard 1-year warranty, and you can add AppleCare for $129 extra. \nIt’s unclear how long Apple will offer these phones, but it’s a good way to save a little bit of cash if you don’t need the very latest model.

      "text": "Apple’s decision to drop all but the USB-C ports on its latest MacBook Pro model annoyed many of the potential customers who’d been waiting an inordinate amount of time for the refreshed laptop to arrive.\nSo why did it do it? According to an “Apple engineer” in a new parody video (above), it’s so the tech giant could boost profits by forcing users to buy a bunch of dongles. Actually, some might agree with him.\nCreated in the same way as those amusingly subtitled Downfall videos , the engineer, who “worked in Apple’s laptop division,” explains to an interviewer that during the development of the latest MacBook Pro, Apple boss Tim Cook pressured them to create something more profitable than the iPhone.\nAt a meeting, one of the team members suggested they should “remove the ports and sell them as dongles.” Recounting the story, the engineer is unable to contain himself at the sheer absurdity of the idea – or possibly the pure brilliance of it.\nLaughing uncontrollably, he especially enjoys the idea that everyone who buys Apple’s latest laptop will “have to carry around a bag full of dongles,” adding that Tim Cook is “crazy for dongles.”\nThere’s plenty more choice lines that’ll have you chuckling, so check it out if you need a laugh.\nMore: DT’s guide to the new MacBook Pro models\nResponding to the outcry from disgruntled Apple fans looking to buy a new MacBook Pro, the Cupertino company on Friday slashed the prices of its range of USB-C dongles.\nThe company said it recognized that “many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem,”\nThe price cuts, which will save users between $10 and $20 a pop, will run till the end of the year.\nWhat’s the best MacBook for your money? Can Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 keep pace with Dell’s XPS 13? Watch Apple’s latest product announcements live, right now",

That changes today.\n\nApple just added refurbished iPhones, which it has typically used as replacements for broken devices, to its online store, so you can pick up a relatively new unlocked phone for a lower price.\n\nThe 7 and 7 Plus are too new to be included in the refurb store, but you can pick up an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus for as low as $449—that’s for the 16GB 6s. The 16GB 6s Plus is $529, and the 64GB 6s Plus is $589. Apple doesn’t actually sell those models in its regular store anymore, since bumping up storage space to 32GB and 128GB with the launch of the iPhone 7.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Apple recently updated its online refurbished store to include a range of different iPhone models, giving customers a way to purchase a certified refurbished device at a lower cost directly from Apple.\n\nApple is currently offering refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models in a variety of colors and capacities. Prices for an entry-level 16GB iPhone 6s start at $449, while a 16GB iPhone 6s Plus can be purchased for $529.\nThose prices are $100 to $120 less than brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices, which are priced at $549 and $649 for 32GB of storage space. All refurbished iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are unlocked and SIM-free, meaning they are compatible with all U.S. carriers.\n\nWhile Apple has long offered iPads and Macs in its refurbished store, it has never before allowed customers to purchase refurbished iPhones. Customers who wanted lower prices on iPhones had to wait for third-party deals or purchase refurbished/used devices from a third-party retailer.\nAll of Apple's refurbished products, iPhone included, are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. iPhones also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell, ensuring there are no scratches or other cosmetic damage.\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 6s\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "Apple starts selling refurbished iPhones Apple has recently started selling refurbished iPhones. (Source: Apple) For consumers hoping to enjoy iOS without spending a lot of money, Apple has started selling iPhones on its refurbished store. The refurbished units will be sold at a discount, but still come with the standard warranty and accessories. by Sam Medley, 2016/11/08 Apple Deal iPhone iPhone 7 Smartphone Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here People who are looking to enter the iOS ecosystem or upgrade their existing iPhones will now be able to do so at a lower cost. Apple has officially started selling iPhones through the Refurbished Shop on their website. Previously, bargain hunters hoping to score a used or refurbished iPhone at a discount would have to go through third-party vendors, which could provide spotty warranties, shoddy products, or lackluster service. Apple, a company known for their high level of customer and product support, is offering a one-year warranty with the refurbished devices, the same warranty included with new iPhones. The phones will ship with the typical iPhone accessories: Apple’s EarPod headphones, a Lightning to USB cable, a USB power adapter, and the usual documentation. The refurbished iPhones will also come with a brand new battery and new outer shell. Essentially, Apple is gutting the internals of older phones (most likely received from the iPhone Upgrade Program) and sticking them into new casings without cosmetic flaw. The refurbished phones will be sold unlocked, but purchaser will have to provide his or her own SIM card. Potential buyers will have to eschew the latest iPhone 7 , though. At the time of writing, Apple is only selling refurbished iPhone 6S Plus models , although there are various colors and storage capacities from which to choose. Prices range from $529 for a 16 GB 6S Plus to $589 for the 64 GB version, which both reflect a 15% discount. Buyers will also receive free shipping for any refurbished products. Should the need arise, users will also be able to return their device for free within 14 days of purchase. Applecare will also be available for purchase to extend the service and warranty of the device. The iPhone is currently Apple’s best selling product, and it’s good to see it finally join the refurbished ranks in Apple’s online store. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple Pay has slow to gain adoption in Australia as Apple fights with the large banks for adoption . Now, however, Apple has signed a deal with payments group Cuscal that will see the mobile payments service come to more than 30 credit unions and small banks in the country… \nAccording to a report from news.com.au , the partnership will see Apple Pay comes to over 4 million users in Australia, with the number of Cuscal customers supporting the platform expected to continue to grow. Notable inclusions are Credit Union Australia, Bank Australia, Teachers Mutual Bank Limited and People’s Choice Credit Union. The full list can be found here . \nIn a statement, Cuscal managing director Craig Kennedy explained that he hopes the partnership will encourage major banks and institutions to resolve their differences with Apple and put the goo d of the consumer at the forefront of efforts. \n“I hope that Apple and the banks find some middle ground here because I think it would be everybody’s interest if they found a solution for their current stalemate,” Mr Kennedy said. \n“The more people use these services and the more cards that are in there, the more common that it becomes and it lifts everybody. \n“Whenever you’ve got a few people doing it, it’s going to hold back the growth and the acceptance of this sort of behaviour. And I don’t think that’s in the interests of any of the parties that are currently in dispute. \n“I hope they find a way through all of that.” \nApple Pay head Jennifer Bailey also commented on Apple’s partnership with Cuscal, explaining that Apple wants as many Australians as possible to use Apple Pay. Bailey also explained that the partnership will bring Apple Pay not only to retail stores, but also to apps and websites. \n“We want as many Australians as possible to be able to use Apple Pay,” she said. \n“Today more than 3500 banks across 12 countries already support Apple Pay and we think Cuscal’s customers will really love using Apple Pay for everyday purchases in stores, apps and on the web.” \nIn addition to the new credit unions and institutions that come as part of the Cuscal partnership, Apple Pay is supported in Australia by ANZ and American Express, while other banks are also working to gain approval to partner with Apple to support the service.

As expected, approximately 24 hours after registered developers were able to install the new Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1 and watchOS 3.1.1 on their supported devices, now public beta testers can do that as well either by following our in-depth tutorial on how to install an iOS 10 Public Beta or by updating their existing Beta 1 installations. As mentioned in our initial report, the biggest new feature of the iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 or Developer Beta 2 milestone is the addition of the new TV app that Apple unveiled last month during its \"Hello Again\" event where the Cupertino company announced new MacBook Pro models. The TV app will be installed automatically on your supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch device, along with the Videos app in case you removed it from your device. The TV app can also be removed if users choose to do so, especially because of the fact that it cannot be used in countries where the iTunes Movies service is not supported. macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Beta 2 now available for developers Also today, Apple seeded the second Beta snapshot of the upcoming macOS 10.12.2 Sierra operating system for supported MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook, iMac, and Mac Mini devices, but only to registered developers. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 2 is tagged as build 16C41b, and it's available via the Sierra Developer Beta Access Utility. Public beta testers will most probably be able to install the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Beta 2 update as well in the coming hours, but rest assured that we will announce it right here on this space. In the meantime, Apple is yet to announced the second Beta release of its Xcode 8.2 IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for developers.",

      "text": "By Michael Firth Neowin LLC @techfirth · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nContinuing the theme of Apple discounts last week , the tech giant has just discounted its newly announced 4K/5K monitors, introduced as part of a collaboration with LG alongside the new MacBook Pro. \nCustomers have been calling for new, high resolution Apple Thunderbolt displays for some time. Thankfully, at last the \"Hello Again\" event , Apple debuted its new notebooks alongside two new LG monitors which it said had been specifically designed 'in partnership' to complement the new MacBook Pro range. \nThe move marks a departure for Apple, and appears to confirm the end of Apple producing its own external displays in favor of inviting third parties to fill the gap. \nThe discount is available directly from Apple, with the new pricing already applied to its online store. \nThe updated pricing is as follows: 21.5\" 4K UltraFine Display - £471/$524 (discounted from £629/$700) 27\" 5K UltraFine Display - £884/$974 (discounted from £1179/$1300) \nLike the discounts that Apple has applied to its USB-C adapters, the price reduction is for a limited time only. With the offer expiring at the end of the year, it may provide enough of an incentive for those people thinking of purchasing the new MacBook Pro before the Christmas holidays. \nThe new monitors are not expected to reach customers until December.",

      "text": "Share this article Share In some forms, the system would allow for users to see search results on top of the live video, even if these points are not viewable in real life, allowing them to visualize the way to more distant objects. And in another embodiment, the user could even be provided multiple display views based on the angle of the device. The user may instead see an illustrated or schematic map view if the angle indicates the device is being pointed at the ground where there would be few objects of interest When held between 45 and 180 degrees relative to the ground, the augmented reality view may appear. But, when held at a smaller angle, the user may instead see an illustrated or schematic map view, as this would indicate the device is being pointed at the ground where there would be few objects of interest. It comes just a month after Tim Cook, speaking to Buzzfeed News , suggested the firm may be focusing on augmented reality, explaining that technology should encourage human contact. The Apple CEO had previously remarked that the firm is ‘high on AR’ and raved about Pokémon Go. A patent filed in September 2008 is called 'Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display'. Its description reads: 'The portable electronic may be physically coupled to the head-mounted device such that [it] can be worn on the user's head' Augmented reality, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world, is one of the latest fixations in the technology business. ‘There’s no substitute for human contact,’ Cook said in an exclusive interview with Buzzfeed News. ‘And so you want the technology to encourage that.’ Over the past few years, though Apple has remained tight-lipped about its plans for future systems, the firm has made numerous moves in the direction of AR. This includes the acquisition of PrimeSense in 2013 – the company responsible for the motion-capture system in the original Microsoft Kinect – and the hiring of numerous researchers with VR backgrounds. Speaking to Buzzfeed News , Tim Cook suggested the firm may instead be focusing on augmented reality, explaining that technology should encourage human contact. This comes just months after the Apple CEO remarked that the firm is ‘high on AR’ And, according to Buzzfeed News, the Apple has been having meetings with immersive content companies, including Jaunt. The firm’s latest handsets also feature what could be the means to support AR, with the iPhone 7 plus hosting a Wide Color display and two-camera system that can gather stereoscopic data and generate image depth maps, Buzzfeed reports. ‘VR has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,’ Cook told Buzzfeed. ‘Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might…have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? ‘And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated withouta becoming a barrier to our talking. 'You want the technology to amplify it, not be a barrier.’ Read more:",

      "text": "Apple Not Releasing iPhone SE Successor In 2017? \nThe new macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta is unlikely to come with new features, since the first beta already introduced them when it was launched to developers and public beta testers. As per MacRumors , what users can expect from the upcoming update based on the first beta is the new set of Unicode 9-based emojis. \nApart from the new characters like clown face, face palm, drooling face and fox face, among many others, Apple has also reportedly enhanced the artwork of existing emojis to make them appear more detailed and realistic than the very cartoonish appearance they currently have with macOS Sierra 10.12.1. \nThe same set of emojis has been confirmed to roll out to the iPhones and iPads via the upcoming iOS 10.2 software update. As previously reported , iOS 10.2 is bringing new Music sorting options and Star Ratings to the Music app. There will also be improvements in the Camera app and Siri, as well as a new widget for the Videos app and a different headphone icon for the status bar.

      "text": "One of the more competitive services in the technology industry is streaming music. A number of companies are duking it out for control of the multi-billion dollar market, from Pandora to Spotify to Apple Music and more. Companies are seeking out every advantage they can to grab on to a few more subscribers.\nApple, in particular, has been aggressive in this space, which is particularly important to it given the slowdown in hardware sales across the board. One tactic Apple has often turned to when it needs a component to flesh out a winning strategy is acquisitions. It pulled out the wallet recently in picking up some assets from now-defunct streaming service Omnifone, as Techcrunch reports .\nMore: Check out our comparison of Apple Music and Spotify\nApparently, Apple is cherry-picking some employees and technology to plug into Apple Music, information that was revealed as Omnifone founder Rob Lewis embarks on setting up a new streaming music service, Electric Jukebox. While Apple typically discloses their full acquisitions, the Omnifone investment does not qualify and thus Apple has been mum.\nApple’s investment in Omnifone, which occurred in August, was rumored as early as July when bankruptcy proceedings made note of a potential buyer of parts of the company for $10 million. The rumors, which named Apple specifically, were discredited — seemingly a bit too soon as it turns out.\nThe Omnifone staff that will reportedly be making their way to Apple headquarters include engineers that are now involved with iTunes and app development. Omnifone has more than 50 registered patents across a wide range of streaming technology such as media identification and downloading. While it is unclear which technology was purchased, it is clear that it will make its way into Apple Music and iTunes at some point.\nThe Omnifone investment highlights just how much of Apple’s Music service is a result of acquisitions, as the company also purchased Swell, Lala , MusicMeter and, of course, Beats , the latter of which is an important part of Apple’s music business going forward. Apple is clearly serious about making its streaming music service a success and there is even speculation that it will lower the price of Apple Music plans to make the service more competitive — proving the market is big enough when Apple is willing to spend money to grab a larger share.\nApple may be preparing to lower the price of Apple Music plans, report says Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king?

      "text": "DongleGate: Apple's Big 2016 Controversy It'll all work itself out. Evan Niu Nov 8, 2016 at 7:57PM Twenty-five years of progress. Image source: Apple. \nThis happens every couple of years; it's just a lot louder this time around. \nIn the wake of Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) release of new MacBook Pros, which were unveiled last month, there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the company's decision to completely transition all input/output jacks to USB-C (Apple's implementation also supports Thunderbolt 3). The criticisms aren't misplaced, as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that they'll need for their daily workflow. The irony is that USB-C's potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. Apple isn't just swapping out one old port for one new port -- it's swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port. \nApple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 \nBut at the same time, the decision was hardly unexpected, as there had been months of rumors that Apple would switch completely to USB-C as the port of the future. It's useful at times like these to go back and revisit how Apple approaches which technologies to invest in. That's what he said \nSteve Jobs made his final appearance at AllThingD's D8 conference in 2010 and discussed the iPad and the controversial absence of Adobe Flash on the tablet. People were outraged that Apple's new device didn't support the standard web video technology of the time. His response to Walt Mossberg really hit at Apple's broader philosophy : \nWalt Mossberg: What if people say the iPad is crippled in this respect? \nSteve Jobs: Well you know, I'd say two things. Number one: Things are packages of emphasis. Some things are emphasized in a product, some things are not done as well, some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product. And so different people make different choices and if the market tells us we're making the wrong choices, then we listen to the market. \nWe're just people running this company. We're trying to make great products for people. And so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say, \"We don't think this is part of what makes a great product, and we're gonna leave it out.\" Some people are gonna not like that, they're gonna call us names, it's not going to be in certain company's vested interests that we do that, but we're gonna take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers. \nWe're going to instead focus our energy on these technologies, which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are gonna be the right technologies for customers. And you know what? They're paying us to make those choices. That's what a lot of customers pay us to do. Is to try and make the best products we can. \nAnd if we succeed, they'll buy them. And if we don't, they won't . And it'll all work itself out. So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking iPads. We've sold one every three seconds since we launched it. \nIt should be clear that USB-C is a technology that is in its ascendancy, even if Apple's switch is seemingly premature given the immaturity of the USB-C ecosystem. A second opinion \nThere's another quote that's a little more directly relevant here, too. This controversy actually started last year, when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, which also only uses USB-C. The main difference is that the move is less likely to attract ire in a consumer laptop, while professionals have greater connectivity needs with their tools and workflow. When asked about the decision in a Mashable interview, marketing chief Phil Schiller acknowledged that these types of transitions are often tough and uncomfortable: \"We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes.\" \nFrom an investing perspective, the real question is whether or not this controversy will prove to be a fading argument like all past instances, or if there will be some type of lasting impact on Apple's Mac business. Assuming that the industry indeed moves toward USB-C, which by all signs it is (slowly but surely), it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where this hurts Apple over the long haul. One encouraging data point is that Schiller also confirmed in a recent interview with The Independent that demand is soaring: \"And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.\" \nSo far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking MacBook Pros. It'll all work itself out. \nEvan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

      "title": "The new MacBook Pro is selling like crazy",
      "text": "Apple's new MacBook Pro didn't get the best reception when it was launched, thanks to a price hike and a rather courageous selection of new ports. But that doesn't seem to have dissuaded all the wannabe Pros out there, because some data is showing the new MacBook Pro selling weirdly fast.\nDON'T MISS: Donald Trump’s son just broke the law while voting\nView photos\nrecent-laptop-launches-1 More Slice Intelligence uses data from electronic shopping receipts to track online purchases. It uses that information to try and work out how many products are selling and to who. Its data looks good for Apple: four times more revenue has been made fromMacBook Pros in two weeks than Surface Books have generated in a year. Revenue from the new Pros is even closing in on the 12-inch MacBook, which has been on sale since April last year.\nNow, total sales (in terms of volume) may not be as big as you'd think. Although Apple hasn't disclosed numbers, the nicer 15-inch Pros are far more expensive than most laptops, typically costing around $3,000. The data also only reflects online sales (or those with an emailed receipt), and the same professional users who would spend three grand on a laptop are also more likely to buy it online, compared to people using the 12-inch MacBook, or any other laptop you'd wander into Best Buy and purchase.\nStill, the numbers look good for a laptop that many people (including me!) thought would be too niche to appeal to a wide audience. We'll have to wait for Apple's next set of financials to see the effect on the company's broader MacBook financials. But for now, it's clear that the MacBook Pro isn't a flop, at the very least.\nTrending right now:\nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go It’s not too late: There are 12 states where you can still register and vote See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Remembering Apple iPhone 1 Now Playing For those who skipped Apple's iPhone 6s or 6s Plus back when they were first released, Apple is now offering refurbished units for a lower price. All the refurbished units are 15 percent less than the original price, starting at $449. ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple is now officially selling refurbished versions of its previous flagships now that the more recent iPhone 7 has been released. If you want to save 15 percent off the original price of Apple's iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you may want to opt for the refurbished variants. Pricing starts at $449 for a 16 GB iPhone 6s, $529 for a 16 GB iPhone 6s Plus and $589 for a 64 GB iPhone 6s Plus. All the listings state that the phones will be unlocked, SIM-free models and will be available in three colors: silver, space gray and rose gold. All models will come with a year's worth of warranty, and while these units are indeed refurbished, Apple states that all the devices will ship with a brand-new battery and an outer shell. In the past, Apple has sold refurbished Macs, MacBooks, iPads, iPods and even Apple TVs, but this marks the first time that the company is putting refurbished variants of its smartphones up for sale. If you find that the price points are still a bit steep to your liking, there's also an exhaustive list of used iPhone models from third-party retailers, but that nets you a considerable risk of receiving bogus and faulty units that might still hold defects. If possible, it's best to stick to Apple if you want official refurbished units straight from the company itself. Is Apple Clearing Out iPhone 6s Units? Finally selling refurbished phones is an odd turnout for Apple, who previously didn't harbor a predilection for putting up lower-priced iPhones for sale. Since the iPhone is one of Apple's major profit contributor, the company has always offered the lineup in its full price to avoid encouraging consumers to opt for the inexpensive models. It's up for speculation why Apple has suddenly decided to sell refurbished iPhone 6s or 6s Plus units for the first time. The measly sales figures of the 6s lineup may have convinced Apple to offer them at a bargain in an attempt to clear out the inventory at a faster pace. It's also a way to attract users who, upon veering from the iPhone 7's steep price, might be eyeing other Android handsets such as the Google Pixel . Apple is currently exerting efforts to bolster its gross margins. In a recent note to investors by Apple, the company has reported a lower gross margin guidance for Q1 2017, and it might be skipping a refresh of the iPhone SE as a result. What Are Refurbished Products? If you're worrying about the prefix of a refurbished product, then you shouldn't. In fact, refurbished variants of products are often better than their newer counterparts. Refurbished products are basically devices users have returned because of problems or defects. Apple scrutinizes and fixes whatever these products may have, and once everything is ironed out, they put the components in a new outer shell and sells it for a much lower price. These products go through a lengthy pat-down to ensure that there'll be no more problems embedded in the refurbished product. Aside from this, selling refurbished variants is also a way for Apple to offset the cost of product returns and prevent wasted inventory. \nIf you're planning on buying one, head over to Apple's special deals site of refurbished iPhone 6s or 6s Plus units to find the right configuration for you. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "refurb \nApple has been selling refurbished Macs, iPads, and iPods for a while, but today the company added iPhones into the mix for the first time, giving customers a way to purchase a device at a lower cost directly from Apple complete with official warranty support. \nRight now the company is only selling a few models of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. A 16GB iPhone 6s can be had for $449 while the larger iPhone 6s Plus is being offered in two storage varieties: 16Gb and 64GB for $529 and $589, respectively. Both devices are available in all colors including Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nThose prices are about $80 to $110 less than brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices, although the regular store only offers them in 32GB and 128GB capacities. A brand new iPhone 6s costs $549 for the 32GB model and $649 for the 128GB variant, while the 6s Plus is either $649 or $749 for the 32GB and 128GB versions respectively. \nAll refurbished iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are unlocked and SIM-free, meaning they are compatible with all U.S. carriers. Apple says these phones are fully tested, updated with replacement parts for any defective modules identified in testing, cleaned and repackaged with cables and other materials you get when you buy a new iPhone. \nThey come with the same one-year warranty as brand new iPhones, and they also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell with no scratches or cosmetic damage. \nApple last sold reconditioned iPhones through its official refurb store back in 2008 with the iPhone 3G and has also used an eBay store front in recent years.

      "text": "Apple is giving potential iPhone customers a cheaper way to buy a device — for the first time ever, the company is offering refurbished iPhones through its online refurbished store .\nThe store currently only offers the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but those models come in a variety of colors and different storage capacities. The price of the devices starts at much less than the new phone — you can get a 16GB version of the iPhone 6s for $449, and the 6s Plus for $529.\nMore: Color options for iPhone 7, 7 Plus may expand with addition of jet white model\nThe phones are between $100 and $120 less than buying a phone new, and all of the phones are unlocked and SIM-free — meaning that you could buy one and use it with any of the major U.S. carriers. It’s likely that over the next few years, more models will be on offer through the refurbished store — for example, after the iPhone 8 comes out, we’ll likely see refurbished iPhone 7s available too. It’s currently unknown if Apple only intends on offering the previous generation phone through its refurbished store.\nApple’s refurbished store has been around for a while, but until now it has only offered iPads and Macs. What that means is that customers who wanted cheaper iPhones had to buy one second-hand from another source, or wait for third-party sellers to refurbish phones for themselves.\nThe great thing about buying a refurbished product through Apple is that all devices are tested, cleaned, and certified. They also come with a one-year guarantee, and feature a new battery and a new case — meaning that there’s no outer damage to the devices. Buying a refurbished device from Apple is likely the next best thing compared to buying a new phone, and at a far cheaper price.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Our take on Apple’s latest and greatest Which big iPhone should you buy? iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 6S Plus iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6S: Should you make the leap to the next generation?",

Specifically, there are iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models in various storage sizes and colors as of this writing. All refurbished iPhones include a brand new battery and outer shell as well as a one-year warranty. \nPricing for Apple’s refurbished iPhones starts at $449 for a 16GB iPhone 6s and goes up to $589 for a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus. \nYou’ve always been able to buy used iPhones from places like eBay, Craigslist, and some retailers, buy the news that Apple now sells refurbished iPhones is still big. That’s because when you buy from Apple, you’re buying from a reputable seller and you know that you’re getting a quality device that’s been looked over, has a fresh battery and a new casing, and even comes with a one-year warranty for peace of mind. So if you ever find yourself in the market for a used iPhone that’ll be easier on your wallet, hit up Apple’s online shop. \nHave you ever bought a refurbished smartphone? Via:",

Apple so far has relied on LCD screens for the iPhone, but uses OLED panels in other products including Apple Watch and, most recently, the 2016 MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar.\nMultiple reports claim that Apple is finally ready to make the jump to OLED screens in its iPhones, and there’s more proof coming in that direction, this time directly from Apple.\nDON’T MISS: What happens if today’s Presidential election ends in a tie?\nApple’s most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing contains a detail that seems to back up existing iPhone rumors concerning OLED displays.\nApple Insider 's J.P. Morgan noticed that Apple placed a purchase order with more than a year duration for the first time. The total amount is quite substantial: $4 billion. Apparently, the order coincides with an “off-balance sheet obligation: for the same amount from the third quarter, believed to be a long-term OLED obligation to Samsung for the future iPhone.\nSamsung is seen as the primary beneficiary of the first iPhone models that will have an OLED display, but competing suppliers including LG, Foxconn’s Sharp, and Japan Display are also making large investments in OLED display factories.\nNot only is an Apple contract very lucrative for a supplier, but the OLED iPhone will convince other smartphone makers to adopt such screen technology for their iPhone killers.\nApple also made a change in its risk related to component acquisition statement. The company said that it might have trouble acquiring certain components “on commercially reasonable terms.”\nSeveral factors, including supply availability and cost, may have prevented Apple from equipping the iPhone with an OLED display in the past, but that may be changing.\nTrending right now:\n2016 election live stream: How to watch election coverage and results online Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

With the Public Beta released, iOS users get the chance to use the app now if they are indeed signed up for the public beta. If you're wondering what \"TV\" is, it's an app that you would call a one-stop shop for video on iOS. It works with streaming video apps like Hulu, HBO Go and Showtime Anywhere.Instead of going from app to app to find a video you want to stream, \"TV\" will give you the opportunity to search and find specific videos. It also will recommend videos for you based on your viewing history. When you see a video on the app that you want to view, click on it and your iDevice will open the appropriate app so you can start streaming it. The other day we told you about some of the new features available with the beta version of iOS 10.2. There is the new Unicode 9 version of emoji , and the return of Apple Music star ratings to name a couple.The public beta version of iOS 10.2 is available OTA to any iOS user who has registered first with the public beta program. To register, users need to go to the Apple Beta Software Program (https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/) and sign up for free. Once that is done, go to Settings > General > Software Update and follow the instructions to install the iOS 10.2 public beta program on your iOS device.",

      "text": "Apple Pay hasn't swept the world by storm just yet, but Apple's homegrown payment service continues to grow by leaps and bounds. As an illustrative example, Tim Cook said during Apple's most recent earnings conference call that the number of Apple Pay transactions increased by 500% year over year. Looking ahead, we can expect the volume of Apple Pay transactions to grow even more now that macOS Sierra supports Apple Pay on the web. Additionally, Apple's recently revamped MacBook Pro has a Touch ID sensor built right into the keyboard, providing an efficient means to authenticate online transactions. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \n2016 election live stream: How to watch election coverage and results online Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go Amazon’s 15 best deals: 128GB microSD, insanely thin iPhone 7/7 Plus cases, $25 Fire TV Stick, more ",

The company is expected to update its iPhone and iPad lines, and introduce new bands for the Apple Watch. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Advertisement \nFans of iPhone are waiting for the biggest revelation for the rumored release of iPhone 8 next year as many of its followers were disappointed with the launched iPhone 7 this year. \nAccordingly, iPhone 7 did not meet the high expectations. According to iTechPost , Apple did not really pursue its highest prowess with iPhone 7 as they are anticipating for its 10 th anniversary in 2017. \nIt caused disappointment for some fans as there was somewhat a slow upgrade in this year's released of iPhone 7. \nOn the other hand, there are reports that claim that iPhone 8 will have polymer materials making it flexible, bendable and foldable. \nThrough this, a stiffener for the iPhone 8 will be provided for its future users. The polymer materials that will be utilized in this new model of Apple can be molded to form bends. \nOf course, these bends will have edges of a touch sensor display which will truly create an amazing experience for iPhone 8 users in 2017. \nMeanwhile, in a report from Forbes , the next iPhone will be a clear piece of glass. This will be composed of Gorilla Glass with polycarbonates material. This component will surely make iPhone 8 as a shatter resistant phone. It will also have the next-generation OLED screen. \nOn the other hand, iPhone 8 will be expected to have a great performance as its headset will have eye sensors that will give a higher apparent frame rate compared to a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it. \nAmazing features of iPhone 8 are the things that Apple followers should wait for! Check out our website for more updates on this amazing device in celebration of Apple's 10th anniversary next year. \n",

The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels.

      "text": "Share Save \nEveryone has been waiting around to see what Apple was going to shock us with this time, and many have been pleasantly surprised by the MacBook Touch Bar. They actually compared it to the adaptive keys we seen Lenovo come out with a few years ago, although the company quickly threw the idea away after poor feedback. \nNearly all Apple fans haven't realized something similar to the Touch Bar was created nearly a couple of decades ago. It was also created by Microsoft, their biggest rival in the world. Adaptive hardware might become huge now, but it has been toyed with since the end of the last century. Did Microsoft Influence Apple In Any Way? Apple are meant to be the biggest innovators in the tech world. Not only have they proved it with computer software, but with phones and music devices too. But you can't deny a lot of the stuff you'll now find on a Touch Pad was once investigated at great length. It might have been old school compared to the touchscreen interfaces we have today, but it's surely got to count. Steven Bathiche was in charge of the applied sciences department at the time when they explored how keyboards could change depending on what was on the screen. Access To Less Options In The Past We didn't have touchscreen interfaces like we do today, so do you have any idea what kinds of things Microsoft played around with in the hope for a breakthrough? Things like ancient touchscreens, keyboard buttons, and projectors were all taken into consideration. In 2009, Microsoft finally finished their extensive research into the technology. Their final adaptive keyboard might look familiar to you because of the touch screen display sitting on top of the keys. Some will say there isn't much difference between the two, but will the Touch Pad fair any better? Microsoft Ended Up Disregarding It The only reason Microsoft wanted their innovative keyboard to become successful was because of their customers. They thought it would be capable of making the average keyboard user a lot more productive. After all, there isn't too many people with the ability to hit hundreds of different shortcuts in a session. Unfortunately the adaptive keyboard was locked away never to be seen again. It was only a concept, so it would be impossible to guess what might have been. Does this mean Apple should be worried because it's not a prominent feature on keyboards today? Why It Actually Never Came To Light Once you dig a little deeper you realize Apple might be okay. The only reason Microsoft ditched it was because they only made software at the time. If you can remember when they did finally release their first computer it was a touchscreen, so the keyboard they spent so much research money on would have been useless. It's also obvious there are a lot more options today because of the advancements in technology, so maybe Apple are onto a winner and only time will tell. It's still hard to accept they weren't heavily influenced by their bitter rival even though they'll never admit it. 0 Shares ",

But Ireland isn't fighting to get back what it's owed; rather, it's contesting a recent EU ruling on behalf of Apple, saying that the company shouldn't have to pay Ireland the equivalent of about $3,000 per person.\nDON'T MISS: Donald Trump’s son just broke the law while voting\nIreland will be filing its appeal at the EU General Court tomorrow. At stake is an argument over what level of involvement the EU can have in a nation's tax affairs; far more pressingly for Apple, it's also an argument over the legality of its European tax arragements, which have saved it billions over the past few years.\nYou can read more about the background of the case here , but what the sides ultimately disagree on is how Apple’s taxes are structured through Ireland. It’s a complicated arrangement used by hundreds of big companies aside from Apple, but it works something like this: Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe are two Irish-registered companies, which hold the intellectual property to Apple products and brands outside of North and South America.\nUsing legal tax mechanisms, all sales of Apple products in Europe went to these companies, so the bulk of all profits made in Europe ended up in Ireland. Using transfer pricing like this to funnel profits into a particular country is a legal and well-used (if ethically dubious) practice.\nThe real problem is how profits were taxed once they got to Ireland. Apple and Ireland agreed on a system that channeled “most profits…away from Ireland to a ‘head office’ within Apple Sales International,” according to the European Commission. The Commission’s investigation showed that Apple had been given a tax rate as low as 0.005 percent at some points, far lower than the already-low Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent.\nThe EU doesn't want individual nations quietly striking tax deals with other companies, because it damages the integrity of the free trade and single market that are the cornerstones of the Union. Ireland doesn't want Apple to face a massive tax bill, because that could well cause the company to leave Ireland, taking millions in taxes and thousands of jobs with it.\nApple, of course, wants its present tax arrangements to continue, and thinks it's done nothing wrong. It is planning to appeal the EC's decision separately. In a statement issued at the time of the initial ruling, CEO Tim Cook said \"over the years, we received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law — the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there. In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.\"\nTrending right now:\nEvidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone Leak reveals 24 channels that will be included in AT&T’s web-only streaming TV service 9 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "The 11-inch MacBook Air lost its status as Apple’s most coveted laptop some time ago, but for cash-strapped Mac fans, the svelte ultraportable was their go-to system thanks to its $899 price tag. Unfortunately, last month Apple announced it’s giving its 11-inch ultraportable the ax. Moreover, by not upgrading the 13-inch MacBook Air ($999), it’s sentencing all of its sub $1,000 laptops to a slow death.\nThat means that in the near future Apple could make the 12-inch MacBook ($1,299) and the 13-inch MacBook Pro ($1,499) the company’s new entry-level machines, sans entry level prices.\nFortunately, the Apple Store offers refurbished MacBook Air , MacBook , and MacBook Pro laptops with prices starting at $929.\nIf the idea of a refurbished laptop makes you hesitate, rest assured that Apple’s refurbs are among the best in the industry and they’re all backed by the same 1-year warranty found in Apple’s newer devices. Below we’ve rounded up a few refurb Apple laptops currently available.\nMacBook laptops on sale from $170 to $210 off:\n11.6-inch MacBook Air for $929 ($170 off): There’s no Retina display and its 11-inch screen may be too small for some users, but at $929 — the 11-inch MacBook Air is the cheapest way to set foot inside the Mac laptop ecosystem. This laptop’s classic design has spawned countless imitators — including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook — and its just 0.3 pounds heavier than the 2-pound 12-inch MacBook. This model has been upgraded to include 256GB of storage space. 12-inch MacBook for $1,182 ($210 off): The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s most forward-thinking device to date. It defines the bleeding edge in PC portability and just like the original MacBook Air inspired dozens of competitors, so will the 12-inch MacBook. At its full price, however, it offers too little for too much money. As a refurb, it presents a more compelling argument, just keep in mind it doesn’t offer the best battery (that would be the 13-inch MacBook Air) nor does it offer the most horsepower, if CPU muscle is what you require. 13.3-inch MacBook Pro Retina for $1,099 ($200 off): This laptop costs $100 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, yet it includes an eye-opening 2,560 x 1,600 pixel Retina Display. This 2015 model may be outdated — when compared to the just-released 13.3-inch MacBook Pro — but in terms of power it leaves the older 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook in the dust.

      "text": "In August, Apple made an investment in now-defunct streaming service Omnifone, bringing new staff and technology to help Apple Music better compete with its competition in the streaming music market. More One of the more competitive services in the technology industry is streaming music. A number of companies are duking it out for control of the multi-billion dollar market, from Pandora to Spotify to Apple Music and more. Companies are seeking out every advantage they can to grab on to a few more subscribers.\nApple, in particular, has been aggressive in this space, which is particularly important to it given the slowdown in hardware sales across the board. One tactic Apple has often turned to when it needs a component to flesh out a winning strategy is acquisitions. It pulled out the wallet recently in picking up some assets from now-defunct streaming service Omnifone, as Techcrunch reports .\nMore: Check out our comparison of Apple Music and Spotify\nApparently, Apple is cherry-picking some employees and technology to plug into Apple Music, information that was revealed as Omnifone founder Rob Lewis embarks on setting up a new streaming music service, Electric Jukebox. While Apple typically discloses their full acquisitions, the Omnifone investment does not qualify and thus Apple has been mum.\nApple’s investment in Omnifone, which occurred in August, was rumored as early as July when bankruptcy proceedings made note of a potential buyer of parts of the company for $10 million. The rumors, which named Apple specifically, were discredited — seemingly a bit too soon as it turns out.\nThe Omnifone staff that will reportedly be making their way to Apple headquarters include engineers that are now involved with iTunes and app development. Omnifone has more than 50 registered patents across a wide range of streaming technology such as media identification and downloading. While it is unclear which technology was purchased, it is clear that it will make its way into Apple Music and iTunes at some point.\nThe Omnifone investment highlights just how much of Apple’s Music service is a result of acquisitions, as the company also purchased Swell, Lala , MusicMeter and, of course, Beats , the latter of which is an important part of Apple’s music business going forward. Apple is clearly serious about making its streaming music service a success and there is even speculation that it will lower the price of Apple Music plans to make the service more competitive — proving the market is big enough when Apple is willing to spend money to grab a larger share.\nApple may be preparing to lower the price of Apple Music plans, report says Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king?

      "text": "Apple has launched the second beta of iOS 10.2, bringing a number of new features to users, including the addition of the new TV app, a few design tweaks to the Music app, and some other bug fixes and tweaks. More The second beta of iOS 10.2 has been pushed to developers, bringing a number of changes to the operating system, which will ultimately be pushed to consumers.\nPerhaps the biggest change to iOS is the fact that it now has the TV app that was shown off during Apple’s October 27 event. The app allows users to view content from a range of other streaming accounts, although Netflix will not be among the list of providers at launch, according to reports from Recode .\nMore: Facebook gradually moving into TV advertising with Apple TV and Roku TV ads\nApart from the TV app, the new iOS 10.2 beta comes with a few design tweaks in Apple Music, and some new SOS features.\nWhen it comes to the SOS features, users will now be able to press the power button five times to automatically dial an emergency number. The feature works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. You can manage the settings for the new SOS feature by heading to the Settings app and scrolling to the General section.\nThe Music app has also gotten a few design tweaks to make using it a little easier. For example, the Shuffle and Repeat buttons have both been made a little more prominent, and you can simply swipe up to access those larger buttons.\nApart from the TV app and the new Music app, there are a few new emojis and a few redesigned emojis, as well as a new selection of wallpapers. You’ll also get the option to save the camera settings, plus support for a single sign-on, which lets users with a subscription to a cable service sign in only once to access multiple apps.\n100 awesome iPhone apps for 2016 Best iPhone fitness apps Microsoft launches a single two-factor authentication app for mobile platforms",

      "text": "The Obama administration’s well-documented relationship with Google had no small impact on the last eight years, clearing regulatory hurdles for technologies like self-driving cars and A.I., using custom-made software to help the president get re-elected and opening the first high-traffic revolving door between the White House and one of Silicon Valley’s giants. Now peeks inside Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president via the leaked emails of campaign chair John Podesta suggest Google could be unseated by one of its competitors — Apple — in a future Democratic White House.\nBy Krassotkin (derivative), Gage Skidmore (Donald Trump), Gage Skidmore (Hillary Clinton) [ CC BY-SA 3.0 ], via Wikimedia Commons WikiLeaks’ latest dump of emails hacked from Podesta include more correspondence between Apple higher-ups and Clinton staffers, with the back-and-forth led chiefly by Podesta, who reportedly tops Clinto n ’s short list for chief of staff , and Lisa Jackson, a former EPA administrator under President Obama and Apple’s vice president of environmental policy and social initiatives.\nJackson works closely with Apple CEO Tim Cook, a policial novice, according to chatter between Clinton staffers who say she’s taken a lead role in steering Cook through Washington.\n“Tim loves HRC – not very political but Lisa has been getting him to start being more active,” finance director for the Clinton campaign Dennis Cheng wrote to Podesta last June. “They’ve done a few fundraisers for Senate candidates. Would be great if Tim would host an event and also be helpful to other ways – personal endorsement, etc?”\nThe email preceded a meeting between Cook and Podesta where staffers urged caution for fear of putting too much pressure on the Apple CEO.\n“Tim’s office requested a 1:1 meeting today, which was a nice way of saying ‘no staff,’” campaign fundraiser Lindsay Roitman wrote on a email chain including Podesta. “I think this is one we should proceed cautiously. He’s supportive but new to this so I think we shouldn’t come on too strong.”\nMore emails show the beginning of a revolving door with Podesta pitching multiple contacts to Jackson for jobs at Apple , while others document multiple meetings between the two and frequent back-and-forth on a number of technology and business issues addressed by the former secretary of state.\nIn one exchange, Podesta walked back Clinto n’ s support for withholding patents for ransom from companies in exchange for taxes on their overseas assets (which Apple has many of). In another, Podesta convinced Jackson to take a public stance with the campaign after Clinton voiced her opposition to government-mandated backdoors into products featuring encrypted communciations like the iPhone.\n“I wanted to reach out to say thanks for the principled and nuanced stance the secretary took last night on encryption and the tech sector,” Jackson wrote to Podesta after Clinton said “the back door is the wrong door” during the Dec. 19 Democratic presidential debate.\n“I would not go that route,” Clinton said in response to a question about whether she would weaken encryption in exchange for greater surveillance of Americans’ communciations for the sake of national security. The question came after the San Bernardino ISIS-inspired shooting in December, during the early stages of the FBI’s fight with Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the shooters.\n“I don’t know enough about the technology,” she said, “but I’ve got enough confidence in our tech experts, and maybe the back door is the wrong door. I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.”\nClinton’s stance came after Jackson organized a briefing on the issue between Apple and Clinton staffers.\n“Leadership at Apple certainly noticed and I am sure that is true though out the Valley,” Jackson continued in the letter to Podesta (which he forwarded to Clinto n), adding encryption doesn’t preclude Apple from assiting law enforcement with access to metadata and “other very useful categories of data,” something she said the company does “thousands of times every month.”\n“Lisa, Thanks. We are trying to hold the line in a crazy environment,” Podesta replied . “Thought any more about whether you could play a public role with us?”\n“Yes I can,” Jackson responded. “Am happy to.”\nThe relationship bore exactly the kind of fruit the Clinton camp was hoping for. In August, Cook hosted a fundraiser for Clinton in California, also attended by Jackson, where ticket costs ranged from $2,700 to $50,000. Cook even made the short list of vice presidential picks for Clinton alongside Bill Gates and others.\nPortions of Clinton’s technology platform already borrow heavily from Apple and Cook , who hammering away on Apple’s chief political issue earlier this year, said the choice between privacy and security painted by the FBI is a false one.\n“I know people like to frame this argument is privacy versus national security. That is overly simplistic and it is not true, this is also about public safety,” Cook said. “Our job is to protect our customers … It’s not just about privacy but it’s also about public safety.”\nCook and the company expounded on its position in an open letter and FAQ sheet , which states, “We feel the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands under the All Writs Act and, as some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology, and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy, and personal freedoms. Apple would gladly participate in such an effort.”\nIn what may be the first of many similar technology policy positions, Clinton agrees.\n“Hillary rejects the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe,” the “Protect Online Privacy as well as Security” portion of her tech platform reads . “She was a proponent of the USA Freedom Act, and she supports Senator Mark Warner and Representative Mike McCaul’s idea for a national commission on digital security and encryption. This commission will work with the technology and public safety communities to address the needs of law enforcement, protect the privacy and security of all Americans that use technology, assess how innovation might point to new policy approaches, and advance our larger national security and global competitiveness interests.”\nFollow Giuseppe on Twitter \nThe post Apple Could Get a Seat in a Clinton White House appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Apple Makes iTunes Backups ‘1,000 Times Safer’ in iOS 10.2 Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 09, 2016 | No Comments \nA security flaw discovered in iOS 10 made it possible to brute force iTunes backup password “approximately 2500 times faster” than before. Apple seems to have been silently working on fixing the flaw and issue by implementing stronger encryption measures in the first beta of iOS 10.2. \nWhen the security flaw in iOS 10 was first reported, Apple was quick to drop encryption of metadata in iOS 10.1 and also patched the security flaw. Now, with iOS 10.2, the company is working on making things even more secure. By implementing a stronger encryption process, Apple has made iTunes backups taken with iOS 10.2 up to 1,000 times more secure. \nNow in the first iOS 10.2 beta, things changed yet again, and Apple packed a little surprise for would-be attackers: not only is the entire backup database now encrypted, but validating a user password is now much more demanding in terms of processing power, requiring many more iterations to generate the derived key. Our user’s password is safer than ever, taking the better part of a 1’000 years for our hypothetical hacker to crack. \nApple has achieved this stronger encryption by increasing the number of iterations of the algorithm that validates the user inputted password. The more the number of iterations, the more secure and longer it will take for a password to be validated. \nApple has always taken security seriously and this move from the company to further secure local iTunes backup just further reinforces that fact.",

      "text": "Revenue from the 2016 MacBook Pro exceeds that of Microsoft Surface Book.\nSlice Intelligence Apple's MacBook Pro , the company's newest model for power users, is generating vastly more revenue than the company's ultralight laptop that debuted a year and a half ago, an e-commerce tracking firm says.\nThe MacBook Pro revenue in its first five days has reached 78 percent of last year's MacBook , Slice Intelligence said Tuesday . In addition, the new Mac has generated nearly four times that of Microsoft's Surface Book challenger since its debut a year ago.\nThat may sound like great news for Apple , but there likely was pent-up demand for the new MacBook Pro since it's gone years without a major redesign.\nAnd shoppers showed a willingness to switch to Windows-powered machines during the long wait, Slice found. Among those who bought an Apple laptop in 2014, 40 percent bought another brand since, Slice said. The firm bases its statistics on the behavior of a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers. It tracks online sales only.\nThe new MacBook Pro is smaller and lighter, with a starting price of $1,499. Higher-end models feature a touch-screen strip called the Touch Bar instead of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Critics don't like its lack of old-style but still widely used rectangular USB ports.\nApple declined to comment.",

That means you stand to save about 15 percent of the price of a new device. \nIn addition to spending less on Apple gear, you’ll also get a full 1-year factory warranty.

      "text": " Apple starts selling refurb iPhones through its online store Engadget 1 hr ago Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget If you've ever wanted to buy an iPhone straight from Apple but thought that brand new unlocked models were out of your reach, you're in luck. Apple has started selling refurbished iPhones in its US online store, with hefty discounts depending on what you want to buy. An unlocked 16GB iPhone 6s is selling for $449, or $80 off the usual price; splurge on a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus and you'll shell out $589, or $110 less than usual. The iPhone SE and iPhone 7 are absent, but that's not surprising given that owners have only had them for several months at best.\nThis won't be as big a bargain as you'd get by purchasing an iPhone through a used goods site, an auction or a friend. However, you'll get both a year-long warranty and the knowledge that there won't be any rude surprises when you open the box. In short: if the thought of shopping on eBay or Swappa makes you nervous, this is your best bet.\nApple\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack from iPhone 7 surprised many, but this audio chipmaker’s content increased substantially and the transition represents huge growth opportunity going forward.\nThe Company\nFounded in 1984 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Cirrus Logic ( CRUS - Free Report ) is a supplier of high-precision analog and digital signal processing components for a variety of audio, energy and industrial applications. They have ~1,380 employees and ~3,200 customers worldwide. Majority of their products are sold through direct sales channels.\nThe company has a strong intellectual property portfolio with 2,400 patents issued and pending. Cirrus Logic is the only supplier of a complete audio IC solution from capture to playback. Their audio chips are used in the leading smartphone brands, tablets, digital headsets, wearables and many emerging smart home applications.\nApple is CRUS’s largest customer, accounting for ~78% of the revenue in the reported quarter though the company develops solutions for many industry leading global brands.\nJack-less iPhone a Boon for Cirrus\nApple’s decision to remove the headphone jack has been great for this company. Their content in each iPhone 7 unit has gone up substantially because their chips are used in new lightning EarPods and adapter.\nThis is a huge opportunity for Cirrus because Apple sells about 45 million units in a quarter and is expected to sell 70 million in the holiday quarter.\nMany other smartphone makers are also making the switch from tradition headphones to digital headphones, following’s Apple’s lead.\nExcellent Earnings and Upbeat Guidance\nThe chipmaker reported its Q2 fiscal 2017 results on October 27. Revenue of $428.6 million came in above the high end of their guidance thanks to better-than-expected demand for some portable audio products.\nAdjusted earnings of $1.24 per share were substantially above of $0.95 per share.\n“We are extremely pleased with our progress in the September quarter as we began volume shipments of our new digital headset solution, expanded our share with boosted amplifiers and ramped production in a mid-tier smartphone at another leading customer”, said the CEO.\nThey also raised their guidance for the current year after solid results. Revenue is expected to range between $475 million and $515 million while GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 47 and 49%\nEstimates Soaring\nAfter the big beat and upgraded guidance, analysts have raised their estimates for the company. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next fiscal year have soared to $3.73 per share and $4.41 per share respectively, up from $2.83 and $3.35, before the results. Rising estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe company has an excellent record of beating as can be seen from the following “Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart”:\nThe Bottom Line\nAudio/video features continue to grow in complexity and differentiation value. While they continue to expand in high-end devices, they have now started moving into mid-range devices. These features continue to expand beyond smartphones and tablets, into wearables, accessories, automotive and connected homes.\nWith its leadership position in Analog and Mixed Signal Technology and focus on fast growing markets, Cirrus seems to be well positioned for solid growth in coming quarters.\nThe company is highly dependent on a single customer, so that makes the stock a bit risky but I think it’s worth a look due to growth potential.\nConfidential from Zacks\nThis week, Zacks researchers have named 7 other stocks that look to break out even sooner than today's Bull of the Day.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAlthough Apple CEO Tim Cook hasn’t officially laid out the company’s etched-in-stone plans for virtual reality and augmented reality, he has hinted that the company may lean more towards the latter, as AR keeps users visually connected with others in the same room while VR experiences completely engulf each viewer. Support for these technologies begins at the operating system level, and a recent patent reveals that Apple could be currently working on implementing AR into its base iOS services. \nPublished by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, Apple’s new patent is simply called “ Augmented reality maps .” It was submitted for approval in February 2010, and lists former Apple employee Jaron Waldman as the inventor. Waldman was responsible for developing the location-based services infrastructure for Maps, CoreLocation, and MapKit for iOS and OS X. He left Apple in 2013 to establish Curbside, a service for finding, buying, and retrieving products from nearby stores. \nMore: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events” \nBased on the new patent, Apple’s Maps application won’t utilize a special headset that will project augmented map information in the user’s field of view. Instead, the information will be displayed on a mobile device’s screen, and will based on the user’s current geographical location, camera direction, and the tilt of the device. Essentially, users will point their iOS device in a specific direction and a search result will display nearby points of interest in an overlay rendered over the camera’s real-time feed. \nFor instance, the owner of an iPhone may load up Maps and point the device in a specific direction when visiting Washington, D.C. In turn, Maps will render relevant information in a layer drawn over the camera’s real-time video feed displayed on the screen. This information will stay “attached” to those real-world points of interest no matter how the iPhone’s point-of-view is shifted. After that, if the user selects a location on the screen, Maps will progress to display directional information as the user moves toward that location. \nThat said, the AR version of Maps relies on several factors: a built-in camera, GPS connectivity, a digital compass to determine the camera’s direction, an accelerometer to determine the camera’s tilt orientation, and internet access for retrieving and servicing map information requests based on the area surrounding the current GPS coordinates. That information will include “descriptive” data of features including places, roads, buildings, and other points of interest. \nOf course, we can’t forget the graphics processor that will generate the augmented information and the real-time video feed on the same screen: \n“The graphics processor configured to: overlay, on the video image, map data representing each of the one or more identified points of interest and an illustrated portion of a route from the GPS location identified by the GPS device to a selected one of the identified points of interest, the route being determined based on the map data; and update the illustrated portion of the route as the GPS location of the video capture device changes with movement along the route; and the display configured to present the video image that has been overlaid.” \nIf anything, the patent reveals that Apple has tooled around with AR technology for at least six years. Naturally, the advancement of mobile technology makes the patent relevant to today’s devices rather than what powered the iPhone 4 so many years ago. It also shows that Apple is indeed building an AR foundation into iOS, and hopefully we’ll see all that work go live with an upcoming iOS release in the near future.",

      "text": "On stardate 3715.3, the starship USS Enterprise orbits the planet Gamma Trianguli VI . A landing party comprised of Captain Kirk , Commander Spock , Ensign Chekov , Yeoman Martha Landon and two security officers , Kaplan and Marple , beam down to the planet to scout the area, followed shortly after by Dr. McCoy and two more security officers, Hendorff and Mallory . \nSpock notes that the soil on the planet is rich and fertile and that there is very little variation in temperature, even at the poles, with a planet-wide average of 76 degrees. Chekov says that it makes him homesick, because it is \"just like Russia \". When McCoy corrects him that it is more like the Garden of Eden , Chekov claims that the Garden of Eden was \"just outside Moscow \". However, almost immediately, one of the crewmen, Hendorff, is shot and killed by a pod plant . \" What did somebody say? That paradise must have looked like this?\", Kirk says. Act one Edit \nKirk contacts Montgomery Scott on the bridge of the Enterprise , who reports that they are encountering a minor problem with the antimatter pods and that the readings on the planet's electromagnetic field are \"a wee bit abnormal\". At this point, it does not appear to be a major problem, but Kirk asks him to keep an eye on the situation. Spock reports that his tricorder has detected strong subsurface vibrations, coming from miles in all directions, that are \"quite strong, fairly regular, [and] artificially produced\". \nKirk orders two of the remaining security officers to make a full reconnaissance of the area, but to avoid contact with humanoids , be wary of other dangers, and stay in constant communication . Spock detects a humanoid lurking in the bushes nearby. Kirk goes off to investigate, and reports that \" whatever it is, it moves like a cat \". He advises the other members of the landing party that they are being watched, and they start heading through jungle for a nearby village in formation L. \nSpock discovers a rock that has a low specific gravity, and is very brittle. After breaking it in two with his bare hands, he casually tosses aside one of the pieces, and it violently explodes. Kirk asks him to be careful when tossing his rocks from now on. \nBack aboard the Enterprise , Scott contacts Kirk to report that the antimatter pods are completely inert because of something on the planet's surface that is acting \"like a pail of water on a fire\". Spock surmises that it may have something to do with the vibrations his tricorder picked up earlier. \nMcCoy shows Kirk some of the plant darts and notes that they have an extremely strong poison on the tip. While he and Kirk are talking, Spock notices one of the pod plants turning slowly and preparing to shoot, just in time to step in front of it and take a chestful of darts himself instead of Kirk. He falls to the ground and the captain fears the worst, but Spock is still alive and McCoy quickly begins treating him. \nRealizing there is too much danger, Kirk orders a retreat. However, Scott reports that the ship's power systems are being drained. An attempt to transport the landing party fails; the Enterprise 's transporters don't have enough power to even beam up a fly , Scott reports. Act two Edit \nAfter Kirk realizes he and his party are trapped on the planet, Spock regains consciousness, reporting that the injection McCoy had used to revive him turns his stomach, but that he is otherwise \"quite well\" (possibly spared by his Vulcan physiology). Kirk chastises him for stepping in front of the plant and tells him to \"just yell\" next time. Suddenly, an electrical storm starts and Lieutenant Kaplan is struck by lightning and vaporized. The rest of the party runs for cover. \nMeanwhile, security officer Mallory (who was not with the landing party when it was discovered that there were exploding rocks on the surface) has reached the village and contacts Kirk to tell him the coordinates, but his and Kirk's communicator stops working shortly afterward. Concerned for his safety, Kirk and the others rush to find him, just in time to see him step right onto an exploding rock. He is killed instantly. Kirk remarks that he knew Kaplan's family, and that Mallory's father helped him get into the Academy . Kirk has become increasingly distraught over the now multiple deaths of his crewmen. Spock and McCoy try to console him by telling him that he couldn't have foreseen any of the accidents that have happened while they were on the planet and that he was given orders to explore the planet, but Kirk is convinced that he could and should have done more to prevent the deaths. \" I won't hurt you, do you understand? I won't hurt you. \" \nWhile they are talking, Spock notices that the humanoid who was spying on them before has returned. Kirk orders Spock, Chekov, and Marple to create a diversion while he ambushes the humanoid. Kirk successfully comes up behind the humanoid and punches him in the face, but is surprised when the planet native starts to cry. Kirk assures the humanoid that he won't hurt him again, and asks him why he has been following them. He says, \" I am the eyes of Vaal . He must see, \" and introduces himself as \" Akuta , the leader of the feeders of Vaal . \" Spock notices antenna on the back of his head, and Akuta responds they are Vaal's ears, given to him in the \"dim time.\" \nKirk asks to speak to Vaal, but Akuta says that he is Vaal's representative and that only he speaks to Vaal. Akuta offers to take Kirk and the others to the village. \nMeanwhile, Scott hails Kirk to inform him that the Enterprise is being held in orbit around the planet by an unknown source, and is unable to break free. Kirk asks again to be taken to Vaal and this time, Akuta agrees, but says that Vaal will speak only to him. \nAkuta takes the landing party to Vaal, which is a large cave with a mouth that resembles the head of a serpent. Act three Edit \nSpock's tricorder reads that Vaal's opening leads beneath the planet's surface and Kirk believes it may be the source of the field that is affecting the Enterprise . When he tries to approach Vaal to get a closer look, he is repelled by a powerful force field . Kirk asks Akuta how he talks to Vaal, and he says that Vaal calls him when he has something to say and that Vaal might be willing to talk when he is hungry. \nAkuta leads the landing party to the village for food, drink, and rest and introduces them to the \"people of Vaal\" who are smiling and friendly to the landing party. A female native introduces herself as Sayana , and she and the others seem much amused upon learning Spock's name. Kirk points out that the tribe doesn't seem to have any children and asks Akuta why. Akuta at first doesn't know what a child is, but finally realizes Kirk is talking about \"replacements\", and replies that Vaal has forbidden love and marriage . McCoy scans the people and sounds surprised when he discovers they are in perfect health and that they don't seem to be aging at all. \nSuddenly, the villagers all begin to congregate around Vaal. Kirk and Spock follow, and spy on them from behind a bush. After observing that the villagers are able to approach Vaal, Kirk decides to try his luck. When Kirk and Spock start to get up from behind the bush, Vaal immediately notices, as apparent from suddenly glowing eyes, so they decide against it And resume their attitude of observing only. Kirk wonders whether Vaal gets weaker around feeding time and asks Spock to get an estimate from the Enterprise 's astrophysics lab of the total amount of energy Vaal is expending against the ship on an hourly basis. \nMcCoy joins them and complains to Spock that Vaal is depriving the planet's inhabitants of their right to \"a free and unchained environment\" and an opportunity for growth. Spock argues that McCoy is unfairly applying Human standards to non-Human cultures, and that humanoids also have the right to choose a system that works for them. \nScott contacts Kirk to report that Vaal's power output has been slowly decreasing, and that they are working on increasing power to the ship's impulse engines , but the work will take eight hours to complete. Kirk notes that they don't have much longer than that to break orbit before they get pulled into the planet's atmosphere . \nBack in the village, Kirk wonders what would happen if one of the villagers died . Yeoman Landon agrees that they would need a replacement, but she wonders where this replacement would come from, since they don't have any concept of love or sex . Spock postulates that in that case, Vaal would provide the \"necessary instructions.\" McCoy remarks that he would like to see that. \nOut in the jungle, two of the villagers, Sayana and Makora , see Landon and Chekov embracing and kissing , become curious and decide to try it themselves. Vaal reacts by shaking the ground as Akuta catches them in the act. Vaal communicates to Akuta through his antennae, apparently telling Akuta that Kirk and the others are dangerous to the planet's inhabitants. He calls a village meeting at the clear place of the male \"children of Vaal\" to take place while the landing party is asleep. \nAkuta tells the male villagers that Vaal has ordered them to kill the strangers. The villagers don't understand what the word \"kill\" means, so Akuta explains that \" it is a thing to do, like feeding Vaal, \" and demonstrates by smashing a piece of fruit (representing a stranger's head) with a stick. Act four Edit \nIn the hut, while the others sleep, Kirk and Spock discuss the situation. Kirk has decided that he agrees with McCoy: the villagers' society is completely stagnant and exists only to serve Vaal. Spock warns that interfering with Vaal would violate the Prime Directive but Kirk sees no other choice. \" These are people, not robots. \" Spock does not believe Starfleet Command would agree with Kirk's interpretation, but the captain decides to take his chances. \nKirk contacts Scott and asks for a progress report. Scott still needs half an hour to complete the modifications to the engines, but he only has 47 minutes until the Enterprise is pulled into the planet's atmosphere. \nSpock announces that the people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. Kirk and Spock go to Vaal and Spock determines that the force field is down. Kirk tries to talk to Vaal, but Vaal starts another lightning storm. Spock is stunned by a bolt of lightning, and Kirk carries him back to the village, where McCoy diagnoses him with second degree burns – painful, but not serious. \nSuddenly, the villagers return and successfully ambush and kill Marple but the others are able to fight off the rest of the villagers. Kirk orders Chekov, Landon, and McCoy to imprison the villagers in one of the huts. \nWith twelve minutes left before the ship enters the atmosphere, Scott has transferred all available power to the impulse engines and is ready to try to break orbit. He orders Kyle to apply full reverse and the ship begins to pull away enough to gain another hour but most of the ship's systems have been heavily damaged and Scott will not be able to try it again. Kirk becomes distraught at the idea of the Enterprise 's entire crew of over four hundred dying because he didn't realize the danger early enough and orders McCoy and Chekov to prevent any of the villagers from feeding Vaal and Scotty to concentrate all of the Enterprise 's phaser power on Vaal's coordinates. The ship begins firing phasers at Vaal. \nTrying to defend itself against Enterprise 's phasers forces Vaal to exhaust all of its energy reserves. Spock determines that Vaal is no longer generating any power and pronounces it dead. Scott reports that potency is starting to return to the ship's antimatter pods and that engineering will be able to start repairs immediately. Kirk orders him to send an engineering detail down to the surface as soon as the transporters are fixed and then tells Chekov and McCoy to release the villagers. Later, in front of a lifeless Vaal, Akuta is at a loss as to how he and his people will survive without Vaal. Kirk tells Akuta and the rest of the natives that they will now have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit and to love. \nBack aboard the Enterprise , Spock expresses his concern in one of the ship's corridors that the people of Vaal have been \"driven out of paradise \", as in the Biblical story of \" Genesis \". Kirk asks if Spock is casting him in the role of Satan , which Spock denies and then rhetorically asks Spock whether he knows of anyone on the ship who looks like Satan, while he and McCoy circle him. Spock replies, \" I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, captain. \" Kirk says, \" No, Mr. Spock, I didn't think you would. \" Log entries Edit \" Captain's log, stardate 3715.3. While making a routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli VI, one of my men has been killed by a poisonous plant. \" \" Captain's log, supplementary. Our investigation of Gamma Trianguli VI has suddenly turned into a nightmare. We're being watched and followed, Mr. Spock has been injured, and now we find we are unable to return to the ship. \" \" Captain's log, stardate 3715.6. We have been introduced to Vaal, evidently the source of the planet's power emanations, possibly the force that threatens both us, and our ship. \" Memorable quotes \n\" What did somebody say? That paradise must have looked like this? \" - Kirk , upon the death of Hendorff on Gamma Trianguli VI's surface \n\" The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow. A very nice place. It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave. \" - Chekov , as McCoy describes the planet as the Garden of Eden \n\" Garden of Eden, with land mines. \" - Kirk , after Spock tosses a rock which explodes \n\" Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions – turning my stomach. Other than that, I am quite well. \" \" If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach. \" - Spock and McCoy , as McCoy treats Spock from the poisonous thorns \n\" Trying to get yourself killed...Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you? \" \" One hundred twenty-two thousand, two-hundred... \" \" Never mind! \" - Kirk and Spock , as Spock recovers from taking an attack meant for Kirk \n\" Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! \" \" Uh, mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a very high efficiency rating! \" \" Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! \" \" What do you want, violins? \" - Spock and Chekov , creating a diversion for Akuta \n\" It, ah, does something for you. \" \" Yes, indeed it does, captain. It makes me uncomfortable. \" - Kirk and Spock , referring to the garlands given to Spock \n\" Little ones like yourselves. They grow. \" - Kirk , describing children to Akuta \n\" Well, there goes paradise. \" - McCoy , after learning that love is forbidden by Vaal \n\" There are certain absolutes, Mr. Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment; the right to have conditions that permit growth.'\"\" - McCoy to Spock , on the stagnant condition of the humanoids serving Vaal \n\" I mean, how is it ... done? \" \" Mister Spock, you're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady? \" \" Well, I believe it's safe... \" (Spock coughs) \" ... safe to assume that they would... receive the necessary... instructions. \" \" From a machine? That I'd like to see. \" - Landon , Kirk , Spock and McCoy , discussing Vaalian reproduction \n\" It is a... thing to do, like... like feeding Vaal. \" - Akuta , explaining to the followers of Vaal how they must kill Kirk and the others \n\" Second-degree burns. Not serious, but I bet they smart. \" \" Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement. \" - McCoy and Spock , after Spock is hit in the back by a lightning strike \n\" The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieve true Human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the first step. They've learned to kill. \" - Spock , after Marple presumably dies \n\" Little ones, look like you... just go on the way you're going, you'll find out. \" - Kirk , explaining children to the natives \n\" Is there anyone on this ship... who even remotely... looks like Satan? \" - Kirk , as he and McCoy circle Spock Background information Edit Spock's lightning-burned shirt was auctioned off at a science-fiction convention in 1967. This is the episode in which the redshirt phenomenon comes to the fore. Every red-shirted male in the landing party dies horribly. Hendorff is killed by the plant's poisoned darts, Kaplan by the lightning, Mallory is blown up by an exploding rock, and Marple is killed by a blow to the head. Of his many appearances in Star Trek 's second and third seasons, this was the most dialogue Jay Jones ever delivered. In fact, his only other speaking roles are three words in \" The Tholian Web \" and a couple of brief voiceover lines in \" Catspaw \". Jay Jones, a frequent stunt performer, was seriously injured while filming the \"exploding rock\" scene. Footage of the Enterprise firing phasers down to the surface of a planet is reused from \" Who Mourns for Adonais? \". Walter Koenig seems to have discarded the wig he used in his earlier episodes. Since his own hair was now long enough, it was not necessary for him to wear it anymore. The sparkling effects as Vaal is attacked by the phaser barrage were lifted from the opticals used for the Companion in \" Metamorphosis \". They will appear again in the opticals for the creature in \" Obsession \". Celeste Yarnall wore Grace Lee Whitney 's costume, left over from season one. It was recut and fitted to suit her. Worrying if Whitney might return and need the costume, Bill Theiss assured her that she will never return. ( These Are the Voyages: TOS Season Two ) George Takei ( Sulu ) and Nichelle Nichols ( Uhura ) do not appear in this episode. After reading the script giving Akuta an antennae implanted in his head, Bob Justman jokingly suggested they should cast Ray Walston (famous for his portrayal of \"Uncle Martin\" in My Favorite Martian ) for the part. ( These Are the Voyages: TOS Season Two ) Two and half decades later Walston was indeed cast in Star Trek , in the role of Boothby in \" The First Duty \". Spock states he has an assessable value in this episode, which he begins to enumerate as \"One hundred twenty-two thousand, two hundred ...\", after Kirk asks if he knows how much Starfleet has invested in him. McCoy describes the poison in the thorns that killed Hendorff and injured Spock to be \"like saponin, only 1,000 times stronger.\" Given the potency of sapotoxin, this would give it an approximate LD50 of 1 mg/kg earning it a rating of a class 1 toxin (extremely toxic) on the Hodge and Sterner Scale. It is established in this episode that the warp nacelles can be discarded from the ship and that it is a dangerous process. This episode's original script called for an emergency saucer separation . However, due to budgeting, the effect was only mentioned but not seen. It was seen for the first time in TNG 's pilot episode, \" Encounter at Farpoint \". In a special feature on the Star Trek (2009) DVD, Anton Yelchin , who plays his alternate counterpart in the film, specifically mentions Chekov's behavior in this episode - seemingly more concerned with \"macking\" on Landon than completing the mission at hand - as a prime example of the eccentricities which, in Yelchin's opinion, were the best thing about the character. The episode was adapted into issue thirteen of IDW Publishing 's alternate reality Star Trek: Ongoing comic series, \" Hendorff \". In this version, the redshirts survive their ordeal, although Hendorff (\"Cupcake\" from the 2009 film) wonders if in another universe everyone died. The 2013 video game Star Trek uses this episode's title as a chapter title. Remastered information Edit \nMinimal changes were made to the special effects in the remastered version of this episode. Most notable was the new appearance of Gamma Trianguli VI and the phaser color and its effect while hitting Vaal. The sky color surrounding the storm clouds (taken from stock footage) was tinted red and orange in the DVD version, to match the red colored soundstage backdrop. In the remastered version, it's reverted back to the original blue-gray and black.

      "text": "Apple appeared to disappoint a lot of potential customers when it ditched most of the ports on its latest MacBook Pro laptops. This brilliant parody video gives us the behind-the-scenes story as to how it came about.... More Apple’s decision to drop all but the USB-C ports on its latest MacBook Pro model annoyed many of the potential customers who’d been waiting an inordinate amount of time for the refreshed laptop to arrive.\nSo why did it do it? According to an “Apple engineer” in a new parody video (above), it’s so the tech giant could boost profits by forcing users to buy a bunch of dongles. Actually, some might agree with him.\nCreated in the same way as those amusingly subtitled Downfall videos , the engineer, who “worked in Apple’s laptop division,” explains to an interviewer that during the development of the latest MacBook Pro, Apple boss Tim Cook pressured them to create something more profitable than the iPhone.\nAt a meeting, one of the team members suggested they should “remove the ports and sell them as dongles.” Recounting the story, the engineer is unable to contain himself at the sheer absurdity of the idea – or possibly the pure brilliance of it.\nLaughing uncontrollably, he especially enjoys the idea that everyone who buys Apple’s latest laptop will “have to carry around a bag full of dongles,” adding that Tim Cook is “crazy for dongles.”\nThere’s plenty more choice lines that’ll have you chuckling, so check it out if you need a laugh.\nMore: DT’s guide to the new MacBook Pro models\nResponding to the outcry from disgruntled Apple fans looking to buy a new MacBook Pro, the Cupertino company on Friday slashed the prices of its range of USB-C dongles.\nThe company said it recognized that “many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem,”\nThe price cuts, which will save users between $10 and $20 a pop, will run till the end of the year.\nWhat’s the best MacBook for your money? Can Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 keep pace with Dell’s XPS 13? Watch Apple’s latest product announcements live, right now",

      "text": "Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) has often drawn comparisons to Apple ( AAPL ) , and Elon Musk to Steve Jobs. But in some ways, the electric car pioneer has more in common with Amazon.com ( AMZN ) .\nLike Amazon, Tesla started off by producing one innovative offering that addressed just a small portion of the total market it wanted to go after, and has gradually expanded its product line. And like Amazon, the company has absorbed substantial losses in the name of fleshing out its ambitious vision, and become a deeply polarizing subject among investors.\nAnd just like Amazon, Tesla has long treated the infrastructure that enables its main offerings as a core competitive advantage, one that it's willing to invest heavily in to gain an edge on rivals. Tesla's battery-producing Gigafactory and supercharger network both serve as examples. So does, of course, the investments Tesla has made in creating highly-automated, robot-filled, production lines at both the Gigafactory and the company's giant Fremont, California car manufacturing plant.\nOn Tuesday, Tesla added to its automation investments by striking a deal to buy Grohmann Engineering, a 700-plus employee German firm proclaimed by the company to be \"one of the world leaders in highly automated methods of manufacturing.\" Terms are undisclosed; the deal is expected to close in early 2017.\nTesla has already been working with Grohmann for over a year on projects related to its relatively low-cost Model 3 sedan, which the company plans to begin shipping in late 2017. \"Several critical elements of Tesla's automated manufacturing systems\" will be made at Grohmann's Prüm, Germany headquarters, according to the company.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "title": "iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 Now Released: New TV App, SOS Function And More",
      "text": "A week after the initial release of iOS 10.2 beta, Apple has now rolled out the second public beta, opening up the software for public testing. The update includes the new TV app, an SOS emergency function and more. ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple has released the iOS 10. 2 public beta 2 on Monday, just a week after it released the initial 10.2 beta . The tiny release gap might be indicative that the company is rushing to get this public build to the hands of developers as fast as possible. Chief among the new features introduced in the initial 10.2 beta release is the addition of an organization system for Apple Music alongside star ratings , a Preserve Settings option for the camera and a host of new emoji. The latest 10.2 public beta packs more than just performance improvements or bug fixes, though, since Apple has brought, as promised, the brand-new TV app the company first showed off during the MacBook Pro reveal event back in Oct. 28. Apple is now pushing out the second public beta of iOS 10.2, and if you aren't enrolled in Apple's Beta Software Program, here are the biggest changes included in the latest release. The New TV App For iPhone Apple's new TV app is Apple's own solution to online video for the iPhone, and while Netflix isn't jumping aboard Apple's new proprietary gimmick, there's plenty of partners present here, with a few examples being HBO Go, Hulu and Showtime Anytime to help users find content they want to stream. The app acts as a centralized hub for users who want to find a movie or a TV show they want to watch, upon which the app links the user to the services mentioned above in order to start streaming. Additionally, the TV app can make recommendations based on your history. SOS Emergency Calls The second public beta of iOS 10.2 also brings a new SOS function that connects the phone automatically with emergency services upon pressing the home button five times. Apple's release notes state that the SOS function is available in the United States and a number of countries including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain and the UK. A Slight Change To The Music App Slight changes have been also added to the music app. Shuffle and Repeat buttons now feature larger buttons instead of icons in the music interface during playback. Also present in public beta 2 are the new emoji with Unicode 9.0 support from the initial beta, as previously mentioned, along with new wallpapers and a new widget for the Videos app. Those enrolled in Apple's Beta Software Program can head over to Settings, tap General then Software Update. Follow the instructions and the new beta will download over the air. Before you can try the new beta, however, you must have Apple's public beta profile installed. \nHave you tried the iOS 10.2 public beta 2?

People who want to get an iPhone but want to save a few dollars are in luck. Apple has just started offering refurbished iPhones on its site at slightly more affordable prices. \nHowever, as far as officially offered Apple products go, the discounted prices still carry something of a premium. Savings are estimated to be typically around $80 to $110, reports Tech Crunch. \nThe current selection is limited to iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which are priced from $449 for the 16GB version of the 6s to $589 for the bigger 64GB Plus. Savings are calculated to be about 15% from the full retail price. ADVERTISEMENT \nAnd since these are officially released by Apple, despite being refurbished, they also get a one-year warranty.

      "text": "Comment Apple iMac 2016 releases on Oct. 27 \nIt would be rather strange for a company like Apple not to roll out a new or refreshed product each year -- and next year does seem to indicate that the red carpet for a new iMac model is due. Obviously, it will be known as the iMac 2017 for easier reference, but as at press time, nothing official has been revealed by Cupertino just yet -- so we will simply have to feed off rumors and whispers on the grapevine concerning the possible hardware configuration and specifications of the upcoming iMac 2017. Originally meant to be released with the recently introduced MacBook Pro 2016, it looks like the iMac 2017 is now slated for a release next year. \nWhile no one outside of the iMac development team and those who are supposed to be in the know of the situation at Apple have an inkling of an idea on what the iMac 2017 will come with, there is always the power of common sense which can be harnessed to take a stab at the possibilities. A slew of rumors have obviously started to gain steam, especially since Apple’s bitter rival, Microsoft, has launched their salvo of All-in-One devices in the form of the Surface Book i7 recently. \nWill the iMac 2017 run on Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors? Certainly an inference can be made there taking into consideration how there is a seeming lack of Intel Kaby Lake processors right now, which could be the reason as to why the iMac 2017’s release is delayed. Obviously, the processor is at the heart of every computer, and the lack of a processor would point to a surefire shortage. As for the MacBook Pro 2016 that was just introduced, it runs on the Intel Skylake processor, which is a predecessor to Kaby Lake. It might simply be a matter of a waiting game for Apple as they patiently bide their time for the chip manufacturer to ensure an adequate supply of Kaby Lake processors for the iMac 2017. \nThe MacBook Pro 2016 did come with its fair share of changes to up the ante in the high end notebook market, and chances are some of these features and functions might also see action in the iMac 2017. The Touch Bar feature is definitely one of them, and assuming this upgrade makes the cut in the new iMac 2017, it would certainly offer a fresh outlook and turn the page of a new chapter in the world of iMacs. It has been said that the Touch Bar feature would be considered to be an upgrade in terms of hardware, and should also offer a boost to the user’s productivity levels. \nAs for the possible release date of the new iMac 2017, we might be looking at some time in the middle of next year. After all, 2017 would mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and hence it would be a watershed moment to introduce something as revolutionary as the iMac 2017 -- assuming it does come with the Touch Bar feature at the very least, of course. After all, history has also persuaded this school of thought, since more than a couple of years have passed since Apple introduced a newer iMac to the masses, and hence is long overdue for a refresh .

      "text": "Earlier this year, in a move that was well received by gun control activists, Apple replaced the more realistic-looking gun emoji with a bright green water gun in its iOS 10 update. Android users should not expect a similar modification, as Google, which owns the operating system, announced at the inaugural Emojicon in San Francisco that it would be keeping its gun emoji.\nApple replaced its pistol emoji with a green squirt gun icon. Source: Apple Newsroom The motivation to keep the gun emoji is to ensure nothing gets lost in translation; Google essentially wants to make certain emojis are universally consistent across its different devices and platforms. This way, in theory, there will be no miscommunication between a user sending a relatively harmless water gun emoji and a user who receives a pistol emoji.\n\"The thing is, emojis already look different on different platforms, and it does cause confusion,\" Jeremy Burge, editor of Emojipedia, told the BBC at the time of Apple's gun emoji redesign. \"When we're dealing with guns and toys as a comparison, that's a whole new level of problems that we have there.\"\nCurrently, Apple's operating system is the only one to represent the gun emoji as a squirt gun. While Microsoft previously had a toy gun emoji, it switched to a revolver emoji as part of its Windows 10 Anniversary Update one week after Apple's announcement.\n\"We believe in the cross-platform communication, so we are maintaining our gun,\" Rachel Been, a Google art director who worked on Android emojis, said at the three-day event, according to Fortune .\nApple, Google and Microsoft are all members of Unicode Consortium , the nonprofit in charge of selecting and overseeing emojis.",

In the past, Mac Otakara has accurately leaked information about Apple's upcoming plans including the \"Jet Black\" colorway , the 3.5mm headphone jack as well as several other details about the iPhone 7.

This is the first time that the company has offered iPhones on its official refurb store online. \nCustomers will find the iPhone 6s in 16 GB storage varieties for $449.00. The larger iPhone 6s Plus is being offered in two storage varieties: 16Gb and 64GB for $529 and $589, respectively. It seems that all colors are currently available, which includes Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nIn the end, users can expect to save up to 15% ($110) by going the refurbished route, and remember that these devices come with a full 1-year factory warranty, which makes refurb units a great idea for budget-conscious shoppers.

      "text": "\nCREAMY SWEET POTATO, APPLE AND BACON SOUP \n1 tablespoon butter \n1 medium onion, thinly sliced (2 cups) \n1 to 2 medium Fuji or Gala apples, cored and thinly sliced (2 cups) \n1 teaspoon salt \n3 to 4 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch pieces (2 lb) \n32 ounces chicken broth \n1/2 cup heavy whipping cream \n2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar \n1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves \nIn 5-quart Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Cook bacon in butter 8 to 10 minutes or until just crisp. With slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel-lined plate; set aside. \nIn same Dutch oven, cook onion, apple and salt 7 to 9 minutes, stirring frequently, until very soft and beginning to brown. Add sweet potatoes and broth. Heat to boiling; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are very tender. \nRemove from heat; let stand 10 minutes or until cool enough to transfer to blender. Fill blender one-third to half full. Remove or loosen center cap from lid of blender. Cover lid with folded dish cloth, and hold it down when blending. Puree until very smooth. Return mixture to Dutch oven. Continue to blend in small batches until all is pureed. Heat to simmering over medium heat. Add whipping cream; return to simmering. Remove from heat; stir in vinegar. Top soup with bacon and thyme leaves. \nTips: When pureeing any hot liquid, steam can build up. This may result in the top of the blender jar being dislodged and hot liquid splattering. To avoid this, make sure never to fill the blender more than halfway with the hot liquid. Remove or loosen the center cap of the lid to release the steam, and always drape a dish cloth over the top to catch any small splatters. \nTop with shredded Parmesan cheese for an extra boost of flavor. \nIf reheating soup, consider adding just a touch more vinegar at the end, since acids tend to cook out after reheating.

      "text": "  \nApple is giving potential iPhone customers a cheaper way to buy a device — for the first time ever, the company is offering refurbished iPhones through its online refurbished store . \nThe store currently only offers the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but those models come in a variety of colors and different storage capacities. The price of the devices starts at much less than the new phone — you can get a 16GB version of the iPhone 6s for $449, and the 6s Plus for $529. \nMore: Color options for iPhone 7, 7 Plus may expand with addition of jet white model \nThe phones are between $100 and $120 less than buying a phone new, and all of the phones are unlocked and SIM-free — meaning that you could buy one and use it with any of the major U.S. carriers. It’s likely that over the next few years, more models will be on offer through the refurbished store — for example, after the iPhone 8 comes out, we’ll likely see refurbished iPhone 7s available too. It’s currently unknown if Apple only intends on offering the previous generation phone through its refurbished store. \nApple’s refurbished store has been around for a while, but until now it has only offered iPads and Macs. What that means is that customers who wanted cheaper iPhones had to buy one second-hand from another source, or wait for third-party sellers to refurbish phones for themselves. \nThe great thing about buying a refurbished product through Apple is that all devices are tested, cleaned, and certified. They also come with a one-year guarantee, and feature a new battery and a new case — meaning that there’s no outer damage to the devices. Buying a refurbished device from Apple is likely the next best thing compared to buying a new phone, and at a far cheaper price. Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge",

      "text": "DongleGate: Apple's Big 2016 Controversy newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) Twenty-five years of progress. Image source: Apple. \nThis happens every couple of years; it's just a lot louder this time around. \nIn the wake of Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) release of new MacBook Pros, which were unveiled last month, there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the company's decision to completely transition all input/output jacks to USB-C (Apple's implementation also supports Thunderbolt 3). The criticisms aren't misplaced, as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that they'll need for their daily workflow. The irony is that USB-C's potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. Apple isn't just swapping out one old port for one new port -- it's swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port. \nApple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc \n— Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 \nBut at the same time, the decision was hardly unexpected, as there had been months of rumors that Apple would switch completely to USB-C as the port of the future. It's useful at times like these to go back and revisit how Apple approaches which technologies to invest in. That's what he said \nSteve Jobs made his final appearance at AllThingD's D8 conference in 2010 and discussed the iPad and the controversial absence of Adobe Flash on the tablet. People were outraged that Apple's new device didn't support the standard web video technology of the time. His response to Walt Mossberg really hit at Apple's broader philosophy : \nWalt Mossberg: What if people say the iPad is crippled in this respect? \nSteve Jobs: Well you know, I'd say two things. Number one: Things are packages of emphasis. Some things are emphasized in a product, some things are not done as well, some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product. And so different people make different choices and if the market tells us we're making the wrong choices, then we listen to the market. \nWe're just people running this company. We're trying to make great products for people. And so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say, \"We don't think this is part of what makes a great product, and we're gonna leave it out.\" Some people are gonna not like that, they're gonna call us names, it's not going to be in certain company's vested interests that we do that, but we're gonna take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers. \nWe're going to instead focus our energy on these technologies, which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are gonna be the right technologies for customers. And you know what? They're paying us to make those choices. That's what a lot of customers pay us to do. Is to try and make the best products we can. \nAnd if we succeed, they'll buy them. And if we don't, they won't . And it'll all work itself out. So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking iPads. We've sold one every three seconds since we launched it. \nIt should be clear that USB-C is a technology that is in its ascendancy, even if Apple's switch is seemingly premature given the immaturity of the USB-C ecosystem. A second opinion \nThere's another quote that's a little more directly relevant here, too. This controversy actually started last year, when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, which also only uses USB-C. The main difference is that the move is less likely to attract ire in a consumer laptop, while professionals have greater connectivity needs with their tools and workflow. When asked about the decision in a Mashable interview, marketing chief Phil Schiller acknowledged that these types of transitions are often tough and uncomfortable: \"We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes.\" \nFrom an investing perspective, the real question is whether or not this controversy will prove to be a fading argument like all past instances, or if there will be some type of lasting impact on Apple's Mac business. Assuming that the industry indeed moves toward USB-C, which by all signs it is (slowly but surely), it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where this hurts Apple over the long haul. One encouraging data point is that Schiller also confirmed in a recent interview with The Independent that demand is soaring: \"And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.\" \nSo far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking MacBook Pros. It'll all work itself out. \n10 stocks we like better than Apple \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn't one of them!

      "text": "SEC filing by Apple appears to confirm use of OLED screen on future iPhone model SEC filing by Apple appears to confirm use of OLED screen on future iPhone model Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + There has long been speculation that Apple will replace the LCD screen long used on the iPhone, for an OLED panel in 2017. Next year, of course, will be the tenth anniversary of the handset. A report last month from the Nikkei Asian Review said that the OLED screen will be used on a special 5.5-inch 10th anniversary model , while the current LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) display will be employed on the 4.7-inch unit and a rumored 5-inch Apple iPhone.Apple itself has seemingly confirmed that it plans to use an OLED screen on at least one 2017 iPhone model. An SEC 10-K filing made by Apple was studied by investment firm J.P. Morgan. According to the latter, the filing revealed that Apple has placed a purchase order sourcing about a year's worth of OLED supply, possibly from Samsung. The value of the PO is $4 billion. Other potential suppliers of OLED panels to Apple include Sharp, which happens to be owned by iPhone assembler Foxconn, and Japan Display. Apple already features an OLED screen on the Apple Watch, and uses the technology on the Touch Bar employed on the new MacBook Pro.",

      "text": "Cross Platform C# Sez Who? Support for iOS 10 Speech Recognition in Xamarin With Apple's update to its phone OS, we look at the support that Xamarin has for it by building a simple speech app. Get Code Download \nOn September 7 Apple introduced it's newest phone operating system, iOS 10, a gold master version of the XCode programming language and the iOS SDK Xamarin followed up the next day with binding support for iOS10 APIs, and developers were off to the races. Apple supplied the final releases of iOS10 and developer tools the next week after, and Xamarin had updates in less than 24 hours. \nTechnology happens that quick these days. \nIn this and future articles (depending on how you respond to this one), I'll highlight some of the new features in iOS10 and Xamarin's support of these features. Since we aren't going to attempt to cover everything here, I'd like to look especially at what I think will be useful now, and this time we'll cover speech recognition capabilities to get you started. Speech recognition is getting more useful as an input option for apps where users need to be less distracted (when driving, for example). \nFirst, let's quick look at some of the newer features, changes, and deprecated features: True Tone Display. iOS 10 uses ambient light sensors in an iOS device to adjust the color and intensity of the display based on the current lighting that the device is in. App Extensions. Apple has provided new app extension points. App Search Enhancements. Core spotlight provides a number of new search enhancements. CallKit. This provides a mechanism for VOIP apps to integrate with the iPhone UI and provide a familiar user experience. Message App Integration. New functionality allows for the sending of stickers, media files, and interactive messages. Publisher Enhancements. Anyone will be allowed to sign up and deliver content to the Apple News app. Security and Privacy Enhancements. These enhancements will improve the security of code and ensure user privacy. SiriKit. This allows an app to integrate with Siri. Speech Recognition. It allows an app to support continuous speech recognition and transcribe speech. Video Subscriber Account. This provides a single sign in experience for apps that present authenticated on demand streaming. Wide Color. It extends the support for extended range pixel formats. There are numerous other new features, updates to existing features, and deprecated APIs. Check the references at the of this article for links. \nSpeech Recognition While there are clearly a number of exciting new features in iOS 10, what I find to be most exciting is the integration with voice, which I'll cover here. There are several items to be aware of with speech recognition in iOS 10: A connection to the Internet and Apple's servers must be available. Most of the speech recognition works by converting the text to a digital format and sending it to Apple's servers. The textual result is returned to the application. The speech recognition is based on the same technology as Siri and Apple's keyboard dictation. Multiple interpretations of what the user said are returned. Confidence levels for the translations are returned. Requires iOS 10, but not a specific device. \nThere are several permissions that must be provided. These included the NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription key in the Info.plist file. Along with the info.plist key, the program should call SFSpeechRecognizer.RequestAuthorization method. This method will let a user allow or disallow speech recognition. \nThe general steps to use speech recognition in an iOS 10 app are: Provide a usage description in the Info.plist file. This is provided in the NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription key. Request authorization with the SFSpeechRecognizer.RequestAuthorization method. For an existing audio file, use the SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest class. For live audio, use the SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognition class. Pass the speech recognition class to a speech recognizer to start the recognition process. The results that are returned are provided asynchronously. This means when trying to communicate back with the user interface, you will need to talk to the UI on the correct thread. \nLet's build a simple application.

      "text": "Everybody knows that Google’s Android Auto and Apple CarPlay apps offer phone users the ability to use their features off the vehicle’s infotainment display. Likewise, that meant a compatible music player was required and hence put a lot of users, who had older cars, to inconvenience.\nGoogle has now updated the Android Auto app which will let users access the application on the phone instead of the car’s screen, and anyone with an Android phone running Lollipop (OS version 5.0) or newer can use the new version. Once set up, the new Android Auto application automatically fires up and connects to the music player through the Bluetooth function.\nThe app has three icons at the bottom of the screen for maps (with turn-by-turn navigation commands), phone calls, and audio listening. Once the user is accessing any of these functions, a large home button becomes visible so that one can hit on it to go back to the Android Auto home page.\nGoogle added that support for hands-free voice commands is on its way in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.",

      "text": "Looking for an iPhone 6S on the cheap? You can now get a deal directly from Apple — if you don't mind buying a refurbished device.\n9to5Mac reported Tuesday that Apple has started selling refurbished versions of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus at its online store .\nSEE ALSO: The complete guide to the iPhone's Bedtime mode\nThe company previously sold Macs, iPads and other devices on its online store, but refurbished iPhones were mostly offered on eBay or offloaded to third-party resellers.\nThe deals we're seeing right now offer 15 percent off of the device's full price. For example, you can get a refurbished iPhone 6S with 16GB of storage memory for $449 (an $80 discount); the version with 64GB of memory goes for $589 (a $110 discount). Only these two models are available.\nImage: Apple\nWhile buying a refurbished device might not sound like a great option to everyone, remember that these phones come with Apple's regular one-year warranty. Apple also notes that all refurbished iPhone models come with a brand new battery and outer shell.\nAs is usually the case with refurbished models, supply is limited, so if you're interested, you might want to act fast.",

      "text": "Donald Trump Elected President of the US Is Bad News for Apple and Microsoft GO Trump criticized the tech industry several times before Nov 9, 2016 12:42 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Donald Trump is the new President of the United States even though only a few people actually expected this to happen, and now many people involved in the tech field are wondering how the government’s relationship with large technology companies can change over the course of the next four years. Unfortunately, Donald Trump becoming President of the United States isn’t quite the best news for Silicon Valley, mostly because the Republican criticized tech companies several times for building products overseas, as it’s the case of Apple and its iPhone. The San Bernardino saga Furthermore, Trump had often condemned the likes of Apple and Microsoft for not working closely with the US government in a number of very controversial cases, such as the San Bernardino iPhone when the FBI requested Apple to break into the phone used by one of the December 2015 shooters. Although Apple strongly opposed to the request and pledged to offer full privacy to its customers, no matter who they are, several government officials blasted the firm, saying that it puts the national security at risk by protecting terrorists. Trump was obviously one of the main critics, pointing out with pretty harsh words that if he were to be the President, Apple was not allowed to do such a thing. “Who do they think they are? They have to open it up,” Trump said. “I think security, overall, we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense.” Donald Trump, however, owns Apple stock worth millions of dollars, but this hasn’t stopped him from calling a boycott of products manufactured by the Cupertino firm. The Apple boycott and backdoors “Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK? I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number,\" he said, adding: \"I just thought of it. Boycott Apple,” he said. Oddly enough, Trump also turned to the Internet to condemn Apple for its refusal to break into the terrorist’s phone, but tweeted the harsh words with an iPhone. It’s not a secret that tech giants supported each other in the fight against the US government and some took decisions that directly impacted Trump. Microsoft, for example, refused to support the Republican National Convention with a cash donation earlier this year, choosing instead to contribute with technology. Several organizations requested other companies, including Apple and Google, to follow Microsoft’s lead, and it goes without saying that Donald Trump has no reason to be pleased with it. And last but not least, Donald Trump said several times during the presidential race that he wanted American companies to focus on American facilities and employing American workforce, and with the likes of Microsoft, Google, Apple and others having thousands of employees overseas, it’ll be interesting to see how this relationship develops. Donald Trump promised in his speech this morning that he’ll be the president of every American and will fight “to make America great again. Tech companies headquartered in the US have been saying pretty much the same thing with other words for a while now, but a dispute between the two sides is just a matter of time, especially after January when Donald Trump officially becomes the President of the United States.

      "title": "Confirmed: No Touch Bar support for Apple’s Logic Pro X music editor in 2016",
      "text": "Apple confirmed in a recent email when Logic Pro X will receive an update supporting the Touch Bar hardware in new MacBook Pros. Don't expect support anytime soon, however, as the music production tool won't utilize this feature in 2016. More Apple marketing director Xander Soren recently confirmed when Logic Pro X will receive support for the cool Touch Bar installed in Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptops. In an email to one of AppleInsider’s readers , the Apple exec said that the feature wouldn’t arrive until early next year. The confirmation followed rumors that suggested the same release window despite GarageBand and Final Cut Pro X already supporting the new touched-based strip.\nApple introduced the Touch Bar during a recent press event showcasing the latest MacBook Pros. The strip replaces the function keys, and essentially keeps the user’s hands glued to the keyboard area, eliminating the need for a connected mouse. It’s powered by a modified version of WatchOS and monitored by a standalone processor that also handles the new Touch ID security feature on MacBook Pros.\nRelated: The Touch Bar is only the beginning of Apple’s grand designs for the laptop keyboard\nThe new Touch Bar supports 10-point touch input and features a resolution of 1,085 x 30. It’s divided into three regions, with the System Button area located to the left for important buttons like escape and cancel, a large App Area in the middle for extending an application’s functions, and the Control Strip on the right that provides virtual keys for adjusting the display’s brightness, adjusting the volume, and so on.\nLate last month during Apple’s presentation, the company showed how users could move video forward and backward with the slide of a finger on the narrow OLED strip. Even more, images could be fully rotated with a simple touch, lighting could be easily adjusted, filters and affects could be applied, and more just on the Touch Bar alone.\nOverall, Touch Bar support will be integrated throughout the MacOS system and into Apple’s first-party programs to make the MacBook Pro more accessible, productive, and manageable. That seemingly meant all Apple software would support the new hardware sometime around the MacBook Pro availability, but the recent confirmation from Apple over Logic Pro X indicates that the company’s music production software needs extra time to get full Touch Bar support just right.\nRelated: Adobe to release Photoshop update with MacBook Pro Touch Bar support\nThus, as it stands now, Touch Bar support in Logic Pro X will arrive after many third-party developers update their software to include Touch Bar functionality. Photoshop will take advantage of the Touch Bar before the end of the year along with DJ Pro, Microsoft’s Office suite of products, and even Skype Pro for Business. The Affinity designer software and the Sketch professional design software will soon add Touch Bar support too.\nApple’s move to take time in adding Touch Bar functionality in Logic Pro X could be a sign that MacBook Pro users may have to wait a while before the new touch strip is fully utilized by all first-party and most third-party solutions. It’s a new concept, thus developers are likely trying to figure out the best way to take advantage of the new hardware without repeating the same functions on the screen. We can only assume the experience will be even better when Apple reveals the second-generation Touch Bar next year.\nMicrosoft explains how its Office suite will use the MacBook Pro Touch Bar Apple's Final Cut Pro X gets updated to version 10.3, adds Touch Bar support Check out Apple’s touchy new OLED bar mounted in the new MacBook Pro laptops",

      "text": "Author Taylor Stanton Categories Apple , Business Trends Tags Apple , data , e-commerce , Macbook Pro , Touch Bar New data indicates it may bring former buyers back to Mac \nThe new MacBook Pro is here, and Slice Intelligence reports that in the first five days of availability online, the latest model generated over seven times the revenue that the MacBook 12-inch did during its April 2015 launch. The new model’s sales already equal 78 percent of all the revenue generated by the MacBook 12-inch since it became available, and has accumulated more revenue than any other laptop this year. will the new MacBook Pro bring former Apple buyers back to Mac? \nThis successful launch may be luring those who have abandoned Apple back to the brand. Touch-screen technology has been deployed by other laptop brands for years and shoppers looking for the newest technology would have to move away from Apple to try the new tech. \nSlice Intelligence found 40 percent of Apple laptop owners who purchased a MacBook in 2014 bought their next laptop with another brand. Dell and Asus computers were the most popular laptops for people who previously purchased a MacBook. MacBook Pro shoppers mirror Apple Watch early adopters \nThose who ordered the new MacBook Pro look strikingly similar to the early adopters who bought the Apple Watch on release. Over eighty percent of shoppers who bought a MacBook Pro in the first five days release have been men, which is the same gender breakdown that we reported when the Apple Watch was released in April 2015. \nabout this data \nWith a panel of over 4.4 million online shoppers, Slice Intelligence gives the most detailed, and accurate digital commerce data available, and is reported daily. \nSlice Intelligence is the only service to measure digital commerce directly from the consumer, across all retailers, at the item level, and over time. Our retailer-independent methodology precisely measures commerce as it happens. By extracting detailed information from hundreds of millions of aggregated and anonymized e-receipts, Slice can map the entire Purchase Graph, connecting each and every consumer to all their purchases. \nSlice gets its data from e-receipts – not a browser, app or software installed by the end-user – so its measurement reflects comprehensive shopping behavior across multiple devices, over time which are key in an increasingly omnichannel retail world.

      "title": "Apple’s New MacBook Pros Are Already Outselling The Competition",
      "text": "Apple’s New MacBook Pros Are Already Outselling The Competition  53 PST \nThere have been numerous complaints made about Apple’s new MacBook Pros . Whether it be that the specs aren’t as good as the competition, or that it is too expensive, or that it didn’t meet expectations, we’ve heard it all. However it seems that despite the complaints, Apple’s MacBook Pros are apparently outselling the competition . \nThis is according to a report from Slice Intelligence in which based on the numbers that they’ve managed to gather, the MacBook Pro has managed to generate more revenue than any other laptop that has been sold in 2016. As you can see in the graph above, within 5 days the new MacBook Pros have generated almost five times the sales compared to the 2015 Surface Book. \nIt has also generated almost ten times the sales of the ASUS Chromebook Flip, the Dell Inspiron 2-in-1, and the Lenovo Yoga 900. It also seems that the new MacBook Pros are on track to outdo the 12-inch Retina MacBook which has been on sale since way back in 2015, so that’s saying a lot. \nWhile we can’t be sure of the accuracy of the numbers, Apple has confirmed that the new MacBook Pros have received the most online orders than any other laptop the company has released to date. We are also hearing reports that Apple has been aggressively placing orders in their supply chain to meet the demand. So it looks like despite the grievances that customers might have had at the start, Apple’s new laptops are actually off to a pretty good start. \nFiled in Apple > Computers .
