      "text": "SHARE 0 \nI have a confession to make. Remember my 5-star review of Luke Cage ‘s first four episodes? I still stand by that. But I don’t stand by that rating for the entire season. Luke Cage fell into the Marvel-Netflix trap of having far too many episodes, with a story that slowed down to an unbelievably glacial pace as it marched towards its sixth and seventh episodes (a gruelling, slow march). Maybe it was the lack of Jessica Jones, or how Luke Cage felt totally unconnected to the rest of Netflix’s Marvel Universe (despite the advent of the Claire Temple), or how a good villain with a complicated story like Cottonmouth got turned into … whatever the hell Diamondback was about. \nThere were a lot of things Luke Cage did well — Mike Colter ‘s casting continues to be the character’s biggest boon, and the way the show really leaned into its Harlem setting and made this very specifically a show about black superhero was very different and very good. But the reality is that nobody likes a mopey superhero, I don’t care what current movies try to force on us. Luke Cage as a “hero for hire” that has to decide to fight for people for good rather than for pay is a much more interesting story than a guy who just wants to be left alone, and slowly (so, so very slowly) gets pulled into the idea of doing more. So slowly. Image via Netflix \nNetflix dropped the news of Luke Cage ‘s renewal on a Sunday afternoon during the holiday season, when almost no one is online. Were they hiding the fact that there would be no fervor over this? Or was it to elicit a “Sweet Christmas!” The renewal was inevitable — Netflix and Marvel are banking on this partnership for the long-haul — but by the time Luke Cage Season 2 rolls around (which will be a long time, one guesses), maybe it’ll be more interesting. In the comics, Luke is best friends with Iron Fist and romantically involved with Jessica Jones. I understand why Netflix is giving each show its own origin, but they aren’t all dropping at once. It’s taking a long, long time, and some crossover would be appreciated. Look at how, on the DC side, Arrow launched Flash which in turned helped launch Legends , with Flash also acting as a bridge to Supergirl even when they were on different networks. You don’t have to have these characters around for all 13 episodes of another hero’s season, but ignoring the fact that they all live in the same city (and most of them in the same borough) is getting ridiculous. \nWhat this all seems to suggest is that The Defenders ‘ season will be all about getting the team together, a la The Avengers . Netflix has all the time in the world to let these stories play out, but viewer patience is finite. Let’s hope by the time Luke Cage Season 2 does get here, some of these issues will be fixed. \nFor a complete list of the renewals and cancellations of over 150 scripted series, check out our TV Lifeline .

      "text": "Courtesy of IMDA December 6, 2016 | 03:35AM PT \nSINGAPORE – Global streaming video giant, Netflix is in talks to co-produce local Korean content with iHQ , the production subsidiary of Korean pay-TV provider D’Live. \n“Korean people are very dedicated to local content,” said Jeon Yong-ju, CEO of D’Live and iHQ. “Netflix is interested in investing in Korean content, therefore D’Live’s and Netflix’s visions are in sync. Korean content needs to compete with global content.” \nJeon was delivering a keynote at the Asia Television Forum & Market in Singapore on Tuesday. In May, Netflix partnered with D’Live to provide its content in Korea via D’Live’s set top box, choosing the smaller player over larger platforms like SK Broadband and LG UPlus. \nD’Live started small, with distribution of 10,000 set top boxes in 2016, but it has aggressive plans for 2017. “We are aiming for 300-500,000 boxes in 2017,” Jeon said. \nIn 2017 D’Live is also launching an all-in-one 1Gb OTT set top box that will deliver 4K content, and an app tentatively titled D’Live K-Wave OTT, that will feature content from D’Live’s roster of K-Wave talent. \nIt wasn’t always sweetness and light for the company. 2015 saw the company, then called C&M, fail to stave off competition from IPTV providers and a consequent subscriber base erosion from 2.7 million to 2.3 million. “We underestimated the competition,” Jeon said. \nJeon was hired as CEO in April 2016 and his first step was to rebrand C&M as D’Live. The next stage was refinancing. In May, prior to the Netflix partnership, the company was on the brink of going into creditor management. Things have looked up since then. “We have successfully refinanced for the next three years with local financial institutions,” Jeon said. \nThe next step for 2017 is to expand in Asia, beginning with Singapore. “We’d like to be the gateway to global content providers,” Jeon said.

      "text": "The content boss of Netflix has explained why the quantity of the streaming service’s movie collection has declined so substantially over the past two years.\nWhen asked about Netflix’s thinner film selection, Ted Sarandos told the UBS Global Media and Communications conference in New York that only around a third of the media company’s subscribers watch movies.\nHe explained that even in Canada, where Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, only a third of viewing comes from films--the same as in the U.S. which has just one deal . “No matter what, we end up with about one-third of our watching being movies,” Sarandos said, according to Business Insider .\nSarandos added that one of the reasons why movies don’t do as well as TV shows on Netflix is because of the delay between films’ releases and Netflix being able to show them. “If you were passionate [about the movie], you’ve already seen it [when it came out],” he said.\nResearch reported on earlier this year showed that in 2014, roughly 20% of IMDB’s top 250 movies were available to watch on Netflix, whereas only around 12% were in September 2016. Additionally, Netflix's selection of titles has dropped over 50% since 2012, according to the streaming blog Exstreamist.",

      "text": "\nNetflix plans to double the number of original series it produces next year, adding 20 new unscripted series as well as several scripted series, according to a report by Variety ‘s Todd Spangler.\nThe streaming media company currently has 30 original series in “various stages of development or release,” Spangler writes.\nNetflix intends to focus on unscripted reality shows with the potential to “travel” to international markets.\nSpangler gives Ultimate Beastmaster , a physical competition reality show produced by Sylvester Stallone and Dave Broome, as an example of a show will travel well. Ultimate Beastmaster is already slated for production in six different countries — the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan — with differently athletes or celebrities hosting the show in each country.\n“When Beastmaster hits in Korea, they’ll never have seen anything like it,” Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said.\nNetflix Has 30 Original Series Today, Will Double That In 2017, Content Chief Ted Sarandos Says https://t.co/gvsjqetWDH pic.twitter.com/xSq3Lrpnr8 \n— Variety (@Variety) December 6, 2016 \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York on Monday, Sarandos said that Netflix will produce up to 1,000 hours of new original programing in 2017, adding “that’s a conservative measure right now,” according to Spangler. One thousand hours of new original programming would roughly double what Netflix offered in 2016.\nTo allow for the production costs of the new programming, Netflix will increase its budget for new programming from $5 billion for 2016 to $6 billion for 2017 on “a profit-and-loss basis,” Spangler notes.\nTechCrunch reported in September that Netflix aims to make 50 percent of its video library original content .\n“The 50-50 target was revealed by Netflix CFO David Wells at the Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia conference on Tuesday (via Variety ), and Wells added that they’d like to hit that mix sometime over the course of the next few years,” TechCrunch reported. “As for its progress so far, Wells said Netflix is already about ‘one-third to halfway’ to that ratio, having launched 2015 hours of original programming in 2015, and with the intend of achieving a further 600 hours by the end of 2016.”\nProducing original content has long-term benefits for Netflix in terms of licensing and profitability, TechCrunch explained. While the upfront costs of producing your own content can be greater, it is a “one-and-done” deal, giving the producer the rights to the work in perpetuity without having to renew licensing agreements or pay out more money in licensing fees down the road.\nAnd Netflix has seen extraordinary success with much of its original content, particularly the Stranger Things series and the Luke Cage and Jessica Jones series from the Marvel universe.\n#SweetChristmas : Netflix has renewed Marvel’s Luke Cage for another season. Time to re-up on our coffee! https://t.co/ya5d2xf86b pic.twitter.com/rN3aVqiIKW \n— JET magazine (@GetJETmag) December 6, 2016 \nNetflix will also focus on expanding its library of original movies.\n“According to Sarandos, the comedies from Adam Sandler it has released so far ( The Ridiculous 6 and The Do-Over ) have been the No. 1 performing titles everywhere in the world,” Spangler writes. “He also pointed to Bright , a cops-and-orcs action film starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton and directed by David Ayer ( Suicide Squad ), as a potential franchise.”\n“That’s the kind of project we’re trying to steer the model toward — the way we’ve created television events, can we do that in the movie space?” Sarandos said.\nWhile Netflix is working on providing more and better programming, the company is also striving to improve the overall user experience of its members.\nEngadget reported Monday that Netflix has “ updated its video coding to make downloads look better .”\nThe update focused on improving the way movies are downloaded to smartphones from Netflix. The goal was to provide better visual quality while reducing the amount of data used by the phone.\nOne area that Netflix still is not looking to expand into is live sporting events. Sarandos says that Netflix simply isn’t a very good platform for live programming.\nDoubling the amount of original content seems like a fair trade off.\n[Featured image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]\nNetflix Plans To Double Its Number Of Original Series Next Year, Adding 20 Unscripted Shows is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile App News / Netflix is now the USA’s top-grossing iPhone app – any guesses why? Netflix is now the USA’s top-grossing iPhone app – any guesses why? \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nNetflix has rocketed to the top of Apple’s list of ‘Highest Grossing’ App Store apps in the USA, marking a first for the streaming giant. \nAfter a couple of single-day stints in second position over the last two months, Netflix has finally landed itself first place on the list of App Store apps that generate the most money. By comparison, Netflix was the seventh highest-grossing iOS app in the US for November – so this is a major leap. \nThere are two key moments that are likely to have prompted this rise to glory for Netflix. The first was the addition of in-app subscriptions that was introduced last autumn, allowing users to pay for their membership through the Netflix app. According to analysts at Sensor Tower , Netflix’s weekly net revenue has grown from below $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million since the change. \nBut what probably nudged Netflix into the top spot was the introduction of offline viewing last week. The new feature allows users to download content to watch without an internet connection – a long-request feature that was already offered by major rivals like Amazon Video. This new feature may have been enough to prompt even more users to pick up a Netflix subscription, thus propelling Netflix into first place. \n  figures don’t simply rely on day-to-day sign-ups. If a user subscribes to Netflix through the iPhone apps, all of their monthly payments will count towards the tracked revenue. \nBut these aren’t the only reasons why Netflix has seen such a steady revenue growth. The company has been heavily investing in original content, which has allowed Netflix to create an impressive base of exclusive TV shows and movies that draw customers away from rival services. Netflix is also planning to push into unscripted programming too, with 20 such shows expected to debut next year. \nNetflix has also been increasing its pricing over time, too. For instance, the monthly cost of the HD subscription increased from $7.99 to $9.99 for new subscribers in April 2014. And existing customers grandfathered on the old price were shifted onto the higher pricing tier in May this year – unless they opted to downgrade their package to standard definition instead. \nHowever, the price hike hasn’t hampered the company’s success. After a global rollout in January 2016, Netflix’s latest figures put the total subscriber base at over 86 million users worldwide – 47 million of which are in the USA. \nWatch: What you need to know about Netflix Offline Viewing \nAre you a Netflix subscriber?

      "text": "Several years ago, when Netflix was playing around with a redesign of its platform, Chris Jaffe , VP of user interface innovation, went to Barnes & Noble and bought every entertainment magazine on the rack. He took them all home and spread them out on his living room floor. Then he asked himself this question: How does Hollywood merchandise its shows?\n\"And what you saw when you stood back and looked was that it was all about strong imagery with a small amount of contextual text,\" Jaffe tells me during a recent interview, standing in a conference room at Netflix&apos;s Los Gatos headquarters. \"It was, &apos;Here&apos;s The Walking Dead &apos; and there was a big, strong image of that. Or, &apos;Here&apos;s Mad Men ,&apos; and a big image.\" \nChris Jaffe This revelation led Netflix—following the kind of exhaustive testing and research the company is famous for—to ditch its earlier UI design, which highlighted optionality, and put an emphasis on imagery instead. By now, most subscribers are familiar with the look, which debuted in 2013: A series of lush, rotating images dominates the screen, accompanied by a simple synopsis.\nNetflix found that the new design did a better job of connecting viewers to its approximately 7,000 movies and TV shows, but, Jaffe says, \"We always thought it could be better… and the better way is video.\"\nThe future of browsing, according to Netflix. This hunch, confirmed by further rounds of tests and data gathering, has led to an even bigger UI upgrade, which is being rolled out to the company&apos;s 86 million global subscribers starting today, as announced in a company blog post . Now, as you scroll through the rows of offerings, preview videos for each title will begin automatically playing whenever you linger on an image for more than a second or two. It&apos;s a drastic change for a site that, when it debuted its internet TV service in 2009, looked like \"an efficient vending machine,\" Jaffe jokes.\nAnd it brings the Netflix experience far closer to old-fashioned channel surfing and further away from the act of staring at a computer screen and clicking static icons (which is, incidentally, what browsing Amazon still feels like). Ironic throwback, perhaps, but nonetheless exactly what Netflix was going for. Says Stephen Garcia , director of product innovation at Netflix: \"Television has decades&apos; worth of expectation that when you turn it on, the video and audio play. So it&apos;s actually quite strange to have a silent experience.\"\nThe move may cause some blowback in the same way that the autoplay feature on Facebook has drawn grumbling from people who don&apos;t like videos instantaneously playing as they scroll. But Netflix remains steadfast in its belief that TV—as opposed to a social media site or blog—is meant to come to life when you turn it on. So for now at least, it isn&apos;t offering a disable option. That will likely change, however, on the laptop and mobile UIs, which are still in the process of being tested and built. \n\"Television has decades&apos; worth of expectation that when you turn it on, the video and audio play. So it&apos;s actually quite strange to have a silent experience.\" \"You&apos;re used to turning on TV and things being loud and happening,\" Jaffe says. \"It&apos;s a different thing on your laptop and mobile. We&apos;re evaluating those (experiences) right now, we&apos;re going through the design exercises on mobile. We&apos;ll probably have different considerations.\"\nAnother important detail: The experience won&apos;t be available to all Netflix users at once. At launch, the Sony PlayStation, Xbox One and S, and Roku platforms will have the upgrade. Following in the next few months will be the Xbox 360, then smart TVs and other set-top boxes such as the Fire TV and Android TV. Other devices—including the Apple TV and Wii—will be upgraded as soon as possible, though Netflix is not sharing specific timelines. (The 2013 UI design has never been implemented on Apple TVs because Apple insists that its app developers all adhere to a grid design, as explained here .)\nStephen Garcia The intuitive rationale behind the upgrade was that video is a far more compelling format when advertising, well, video, not to mention a feature that users have come to expect from their online experiences. (Netflix customers have been demanding the kinds of trailers that iTunes, Hulu, and HBO Go provide.) But more importantly, Netflix found that when users interact with videos rather than still images, it cuts down on browsing time.\n\"What this video does is make it so that people actually have to browse less before they find something that they feel confident in watching,\" Garcia says. \"When I say &apos;confident,&apos; I mean that you pick something and you watch a little bit or you watch a lot. So did you finish Beasts of No Nation or did you watch a little bit and say, &apos;This isn&apos;t for me, I&apos;m out&apos;? And when you pick something and don&apos;t finish it, that&apos;s a failure on our part. So what we really wanted to do was make sure we were helping you find something great.\"\nNetflix found that when users interact with videos rather than still images, it cuts down on browsing time. Less browsing doesn&apos;t completely answer the biggest existential problem that Netflix users grouse about—how to see all of the choices at once without scrolling your life away—but it does chip away at the challenge of discovery something that fits your taste. And a customer who spends less time searching and more time watching \"something great\" is a happy customer, which helps Netflix achieve its ultimate goal: retaining and growing subscribers. Netflix, after all, does not run ads with its content, which means that its health is entirely dependent on subscriber growth. And as Garcia notes, \"It&apos;s very easy to cancel your service. We want you to feel that your subscription is valuable and worth the money.\"\nScreens like this one were a slight upgrade from the \"efficient vending machine\" look of Netflix&apos;s earliest interfaces. This philosophy is the motive behind all of the company&apos;s innovations and distinguishing perks, from its algorithms that recommend content based on users&apos; viewing habits to its slew of original shows like House of Cards and Stranger Things to its frequent service upgrades and offerings. Just last week Netflix announced —in a major turnaround—that subscribers will now be able to download content for later viewing, when they won&apos;t have an internet connection—an option that both Amazon and iTunes allow.\nThese improvements come as Netflix faces an onslaught of competition from the likes of Amazon, Hulu, and newer streaming platforms like DirecTV Now. With more and more cord-cutters weighing the benefits between services, Netflix is strategizing how to stay out ahead. Amazon in particular is a growing threat. Although Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos recently snubbed Amazon&apos;s original content efforts, the online shopping behemoth, which has about 60 million subscribers, is catching up to Netflix&apos;s global reach, and has pledged to increase its content budget from the $3 billion-plus it spent in 2016. Netflix, meanwhile, will plow $6 billion into content in 2017, with over 1,000 hours of original programming in the works. \nSo why has it taken so long for Netflix to get around to video? In short, because it required a ton of work. Jaffe says that when the company began \"poking\" at video a few years ago, its technology wasn&apos;t advanced enough. \"For a long time, the internet technology wasn&apos;t there for us to deliver this really, really quickly,\" he says. \"We had prototypes of this stuff, we knew that this was always the experience we all wanted. But we needed to make the investments [and optimize] things like adaptive streaming and our Open Connect global infrastructure for delivering content.\"\nIn other words, Netflix needed the horsepower to set up thousands of videos to play at a moment&apos;s notice. \"That video needs to start very, very quickly or you&apos;re not in the game,\" Jaffe says.\nNetflix also needed to prove its hypothesis: that video is more effective than images when it comes to engaging users. And to do that, the company ran hundreds of tests. To help me understand this process during my visit to HQ, I&apos;m brought into a room where I&apos;m seated in front of a screen and hooked up with sensors that measure my palm sweat and heart rate. A small camera on the screen tracks my eye movement, and another one reads my facial expressions to gauge my emotional responses. I&apos;m then shown three preview videos. (The subjects in the actual tests, I&apos;m told, were shown many more.) At the end of the trailers, I&apos;m asked questions such as, \"After seeing this video, how interested are you in watching X?\" and \"Can you remember the names of the trailers that you just watched?\"\nWith more and more cord-cutters weighing the benefits between services, Netflix is strategizing how to stay out ahead. The tests helped Netflix understand which types of videos work best in a streaming environment, where you&apos;re able to watch content immediately. These previews serve a wholly different purpose than official trailers for movies or TV series available sometime in the future. Netflix made them internally and designed them to accurately convey the gist of a product that you can watch right now. \n\n\"[Traditional] trailers can sometimes build anticipation for something without telling you much of a story,\" Garcia says. \"They&apos;re teasers. Cloverfield did that really well. Blair Witch did that really well. So the purposes can be different.\"\nNetflix&apos;s previews are efficient, running between 30 seconds and a few minutes. Garcia says he initially thought they would have to be longer, but research showed that \"people take 90 seconds in order to make a decision about what to watch. So we try to help them find something to watch in less than 90 seconds to make sure they can enjoy their experience.\"\nWith the exception of Netflix original movies and shows, most of the previews lack dialogue, and instead feature a music soundtrack. But Netflix says that will change as the company continues to discover what kind of audio format works best for each title. Netflix is very much maintaining a work-in-progress attitude throughout the rollout. The company wouldn&apos;t confirm what sorts of features could start showing up down the line, but it&apos;s conceivable that videos personalized to highlight users&apos; individual tastes might one day appear.\nAs for when to expect the new UI on mobile devices, Garcia says, \"We want to create something that members love. So if we test something and members love it, we will roll it out. Just like we&apos;ve done with this.\"\nTesting aside, Garcia admits that the biggest affirmation of the new UI came from his own experience. \"I used it [at home] for the entire duration of the test and I missed it when it was gone. It feels fresh, it feels new. It feels like something that should have always been there.\"",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s Why You’re Seeing Fewer Movies on Netflix \nThe content boss of Netflix has explained why the quantity of the streaming service’s movie collection has declined so substantially over the past two years. \nWhen asked about Netflix’s thinner film selection, Ted Sarandos told the UBS Global Media and Communications conference in New York that only around a third of the media company’s subscribers watch movies. \nHe explained that even in Canada, where Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, only a third of viewing comes from films—the same as in the U.S. which has just one deal . “No matter what, we end up with about one-third of our watching being movies,” Sarandos said, according to Business Insider . \nSarandos added that one of the reasons why movies don’t do as well as TV shows on Netflix is because of the delay between films’ releases and Netflix being able to show them. “If you were passionate [about the movie], you’ve already seen it [when it came out],” he said. \nResearch reported on earlier this year showed that in 2014, roughly 20% of IMDB’s top 250 movies were available to watch on Netflix, whereas only around 12% were in September 2016. Additionally, Netflix’s selection of titles has dropped over 50% since 2012, according to the streaming blog Exstreamist. ",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nDecember 6, 2016 8:30am \nWe’ve all likely been there at some point: Netflix has just rolled out a wash of new content, and you’ve been browsing it for around 15 minutes, but can’t decide exactly what you want to watch next. There are just too many options and you’re not exactly sure what each television show or movie is really about. \nThis is an issue Netflix’s new video preview feature aims to solve, according to the streaming giant. Netflix has launched a new user interface feature that brings video content alive in real time, showing subscribers short snippets of video as they’re browsing Netflix’s user interface. \n“As video becomes a bigger part of our lives, it will continue to play an increasing role within Netflix as we enhance the Internet TV experience around the world. We hope you enjoy video previews and find more great stories along the way,” said Stephan Garcia, Netflix’s vice president of product innovation . \nNetflix says that video previews aren’t teasers or trailers and are instead specially designed video synopses that highlight story, characters and the tone of the title. \nPreviews is rolling out globally today and will be available on almost all platforms the service, including Roku devices and game consoles.

      "text": "Source: Robert Viglasky | Netflix Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II and Matt Smith as Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh in The Crown a Netflix Original Netflix has become the top grossing iPhone app in the U.S. for the first time, driven by a change that allowed users to subscribe to the streaming service on their mobiles, according to a report released Monday. \nIn September 2015, Netflix introduced a feature for Apple users allowing them to sign up to the service through the app rather than via than via the website. \nThis has helped it gradually get to the top of the rankings, a report by app data company SensorTower showed. Since in-app purchases were introduced, weekly net revenue has grown from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million. \nMonthly iOS revenue for Netflix in the U.S. has been increasing at an average of 19 percent per month since last November, SensorTower said. Over the same period, monthly iOS revenue for rival service Hulu in the U.S. increased an average of 3 percent per month. \nNetflix has been focusing on growing its mobile product as it continues to push for new users. Last month, the company introduced a download feature to allow users to watch certain shows offline. \nIn its third-quarter earnings , Netflix said that it had gained 370,000 net memberships in the U.S. and 3.2 million internationally, a total of 3.57 million, beating the 2.3 million the company forecast. This helped quell investor concerns of a continued slowdown in subscriber growth for the company. \nNetflix also occupies the number one grossing spot on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia.",

      "title": "Netflix for iOS Becomes Top Grossing App for the First Time",
      "text": "  Netflix for iOS Becomes Top Grossing App for the First Time Netflix and chill at the top spot by Aldrin Calimlim December 6, 2016 \nFor the first time ever, Netflix reached the No. 1 spot of the top grossing chart for iPhone on the App Store. \nAt the time of posting, the official iOS app of the popular video subscription streaming service is already down at the No. 2 spot, having been dethroned by the Arnold Schwarzenegger-endorsed modern warfare game Mobile Strike . But for a brief period yesterday, Dec. 5, it occupied the highest position on the App Store’s top grossing chart for iPhone apps in the U.S., as well as in Colombia, India, and Mexico, according to the app data tracking company Sensor Tower . \nThe App Store’s top grossing chart essentially ranks the apps that have garnered the most gross income from their in-app purchases. Netflix has been supporting in-app purchases for subscriptions to its video streaming service since September 2015. \nApple takes a 30-percent cut from all in-app purchases. But last month it was reported that the company would be reducing its share of the pie by half, i.e., 15 percent, for video subscription apps like Netflix. \nAs visualized in Sensor Tower’s graph above, after some initial troubles, Netflix had been on a steady ascent to the No. 1 position of the top grossing chart since its introduction of in-app subscriptions over a year ago — until it finally claimed the top spot yesterday. In the interim — from September 2015 through November 2016, by Sensor Tower’s reckoning in the graph below — its weekly net revenue increased from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million. \nNetflix’s holding of the No. 1 position on the top grossing chart on the App Store notably comes just days after the app was updated with the long-awaited ability to download content for offline playback . \nLearn how to download Netflix content for offline playback in the app Netflix Now Lets You Download and Watch Offline — Here’s How \nBut one would be remiss if one did not consider Netflix’s ever-expanding catalog of original programming — including “Daredevil,” “Stranger Things,” and the recently premiered “Gilmore Girls” revival — as being a factor in attracting more subscribers and leading to the app’s becoming the top grosser on the App Store. \nGet the app",

      "text": "Netflix is introducing a new interface for its TV app from today, ushering in video previews that display a specially created snippet of the program or movie before you click to watch.\nRolling out around the world from today, the refreshed Netflix TV app will be landing on game consoles and Roku devices first of all, with smart TVs and other platforms added to the mix “in the coming months,” according to a company statement.\n“As we launch more than 1,000 hours of original content next year, we know we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title — that’s why we’re introducing video previews into the TV browsing experience,” explained Stephen Garcia, director of product innovation for TV, and Chris Jaffe, VP of product innovation, in a blog post .\nAs Netflix approaches almost a decade as a video-streaming company, it has had to adapt to the changing technological landscape. Just last week, it finally caved in and made downloading TV shows and movies possible through its mobile apps — this was reflective of the demand the company has seen around the world for offline access, particularly in emerging markets where Wi-Fi and mobile internet may be patchy.\nThe new TV interface certainly lends itself better to the big-screen, as the menu options and video preview must be visible simultaneously, which is why it’s not being introduced to the smartphone or tablet apps.\nThe company is quick to point out that previews are not “teasers or trailers” — they’ve have been designed specifically to help viewers decide quickly what they want to watch. “They are specially designed video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title,” the company says. “In developing this experience, our testing showed that people watched more of a story, demonstrating these previews helped them browse less and watch more.”\n",

      "text": "'Luka Cage' Season 2 Release Date News Update: Netflix Confirms 'Luke Cage' Renewal Vianne Burog Dec 06, 2016 09:47   NETFLIX/ Luke Cage \nNetflix has confirmed that it is picking up \"Luke Cage\" for a second season. \nThe streaming service made the announcement on December 4 on the series' official Twitter and Facebook pages, where they posted a short video featuring a sign in Pop's Barber Shop that read \"Season 2 coming soon.\" The posts also came with Pop's own motto, \"Always forward.\" \nThe renewal makes \"Luke Cage\" the third Marvel series to get a second season on the streaming giant. Marvel series \"Daredevil\" and \"Jessica Jones\" both received the greenlight for a second season after their well-received freshman seasons. \"Daredevil\" was also recently renewed for a third season. \n\"Luke Cage\" stars Mike Cotler as Harlem, a bulletproof superhero who originated on \"Jessica Jones.\" In the Marvel series, he was endowed with superhuman strength and impenetrable skin after an experiment on him went wrong. His goal is to stop running away from his past and face those who want to shake his alter ego.   \nCurrently, the series is streaming the 13 episodes of its premiere season on Netflix. \n\"Luke Cage\" season 1 was critically acclaimed because of its interesting storyline. Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote in her review of the series, \"Nothing is cooler than watching bullets bounce off Luke Cage as he brings the ruckus and schools all the fools.\" \nAside from Mike Colter, other actors featured in the series are Rosario Dawson, Mahershala Ali, Simone Missick, Theo Rossi and Alfre Woodard. Cotler is also set to star in \"The Defenders.\"",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix October 17, 2016 | 03:03PM PT \nTwelve-year-old actor Noah Schnapp has revealed his thoughts on his character’s sexuality in “ Stranger Things .” \nThe actor plays Will Byers, a young boy who mysteriously disappears one night, and there has been speculation online about whether the character is gay or not. \nSchnapp said he feels it’s time for him to “jump into the conversation” and addressed the matter in an Instagram post, which features two tweets from people commenting on both sides of the debate. But Schnapp feels that “everyone here is missing the point.” \n“For me, Will being gay or not is besides the point,” he wrote. “‘Stranger Things’ is a show about a bunch of kids who are outsiders and find each other because they have been bullied in some way or are different. Does being sensitive, or a loner, or a teenager who likes photography, or a girl with red hair and big glasses, make you gay? I’m only 12 but I do know we all relate to being different.” \nSchnapp said after author Gary Schmidt gave a talk at his school, he realized that “good stories aren’t supposed to leave you with answers because then you never question yourself and you forget about it.” The show’s writers, Matt and Ross Duffer, want the audience to walk away with questions, he wrote. A photo posted by 🌍Noah Schnapp🎥 (@noahschnapp) on Oct 16, 2016 at 9:22am PDT \n“Stranger Things” is one of Netflix’s most watched series and Season 2 of the show is set to premiere on in 2017.

      "text": " 40AM from the in-reality dept. Two of the most common issues people have with Netflix is: the movie catalog is shrinking, and the quality of the movies aren't that great anymore. Netflix says it is aware of those issues, and it thinks, in reality, those factors don't really matter much as people end up watching the same amount of movies as they always have . From a report: According to the Netflix exec, subscribers spend about the same time watching movies on the service regardless of the depth or perceived quality of the movie library. \"No matter what, we end up with about one-third of our watching being movies,\" he told the audience. Mr Sarandos cited two contrasting examples of the United States and Canada as proof of such behavior. In Canada, Netflix has five major deals with movie studios to use their content while in the US the company basically has none, with the exception of the recently signed Disney deal. Despite US subscribers having far less access to movies from big studios, both countries spend roughly the same proportion of their time on the service watching movies. Netflix believes that by the time many blockbuster movies make it onto the platform -- many months after being released in the cinema -- a majority of fans have already seen them. \"If you were passionate (about a movie), you've already seen it,\" he said.",

(Photo: Elise Amendola AP) \nDonald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory. \nHowever, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ), which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes. \nNetflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, \"We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points.\" \nNetflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of \"crony capitalism.\" \nWhere net neutrality stands today \nThough net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes. \nIn February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to \"preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth. The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like Verizon ( NYSE:VZ ) have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. \nIn this May 15, 2014 file photo, protesters hold a rally at the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) in Washington, DC to support \"net neutrality.\" The top US telecom regulator FCC announced February 4, 2015 he would propose to regulate the Internet as a public utility, as part of a renewed effort to enforce \"net neutrality\" rules. Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the plan which aims to prevent Internet providers from playing favorites or blocking some services or allowing others to pay for \"fast lanes.\" The new proposal comes a year after a federal court struck down the FCC neutrality rules, saying it lacked the authority because Internet providers were not\"common carriers\" under US telecom law. The plan, which is expected to unleash a fresh legal and political battle, aims to resolve the impasse by reclassifying Internet service providers as regulated entities under the 1934 Telecommunications Act. AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER / FILESKAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images ORG XMIT: US plan w ORIG FILE ID: 537437406 (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) \nWhat the end of net neutrality would mean for Netflix \nIf Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service. \nThe most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home. \nThe biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called \"fast lane\" treatment to their own services, as Comcast ( NASDAQ:CMCSA ) could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined AT&T ( NYSE:T )- Time Warner ( NYSE:TWX ), as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner. \nWhile rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. \nThe net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a \"Netflix tax\" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. \n10 stocks we like better than Netflix When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "It was basically a foregone conclusion, but Marvel Entertainment and Netflix made it official this week: Luke Cage will be back for a second season.\nOne of the most-watched original series on Netflix, and the recipient of extremely positive reviews from critics and general audiences, Luke Cage debuted September 30 on Netflix and was the third solo series to come out of Marvel’s partnership with the streaming video service. Although the announcement video that confirmed the series’ return didn’t reveal the exact date when star Mike Colter will return as the titular, steel-skinned superhero, it did offer a nice reminder that Pop’s Barber Shop — a central location in the Harlem-based show — is indeed staying open for business.\nMore: Everybody’s always smiling in ‘Luke Cage: Family Matters’ sitcom mashup video\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr\n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nAlong with Colter in the lead role, Luke Cage also starred Simone Missick ( The Road to Sundance ) as Misty Knight, who will return for the upcoming crossover miniseries The Defenders . That series will bring together many of the main characters and supporting cast from Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , and the upcoming Iron Fist series.\nThe first season of Luke Cage also featured Emmy-nominated House of Cards actor Mahershala Ali as the first season’s villain, Frank Whaley ( Pulp Fiction ) as police detective Rafael Scarfe, Theo Rossi ( Sons of Anarchy ) as Shades, and Alfre Woodard ( Cross Creek ) as Mariah Dillard. Rosario Dawson, who appeared in both Daredevil and Jessica Jones , reprised her role as Claire Temple.\nCheo Hodari Coker ( Notorious , NCIS: Los Angeles ) served as the showrunner on the first season of the series and also penned the scripts for the first two episodes, but it’s unknown whether he’ll return for the second season.\nThe next series to debut in the shared universe of Marvel’s Netflix shows will be Iron Fist , which will be available March 17, 2017.\n'Stranger Things' director/producer Shawn Levy enters 'Uncharted' territory Ever wonder about Willy Wonka's origin story?

      "text": "Netflix has big plans for 2017. After recently announcing it plans to have half of its content consist of original programming over the next few years, the company also stated it would come out with 20 unscripted shows in 2017. First reported by Variety , Netflix plans to double its amount of original content in 2017 to 1,000 hours, and will include new unscripted series like the global competition show Ultimate Beastmaster , produced by Sylvester Stallone and The Biggest Loser executive producer Dave Broome.\nNetflix Chief content officer Ted Sarandos spoke about his company's plans at Monday's UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. Sarandos said unscripted content is a \"very interesting business,\" and Netflix will focus on shows that have the potential to reach an international audience. A specific example is the planned show Ultimate Beastmaster , which will feature athletes and announcers from the US, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan. Each country will record its part of the show, in its own native languages, and follow athletes competing across an obstacle course called \"The Beast.\" At the end of the 10-episode series, one athlete will be crowned Ultimate Beastmaster.\nFurther Reading Reboots be damned, Stranger Things shows a better way to do nostalgia Sarandos cited the company's hit show Stranger Things as a milestone in Netflix's original programming journey. It was the first series Netflix produced and developed in-house, and thanks to its popularity, the company is already working on season two. However, Netflix doesn't want to be an all-originals streaming company. While the company continues to develop unique show and movie ideas, it still only plans to have 50 percent of its content be totally original programming. Sarandos mentioned the recent reboot of Gilmore Girls as an example where licensing and collaboration made for the best result. “Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself,\" Sarandos said, according to Variety . \"We had a unique ability to do it.\"\nSarandos also reemphasized that live sports is an area Netflix will stay out of since it's not the best platform for live event streaming. “Today, don’t look for us to be bidding for league rights,” Sarandos said, however he did add that “league creation might be interesting.”",

We scroll up and down the Netflix home page, looking at TV show and movie icons, hoping something will catch our eye. Now, Netflix is introducing a novel feature to help users see more about a program than just its icon: A video preview, right on the home page. \nThis isn’t a trailer like you’d see for a new show or movie. It’s a “video synopsis” in the upper right of the screen. Check out this quick video from Netflix, and you’ll see: According to a Netflix blog post , this new feature is meant to make video selection easier: \n(The video previews) help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title. In developing this experience, our testing showed that people watched more of a story, demonstrating these previews helped them browse less and watch more. \nThe company is getting ready to launch more than 1,000 hours of original content in 2017 with a long-term goal of having more than 50% original content . Netflix writes it is rolling out the feature today. Depending on how you get Netflix, you’ll see the new interface over the course of the next several weeks or months.",

      "title": "How to download Netflix movies and TV shows to your phone or tablet",
      "text": "For years, Netflix subscribers have dreamed of the ability to download movies or episodes of their favorite TV shows to accompany them on a long trip off the grid. Now that the dream has we’re here to help you make that transition offline go as smoothly as possible so you can simply sit back and enjoy.\nFor now, downloading titles for offline playback is only available via the Netflix app on iOS and Android mobile devices. Follow us below to figure out how to get downloading so you can get off the grid, and take your Netflix along for the ride.\nGetting your download on Step 1: Get up to date First things first, you’ll need to make sure your Netflix app has been updated to be ready for downloading. If you don’t have your device set to auto update, for iOS devices you can simply click on the app in the app store to get version 9.0.1 or later, while on Android devices you can do the same at the Google Play, where the version varies by device.\nStep 2: Choose your download quality\nnetflix_download_screens_011 More Netflix offers two different quality levels for downloads: Standard and “Higher,” the latter of which is seemingly high definition (720-1080p resolution), though Netflix doesn’t specify there. Standard uses less space on your device and downloads faster, while Higher takes a bit more space. Which one you’ll want to use will depend on how much free space you’ll have on your device, and what kind of device you’re using — a Standard title may look fine on a phone, while Higher may be necessary for your tablet. To choose, tap the menu icon on the left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, under the Downloads heading, tap Video Quality and select your preference. We’ll get to more details on how much space Netflix downloads use later in this article.\nStep 3: Pick your poison\nnetflix_download_screens_012 More Not everything on Netflix is available for download, but the company has made downloadable titles easy to find by arranging them in a special section called simply “Available for Download.” To get there, tap the menu button in the upper left and it’s the first option below the Home section. If you’re searching for specific titles simply look for the download icon, which looks like an arrow pointing down to a line.\nStep 4: Get downloading\nnetflix_download_screens_01 More To begin downloading, simply tap on the download icon on the show or movie you want to watch. There is one thing Android users will need to be aware of here: Netflix can only download titles to the same storage space in which the Netflix app is stored, so if you want to download to an SD card, you’ll need to make sure to download the Netflix app there as well.\nStep 5: Watch your downloaded titles\nhow to download movies and tv shows from netflix screens More how to download movies and tv shows from netflix screens More Once titles are downloaded, they can be found in the “My Downloads” section of the app, can be found by tapping the menu button in the upper left hand corner of the app. The My Downloads folder is located just above the Home section. A title’s running time as well as how much space it uses is listed next to the title. To play a downloaded episode, simply tap on the video thumbnail.\nHow much space do I need?\nnetflix_download_screens_013 More Just how much space a download takes up depends on how long the title is and, of course, which video quality option you’ve chosen. As an example, we downloaded the Netflix original film Mascots , as well as the first episode of Stranger Things in both Standard and Higher quality.\nMore: Time to kill? These are the 101 best movies on Netflix\nMascots has a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes. The Standard quality download of the movie used 487MB of space, while the Higher quality version took up 749.4MB. Stranger Things episode one is 48 minutes long and takes up 197.1MB of space in Standard quality, and 310.1MB in Higher. As mentioned above, Standard should be fine for most phones, but if you’re picky — or going to a tablet — you’ll want to use the Higher resolution.\nWhat’s available? As mentioned above, not all of Netflix’s library of streaming titles is available for download. One thing you can count on being available are Netflix Originals, as every Original we looked at was available for download right away, including episodes of Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Narcos, and The Crown.\nThe Crown More The Crown\nOther titles available at the time of writing were TV shows like Breaking Bad, Blacklist, and Weeds . Movies available for download included No Country for Old Men, London Has Fallen, Pulp Fiction , and Jaws.\nMore: The absolute best TV shows streaming on Netflix right now\nAs with Netflix streaming, many of these titles will only be available for a limited time, and once they’re gone from the service, you won’t be able to watch the downloaded version either. There is also no way to move the files off of a mobile device and play them with another app, so if you were planning to file a hard drive with Netflix titles, you’ll be sorely disappointed.\nHow do I delete titles? Whether you’ve watched downloaded titles or simply want to make room for more downloads, you’ll eventually want to get rid of them. There are two ways to go about this, depending on how much you want to delete.\nDeleting a single title\nIf you only want to delete one title at a time, this can be done from the My Downloads section. Just tap Edit in the upper right, then tap the red X icon next to any titles you want to delete. Titles will be deleted without a second confirmation, so be careful what you tap.\nDeleting all downloaded titles\nYou could delete everything from the My Downloads section, but if you’re looking to clear everything all at once, there’s an easier way. Tap the menu icon in the upper left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, just tap Clear All Downloads, confirm that you do want to delete all your downloaded titles, and you’re done.\nHow to install fonts on iPad or iPhone with AnyFont Join the Apple club with our complete guide to switching from Android to iOS These are the 35 tips and tricks you need to master the Galaxy S7",

      "text": "Netflix rolls out video previews worldwide, but only on its TV app Posted European Commission clears the way for Microsoft-LinkedIn deal \nNetflix is rolling out a new user interface for its app for televisions and streaming media players which will now include video previews, instead of still images. The previews will appear when you’re browsing through the library looking for something to watch, and pause on a specific title. Video previews are something Netflix began testing more broadly earlier this year, so it’s not necessarily a new experience for all users. \nInstead, today’s news is that this is no longer just a test, and video previews will be available globally to all users who watch Netflix on their television. \nThe company describes the video previews as being different from traditional trailers, as they’re shorter in length and also more focused on offering a synopsis of the content by highlighting the story, characters or tone. \nThe videos only begin playing when a user stops browsing for a moment to read more about a title. \nNetflix said that it found people watched more of story when it tested video previews, and they browsed less, which is why it made the decision to roll out the feature to its worldwide audience. \nHowever, not everyone was delighted by video previews when they first launched, given that they are a more interruptive experience compared with using still images. When the company first tested video previews that began playing as soon as the Netflix app was launched on a TV, some users not only complained , they also asked for a setting to disable this option. That didn’t come to pass. \nThat being said, video previews are only live on the Netflix TV experience – not on smartphones or tablets where it could be more cumbersome. \nThe video previews are launching worldwide on Netflix beginning today, and will reach eligible devices over the next few weeks. This includes most game consoles, Roku devices, and other smart TVs, the company said. 0 ",

In developing this experience, our testing showed that people watched more of a story, demonstrating these previews helped them browse less and watch more.” \n\nNetflix is adding the feature as it plans to launch more than 1,000 hours of original content in 2017. \n\nNetflix is starting to roll out video previews on a global basis today, and expects them to become available on eligible devices over the next few weeks, including the “majority” of gaming consoles and Roku players, with smart TVs and other platforms to get them “in the coming months.” Presumably, that feature will eventually be included with Netflix’s new app for Comcast’s X1 platform .",

      "text": "(credit: Getty Images | Jonathan Nackstrand)\nNetflix has big plans for 2017. After recently announcing it plans to have half of its content consist of original programming over the next few years, the company also stated it would come out with 20 unscripted shows in 2017. First reported by Variety , Netflix plans to double its amount of original content in 2017 to 1,000 hours, and will include new unscripted series like the global competition show Ultimate Beastmaster , produced by Sylvester Stallone and The Biggest Loser executive producer Dave Broome.\nNetflix Chief content officer Ted Sarandos spoke about his company's plans at Monday's UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. Sarandos said unscripted content is a \"very interesting business,\" and Netflix will focus on shows that have the potential to reach an international audience. A specific example is the planned show Ultimate Beastmaster , which will feature athletes and announcers from the US, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan. Each country will record its part of the show, in its own native languages, and follow athletes competing across an obstacle course called \"The Beast.\" At the end of the 10-episode series, one athlete will be crowned Ultimate Beastmaster.\nSarandos cited the company's hit show Stranger Things as a milestone in Netflix's original programming journey. It was the first series Netflix produced and developed in-house, and thanks to its popularity, the company is already working on season two. However, Netflix doesn't want to be an all-originals streaming company. While the company continues to develop unique show and movie ideas, it still only plans to have 50 percent of its content be totally original programming.

      "text": "Netflix is proving a free app can make big money on Apple’s App Store.\nThe video-streaming app, which is free for users to download but requires a subscription to its service, is now the top-grossing iPhone app in Apple’s App Store. The achievement comes about a year after Netflix announced that it would offer in-app purchases in the program, allowing users to sign up for the service or add the ability for multiple users to watch its content on the same account all from within its software. Sensor Tower, a company that offers mobile app services and analytics, says the app is also the top-grossing iPhone app in India, Mexico, and Colombia.\nApple AAPL tracks the most popular free and paid programs in its App Store based on their total number of downloads on any given day. The company’s top-grossing chart provides insight into the apps that are generating the most revenue through the marketplace. That revenue is generated through the sale of paid apps or via in-app purchases. In Netflix’s case, the company’s app is available as a free download, but comes with in-app purchases ranging from $8 a month to $12 per month, depending on the number of “screens,” or simultaneous viewers, a user might want.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nNetflix’s success is also Apple’s success: Apple takes a portion of the revenue generated from paid apps and in-app purchases. Apple typically takes 30% of revenue generated from the sale of an app or in-app content, but for subscription-based apps of an auto-renewing subscription, the company takes 70% the first year and 85% in subsequent years. It’s unknown what the revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Netflix is.\nNeither Netflix NFLX nor Apple shares how much an individual app generates in revenue through the marketplace, but Sensor Tower’s data suggests it might be significant.\nSensor Tower, which derives its data from anonymous information it collects across millions of smartphones, estimates that Netflix is generating nearly $2.9 million a week in net revenue from its iPhone app. The analytics firm estimates that Netflix’s weekly iPhone app revenue hovered at less than $50,000 in fall 2015, when the in-app purchases were rolling out to users.\nFor more about Apple’Watch, watch: \nLooking ahead, Netflix might have some work cut out for it to stay atop the top-grossing heap. The chart is always changing and apps are constantly moving up and down the list. Just last month, for instance, Netflix was in the seventh spot for highest-grossing iPhone apps. On Nov. 14, it was in the second spot.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday Move over Memcached and Redis, here comes Netflix's Hollow Netflix's new Java-powered data caching system promises to speed access to local datasets and aid developers building on top of that data InfoWorld | Dec 6, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nA new open source project released by Netflix after two years in internal use is being positioned by the company as a powerful way to cache datasets that change constantly. \nHollow is a Java library and toolset aimed at in-memory caching of datasets up to several gigabytes in size. Netflix says Hollow's purpose is threefold: It’s intended to be far more efficient at storing data; it can provide tools to automatically generate APIs for convenient access to the data; and it can automatically analyze data use patterns to more efficiently synchronize it with the back end. [ InfoWorld's quick guide: Digital Transformation and the Agile Enterprise . | Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. ] Let’s keep this between us \nMost of the scenarios for caching data on a system where it isn’t stored—a “consumer” system rather than a “producer” system—involve using a product like Memcached or Redis . Hollow is reminiscent of both products, since it uses in-memory storage for fast access. But it isn’t an actual data store like Redis. \nUnlike many other data caching systems, Hollow is intended to be coupled to a specific dataset—a given schema with certain fields, typically a JSON stream. This requires some prep work, although Hollow provides some tools to partly automate the process. The reason for doing this is so Hollow can store the data in-memory as fixed-length, strongly typed chunks that aren’t subject to Java’s garbage collection. As a result, they’re faster to access than conventional Java objects. \nAnother purported boon with Hollow is that it provides a gamut of tooling for working with the data. Once you’ve defined a schema for the data, Hollow can automatically produce a Java API that can supply autocomplete data to an IDE. The data can also be tracked as it changes, so developers have access to point-in-time snapshots, differences between snapshots, and data rollbacks. Faster all around \nA lot of the advantages Netflix claims for Hollow revolve around basic operational efficiency, namely faster startup time for servers and less memory churn. But Hollow’s data modeling and management tools are also meant to help with development, and not just speed production. \n“Imagine being able to quickly shunt your entire production dataset—current or from any point in the recent past—down to a local development workstation, load it, then exactly reproduce specific production scenarios,” Netflix says in its introductory blog post. \nOne caveat, Netflix says, is that Hollow isn’t suited for datasets of all sizes—“KB, MB, and GB, but not TB” is how the company puts it in its documentation. That said, Netflix is also implying that Hollow reduces the amount of sprawl required by a cached dataset. “With the right framework, and a little bit of data modeling, that [memory] threshold is likely much higher than you think,” Netflix writes.

Dixon and Stein composed the music for the new Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" (Alex Kacha) Randall Roberts \nConsidering the eerie tone of the new Netflix show “Stranger Things,” it shouldn’t come as a surprise that its musical score and opening theme were composed under curious circumstances by a pair of lesser known first-timers. \nThe score to the Duffer Brothers-created series, about the odd disappearance and arrival of children near a secretive laboratory, was made by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, two members of the Austin, Texas, instrumental electronic group Survive (who prefers its name be displayed in all-caps with spaces in between each letter — S U R V I V E). \nBut of all the TV composers out there, why them?

See more videos \n“The answer to that is kind of a mystery,” said Dixon during a recent phone conversation. “I'm not sure how they found us and they are not really sure how they found us either.” \nWhat is known is that the creators knew about Survive, used one of the band’s songs in an early pitch trailer, and a little more than a year later Dixon and Stein’s music is drawing its own fans. \nSet in 1983, “Stranger Things” is a period piece starring Winona Ryder as the mother of a missing son. She is convinced that a ghostly conspiracy is afoot, and the evidence is certainly there. \nIt was a time when the sudden destruction of a rotary phone could wreak havoc on a rural household. The series draws on a “Choose Your Own Adventure” and “Hardy Boys” style of storytelling, and features a trio of boy sleuths working to find their lost friend while dealing with the confusing new emotions that arrive with adolescence. \nDixon and Stein started working on the score a little over a year ago after a tryout period in which the pair had to prove themselves over the course of a couple months. The producers hadn’t started casting yet, nor had they completed the scripts. \n“They wanted someone to come on really early and be there to bounce ideas off of and figure out the aesthetic they wanted to reach,” said Stein. “But we also had to prove ourselves among other composers who were pitching as well.” \nThe composers employed similar instrumentation that they use on their work with Survive, most notably the immediately recognizable hum of vintage Arp synthesizers. The band has been together since the late ’00s, and will release its new full-length via Relapse Records in September. SNAP Video",

      "text": "Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Haters Should Slow Down, Smell the Roses Netflix stock is not getting any love despite changing entertainment forever By Josh Enomoto , InvestorPlace Contributor | Dec 6, 2016, 12:45 pm EST View All Posts \nIt’s time to make a confession — Netflix, Inc . (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is giving me a full-on migraine. It’s not that I hate this company. NFLX stock was once trading below a buck at the turn of the century. Today, it’s well above three digits. You can’t argue with performance, and performance like that merits special consideration, even if it did occur in the past. Yet there’s a lot of people that have a negative outlook on Netflix stock. Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified) \nNo, it’s not just my imagination. For starters, in the second half of this year, there have been five analyst adjustments. Four of them have been downgrades, which have come from big names like UBS and Jefferies. \nFor November, seven analysts have ranked Netflix stock as “underperform” or worse, while 12 recommend a “hold.” As an average, NFLX is somewhere in between bullishness and neutrality. \nThat’s hardly a ringing endorsement for what was once an unequivocal favorite in the markets. Either NFLX stock has truly lost its edge, or the bearishness is exaggerated. Let’s take a look under the hood, beginning with the critics. Strong Headwinds Pressure NFLX Stock \nOne of the most obvious points of concern is that Netflix stock is overvalued . Against trailing earnings, shares trade at a multiple over 300. That is worse than virtually every other player in the global pay television industry. Against forward guidance, NFLX stock is trading at 130-times earnings — again, another dubious statistic. In fact, against almost any metric that involves “price” as part of its calculation, Netflix is either the absolute worst, or close enough. 5 Tech Stocks That Should Top Your 2016 Christmas Wish List \nThat situation will seemingly dig itself deeper into a hole before it gets out, if it gets out at all. Net income trends have taken a massive hit in recent quarters. As an example, over the last six quarters, income growth averages a loss of 1%. It’s a far cry from what NFLX has been able to achieve in years past. It also points to the fact that the company has been able to expand its domestic and international footprint, but at substantial cost. Eventually, Netflix stock buyers may tire of the onerous premiums. \nThen there’s that ugly little matter of net neutrality. In a nutshell, net neutrality is the argument that all internet traffic should be treated the same. While it has a progressive sounding name, the concept has significant opposition from those who view it as rampant regulation. Among those is Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), which could potentially create avenues by which the channels it owns receive priority traffic. That of course would conflict with NFLX. \nBut as InvestorPlace Feature Writer James Brumley notes , “Two of Donald Trump’s key appointments are in favor of giving internet service providers the right to be biased in the digital content they deliver.” Because Trump essentially will have full control of the government, it could be a long four years for Netflix stock. The Bull Case for Netflix Stock \nSimply put, there’s no shortage of bearish arguments, but it’s not just the scale of pessimism. Admittedly, a majority of the critics have valid points. Another circumstance that tips in their favor is the record average prices seen in NFLX stock. Needless to say, a collapse here would be devastating. \nHowever, I’m not sure that it will. The company has more than 81 million subscribers. To put that into perspective, that’s roughly a quarter of active subscribers to Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ). Most people will surely agree that this is an impressive haul. Netflix is a pay-for-play company; Twitter is not. In its fourth year, NFLX stock jumped from an average share price of 85 cents to $2.60. TWTR, on other hand, is barely holding it together. \nThe undesirable news about Netflix stock tends to detract us from just how powerful this company is. According to Statistic Brain, 30% of domestic internet traffic during peak hours is from NFLX users. Furthermore, 35% of all disc-rental revenue is a result of the Netflix Snail-Mail service. These are paradigm-shifting trends that have taken America by storm. It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to assume the same will eventually happen in other countries. \nWhat’s scary is that Netflix has more room for improvement in key sectors. One of those is in mobile. Only 6% of its multi-million strong consumer base use the service on their cell phones. By showing some attention towards mobile services, the company could hook those that fell through the cracks initially. Indeed, with half of its viewers using video game consoles to watch live streaming, NFLX stock has an enviable number of business opportunities to choose from.",

      "text": "Netflix announced today a key update to its search interface. Now, when a user hovers over a title in the streaming giant’s vast and ever-growing library of thousands of titles, a video preview will automatically initiate.\nThese new video previews bring the browsing experience on Netflix more closely in line with what it’s like to surf for content on traditional TV, the company explained in a blog post . But “video previews aren’t teasers or traditional trailers,” Netflix said. “They are specially designed video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters, and tone of a title.”\nHere’s how the previews look in action:\n\nThe ultimate aim of previews is to help viewers land on content as quickly as possible. Cutting down down on search time will be a crucial driver as Netflix ramps up its content output next year — from 30 original shows in 2016 to 60 come 2017, with a noted emphasis on reality programming. Netflix estimates that “we have less than 90 seconds to capture someone’s attention and get them excited about a title.”\nVideo previews are launching globally today and will roll out in coming months to Netflix-enabled devices, including game consoles, Roku , and smart TVs, the company said.\nIn February, Netflix announced another change to its recommendation methodology by taking into account users’ tastes and preferences across different countries rather than keeping its algorithm region-specific.\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "text": "\n“If you are interested in stories with happy endings, that story is streaming elsewhere.” So begins Lemony Snicket ( Patrick Warburton ) in the latest trailer for Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events . Lest you failed to heed his advice the first time, he adds, “I would advise all our viewers to watch something more pleasant instead.”\nBut if you’ve got a taste for the dark and dreadful, then, well, you might be in the right place. Neil Patrick Harris leads the show as the devious Count Olaf, who’ll stop at nothing to get his hands on the fortunes left to the recently orphaned Baudelaire children (played by Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes ). Click through to watch the new A Series of Unfortunate Events trailer.\n\nA Series of Unfortunate Events Trailer \nThe A Series of Unfortunate Events seems to do a pretty good job of capturing the source material’s darkly comedic tone, as well as its timeless Gothic vibe. Harris has his work cut out for him if he wants to live up to Jim Carrey’s performance in 2004’s A Series of Unfortunate Events , but he seems to be having a lot of fun in the role. And the supporting cast is lousy with great character actors including Alfre Woodard (recently seen on another, very different Netflix drama ), Joan Cusack , Catherine O’Hara , Aasif Mandvi , Rhys Darby , and Don Johnson .\nAll eight episodes of A Series of Unfortunate Events will hit Netflix on January 13, 2017 . Barry Sonnenfeld (who executive produced the 2004 movie) and Daniel Handler (who wrote the original books) serve as executive producers.\nDear Viewer,\nIf you are interested in a story with a happy ending, that story is streaming elsewhere. This story has no happy ending, no happy beginning, and very few happy things in the middle.\nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death.\nThe post ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Trailer: Netflix Suggests You Watch Something More Pleasant Instead appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "I haven't read any of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, but I remember thinking there was untapped potential in the story after seeing the Jim Carrey movie in theaters. Netflix must have thought the same thing, because they've adapted the books into a TV series that begins streaming on Friday, January 13, 2017. Neil Patrick Harris is playing the villainous Count Olaf this time around, and Netflix has released a second full trailer for the show that puts his goofy villain front and center, giving him a ton of face time (albeit with a variety of different faces, since his character has a predilection for wearing disguises). What do you think about the new trailer?",

Twitter Getty Images \nIf you've been surfing Netflix for something else to binge-watch over the holidays, chances are you'll land on an original program from the streaming service. From Stranger Things to the Gilmore Girls reunion, there are a lot of options to choose from, and you'll only find them in one place. \nThere's also a lot more where that came from, as Netflix just announced that they're gearing up to release over 1,000 hours of new, original content. According to Variety , chief content officer Ted Sarandos revealed that in 2017, the platform is aiming to release 20 unscripted shows in addition to the 30 original series in its stable. Uh, that's a lot of stream-time — over 41 days, to be exact! (And that's a “conservative measure right now,” the CCO estimated.) \nSo clear your queue and your weekend plans — though none of the reality shows have release dates, we have a feeling that your couch is going to be the hot new place to be in the new year.",

One such show is 'Ultimate Beastmaster', an obstacle course competition show produced by Sylvester Stallone that's somewhat reminiscent of Japan's 'Ninja Warrior'. Differentiating it is that the format will be shot separately in the US, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan , to bolster each nation's TV catalogue. \n“Unscripted television is a very interesting business, the content itself seems to be largely interchangeable. Meaning, if you want to see a show about hoarding, there are three different shows about hoarding.\" \nAs it stands the company wants to produce 1,000 hours or original content in 2017 as it looks to serve its global footprint. \nIn addition to the announcement, Sarandos answered questions about rival Amazon, which has recently released the Grand Tour and looks to put out Nazi-centric drama, the Man in the High Castle. \nHe said : “It doesn't appear they're gaining much traction against all that spending, maybe it sells Prime memberships or other things I'm not privy to, but right now it just looks like they're spending a lot of money.\" \nThis article is about: North America , netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Media , Media , Brand John McCarthy \nI'm a reporter and presenter, into tech, sport, gaming and great ideas. Breaking news is my game although I love looking into the weird trends in marketing and advertising. \nI drink tea.",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nNetflix is aiming to have more than 1,000 hours of original content on the platform in 2017\nNetflix Inc.'s competitors in content and video streaming haven't done much in the way of knocking the streaming giant down a peg, which has prompted analysts at Evercore ISI, led by Ken Sena, to upgrade the stock to hold from sell.\nShares of Netflix(NFLX)rose nearly 3% intraday on Tuesday following the upgrade.\nIn March of last year Sena saw more platforms with more scaled audiences turning their focus to video, as well as staples in the video content world looking to over-the-top platforms, or online video streaming absent cable subscriptions. The increase in competition, Sena wrote in a note to clients, meant Netflix would need to invest more in content, which would further undermine its valuation.\nRead also:Netflix is rolling out download feature for movies and TV series (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-can-finally-stream-netflix-without-the-annoying-buffering-2016-11-30)\n\"As we assess the present-day competition, we find that the many impending OTT and subscription video on demand offerings we feared have failed to gain material traction or had a combination of false starts and delays. What we have learned is that obtaining scale has not proven easy,\" wrote Sena. \"While Netflix's elevated spending levels continue to raise the stakes where valuation is concerned, competitively speaking, Netflix seems to be in a good position.\"\nAlso see:5 horrible money lessons from 'Gilmore Girls' (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-horrible-money-lessons-from-gilmore-girls-2016-11-25)\nNetflix's level of investment in original programming has been shocking within the industry. At the start of the year, Netflix announced its plan to have 600 hours of original content, up from 450 hours last year. In 2017, the company is aiming for more than 1,000 hours, while again looking to spend $6 billion on content.\nCheck out:Netflix's new show 'The Crown' ushers in a new era of content spending (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-pouring-money-into-some-of-tvs-most-expensive-shows-2016-09-28)\nNetflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, speaking at an investor conference recently, said the platform would add about 20 unscripted TV series next year.\nAll of these investments are, more than anything else, a play to gain and retain paying customers. Sena increased his 12-month price target and bumped up 2017 subscriber estimates, reasoning that churn, or subscribers leaving the service, should improve while the company stands to face easier financial comparisons.\nSena has forecast that Netflix will add 3.9 million subscribers domestically in 2017 and 12.6 million internationally. The 42 analysts following the stock and tracked by FactSet expect 4.4 million net adds domestically and 12.7 internationally.\nThere are caveats, however.\nSena said that Netflix has yet to see more meaningful competition from Amazon.com Inc. or the introduction of \"major scaled audience players,\" such as Apple Inc(AAPL)or Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL)Google. And Netflix is still in heavy investment mode.\nRead also:Amazon is preparing to expand streaming video to 200 countries globally: WSJ (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-preparing-to-expand-streaming-video-to-200-countries-globally-wsj-2016-11-17)\n\"While the company's commitment to international can obfuscate signs of scale efficiency, generally speaking we are seeing higher costs per subscriber on overall decelerating subscriber growth, suggesting that Netflix still very much remains in investment mode,\" he wrote.\nShares of Netflix have gained 7% in 2016, narrowly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up nearly 8%.\n-Trey Williams;\n 1201ET\n ",

      "text": "Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events Releases New Trailer Megan Peters Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nIt is not often that a trailer tells its viewers to watch another program, but not every trailer is meant to advertise A Series of Unfortunate Events . Netflix has released a new trailer for its much-anticipated original series, and it starts off with an ominous warning. \n“If you are interested in a story with a happy ending, that story is streaming elsewhere,” the trailer warns. “I would advise all our viewers to watch something more pleasant instead.” UP NEXT: First Trailer For A Series of Unfortunate Events Released \nEarlier this year, Netflix rolled out the first full-length trailer for A Series of Unfortunate Events , but this new video gives fans a much better look at the show’s slew of characters. The colorful series stars talent like Neil Patrick Harris and Patrick Warburton, and fans are already clamoring over how canonical the trailer feels to Lemony Snicket’s novels. \nThe trailer goes to great lengths to introduce viewers to the poor Baudelaire orphans after they are sent to live with the fearsome Count Olaf. The children are subjected to all sorts of strange encounters as their caretaker tests them again and again. They eventually discover Count Olaf is after their family’s wealthy estate, and he will stop at nothing to strip the Baudelaire’s fortune from them. \nFans first learned that A Series of Unfortunate Events would be coming to Netflix in association with Paramount Television last year. In July, a video titled “An Unfortunate Teaser” was posted to Youtube which teased the show, but Netflix claimed the trailer was fan-made though many are skeptical about that claim. \nLater in the year, Barry Sonnenfeld and Mark Hudis were tapped to helm the series. Neil Patrick Harris was cast to play Count Olaf while Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes signed on to play Violet and Klaus Baudelaire. \nThis spring, K. Todd Freeman was cast as Mr. Poe and Patrick Warbuton agreed to portray Lemony Snicket himself. Production went underway in March, and filming recently wrapped in August. \nThis isn’t the first time A Series of Unfortunate Events has hit the screen. In 2004, director Brad Silberling released a live-action film based on the novel featuring Jim Carrey, Emily Browning, and Jude Law. (Photo: Netflix ) \nMORE: Closer Look At Neil Patrick Harris As Count Olaf / New Character Posters For A Series Of Unfortunate Events Revealed / A Series Of Unfortunate Events Trailer Released \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans -- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and premieres January 13, 2017 only on Netflix. \nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events will premiere on January 13, 2017.",

      "text": "Netflix Is Completely Changing the Way You Choose What to Watch By Email Courtesy Netflix \nLet us paint you a little picture. You've just spent all evening cooking the chicken tortilla soup from Gwyneth Paltrow 's It's All Easy . You've been counting down the minutes (okay, make that hours, because honestly that cookbook isn't as easy as it claims to be—or else you're just inept in the kitchen, but this is all a topic of discussion for another day) until you can take your delicious soup creation, curl up on the couch, and watch the crap out of some Netflix. \nBut then the inevitable happens. \nYou hunker down in front of the TV, pick up the remote, and you can't find anything to watch. You're browsing, you're clicking, you're hitting that Godforsaken back button over and over. \nThe next thing you know, you still haven't chosen a movie and your chicken tortilla soup is cold. And soggy. And nothing that the blessed GP would ever approve of. Thanks a lot, Netflix. Photos \nBehind the Scenes of Netflix's Gilmore Girls Revival \nWell it seems that Netflix heard your complaints (or have been watching you through your TV), because they just announced a giant revamp of the browsing system. Now, they'll show preview videos of each show as you flip through the options. \nSo if you scroll over Stranger Things , you'll see clips from Stranger Things . If you scroll over House of Cards , you'll see clips from House of Cards . If you scroll over 12 Dates of Christmas , you'll see clips from 12 Dates of Christmas . \nThe idea is that you won't have to waste time trying to read descriptions or opening up a random episode to get a feel for what the TV show or movie is like—instead, you'll get a feel for each program in real time. In this world of complete indecisiveness, and complete impatience, it's nice to have a little leg up on decision-making. \nAnd hey, even if you never choose something to watch, you can always just watch the previews. At least while your soup is still hot. TAGS/ Netflix , Top Stories , E! Loves  ",

      "text": "In a move that is on par with some big tech companies, including Netflix, Ikea just announced that it is expanding the paid parental leave it offers its employees. The furniture chain will now allow up to four months of paid time off for its 13,000 US employees after the birth or adoption of a child.\nWhile federal law only requires unpaid leave for new parents, many large companies are taking steps to retain quality workers. High turnover can result after the birth of a child, and it has been shown that employees tend to stay with a company (and provide better service) when they feel they are taken care of - especially after a new child is welcomed into the family.\nNBC News reports :\nEffective Jan. 1, the policy will apply to mothers and fathers who are birth, adoptive or foster parents. Ikea had previously given women giving birth five days of paid leave in addition to six to eight weeks of paid disability leave.\nIkea's move, part of its drive to improve its relations with workers, follows pay increases in the past two years that brought the average minimum hourly wage to $11.87. With unemployment at a nine-year low, many companies are trying to retain workers.\nThe United States lags far behind other countries around the world that offer some kind of paid leave for new parents. But it is possible that more and more companies, like Ikea, Netflix and Target, will begin take the initiative in the absence of legislation:\nNetflix announced last year it was giving parents \"unlimited\" paid leave for up to a year following the birth or adoption of a child, meaning they can take as much or as little as they would like.\nTarget also expanded its plan, and salaried and hourly employees who average 20 plus hours a week and have one year of service can now get two weeks of paid leave. It applies to employees who are giving birth, their partners, those who are adopting or becoming parents via surrogacy, and foster parents.\nWhile paid family leave has become a political issue, these companies show that some businesses will offer this benefit with or without legal requirements, to put the families of their employees first.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2016/12/06/ikea-puts-employees-first-and-offers-extended-paid-parental-leave/",

      "text": "Subscribe to Newstalk 860 on \nIt is with great regret that we must direct you toward the latest trailer for Netflix’s take on Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events , a thoroughly displeasing trailer that will only darken your day. Well … the series itself looks incredible, we just want you adequately prepared for all the despair sure to result. \nWhere the first full trailer understandably lent spotlight to Neil Patrick Harris’ Count Olaf , our second extended look at the 2017 series places greater emphasis on the Baudelaire children, as well as their “supporting” cast of characters. As you can imagine, support is pretty hard to come by in this world. \nSo reads Netflix’s official synopsis for the series, premiering January 13, 2017: \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans – Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Malina Weissman (Violet Baudelaire) and Louis Hynes (Klaus Baudelaire). The series premieres January 13, 2017 only on Netflix. \nAs developed by Paramount TV and novel series author Daniel Handler (Lemony Snicket is a pen name), Netflix’s new live-action adaptation will be directed by Barry Sonnenfeld . Apart from Jim Carrey’s somewhat unsuccessful 2004 take on the material, the Series of Unfortunate Events novels have sold countless copies and spawned a great deal of merchandise, from board games to albums. \nNetflix will release more looks at A Series of Unfortunate Events in the coming weeks, but check out the first trailers below.",

      "text": "By Laura Hurley 22 minutes ago \nNetflix had a big year in 2016 with new shows like Luke Cage , The Crown , and Stranger Things . The streaming service has tackled just about every genre of scripted TV, and plans are in place to spend even more money on new scripted series for 2017. As it turns out, 2017 will also be a big year for Netflix in another way: It will see Netflix adding a whole lot of unscripted shows to its TV library. \nSubscribers can look forward to no less than 20 new unscripted series hitting the web in 2017. The Netflix team is working to produce shows that are especially likely to appeal to international audiences, and unscripted/reality programs are considered pretty safe bets for traffic from viewers all over the world. All in all, the 2017 lineup will more than double the 1000 hours of original programming from 2016, and it looks look unscripted content will play a large part in the increase. \nThe 20 new series number was revealed by Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos to Variety , and it marks a major departure from the company line of May 2015 when Sarandos explained that they weren't interested in producing reality shows. At the time, unscripted series were considered \"disposable\" and lacking a \"long shelf life.\" There were no plans in place then to dabble in reality. It seems that the shifting TV culture of the past couple of years has convinced Netflix execs that the time is right to jump into unscripted entertainment. \nNetflix announced its first reality series earlier in 2016 when action star Sylvester Stallone and The Biggest Loser executive producer David Broome signed on to produce a show called Ultimate Beastmaster , which will pit contestants from all over the world against each other in brutal obstacle courses. At that point, Netflix gave no indication that Ultimate Beastmaster would be only one of many new unscripted projects. \nIt's not a huge surprise that Netflix is dabbling in a new genre. Data indicates that users rate original content higher than syndicated content, 94% of subscribers report satisfaction with the service despite price increases, and the average subscriber streams more than 550 hours of content per year. Netflix has been pouring funds into new originals, borrowing money amounting to more than $3 billion to produce as many originals as soon as possible for audiences looking for more than syndicated content out of their Netflix subscription. \nFor those who aren't necessarily excited by the news of 20 unscripted series, fear not. Netflix has even more scripted projects in the works for 2017. As of now, Netflix has 30 original scripted shows in development. Shows like A Series Of Unfortunate Events , Iron Fist , and Mystery Science Theater 3000 will be available for viewing at some point in the new year. Check out our 2017 Netflix premiere schedule to see what dates have been set for new and returning series next year. Don't forget to take a look at our midseason 2017 premiere schedule to see what else will debut on the small screen in the not-too-distant future.  ",

      "title": "9 On-Screen Clichés to Avoid",
      "text": "9 On-Screen Clichés to Avoid By Paul Barry |   3 p.m. \nShare: Paul Barry Photo Source: Netflix As actors there are some things that are simply out of our control, like where the lights are placed and what catering is serving for lunch. Other things are well within our purview, such as the choices we make with the script in our hands and delivery of the words out of our mouths. Below are 9 all-too-familiar clichés on screen that can be easily fixed, if only actors refused to accept them. That means we must start looking for them in film and TV, begin questioning them in rehearsals and on set, and diligently work together to eradicate them entirely for the good of big and small-screen storytelling from now on. Light luggage Ever see someone in a movie carrying bags to the plane and it seems like there’s nothing packed in them? That’s because there usually isn’t. Ask for Props to put some jeans, shoes and a jacket in there, or dare I say - fill it up? Otherwise you’re the one who looks silly when your character complains about schlepping around the city with ‘heavy luggage’ that can obviously be picked up with one finger. Awkward objects It’s not only infomercial actors who make stacking Tupperware seem like an impossible task. I’ve always contended that if unraveling old Christmas lights, scrubbing burnt egg off stainless steel pans or starting a car with the killer behind you are such challenging tasks, then just record someone legitimately attempting to do them. Don’t record someone making the task look difficult when it’s actually very simple, because it ends up coming across as a frustrating clown show. Empty coffee cups There are so many scenes on screen where somebody brings in a cup of coffee (or many on a cardboard tray), and they are clearly empty. They then sip the allegedly piping hot coffee, but it has no weight and no heat, let alone actual steam. Ask for tea and get it refilled between takes, and if this is somehow deemed ‘unsafe’ for the work environment then just have warm water – or fill it with cold water and act like it’s hot. There’s no excuse for taking us out of the story over props so commonly utilized on screen - and something so easy to fix. (It seems after all these years of bothering me it’s been irking Gilmore Girls fans recently too … ) Invisible background artists Please don’t perform a scene in a crowded school corridor and ignore the hundreds of extras walking by as you tell your friend you think that you’re pregnant to the hot new science teacher. Your environment is one of the greatest modifiers of your behavior. In public you do and say things very differently than had you been talking to your lover privately in the bedroom. The director may make you ignore the crowd for dramatic effect, but challenge her or him on this. Regardless of their final direction, at least you can say you tried to make it representative of reality. Overshares When your character shares information best kept secret suggest to the director that you offer them one take where you say it in your head rather than out loud, because it may produce the same result without the dialogue. Or else offer them a way to say it that might bury some of the overt exposition. Once again, they may be catering to the lowest common denominator, but at least try and raise the bar for those of us with an IQ above room temperature. READ: “ 5 Questions to Ask When Watching Yourself ” Undershares If your character has spent the last 30 nights preparing a surprise birthday party for his partner but she thinks he’s having an affair, there’s no reason to remain silent when she dumps you and storms off into the night. Being chivalrous is only a plot device to extend your partner’s anger at you, which is insulting to the audience’s intelligence. If there is no actual reason why your character can’t just say, ‘I was organizing you’re a surprise party – look, here are the receipts’ or ‘call your brother Gary to verify’, then just say it. Bring it up with the director - and writer, if possible, and work it out in rehearsals, because it’ll be impossible to change the entire plot on the day. Looking too good When you wake up in the morning, do you look as fresh as Natalie Portman when she wakes up in her movies? I doubt it. Ask the make up artist to brainstorm some ways in which you can make things more real. Slightly messy hair, slightly flushed cheeks, minimal eyeliner, or simply wipe sleep from your eyes. Anyone going to bed with that much make up in reality is going to wake up with a face that looks like a panda and a pillowcase resembling the Shroud of Turin. Clichéd injuries How many people in “Lost” or the first few seasons of “The Walking Dead” tripped or twist their ankle as they were being chased? Answer: almost everyone, in almost every episode. Come on, folks. Even if the writers have overextended imaginations that doesn’t mean you can’t suggest an alternative in rehearsals, like losing your way, snagging your shirt, hiding in the wrong place, or having an asthma attack. Who knows, it may just open up new depths to your character. If not, at least it’ll stop being repetitive. Pacing When was the last time you paced back and forth in front of a desk in real life? Exactly. Pacing is a superficial on-screen cliché designed to illustrate restlessness and inspire movement in the frame. It’s no coincidence that it’s employed most commonly in procedural dramas laden with legalese and exposition-packed dialogue. Work out what’s making your character restless in the first place, decide what your character is trying to do - or attempting to escape, and then do what the character would do in that moment. It may be pacing, but it may be something more lifelike. Don’t simply pace because it’s in the script. Pacing, like ‘ey-rolling’ and ‘sighing’ is often more an indication of state of mind than a hard and fast physical instruction. Amanda Peet claims to have refused to pace ever since Uta Hagen told her that “when your activities stay pieces of business, you’re using them wrong’. She was right. Directors and writers aren’t trying to trick us and trap us as actors. It’s just that their words and directions are often departure points from which we are expected to fill in the rest with believability, truth, and personalization. As Hagen says, if anything remains ‘just business’ then it is already dead. Challenge the clichés, throw away the tropes, and delve so deeply into the meaning of the moment that the superficial manifestation of that meaning is entirely flexible. \nAnd for the sake of Gilmore Girls fans everywhere, please put some liquid in those coffee cups. \nInspired?

      "text": "\nOn Tuesday, we got another look at Netflix’s new series, A Series of Unfortunate Events and this time we finally see Neil Patrick Harris in Count Olaf’s many disguises.\nThe first trailer we saw based on the famous Lemony Snicket book series didn’t show any of the main characters, but did tell viewers to beware about the story, which was not a happy one. This trailer gives the same warning, but shows you why you shouldn’t expect happiness.\n“If you are interested in stories with happy endings that story is streaming elsewhere,” Patrick Warburton says as he lights a candle and sets the eerie mood.\nA warning from Netflix then comes across the screen advising you not to watch, in fact telling you to watch anything but this series, which makes us more intrigued.\nIn this trailer we get to know Count Olaf, who is super creepy and only cares about himself, as he reveals his many sides. He is now the guardian of the Baudelaire children, who are orphans now that their parents have died.\n \n\n \nThroughout the teaser, Olaf does anything, and everything in his power to keep the children and get their fortune, including dressing up as different people, women and men alike, all of which are bizarre and spooky.\nOn a positive note, we see that Violet Baudelaire (Malina Weissman) is taking matters into her own hands and doing what she needs to do to protect her siblings, which leads to them going to other “relatives” houses to try and escape Olaf.\nThe trailer ends with the judge, Justice Strauss (Joan Cusack) saying, “Carpe diem,” to which Olaf says, “Seize the children!”\n“It’s seize the day,” the Justice explains. “I said day,” Olaf responds.

(Photo: OBB Pictures) \nOne in a Billion — a documentary released exclusively on Netflix on Tuesday — chronicles the journey of the first Indian-born player drafted into the NBA, Satnam Singh Bhamara, from his home of Ballo Ke, a farming village in rural India, to the bright lights of The Big Apple on draft night. \nBut for the 7-foot-2, 290-pound center who felt the weight of the world's second-most populated country on his shoulders when he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks two summers ago, it's a journey that has only just begun. \nCurrently a member of the Mavericks' NBA Development League affiliate, the Texas Legends, the soft-spoken 20-year-old still has a lengthy road ahead before he gets in on the NBA action. \nA road never before traveled, but a road Singh is working relentlessly to conquer. \n\"That's my goal. I work every single day . Nonstop,\" Singh said in a phone interview with USA TODAY Sports, noting that he hopes to make \"basketball better in India.\" \n\"(Making an NBA roster will) open the gate more for other kids that can come to the USA and go play in high schools, go play in college, go play in the NBA.\" One in a Billion trailer \nThe feature-length documentary, produced by OBB Pictures , features NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé — the first Indian-born majority owner of an NBA team. \n\"OBB has been tirelessly documenting Satnam's incredible journey over the past few years as he attempted to change history for India and the sport of basketball and we are very excited to share that story on Netflix,\" Michael D. Ratner, CEO and president of OBB Pictures said in a statement. \n\"Satnam is playing an important role in both expanding the popularity of the game in one of the world’s most rapidly emerging markets and furthering the NBA's global appeal.\" \nFollow AJ Neuharth-Keusch on Twitter @tweetAJNK 5 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE ",

      "text": "Netflix Made Its Own Mr. Bear That Turns On Fuller House Season 2 When You Hug It Deeplocal pairs connected stuffed animals By Kristina Monllos December 6, 2016, 3:33 PM EST Netflix has teamed up with Pittsburgh-based digital agency Deeplocal again to create an open source connected device for the holiday season. No, it's not another pair of socks. Timed to the release of Fuller House's second season, the agency decided to revive Mr. Bear (Stephanie Tanner's best friend in the original series) and added a glowing heart. When hugged, the bear can connect with another bear in another house (or even another country, according to the video below) and cause its heart to glow red as well. When both bears are hugged, Netflix automatically turns on in both homes. Here's what Netflix says about the bear: Our bears work with a touch of holiday magic and two linked hearts connected via a custom \"cuddle\" sensor. Hug the first bear and he calls his pair, causing both bears' hearts to slowly pulse. When the bear's buddy is squeezed, both hearts glow brightly and blink three times, turning on Netflix in both locations. The code and hardware for our Connected Mr. Bear is open source and available on GitHub. Our Mr. Bear comes from North American Bear Company, the original manufacturers of Mr. Bear in the '80s. You can create your own connected \"bears\" using any of your favorite stuffed animals, because what really makes these bears special is what's inside. Our bears have a custom sensor made with conductive foam pads that registers hugs, cuddles, snuggles, and squeezes. We have also sewn a special enclosure into each bear that's filled with a cellular-connected microcontroller, battery and IR LEDs (for starting Netflix). The bears' illuminating hearts are 3D-printed and embedded with LEDs. If you're not interested in or tech savvy enough to make the bears yourself, Deeplocal and Netflix are giving away a pair of bears today on Pop Sugar's Live Holiday Gift Show. The effort is fun, if a bit odd. What's clear is that Netflix is looking for physical ways to promote its brand and to tie that to the release of new shows. Just last week it dropped a candle tied to the Gilmore Girls revival. Does it do much for the Netflix brand? Who knows. But the ideas are cute.

Post to Facebook Exclusive: Netflix tracks subscribers' binge breaks Viewers weave like-minded films between Netflix series binges, its research shows.  //usat.ly/2heghhH   Exclusive: Netflix tracks subscribers' binge breaks  45   Netflix has seen success with its series such as the rebooted 'Gilmore Girls.' (Photo: Robert Voets, Netflix) \nNEW YORK — Netflix is continuing its quest to dominate television. \nWith 87 million subscribers in 190 territories, it has 30 series in production or development, and next year plans to double — to 1,000 hours — the amount of original programming, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said at the UBS Global Media conference Monday. \nIts next frontier: More unscripted programming, with 20 new shows such as Ultimate Beastmaster , an obstacle-course competition series (think American Ninja Warrior ) featuring contestants and announcers from six countries. \nExclusive series are the streaming service's top priority. Netflix is often criticized for its sometimes moldy selection of theatrical movies, but Sarandos said they still represent 30% of the service's total viewing, even with this year's addition of Disney titles, which are bypassing the typical pay-cable stop. \nBut how do subscribers actually watch? In new data shared with USA TODAY, Netflix says 59% of its members — or about 51 million — take a break, usually lasting two to three days, after finishing an original series before they dive into a new one. \nNick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) meets bunny officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) in Disney's 'Zootopia.'

So, for example, fans of the whimsical Gilmore Girls and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are more apt to follow them with titles such as The Princess Bride and Sixteen Candles , while Stranger Things viewers opt for Disney's Zootopia . \nViewers of Narcos or Breaking Bad go for similarly edgy Pulp Fiction, and watchers of Orange Is the New Black and Bloodline tend to watch Spotlight. (The research is based on worldwide trends from January to October). \nNetflix has a more \"dispassionate audience\" of movie fans, said Sarandos, who views Netflix's original films with Kevin James and Adam Sandler as popular if unexceptional \"comfort-food comedy.\" But expanding its film slate to more ambitious fare may achieve a loftier goal. He expects Bright , an upcoming feature shrouded in mystery that marks a new collaboration between Suicide Squad 's star Will Smith and director David Ayer, to launch a new film franchise. \n\"Can those films be subscription drivers the way series are?\" he asked. \nNeil Patrick Harris stars in Netflix's original Lemony Snicket series, 'A Series of Unfortunate Events,' which makes its debut Jan. 13.

      "text": "Nathalie Caron Tue, Dec 06, 2016 3:20pm \nThe first batch of official pics for Marvel and Netflix’s upcoming Iron Fist series has finally arrived, offering a new look at the Marvel characters and featuring the return of a very familiar face. \nThe new pics released via the good folks at IGN put the spotlight on the comic book series’ titular hero, Danny Rand, played by Game of Thrones ’ Finn Jones. We also have pics of Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) — and it looks like Danny is training in Colleen’s dojo (you can see her in the background, standing at the door) — Ward and Joy Meachum (Tom Pelphrey and Jessica Stroup) and Nick Fury Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), who'll also be training with Colleen (you guys may recall that she picked up Colleen's leaflet in the last episode of Luke Cage ). \nOh, and from what I can see in the last image, it looks like Danny, Colleen and Claire (who are all wearing very fashionable washed-out black clothes) appear to be out for a little game of \"I spy with my little eye.\" Fifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company. However, when a long-destined enemy rises in New York, this living weapon is forced to choose between his family’s legacy and his duties as the Iron Fist. \nThe 13-episode Netflix series slated for a March 17 premiere is the last piece of The Defenders puzzle that will unite Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist against Sigourney Weaver’s mystery villain later in the year. Iron Fist also stars David Wenham as Harold Meachum and Lewis Tan as Zhou Cheng.",

      "text": "Tim Karan 1 min ago \nNetflix insists that you watch something other than the new trailer for the upcoming Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events . It's simply too dreadful to endure. But if you're brave enough to click above, you'll get a good glimpse at a lot of previously unseen footage from the series (which actually looks pretty amazing). Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf, the evil guardian of the Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus (Louis Hynes), and Sunny (Malina Weissman). If you never read the books by fictional author Lemony Snicket (played by Patrick Warburton) and you didn't see the 2004 movie starring Jim Carrey, the Baudelaire kids lost their parents in a mysterious fire, and now Olaf will stop at nothing to gain access to their inheritance. The Netflix original production will span episodes, and it's executive produced by Barry Sonnenfeld, one of the producers of the movie version. The series will premiere Jan. 13, 2017. Recommended",
