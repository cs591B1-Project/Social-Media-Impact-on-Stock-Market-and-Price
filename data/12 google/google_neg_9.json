      "text": "It’s become clear that the algorithms Facebook and Google designed to deliver news to their users have failed . But while fake news is a headache for those tech giants right now, the underlying research question—whether and how machines tell truth from lies on the internet—is one that will persist as long as the world wide web stays an open forum.\nFacebook and Google’s sizable machine learning divisions have created algorithms that effectively surface information that users want to see. But they’ve been unable to actually understand or vet that info—and in fact, experts across the tech industry say it’s unrealistic to expect any AI or machine learning algorithm to do this task well.\nState-of-the-art language processing today All our best efforts so far are built on research in natural language processing, which teaches AI to read a piece of text, understand the concepts within, and provide insight about its meaning. “Modern machine learning for natural language processing is able to do things like translate from one language to another, because everything it needs to know is in the sentence its processing,” says Ian Goodfellow, a researcher at OpenAI. On the other hand, identifying claims, tracing information through potentially hundreds of sources, and making a judgment on how truthful a claim could be based on a diversity of ideas—all that relies on a holistic understanding of the world, the ability to bridge concepts that aren’t connected by exact words or semantic meaning.\nThe limits of AI’s worldview in 2014. (Facebook) For now, AIs that can simply succeed at question-and-answer games are considered state of the art. As recently as 2014, it was bleeding edge when Facebook’s AI could read a short passage about the plot of the Lord of the Rings , and tell if Frodo had the Ring or not.\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset , or SQuAD is a new benchmarking competition that measures how good AIs are at this sort of task. To a human, the test would seem pretty simple: read the Wikipedia page about Super Bowl 50, and then answer questions like “How many appearances have the Denver Broncos made in the Super Bowl?” (The answer is 8.)\nThe top SQuAD prize this year was won by a team from Salesforce’s recently opened AI research center : their AI could accurately answer factual questions posed from Wikipedia articles about 80% of the time. (The win was by a slim margin—it about 2% more accurate than its competitors from Microsoft and the Allen Institute of AI.)\nBut parsing a few paragraphs of text for factuality is nowhere near the complex fact-checking machines AI designers are after. “It is incredibly hard to know the whole state of the world to identify whether a fact is true or not,” says Richard Socher, head of Salesforce Research. “Even if we had a perfect way to encompass and encode all the knowledge of the world, the whole point of news is that we’re adding to that knowledge.”\nThe novelty of news stories, Socher says, means the information needed to verify something newly published as fact might not be available online yet. A small but credible source could publish something true that the AI marks as false simply because there is no other corroboration on the internet—even if that AI is powerful enough to constantly read and understand all the information ever published.\nHow does a human check facts? Humans have always been the gold standard when it comes to fact checking. Carolyn Ryan, senior politics editor for the New York Times, calls the act “the greatest reader service that we do.” Rigorous interrogation of truth is the primary function of any news source seeking to gain the public’s trust, but the internet’s open platform has brought a torrent of websites that don’t subscribe to journalistic ideals. So, millions of readers trying separate truth from lies visit dedicated fact-checking sites like Snopes.com and PolitiFact, which employ researchers and writers to debunk falsehoods on the internet.\nA highly-trafficked fake news article, since removed from the internet. (Screenshot via Facebook) Whatever the fact, the checking process typically starts the same, says Kim LaCaria, content manager for Snopes. The first order of business is combing through a story to see if its sources actually support the claim of the article. For example, the story of a purported link between Hillary Clinton and the suicide of an FBI agent was backed by false, misleading evidence, including fake links and a made-up address. Even if the sources aren’t entirely fictitious, sometimes there’s a piece of information that’s being misrepresented or taken out of context.\n“There’s information and then there’s how it’s presented, and those two aren’t always the same,” LaCaria says. “So the claim might not match the information.”\nSnopes researchers scour the internet to collect as much contextual information as they can, like when the events in the story supposedly happened, who was involved, and when it started to gain traffic online. They also hunt down original sources, and try to call or email the person who first made the claim in question. After all that information is in, they make a judgement call. The process can happen quickly or take days. “A seemingly simple claim can take hours, and a seemingly complex one 15 minutes and there’s no real pattern to that,” says LaCaria.\n  “When 8/10 people say it’s fake news, is it fake news?”   Ilya Sutskever, research director for OpenAI, says a fact-checking AI could be designed to tackle the job the same way humans do now. “One possible approach is to have a system which would have a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the meaning of text—which is something that cannot be done yet today—then it would read many different articles from many different news sources and would look for inconsistencies, the same way a human whose full-time job is determining whether something is fake or not.” says Sutskever.\nBut even humans have differing opinions about which facts are true, says Socher. “When 8/10 people say it’s fake news, is it fake news? What about 7/10?”\nAnd no matter how good the algorithm, Socher says, if it is trained by humans, it will inevitably take on these same biases.\nCurrent AI projects to try to weed out fake news One proposal is to program a sort of shortcut: teach an algorithm how to trust some things and not others, so it doesn’t have to read the entire internet every time it’s fact-checking a story.\nOzlo, a personal assistant startup, thinks it could do just that by training its algorithm to parse the trustworthiness of restaurant reviews.\nThe company’s personal assistant (also named Ozlo) reads reviews and ratings of restaurants across sites—from the professionals like Zagat to the sea of armchair pundits on Yelp. Then, through Ozlo’s chatbot interface, it tracks which sites and reviewers users find trustworthy, and even figures out elements of language that indicate a reliable review. Its goal is to cut through all the reviewer opinion and identify real facts—so it can show the right restaurants to the right people, like if one restaurant has good fish but terrible salads, or dirty bathrooms but good food.\nOzlo doesn’t work entirely without human input: the system reports back to a team of engineers and human trainers who can verify the information it’s learned. “I think we’ll always use trainers, and we’ll always use data from people. I think that’s the way you keep it from turning into a Nazi, right?” Ozlo CEO Charles Jolley says, referring to Microsoft’s Tay . The Microsoft AI experiment earlier this year learned by interacting with English-speakers people on Twitter, Kik and GroupMe—and within 24 hours of being live tweeted out “Hitler was right.” The Chinese and Japanese versions of Tay are still running without a hitch.\nOzlo is now starting to expand outside its little world of restaurants. By feeding tons of news stories from different sources through the already-established framework, Jolley hopes that the bot will figure out how to rank news sites and articles the same way it does restaurants and reviews. Of course, news is very different from restaurant or movie reviews—and Ozlo has an infinitesimally smaller number of users than Facebook; if Ozlo has a 1% error rate when identifying fake news, the mistakes would impact far fewer people and be much easier to identify and snuff out.\nMeanwhile, the scourge of fake news distributed on social media has triggered numerous other projects by hackers and third-party coders trying to solve the problem.\n \nFiB makes a little mark to verify news sources. (Chrome Web Store) One of these tools won a Princeton University hackathon this fall, sponsored by Google. The software, called FiB , checks articles posted on Facebook against websites known as reputable; it also runs the site hosting the article in question through databases of websites known for malware or phishing. If the post has photos and tweets, the tool uses AI to convert any words from the images into text. The software is free on the Chrome Web Store for your browser and also open-source, so developer types can tinker with it themselves.\nAnother piece of software called Fake News Alert from New York Magazine’s Brian Feldman aims to limit Facebook’s fake news problem by simply checking whether a site is on a curated list of fake news sites . If you have the software installed (also available as a Google Chrome browser extension) an alert pops up after you click a link that directs to any site on the list.\nThese sorts of approaches might work to limit fake news originating from outside of the mainstream media. But, LaCaria says, more and more often, major news outlets like CNN and BBC will hop on a story that’s trending but not necessarily true. These stories would technically be “verified,” and would get through the filters.\n  By every measure we have today, AI would have similarly failed that test.   On Nov. 17, US president-elect Trump appeared to claim credit for convincing the chairman of Ford Motors not to outsource jobs to Mexico. In reality, the company had never intended to do so in the first place. But initially, Trump’s equivocation was reported by mainstream and trusted media sources as a real story, and though most of these outlets followed up by debunking it, it was too late: the fake news had been picked up and spread across right-wing media outlets and across social media platforms. By every measure we have today, AI would have similarly failed that test.\nBut LaCaria says she thinks tools like FiB are still on the right track. Publications like Buzzfeed News and the New York Times break news more often than small blogs on the internet—meaning they’re adding new, trustworthy information to the internet. However, they don’t have a monopoly on authenticity. A tool that can understand the full spectrum of reliability online would get us much of the way to weeding out lies. “It’s almost like everything gets weighed when it comes to the truth,” LaCaria says.\nCode that can reason like a human Any fact-checking system must be judged on the scale of the internet, where even a 1% error rate can mean hundreds of millions of people misled. With that metric in mind, it’s hard to imagine any software doing the job short of the AI community’s golden goose: a general intelligence, code capable of reasoning like a human.\nLike many tough problems in AI research, general artificial intelligence has seemed within human grasp since the field’s inception in the 1950s. But the fact remains that we’re not much closer to solving the problem. Eric Horvitz, Microsoft Research’s Managing Director, has joked that many of the same questions thought to be easily answered at the 1956 Dartmouth University conference that launched the field of AI research could win grants today in 2016.\nFacebook and Google are now trying to solve their problem with financial sticks, both enacting changes to prevent fake sites from making money through their respective ad networks. But treating fake news as an economic problem won’t work for others without huge advertising networks to manipulate.\nFor now, however, it seems the onus still falls to the truth’s last line of defense: the reader.",

Photograph: Google The feature is being rolled out ahead of the busy Black Friday shopping period, but could equally be useful for checking out whether a particular bar or cinema is packed among other venues with variable busy times.\nGoogle Maps, like others such as CityMapper, already displays live traffic and public transport congestion information pulled from both public data and other Google Maps and Waze users. The introduction of live data is one of the big differentiators for mapping apps along with indoor navigation and libraries of store and points of interests data.\nGoogle has also expanded the extra information Maps displays, including data on how long people generally stay in the venue or location, as well as opening hours for concessions and departments within a larger store or business, which are set by the individual businesses.\nGoogle reverses decision to ban Pixel phone resellers \nGoogle commits to massive new London headquarters",

      "text": "“Bike Vest,” 1984. About 12 years ago, I inherited from a roommate an oddball little book filled with illustrations of imagined inventions from a nutty near future: shoes with turn signals to avoid collisions in crowded office corridors, furniture with secret compartments to hide inside during a home invasion, cars with washing machines under the hood for cleaning your clothes while you drive.\nCartoonist and futurist Steven M. Johnson. Photo: Courtesy of Steven M. Johnson The book — Public Therapy Buses, Information Specialty Bums, Solar Cook-A-Mats and Other Visions of the 21st Century , published in 1991 by cartoonist and futurist Steven M. Johnson — quickly became one of my favorites. I loved Johnson’s deadpan delivery, combining ludicrous prognostications with reasonable explanations and un-ironic drawings. His description of the “Whole Mouth Dental Appliance,” which you cram into your face to clean all your teeth at once, simply notes that two different brush configurations are available for fitting by your dentist. So crazy, but so matter-of-factly presented.\n1991 And yet, each time I’ve pulled Johnson’s book off the shelf in the past decade, I’ve realized we’re living more and more in the cockamamie and vaguely dystopian world he described 25 years ago. Each time I flip the pages I connect more current-day products to things he predicted decades ago: GoPro cameras , tiny houses , Roomba vacuum cleaners, TaskRabbit-style helpers. Someone has even finally made the customized whole-mouth toothbrush .\n“It’s just a little strange thing I do,” Johnson, now 78, told me when I reached him by phone at his home near Sacramento. Although he hasn’t landed a book deal since 1991, he said he still comes up with new ideas, often in a sort of half-asleep state in which he begins to “mix and match” ideas and objects in his mind, “rolling them around as if they’re in a washing machine or a dryer.” Until he says to himself, “Aha! This will come together in the future.”\nAnd often, it does. Google Glass, for example, went on the market in 2013, just over two decades after Johnson predicted computer spectacles in 1992, as part of a spread on possible uses for the Apple Newton .\n1992 “It seemed obvious to me that an image could be projected on the inside of a pair of glasses,” Johnson said. Even at the dawn of the internet, Johnson saw where things were headed: people will be constantly connected to electronic devices.\n“I don’t know if I predicted it, but I depicted it,” Johnson said modestly. He said he doesn’t have much of a reaction when he sees his drawings come to life. “It’s just a mild form of personal triumph.”\nJohnson foresaw a future in which people are ceaselessly consuming information, necessitating devices like “Hands-Free TV,” presaging a reality like ours, in which people look at screens nearly every waking moment.\n1991 With constant information access comes constant labor, and Johnson predicted that offices would have to change to adapt to the physical needs of people working long hours. He saw that the trend would lead to combining desks with exercise equipment to create “Fitness Work Stations.”\n1991 “It’s a combination invention where you’re thinking, well, perhaps being hunched over at a computer in the future will be bad for lung function and in general,” he said. And, lo and behold, we now have offices with treadmill desks.\nI asked Johnson about a related invention, the self-explanatory “Communications Commode.”\n1991 “I think it likely exists somewhere,” Johnson said. “Everything that can possibly be invented now is being invented, which is kind of discouraging for me as a futurist. I think of something and I’m almost afraid to Google it.”\nI Googled “toilet workstation” and, yes, something like this does unfortunately exist . But lots of people also achieve the same effect just by tapping out emails on their phone while sitting on the john.\nJohnson admits that the rise of the smartphone took him by surprise. Although he predicted lots of other features of our digital age, he didn’t realize so many of them would be tied to a single device.\n“I failed to see the miniaturization of the phone, and that’s been huge,” Johnson said. He imagined, for example, the ride-sharing now facilitated via smartphone with apps like Lyft and Uber, but thought it would work more like a bus station where riders and drivers would meet.\n1991 Johnson also predicted a kind of driverless-vehicle experience with his “Snap-Together Cars,” small vehicles that would link up on highways to allow drivers to relinquish control and relax.\n1991 This one initially seems ridiculous — it looks like a kid’s toy. But like a lot of Johnson’s at-first far-out notions, it’s actually already coming true, albeit in a slightly different form. Driverless cars are now able to communicate with each other to “ platoon ,” coming into formation to decrease wind resistance and increase fuel efficiency.\n“The flocking that birds do is now a capability that cars will have,” Johnson said. “So I have this kind of clunky physical manifestation of the same idea.”\nAlso in the transportation section of his book: the “Trafficscope,” which allows drivers to peer through a periscope and see what’s causing traffic jams down the road. “That’s a frustration issue which I’ve felt, everyone’s felt, you don’t know if the traffic is an accident up ahead or what,” Johnson said.\nIt’s true. Everyone’s felt it, even Larry David .\nThere’s plenty to laugh at in Johnson’s work, which can be so amusingly wacky and absurd. But it’s also often darkly satirical, with unnerving undercurrents.\nJohnson’s predictions describe a future in which fundamental problems — violence, poverty, isolation — not only haven’t been solved, they’ve gotten worse. The products he imagines often don’t change the world, they’re just workarounds, adaptations to a nasty reality.\nJohnson envisioned municipal buses that keep people in separate cells to prevent fights, robotic attack dogs to ward off muggers, and zoning laws that require folding beds in building facades to accommodate a growing homeless population.\nOne of the saddest examples of his dystopian vision is “Back-To-School Armor,” which is just what it sounds like and, even sadder, is now a real thing .\n1991 When he thinks about the future these days, Johnson said, his mind turns toward the disastrous effects of climate change. We ended our conversation on an ominous note, talking about a planetary catastrophe, mass migration, and the stockpiling of resources by the rich.\n“My thought is that a prediction about the future cannot be, as it was for me earlier, simply about extrapolations and scenarios that deal with products and technology,” he said in a follow-up email. “The future will involve a disorderly movement of peoples, animals, and plants out of tropical regions, and which will occur at a time of worsening air. So, while it is fun for me to predict new cities, new technologies, they must happen against the background of increasingly stressful changes in the environment.”\nIt’s a grim vision indeed. But, looking again at Johnson’s great book, I realized he’s already shown us some possible ways to adapt, with homes that turn into stormproof bunkers and flood-ready tower-houses equipped with boats.\n1991 And with Johnson’s track record, there’s a good chance these inventions will be around if and when we need them.\nTags: the vindicated steven m. johnson future products Top Stories Sorry, Todd Solondz, I Was Wrong About Happiness This Crazy Artist Predicted Everything from Uber to Google Glass Back in 1991 How a Music Mogul Became a Powerful Voice for the Wrongfully Convicted Most Viewed Stories Trump Meets With News Executives and Anchors So He Can Berate Them in Person Alec Baldwin Replies to Donald Trump’s Anti- SNL Tweet: ‘Election Is Over’ Here’s What President Obama Told Sasha and Malia After Trump Won the Election Obama Hints That He’ll Be Back — If Trump Goes Too Far Trump Cabinet Hopeful Kris Kobach Forgets Cover Sheet, Exposes DHS Plan for All to See Hillary Clinton Has Been Finding Post-Election Solace Among Books Kanye West Reportedly Hospitalized in Los Angeles for Exhaustion Trump on Business Conflicts: You Knew Who You Were Voting For Gwyneth Paltrow Thinks the Election Result Is ‘Exciting’ Trump Twitter Followers Raged at Hamilton Theater in Hamilton, Ontario, Without Consulting Google First Latest News from The Vindicated 8:48 a.m. Sorry, Todd Solondz, I Was Wrong About Happiness A critic’s awkward in-person mea culpa, and a filmmaker vindicated.\nYesterday at 5:38 p.m. This Crazy Artist Predicted Everything from Uber to Google Glass Back in 1991 Before smartphones and ride-sharing apps, there was cartoon futurist Steven M.

      "text": "We’ll come to you. 2 minute read \nBecause companies that actually give us something back for spying on our lives are the ones we value the most. \n[Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images] Mark Wilson 11.22.16 10:12 AM \nWe’ve all made that mistake of rallying our friends to some hot, new no-reservations restaurant at 5 p.m.—only to find it empty. Or we’ve casually headed to a favorite place on a Wednesday night only to find it unexpectedly packed. \nEarlier this year, Google launched a feature called Popular Times, which showed predictions of how busy a restaurant might be each hour of the day when you scoped it on Google services. Now, the company has updated the feature in a big way: Popular Times now shows how crowded places are in real time—at the very moment you search. \nRestaurants. Bars. Supermarkets. Big box stores. Even public spaces like parks. They’re all fodder for Google’s simple bar graph showing if the location is busier or emptier than normal. \nThe information is based upon \"aggregated, anonymized location history data,\" a spokesperson explains—though \"history\" is an odd word choice in this case. Because what that really means is that all smartphone users searching things on Google, Google Maps, or even using a geolocating Google services like the voice assistant on the Pixel phone , are sharing their location data. And Google is collecting this, throwing it into a mass pile, and resharing it immediately. \nOf course, Google—much like Facebook, or even our phone carrier—has known for a long time exactly where we are much of the time when we’re using our phones. Analytics companies like Flurry (recently acquired by Yahoo) can track the way you use several apps anonymously and combine that data to build a profile of you with such an accurate estimate of your home address that they claim to blur their own data within a few blocks radius before sharing it with developers and marketers. Even everyday websites can see your approximate location as soon as you open a link. \nCompanies make a lot of money off our data. Google and Facebook both use the information to feed us highly targeted ads—Google made $75 billion off their AdWords system that does just this in 2015, while Facebook pockets $14.34 on U.S. customers each year thanks to targeted ad revenue. \nBut what’s different with Popular Times is that Google is giving some of this big, surveillance-style data directly back to the consumer—which is, in fact, exactly what it’s doing when the company spots traffic jams on Google Maps or learns from your searches how to make results better, too. And while maybe it’s still a little creepy, because Google has given me a way to avoid the line at some new restaurant that I really want to try? I care a lot less, by design.  ",

      "text": "The Tor Project recently announced the release of its prototype for a Tor-enabled smartphone—an Android phone beefed up with privacy and security in mind, and intended as equal parts opsec kung fu and a gauntlet to Google.\nThe new phone, designed by Tor developer Mike Perry, is based on Copperhead OS, the hardened Android distribution profiled first by Ars earlier this year.\nFurther Reading Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state surveillance \"The prototype is meant to show a possible direction for Tor on mobile,\" Perry wrote in a blog post . \"We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible to build a phone that respects user choice and freedom, vastly reduces vulnerability surface, and sets a direction for the ecosystem with respect to how to meet the needs of high-security users.\"\nTo protect user privacy, the prototype runs OrWall , the Android firewall that routes traffic over Tor, and blocks all other traffic. Users can punch a hole through the firewall for voice traffic, for instance, to enable Signal.\nThe prototype only works on Google Nexus and Pixel hardware , as these are the only Android device lines, Perry wrote, that \"support Verified Boot with user-controlled keys.\" While strong Linux geekcraft is required to install and maintain the prototype, Perry stressed that the phone is also aimed at provoking discussion about what he described as \"Google's increasing hostility towards Android as a fully Open Source platform.\"\nIt’s about the software backdoors, stupid! Apple's iOS is famously more secure than the Android security garbage fire, right?\nBut Android security will eventually improve, and when that happens, Perry told Ars in an e-mail, \"then the next measure will be the ability of the platform to resist backdoors of various kinds.\"\nFurther Reading iPhone exploit bounty surges to an eye-popping £1.2 million A closed source platform, such as Apple's mobile operating system, is at much greater risk of being compelled to deploy software backdoors, he added.\nEnlarge Tim Ellis \"I think the best argument against backdoors is that they are technically impossible to deploy at all, due to the security properties of the system and people's ability to remove or avoid the backdoor. That argument is stronger for open source than it is for closed source.\"\nPerry also worried aloud about targeted backdoors delivered to specific users.\n\"The iOS App Store is at a significant disadvantage there even compared to Google Play,\" he told us. \"Each iOS app is re-encrypted specifically for the user with Apple's DRM, making it technically impossible to verify that the package you installed matches the official one.\"\nHe said that Apple has \"created the perfect platform for delivering targeted backdoors to specific users. I don't like banking on iOS for those reasons.\"\nGoogle hostile to freedom In order to solve the Android security mess, Google is taking steps that hurt user freedom, and make Android vulnerable to compelled backdoors, Perry argued.\nThe fragmentation of the Android ecosystem into multiple OEMs, who distribute their own versions of the operating system, has resulted in rampant insecurity. Without financial incentives to push security updates to users' phones, OEMs by and large abandon users to their fate.\nFurther Reading Fix for critical Android rooting bug is a no-show in November patch release Under pressure from many quarters to solve this problem, Google is working to improve Android security, but Perry criticised Google's release and development process as increasingly opaque.\nAndroid platform is effectively moving to a 'Look but don't touch' Shared Source model that Microsoft tried in the early 2000s,\" Perry wrote in his blog post. \"However, instead of being explicit about this, Google appears to be doing it surreptitiously.\n\"It is a very deeply disturbing trend.\"\nCopperhead to the rescue Copperhead OS was the obvious choice for the prototype's base system, Perry told Ars.\nFurther Reading Copperhead OS: The startup that wants to solve Android’s woeful security \"Copperhead is also the only Android ROM that supports verified boot, which prevents exploits from modifying the boot, system, recovery, and vendor device partitions,\" said Perry in his blog post. \"Copperhead has also extended this protection by preventing system applications from being overridden by Google Play Store apps, or from writing bytecode to writable partitions (where it could be modified and infected).\"\nHe added: \"This makes Copperhead an excellent choice for our base system.\"\nDaniel Micay, Copperhead's lead developer, welcomed Perry's prototype. \"It will be nice to have somewhere to direct technical users that cannot live without Google Play,\" he told Ars in an e-mail.\nBy default, Copperhead eschews Google Play, and Micay himself refuses to use any Google Apps.\nEnlarge / A general outline of Copperhead's main features. \"Mike Perry is interested in doing things properly which is why [the prototype] goes through the effort of not breaking verified boot or depending on leaving an insecure recovery image,\" Micay said. \"The rough edges can be smoothed out over time.\"\nMission Improbable, but useable today The prototype, nicknamed \"Mission Improbable,\" is now ready to download and install. Perry said he uses the prototype himself for his personal communications: \"E-mail, Signal, XMPP+OTR, Mumble, offline maps and directions in OSMAnd, taking pictures, and reading news and books.\"\nHe suggests leaving the prototype in airplane mode and connecting to the Internet through a second, less-trusted phone, or a cheap Wi-Fi cell router.\nFurther Reading Double-dip Internet-of-Things botnet attack felt across the Internet Further Reading FBI demands Signal user data, but there’s not much to hand over The prototype is the second of its kind. Back in April, 2014, Perry proposed his first Android device optimised for privacy and security—then nicknamed Mission Impossible. The earlier prototype consisted of a 2013 Google Nexus tablet running Cyanogenmod.\nPerry emphasised that the Tor Project has no plans to get into the hardware business, but hopes the prototype will provoke discussion and innovation. He pointed to the Neo900 , which bills itself as \"The truly open smartphone that cares about your privacy\"—a project, he said, that came about in part due to the \"Mission Impossible\" blog post two years ago.\n\"What I’ve found is that posts like this one energise the Android hobbyist/free software ecosystem, and make us aware of each other and common purpose,\" Perry told Ars. \"It also shows Google and others what gaps there are in Android for Tor support, and raises awareness about the dangers the ecosystem faces.\"\nArs readers looking for a weekend project will find the complete Mission Improbable installation instructions on GitHub.\nJ.M.

      "title": "RIP Gingerbread and Honeycomb: Google is ending support in 2017",
      "text": "  \nRemember the days where we all fell in love with Android Gingerbread and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread? I sure do, and those days have been long gone now that we are on Android Nougat . But Google has continued to support Gingerbread devices, until next year. How could you not love that sweet wallpaper? \nThe company has announced that the next version of Google Play services will no longer support devices running either Android Gingerbread or Android Honeycomb. We all knew it was a long time coming, but it will still be a sad day when Google finally cuts the cord. \nVersion 10.0.0 of the Google Play services client libraries, as well as the Firebase client libraries for Android, will be the last version of these libraries that support Android API level 9 (Android 2.3, Gingerbread). The next scheduled release of these libraries, version 10.2.0, will increase the minimum supported API level from 9 to 14 (Android 4.0.1, Ice Cream Sandwich). This change will happen in early 2017. \nThe changes to the Google Play Services will cap support at Android 4.0.1, Ice Cream Sandwich, leaving all other previous versions in the dust. When looking at the most recent Android Distribution charts , it’s obvious that the time has definitely passed, as Gingerbread only accounts for 1.3% of the total percentage. \nRegardless, let’s all raise our glasses one more time to Gingerbread and what it offered back in 2010.",

      "title": "Google Play Services and Firebase to Drop Support for Gingerbread in Early 2017",
      "text": "This week, Google announced some future plans that they have for both Google Play Services, as well as Firebase for Android. Google Play Services version 10.0.x is what is currently available and this will continue to support Gingerbread devices. Things will be changing with the upcoming 10.2.x release though, and Google says this will be made to the public sometime “in early 2017.” We don’t know exactly when, but it will likely happen within the first quarter of next year.\nSince Gingerbread is a 6-year-old platform, Google feels they will be able to provide a more robust collection of tools for Android developers once they no longer have to support the platform. The latest Android distribution numbers, which were released in November , say that only 1.3% of active devices (connecting to the Play Store) are using the Gingerbread OS. So we’ve already seen developers drop support for this version anyway.\nGoogle reminds developers that they will still be able to use Google Play Services and Firebase as they are today. It’s just that new features that get added will not be able to be able to work on these devices since they can’t update to version 10.2.x. So developers have the option of publishing an application that targets API level 14 (which is what Google recommends), or you can build multiple APKs that specifically support an API level less than 14. You should be able to do this with build variants within Gradle.\nGoogle has also published the official change log for Google Play Services version 10.0 . Along with a warning that Gingerbread support is being dropped soon, this update includes some changes to the Cast API, some improvements to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scans, the reintroduction of Nearby Notifications and some improvements and bug fixes from the latest update of Firebase.\nSource: Android Developers Blog \n",

      "text": "No constitutional right to literacy, Michigan tells Detroit students   15:35 Get short URL © Google maps Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, and state education officials argued that Detroit students have no fundamental right to literacy, asking a federal judge to reject a lawsuit about the quality of education and conditions at the city’s schools. \nThe lawsuit, filed by the parents of seven Detroit schoolchildren in September, is an “attempt to destroy the American tradition of democratic control of schools,” the lawyers for Snyder and state education officials wrote in a 62-page motion to dismiss . \nIn the lawsuit , the parents claimed that the state of Michigan denied students in its biggest city access to literacy through decades of \"disinvestment ... and deliberate indifference.\" Detroit Public Schools (DPS) have been run by a state-appointed emergency manager since 1999. By 2011, 47 percent of Detroit residents were “functionally illiterate,” according to a Detroit Regional Workforce Fund report. Read more ‘DPS has not been fixed by the state’: Detroit schools seek forensic audit \n\"For the last 15 years, the state has run the Detroit schools, has run them into the ground,\" Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney with the California-based Public Counsel law firm, said at a news conference outside US District Court in Detroit when the lawsuit was filed. \nBeyond low proficiency scores in reading and math, there is a dearth of teachers in the system, leaving some classrooms without educators, and those teachers that do show up have at times been unpaid . On top of that, there are insufficient classroom materials and “slum-like conditions” in the buildings, including mold, vermin and water damage. \n\"I don’t like the schools in Detroit,\" Dyante Murphy, 16, a Cody High School student, told the Detroit Free Press for a series on youth in the city. \"It feels like I haven’t learned anything in high school since ninth grade. ...I don’t even talk about school no more with my mama. They give us worksheets, but we don't know what we're doing. When I graduate, I want to go to college. But how am I going to go when I don’t know precalculus or anything like that? We don't even get homework.\" \nThe seven plaintiffs attend three of Detroit’s lowest-performing public schools ‒ Osborn Collegiate Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology; Osborn Evergreen Academy of Design and Alternative Energy; and Cody Medicine and Community Health Academy ‒ and two charter schools ‒ Hamilton Academy and Experiencia Preparatory Academy, which closed in June. \nThe suit is seeking class-action status and would set the legal precedent of literacy as a constitutional right under the 14th Amendment. \nThe state is arguing that it merely needs to provide access to an education, and that it is not responsible for creating environments that are conducive to learning. \n“[They] ask this court to serve as a ‘super’ Legislature tasked with determining and dictating educational policy in every school district and school building throughout the United States where an illiterate child may be found,” Timothy J. Haynes, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the response. \n“Such a path would effectively supersede democratic control by voters and the judgment of parents, allowing state and federal courts to peer over the shoulders of teachers and administrators and substitute court judgment for the professional judgment of educators,” he continued. Read more Detroit Public Schools announce lawsuit against state \nMichigan officials believe that the federal judge will dismiss the case because the Supreme Court has “unambiguously rejected the claim that public education is a fundamental right under the Constitution,” Haynes wrote, referring to the 1973 case San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez. \nThe state’s lawyers also disagreed with the parents’ claim that Michigan has been responsible for Detroit schools since 1999. Rather, Haynes argued, emergency managers have been appointed “to supplant local authority, where necessary.” \nIn the motion, Haynes also referred to a 2014 lawsuit against an emergency manager-led school district in Highland Park that was dismissed by the Michigan Court of Appeals because \"Michigan’s constitution requires only that the Legislature provide for a system of free public schools, leaving the details and delivery of specific educational services to the local school districts.\" \nLawyers for the parents described the state’s response as disappointing, but not surprising. It did, however, ignore the reality students face in Detroit schools. \n“There is no mention about the fact that hardly any of the students have access to teachers or books. These are schools where no state officials or state lawyer would send their child,” Kathryn Eidmann, staff attorney for Public Counsel, told the Detroit News. \nThe lawsuit is asking the court to order Michigan to provide relief to the schools including “appropriate, evidence-based literacy” instruction at all grade levels and to bring the schools up to a good state of repair.",

      "text": "Pixel C \nA post by the manager of the Android Beta Program's Google+ page seems to indicate that Developer Preview 2 of Android 7.1 is slated to go live shortly . Orrin Hancock, owner of the page, says that DP2 actually began rolling out today, but we've not received any tips suggesting that's the case. No one who has replied to the thread seems to have gotten it, either, so perhaps the rollout has been slightly delayed or extremely, incredibly, strangely limited (I would hedge on the former). \nAnyway, Android 7.1.1 DP2 will apparently be available for the Nexus 6P, 5X, Nexus 9, Android One, and Pixel C. Build numbers are NPF26F for all devices except the Pixel C, which has the build number NPF26H. We're not seeing any signs of factory images on Google's image pages yet . According to the beta page, the Nexus 6 and Nexus Player should be included in this release (they were not part of DP1), but they are not listed in the post. We're currently looking into this. \nWe also have no idea what changes DP2 entails, but I'm sure we'll be finding out soon enough. Source:",

      "text": "shares \nGoogle’s redesigned ‘Sites’ tool for creating web pages is now available for everyone . \nIf you’re not familiar, Google Sites isn’t meant to be used to create personal sites, a la Squarespace or Wix, so much as building a shared resource for a company or team. \nThe redesigned Sites first launched in an early adopter program back in June , bringing various updates to make it easier to make your own site. \nMainly, Google says creating a site is as easy as making a Doc file, with the ability to add text and images with copy-and-paste, or rearrange them with a drag and drop. In other words, the way you’d expect things to work in 2016. \nThen there’s the tighter integration with G Suite, including schedules from Google Calendar, locations from Maps, content from Docs, and more. Embedded documents, update live, even as you’re working on those very documents. \nResponsive design means the themes scale to any screen size, and you can preview what your site will look like on various screen sizes. And like Google Docs , you can now have multiple people working on a site at the same time. \nWhile Google seems to be keeping the classic sites around for a while, G Suite users can get started with the new Sites now if the tool is enabled for their team. Otherwise, admins can set it up by going here .",

      "text": "Spinn’s futuristic coffee maker is now available for pre-order Posted Google’s redesigned Google Sites goes live \nAt Disrupt NY in May we had the pleasure of seeing a very cool hardware startup make its debut on the Battlefield, looking to make waves in an industry very close to my heart (and mouth): coffee. Now Spinn’s high-tech coffee maker is available for pre-order , so if it piqued your interest earlier this year, now’s your chance to pick one up. \nIn case you don’t remember, Spinn’s machine is fully self-contained, grinding the beans to the correct fineness, then heats the water and uses a spinning cylinder to force it through the ground beans at the right pressure. It should make for great coffee, and the grounds are super easy to dispose of. \nMore details at the original post , or in their new video showing off the machine’s new look, with touch controls so you don’t have to rely on the app. \nThere are three trim levels should you decide to treat yourself: original, which does all the basics and comes with $50 in credit for ordering coffee, for $299; original plus, which adds a carafe and $50 more in credit, for $399; and original pro, which has a larger bean hopper and comes with a milk frother and $200 total in coffee credit, for $599. It should ship in mid-2017, so unfortunately not in time for the holidays. \nAs with most pre-order campaigns, of course, those prices will go up should you hesitate. Not too many of the initial run of 5,000 units are left to buy, but more batches may appear soon. 0",

      "text": "\nGoogle is trying to give a boost to small Android game developers in Europe with the launch of its Indie Games Contest. The competition is targeting teams of 15 developers or less who want to see their games get more attention in the Google Play Store .\nThe contest is currently open for submissions for teams located in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the UK (excluding Northern Ireland). The contest will be open soon for teams in France and Poland. Those teams have to have published a game in the Google Play Store after Jan. 1, 2016. They can also enter if they have a game they are still working on, but plan to publish soon, by submitting a private beta build.\nSee also: Best free Android games of 2016! 2 weeks ago Submissions for the Indie Game Contest must be entered by December 31, and up to 20 finalists will be picked and announced sometime in mid-January 2017. All of those finalists will get to see their game shown off at a special event on February 16 at the Saatchi Gallery in London. They will also get their game promoted on a London billboard for one month. The winning finalists will also get two tickets to a 2017 Playtime event, and one Google Pixel XL smartphone.\nIn addition, the top 10 finalists will get extra promotion for their game in the Google Play Store and the top three finalists will also get, among other things, YouTube influencer promotions that are normally worth €50,000. The top finalist will receive an additional €50,000 worth of YouTube influencer promotion, along with a feature in an Android Developer Story video produced by Google Play and promoted on the Android Developer and Play Developer channels, plus two tickets to attend the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March 2017.\nEnter the Indie Games Contest ",

      "text": "Right Wing ‘News’ Publisher Appears to Be Hiring Writers Using Amazon  09   \nFacebook and Google are clamping down on the spread of fake news in the wake of the US presidential election, but now a website that publishes stories appealing to “alt right” white nationalism appears to be crowdsourcing “reporters” from online marketplaces to write content of questionable veracity. \nAdvertisements attributed to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform, which is essentially a marketplace where businesses can request users to carry out online computing tasks like filling out surveys or transcribing data, have called for writers for “news articles for a new conservative news website”. \nOne such advert , seemingly posted by a conservative news website called The Goldwater , offered $5 per article. The articles should be written “in the style” of right-leaning media firebrands Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos—and if you’re not familiar with those three men, then the job “is not for you,” the advert states. \n“At times, we may give you a conspiracy theory to write about. Roll with it!” the advert adds. “You are a reporter now!” \nAnother such advert, known as an HIT (Human Intelligence Task) in MTurk lingo, called for an article to be written with the headline, “Predictable: First Lesbian Bishop of Stockholm Boots Out Christ and Welcomes Mohammed”, based on an article in Lionheart News—a website run by racist British organisation Britain First. Another HIT request sought out an article defending Vice President-elect Mike Pence and concerning a Trump supporter yelling “fuck you” at the cast of Hamilton . \nOnline labor advocate Rochelle LaPlante, who first spotted these HITs, told Motherboard on Monday that one of the downsides of MTurk is that workers have to work blindly, “not knowing who they’re completing tasks for or how the completed work will be used.” \n“When objectionable HITs are posted, there is a link on the HIT for workers to report it to Amazon, but there is no follow up from Amazon with the worker on what action is taken, if any,” LaPlante said. \n“I reported the HITs last night using that report button, but there’s no way for me to know if Amazon saw and removed it before it was completed by workers, or if Amazon has taken any action against the requester’s account.” Read more: This List of Fake News Websites Proliferating on Facebook Is Staggering \nThe HITs aren’t available to view anymore, and LaPlante said there’s no way of knowing if Amazon removed them, or if they were accepted/completed by workers. But the articles which were requested on MTurk have appeared on The Goldwater over the past 24 hours. Screenshot of the website The Goldwater. Image: The Goldwater. \nAmazon did not respond to Motherboard's repeated requests for comment prior to this article's publication. \nWhile The Goldwater may have a hard time convincing readers it is a legitimate news site, it’s still worth pondering the potential employment of “digital workers” in the future of fake news content. It takes no official requirements or journalistic integrity to scrawl a few exaggerated words regarding a fake news story, and the purported adverts flagged by LaPlante were offering more money than many other HITs that Motherboard saw on the platform. But for the recruiter, $5 per article would yield a significant return on investment with the likely popularity of such an article and its eventual advertising revenue.

      "text": " Google+\nYouTube screen capture\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy James Pindell Globe Staff November 22, 2016\nGet James Pindell’s analysis first via his newsletter, Ground Game. Sign up here .\nIn one of his first major public addresses since winning the election, President-elect Donald Trump explained what he wanted to accomplish during his first 100 days in office in a brief YouTube video.\nNaturally, those 2 minutes and 36 seconds did not yield some exhaustive 60-page strategic white paper with changes to every federal department. A number of media outlets have noted that Trump didn’t even bring up two of his signature campaign promises -- building a wall on the Mexican border and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\nAdvertisement\nBut there was another word that Trump did not mention in his remarks that might be even more telling about his agenda.\nThat word? Congress.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here In his first term, Trump is receiving a gift that nearly every president wishes they had: a Congress led by his own party. Within hours of winning the election, Trump was in Washington, D.C., meeting with Republican leaders in the US House and US Senate. Even though he had a tense relationship with US House Speaker Paul Ryan during the campaign, Trump has spent a lot of time, it seems, on this relationship. It appears that Trump, at least at some level, knows that a good relationship with a Republican Congress could be helpful to a president.\nBut according to the video, Trump may feel that Congress -- even one led by Republicans -- may not be essential to him.\nIf his omission of Congress was intentional, he would be both right and wrong for thinking he doesn’t need them. If he wants to amend trade deals, impose tariffs, repeal the health care law, pass an infrastructure spending bill, or get any controversial nominee confirmed, he will need Congress.\nAdvertisement\nBut on a whole host of other issues on his agenda, Trump doesn’t need Congress (The New York Times has a great chart with specifics on this).\nLook at President Obama: He used executive orders to change national policy and bypass a GOP-controlled Congress. Also like Obama, Trump can also make endless foreign policy decisions without congressional input. What’s more, when Trump talks about changing environmental and energy regulations -- like he did in the YouTube video -- that is something almost entirely in his jurisdiction.\nDuring his first term as president, Trump could continue to expand executive power, much like his predecessors. But why? Most presidents are never as popular as they are during their first 100 days in office. With a Republican Congress, Trump could pass laws that are harder to repeal than an executive order.\nIn addition, Obama’s expansion of executive powers was one of the things that most upset those in the Tea Party movement. This group especially didn’t like Obama’s use of czars in his administration. This very group of former Tea Party protesters made up Trump’s base in the election earlier this month.\nIn the coming weeks, Trump will have to make a major calculation about his presidency: Will he practice the Art of the Deal with friendly members of Congress, or will he simply go it alone?\nRelated Among Trump’s Day 1 promises: withdrawing from Pacific trade deal\nJames Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Nestor Ramos Globe Staff November 22, 2016\nAn internal investigation into a Cambridge police sergeant who detained a Dorchester man for allegedly bumping into him found no wrongdoing, the department said in a statement posted online Tuesday.\nResponding to a Globe story published Tuesday morning and to video of the incident in Porter Square, the Cambridge Police Department statement said Detective Sergeant Thomas Ahern’s “actions were consistent with his duty obligations.”\nAdvertisement\nAhern’s actions, and the department’s decision to pursue criminal charges against Cleon Hodge, 21, and two women who intervened on his behalf, have drawn criticism from civil rights groups who reviewed the videos and police reports.\nThe incident began a little after 6 p.m. on Massachusetts Avenue near Porter Square. In a police report, Ahern -- who was on duty but dressed in plain clothes -- alleged that Hodge made eye contact with him and didn’t get out of his way, intentionally walking into him.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Hodge, in an interview, disputed Ahern’s account and said he was looking down at text messages, glancing up every couple seconds, as he walked to the train station after work. He acknowledged seeing Ahern, but said the next thing he knew, the man’s shoulder was slamming into him.\nView Story Officer, pedestrian bump shoulders. Now the pedestrian may face charges Cambridge police are seeking charges against a pedestrian and a woman who tried to intervene, and pursuing a lesser charge against a second woman.\nIn Tuesday’s statement, police disputed Hodge’s account, who, they alleged, “was not on his phone, made no intention of avoiding a collision and intentionally walked into and struck the officer with his shoulder.”\nHodge acknowledged that he used profanity in demanding an apology from the man he said he believed walked into him, though their accounts differ on what happened next.\nAdvertisement\nAhern said he walked up to Hodge and displayed his badge, to which Hodge allegedly continued to swear at him and clenched his fists. Hodge said he raised his hands above his head as soon as he learned Ahern was a police officer.\nMuch of the rest of their interaction was captured on videos, which begin with Hodge’s hands up and Ahern holding Hodge’s sweatshirt. A crowd gathers, and some question or taunt Ahern while others try to calm the tense situation. More officers arrive and appear to question witnesses and search Hodge’s pockets.\nEventually, Hodge is allowed to walk away.\nA week later, though, Hodge and two women -- one who recorded the incident on her phone and another who happened upon the scene -- received summonses in the mail.\nHodge faces assault and battery and disorderly conduct charges; the two women, whose names have not been released, face charges including assault and battery on a police officer and interfering with a police officer. The possible charges are pending, following a clerk’s hearing last week.\nIn its statement on Tuesday, Cambridge police said a 25-year-old Somerville woman is facing a possible assault charge because she “allegedly grabbed the right arm of Sergeant Ahern multiple times.” In the video, the woman appears to reach toward Ahern, though the angle and darkness make it difficult to see how much contact occurred. The other woman, a 52-year-old from Cambridge who recorded most of the video, is accused of repeatedly encroaching on the personal space” of Ahern, who at one point appears to knock the phone from her hand when she gets close to him.\nWhile some civil liberties advocates questioned both the charges and Ahern’s tactics -- “a textbook example of police overreach,” said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice -- some familiar with police tactics and training were more circumspect.\n“It looks to me like a very unfortunate situation,” said Jon Tiplady, a former Danvers police lieutenant who wrote that department’s use of force guidelines. An accumulation of factors -- the growing crowd, a woman encroaching on Ahern’s space, Ahern not having a walkie talkie handy -- contributed to the chaotic scene.\n“Had they not had that crowd around, if they could have had a brief second to just talk,” Tiplady said, things might have gone differently.\nThe potential charges, he said, appeared to be “CYA -- you’re covering your a--,” he said, and should not survive past the clerk magistrate hearings.\nHe said he hoped the incident would amount to “a good learning experience both ways.”\nBut Espinoza-Madrigal said encounters like these have ripple effects far beyond those directly involved.\n“This type of incident, where the police are proceeding in an aggressive and excessive manner against civilians -- particularly citizens of color -- raise a host of community policing problems,” he said. “It signals to victims of violence that they should be cautious when approaching the police.”\nIn its statement, Cambridge Police Department notes it has “worked thoroughly intimately with the community to build quality relationships and trust.”\nEspinoza-Madrigal, acknowledging Cambridge’s reputation as an enlightened, progressive police force, and said citizens should demand more.\n“I would have expected more from the Cambridge police department. What happened here raises serious questions,” he said.\nNestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @NestorARamos .",

      "text": " Google+\nNYT\nDonald Trump shows off the Twitter app on his Samsung smartphone in his office at Trump Tower.\nBy Carol Hay November 22, 2016\nWe got a sneak peek into the direction our country might be heading when President-elect Donald Trump met Sunday afternoon with Kansas Secretary of State and anti-immigration hard-liner Kris Kobach, who’s reportedly being considered for head of the Department of Homeland Security. Photographed outside Trump’s Bedminster golf club, Kobach was holding a document titled “Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for the First 365 Days.” One hopes that the Cabinet post will eventually go to someone with a sophisticated enough understanding of security to remember to put confidential documents into a folder before heading out to meet the press.\nDon’t feel bad if you hadn’t heard about this. I hadn’t either. Your Facebook feed, like mine, has probably been dominated by outrage over Trump’s puerile Hamilton tweets — or his latest beef with the press. Just more examples in a long, long line of behavior that’s, quite frankly, tacky . In word and in action, Trump has been behaving in ways that are, to our eyes, simply unbecoming of someone elected to the office of president of the United States.\nAdvertisement\nBut I have a prediction: We’re going to be seeing more, not less, outrageousness from Donald J. Trump.\nThat’s not to trivialize bragging about having committed sexual assault or mocking disabled people or threatening to jail his opponents.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But these things pale in importance to what they distract us from. Trump knows us. He is, in the end, a consummate salesman. He knows that it’s easier to pay attention to the flashy, the absurd, the grotesque, than it is to put the work into understanding the complex ways that his presidency will lead to catastrophe. What political appointments and nominations he’s making, what lawsuits he’s settling, what trade deals he’s making and breaking, what legal reforms he’s intending to bring about, what international treaties he’s undermining — these are nuanced and complicated matters, and they’re not often terribly sexy.\nIt’s easier to get huffy about infantile shenanigans than it is to attend to political and legal complexities, but we must resist this temptation.\nThis, then, is my plea to my fellow opponents of the impending Trump presidency: Start ignoring the culture war whose flames he’s proven so adept at fanning. Not because the culture war doesn’t matter, but because he’s baiting us with it. He’s using it as a distraction. We need to be vigilant, we need to focus on the big picture.\nAdvertisement\nTrump isn’t going to stop the buffoonery. But when we feel our collective blood pressure spiking over it, we need to keep our eyes open, because it’s at precisely these moments that he’ll be doing something else with his other hand.\nThe trick is a classic sleight of hand — one, not for nothing, that’s the bread and butter of his beloved World Wrestling Federation.\nCarol Hay is associate professor of philosophy and director of gender studies at University of Massachusetts Lowell.",

      "text": " Google+\nMark Lennihan/AP\nPresident-elect Donald Trump waved to the crowd as he left the New York Times building following a meeting on Tuesday.\nBy Mark Landler New York Times November 22, 2016\nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would “keep an open mind” about whether to pull the United States out of a landmark multinational agreement on climate change.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. But on Tuesday, he said, “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.”\nAdvertisement\nTrump’s comments came at an on-the-record lunch with the publisher, editors and reporters of The New York Times, a meeting that was scheduled, canceled, and then reinstated by Trump after a dispute with The Times over the ground rules.\nTrump said he did not want to inflict any more suffering on Hillary Clinton, explaining why he did not intend to investigate Clinton for her handling of classified information or the dealings of the Clinton Foundation.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

What does it mean? This chart captures the alarming drop in sea ice\nPressed on whether he had definitively ruled out a prosecution of Clinton, he said, “It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about.”\nTrump also appeared to extend an olive branch to supporters of Clinton, saying, “I don’t think they will be disappointed” in his presidency. “I think I will explain it that we, in many ways, will save our country,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nTrump opened the discussion with a list of grievances about the newspaper’s coverage of him, though he couched it in terms of wanting to improve the relationship. “I have great respect for The New York Times,” he said. “I have tremendous respect. I think I’ve been treated very rough.”\nHe then pivoted to an analysis of the campaign, describing it as “18 months of brutality in a true sense.” Trump reiterated his view that he was “never a fan of the Electoral College” and that he would have preferred to have been elected through a victory in the popular vote.\nTrump denied that his campaign had energized the so-called alt-right movement, saying he disavowed it.\n“It’s not a group I want to energize,” he said. “And if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.”\nRelated 5 climate change clues from 2016 that have scientists worried Sea ice hits record lows at both poles.

White letters across the photo read ‘‘Kkk go trump.’’\nAdvertisement\nAssociate athletic director Jim Marchiony says university officials learned of the posting during the men’s basketball team’s 83-63 victory over UAB.\nThe athletics department says a Twitter user reported the Snapchat photo to the school. A tweet from the school described what happened as ‘‘unacceptable.’’\nMarchiony says the female cheerleader insisted Tuesday that someone took her phone at a party Saturday night and posted the Snapchat message.",

      "text": " Google+\nPHOTO BY SCOTT LUSH\nChris Edwards, author of the memoir “Balls: It Takes Some to Get Some.”\nBy Chris Edwards November 22, 2016\nAh, Thanksgiving. A time for family, pumpkin pie and the angst that comes with attending the inevitable 10-year high school reunion. Insecurities around such an event usually involve weight gain, hair loss, or lackluster career stats — not a gender change. Back in 1997, when I attended mine, there was no Transgender Awareness Month. People weren’t even aware “transgender” was even a word, much less a social issue.\nYet there I was, less than two years into my transition from female to male, trying to figure out what I was going to wear to this shindig. It was the Saturday after Turkey Day, and I was feeling like a chicken, cursing myself for letting my four best friends talk me into going. They were all girls and the only Waylandites I still hung out with. Marianne (Most Class Spirit) and Schu (Kindest Heart) were class president and vice president, so it was their responsibility to plan the reunion, and as two-fifths of the “Fab Five” it was their mission to get the other three of us to go. Meek (Cutest) and Mel (Best Looking) were in. I (Most Likely to Get an Ulcer) was the only holdout — right up until the week before the event.\nAdvertisement\nWhat made me change my mind? Something Schu told me during her final plea. “Everybody knows,” she said. “They’re going to ask me how you are, and probably where you are. What do you want me to tell them?”\nThat’s when it hit me. No matter how Schu answered that question, everyone was going to assume I didn’t show up because I didn’t have the, well, balls. And while technically that might have been true (that surgery was years away), after publicly transitioning in front of 500 coworkers I’d developed quite a set of cojones . I was not about to let my former classmates think I was ashamed. I was going.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But I was going to get really drunk first.\nAfter settling on gray flannel pants and a black cashmere sweater, I walked over to Schu’s apartment where the Fab Five, plus one husband and one boyfriend, were gathering for pre-party beverages. I entered to cheers, hugs and a shot glass filled with tequila, the latter of which only made my stomach feel worse.\nI suggested to the group we blow off the reunion and just hang out at Schu’s but was simply handed another shot. There was no getting out of it now.\nAdvertisement\nOn the way to the event I reminded everyone of the rules:\n1. No one was to leave me alone with anyone for the first hour\n2. If I was spotted talking to a class member by myself for more than 10 minutes, someone had to come in for the save\n3. A Fab Five husband or boyfriend was to accompany me to the men’s room whenever I needed to go\n4. I was to have a full vodka soda in my hand at all times\nThe reunion took place in the lounge area of an upscale restaurant walking distance from Schu’s apartment. On our way in, someone called my name and I turned to find one of my coworkers heading toward me. I turned back to find all my friends had entered the party without me. It had only been 30 seconds, and all of them had already broken rule number one.\nGreat.\nI took a deep breath and forged on. The first person I ran into was a tall, good-looking guy with a receding hairline and warm smile. He looked at me and after a second said, “Chris?”\n“Ye ,” I replied slowly.\n“Mike,” he helped.\n“Mike Ball!” I shouted, proud of myself for remembering his last name.\n“Yes!” he said, and in lieu of the hug he would’ve given me as “Kris,” appropriately stuck his hand out. I shook it, and used my sense of humor to break the ice.\n“I thought people would have trouble recognizing me.”\nMike laughed and said he’d heard the news a while ago, adding that he was proud of me for doing what I needed to do to be happy and having the guts to come to the reunion. Two minutes later, Meek showed up with my vodka soda. Rules number one and number four: check.\nI didn’t leave that spot for an hour. Once people got wind I was there they sought me out, girls giving me hugs and saying how great I looked, guys shaking hands and treating me no differently than before. My prom date was a no-show, but I did run into the guy I had my first kiss with at the eighth-grade dance. He came right up and said how great it was to see me. I couldn’t believe how mature everyone was.\nI’d mistakenly assumed my classmates would react like high school kids, not 28-year-old adults with jobs, spouses, and families. But they’d grown into their true selves, just like I had. Who knew that a Thanksgiving-weekend high school reunion could be the place to let go of old anxieties — instead of just reliving them?\nI ended up having a blast. In the end, my fellow Fab Fivers had to drag me out of there.\nThe next day, I gave my family the anxiously awaited recap. “It was really fun,” I said, popping two Advil. “Everybody was really cool about it.”\nMom cut to the chase, “Well, what did you say when you walked in?”\n“I said ‘You should’ve voted me Most Likely to Get a Sex Change.’”\nChris Edwards is the author of the memoir “Balls: It Takes Some to Get Some.” This column is adapted from his book.",

      "title": "Donald Trump’s new world order",
      "text": " Google+\nJustin Sullivan/ Getty Images\nBy Niall Ferguson November 22, 2016\n“It Can’t Happen Here.’’ That was the title of Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel in which the fascistic Berzelius “Buzz” Windrip is elected president and within months transforms the United States into an American Reich. Well, maybe it just did happen here.\nThe litmus test will be how far Steve Bannon’s appointment as chief strategist to President-elect Donald Trump signals the triumph of the will of the so-called alt-right. Will he be Lee Sarason to Trump’s Windrip? Are we all doomed to the Third World War, only this time with America on the wrong side?\nAdvertisement\nTwo weeks after Trump’s election, a more or less complete uncertainty reigns as to what direction his foreign policy will take. Rather than speculate about who gets which job, it may be more constructive to ask what Trump’s strategic options are.\nLet us begin with the geopolitical landscape that Trump inherits from his predecessor. In his most recent book, “World Order,’’ Henry Kissinger outlined four scenarios that he regards as the most likely catalysts for a large-scale conflagration:\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here • A deterioration in Sino-American relations whereby the two countries tumble into the so-called Thucydides trap that history sets for every incumbent power and the rising power that challenges it.\nTrump auditions Cabinet prospects high above Manhattan The future president received a line of former rivals, longtime allies, and TV executives.\n• A breakdown of relations between Russia and the West, based on mutual incomprehension and made possible by:\n• A collapse of European hard power due to the inability of modern European leaders to accept that diplomacy without the credible threat of force is just hot air; and/or\nAdvertisement\n• An escalation of conflict in the Middle East due to the Obama administration’s readiness, in the eyes of the Arab states and Israel, to hand hegemony in the region to a still-revolutionary Iran.\nThis is frightening stuff. Yet Trump enters the Oval Office with an underestimated advantage: the fact that Barack Obama’s foreign policy has been such a failure. This is most obvious in the Middle East, where the smoldering ruin that is Syria — not to mention Iraq and Libya — attests to the fundamental naivete of his approach.\nThe “Obama doctrine” has failed in Europe, too, where UK voters opted to leave the EU in defiance of the president’s threats. Finally, his foreign policy has failed in Asia, where little remains of the much-vaunted American “pivot.”\nAll this means that, by merely changing Obama’s foreign policy, President Trump will quite likely achieve success. The question is: How exactly should he go about this change? Kissinger’s recommendations to Trump may be summarized as follows:\n• Do not go all-out into a confrontation with China, whether on trade or the South China Sea. Rather, seek “comprehensive discussion” and aim to pursue the policy of “co-evolution” recommended in “World Order.”\n• Give a weakened, traumatized, post-imperial Russia the recognition Vladimir Putin craves, “as a great power, as an equal, and not as a supplicant in an American-designed system.”\n• Treat Brexit as an opportunity to steer the continental Europeans away from bureaucratic introspection and back to strategic responsibility.\n• Make peace in Syria as we made it in the former Yugoslavia 20 years ago, by “cantonizing” the country and giving President Bashar al-Assad a one-year “off-ramp,” or exit route.\nWhat if Trump, against all expectations, decided to seek better relations with both Moscow and Beijing? This would combine his own Russophile leanings with Kissinger’s argument for a new policy of partnership with China. Such an arrangement would theoretically be achievable if Trump engaged only in kabuki theatre with China over trade (which is what many influential Chinese seem to expect him to do). It would also be consistent with the tough line on Islamic extremism that has been such a feature of Trump’s campaign, for on this issue the three great powers — each with their worrisome and growing Muslim minorities — have a common interest. And it might be consistent with a reordering of the Middle East that reimposes the ancien régime of kings and dictators in the Arab world and reinforces Israel, all at the expense of Iran.\nAs a corollary, the three powers might agree on the demotion of Europe from great power status, taking advantage not only of Brexit but of the increasingly fragmented and self-referential character of EU politics. One possible way to do this would be for Trump to propose replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with NAFTA 2.0, which would bring the UK directly into a post-EU Anglo-Atlantic sphere while at the same time delivering on Trump’s anti-Mexican (though not anti-Canadian) election pledge. Simultaneously, Trump could credibly apply pressure on other NATO members to increase their risible defense budgets. Finally, he and Putin could work together to help continental populists such as Marine Le Pen to win the elections of 2017.\nOne striking feature of such a strategy is that the five permanent members of the UN security council would ultimately all be either populist or authoritarian-controlled, assuming Le Pen can somehow be helped across the line against the French pacte républicain. Thus might the institutions of collective security end up serving the interests of the great powers as never before: the ultimate revenge of realpolitik.\nThe new tripartite arrangement would be looser than the post-Napoleonic Holy Alliance of Austria, Prussia and Russia but, like their predecessors 200 years ago, liberals would denounce it as an Unholy Alliance of populists and authoritarians, indifferent to the principles of human rights. Some smaller countries would doubtless lose out. But for the world as a whole it would be an order of sorts. And no world war would be very likely to break out.\nOne objection might be that an alignment between America, Russia, and China, as well as Britain and France, is without precedent, but that is nonsense: It was precisely the alliance that won the Second World War. Another might be that such an alliance is unsustainable in the absence of an aggressive Germany and Japan. Yet the Cold War did not begin until 1948, and the Communists did not come to power in China until a year later: Up until that point, many reasonable people had hopes of sustaining the wartime coalition.\nMuch that I have written here is necessarily speculative. I do believe, however, that a new American foreign policy — if not a new world order — is already taking shape. Not only is it foreshadowed in the writing of Kissinger. It is also implicit in the current constellation of geopolitics.\nIf it is Kissinger’s spirit that animates the Trump administration — as opposed to Buzz Windrip’s — then its new order will not be so new, nor altogether bad.\nNiall Ferguson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Nestor Ramos Globe Staff November 22, 2016\nCleon Hodge was walking toward the Porter Square T station on his way home from work last month, glancing down at a text message conversation a few minutes after 6 p.m., when he banged shoulders with another pedestrian.\n“You gotta say ‘Excuse me’ if you’re going to try some cute [stuff] like that,” Hodge, 21, recalled telling the middle-aged man he’d collided with.\nAdvertisement\nBut the man was an on-duty plain-clothed police officer, Cambridge Detective Sergeant Thomas Ahern, and soon he was clutching Hodge by the sweatshirt while a small crowd gathered and a woman recorded the encounter.\nEach man believed the other had initiated the contact — a fact of life in a crowded city, the type of encounter that typically ends in little more than mutual annoyance. But now Cambridge police are seeking assault and other charges against Hodge and a woman who tried to intervene, and pursuing a lesser charge against a second woman who recorded the incident with her cellphone.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here The Oct. 13 incident and its aftermath, captured in four video clips by two bystanders, should raise serious questions about both Ahern’s handling of the situation and the resulting possibility of criminal charges, according to two civil right lawyers familiar with police abuse cases who reviewed the footage. Both were incredulous: How, they wondered, could what both men described as a minor collision between pedestrians on a crowded city street possibly be construed as assault and battery?\n“How many times have any one of us been bumped into by someone who is not paying attention?” asked Rahsaan Hall, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts Racial Justice Program, who reviewed the videos and Ahern’s account of the incident.\n“This is the type of behavior and abuse of authority that erodes the public’s confidence in the police.”\nAdvertisement\nCambridge police spokesman Jeremy Warnick said the department and Ahern were prevented from discussing the incident because of the potential charges pending before a clerk magistrate. Ahern, who joined the force in 1993, has had five complaints lodged against him over the course of his career, Warnick said — all of which were dismissed after investigation. He has receieved numerous awards, including a 2013 Unit Ribbon Award for leading a Special Response Team during the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings.\nBarry Chin/Globe Staff\nPolice are seeking to charge Cleon Hodge (above) with assault and battery.\nHodge — who had charges from a February run-in with Boston police recently dismissed — received a summons for assault and battery and disorderly conduct for the October incident. Both women could face charges of interfering with a police officer, and one for the more serious charge of assault and battery on a police officer. The latter carries a potential sentence of 2&frac12; years behind bars.\nDonald Gosselin, a retired 30-year veteran of the Boston Police Department who consults with police forces in Latin America on police modernization and community policing, said the assault charge against Hodge would appear to be difficult to prosecute.\n“I don’t see an assault and battery — you have to prove intent,” Gosselin explained. However, he added that if Hodge yelled at Ahern after they bumped into each other and created a scene, then a disorderly conduct charge would potentially apply.\nThe charge against the woman who allegedly touched Ahern’s arm, Gosselin said, hinges in part on when and whether the woman knew Ahern was a police officer. Such cases can be complicated when officers are working in plain clothes.\nBut the video, in which the woman appears to reach out with her left hand and contact the officers arm, “is conclusive evidence that the police officer was the victim of assault and battery,” Gosselin said.\nHodge and the two women appeared at a clerk magistrate hearing last week. Because two of the three defendants did not have lawyers, the matter was continued until December, according to Bill Merrigan, a lawyer who briefly represented the woman who Ahern alleges assaulted him by repeatedly touching his arm during the incident.\nLast week, Merrigan said, he withdrew from the case, referred the woman — a family friend — to a criminal defense lawyer, and filed a complaint over Ahern’s handling of the situation with the attorney general’s office. The names of those involved were not released because charges have not been issued yet. Only Hodge and Ahern are clearly identifiable in the videos.\nThe videos do not capture what touched off the confrontation, and Hodge’s and Ahern’s accounts differ.\nIn a police report written two hours after the encounter, Ahern alleged Hodge made eye contact with him before bumping him in the chest with his shoulder and angrily demanding an apology.\n“I walked up to him in an attempt to de-escalate the situation and identified myself as a police officer by displaying the badge which I carry on my belt,” Ahern wrote. Hodge, he wrote, replied with expletives that he didn’t care and continued to demand an apology.\n“At this point I could see that his both hands were clenched into fists which I interpreted as a pre-assault cue,” Ahern wrote. “I grabbed him by his shirt and told him to settle down and give me his ID.”\nHodge, in an interview, acknowledged demanding an apology from the man who he said banged into him deliberately. But he denied being physically aggressive.\n“Once I saw his badge, my hands go straight in the air. By my ears, straight up,” Hodge said.\nThe first video recording opens with Ahern gripping Hodge’s sweatshirt and Hodge’s hands in the air. Ahern reaches toward Hodge’s waist with his free hand, asking “What do you got in your pockets?” as Hodge backs away and moves his hips to avoid being searched. “You started this,” Ahern tells Hodge, who calmly tells Ahern that he was supposed to say “Excuse me.”\n“Get away from me, you’re going to be arrested in two seconds,” Ahern shouts, apparently at the woman recording the confrontation, and then slaps at the phone, knocking it out of her hand. “I’m police,” Ahern says after she retrieves her phone, “Go away.”\nIn the second recording, which appears to pick up soon after, Ahern is confronted by a second woman who demands to see his badge. He shows it to the woman while maintaining his grip on Hodge, whose hands are still raised, the pair now backed into a doorway.\nHodge hands his phone, which he’d been holding aloft, to the woman and asks her to call the police. Ahern jerks Hodge around and shoves him into a brick wall, lunging with his free hand toward Hodge’s waist.\nThe woman asks whether Ahern has a warrant to search Hodge — though typically only probable cause is necessary to conduct such a search, not a warrant — and then reaches toward Ahern’s arm with her left hand. Physical contact is not clearly visible in the video because the woman’s body obscures her hand, but Ahern immediately says “Don’t touch me.”\nThough the camera stays trained on Ahern and Hodge, a growing number of onlookers can be heard shouting to both men.\nHodge repeatedly asks Ahern to let go of him, as Ahern pulls him back into the doorway and pushes him against the wall and door.\n“When you bumped by me, I said excuse me,” Hodge says.\n“I didn’t bump into you,” Ahern says.\n“Yes you did. Don’t lie,” Hodge answers. “Come on now. Be for real.”\n“You’re being detained,” Ahern says, before being interrupted by another man who urges Hodge not to argue with the police.\nThe third recording shows Ahern still holding Hodge’s sweatshirt as Hodge asks why he’s being detained. Ahern declines to answer.\nAfter another brief exchange, more police officers arrive and search Hodge’s pockets, at which point Ahern releases his grip. Eventually, Hodge is allowed to leave.\nIn his report, which broadly matches the video but differs in the sequence of some events, Ahern described feeling concern about the growing crowd.\n“At this time I would estimate the crowd at about twenty people, most of who were outwardly hostile toward me,” Ahern wrote. Hodge and the two women were not arrested at the scene, he wrote, “so as to de-escalate the scene,” where a small crowd had begun chanting “Let him go.”\nLater that night, Ahern wrote in his report, police received a call from Hodge’s mother, who alleged that Ahern had appeared intoxicated — something two onlookers can be heard saying during the videos.\nAt one point in one video, Hodge says he can smell alcohol on Ahern’s breath and accuses him of being drunk.\nAhern responds, apparently dismissively: “Oh, I’m drunk. OK. Yeah, you’re right. You must be right. You’re right. Yep. Yep.”\nAt the police station, Ahern wrote, he took a breathalyzer test — video recorded and witnessed by another officer — that showed he had not consumed alcohol.\nAhern issued summonses to Hodge and the two women by mail.\nHoward Friedman, a Boston civil rights lawyer who specializes in police abuse cases, reviewed the videos and praised Hodge for remaining calm.\n“He was well-behaved considering this guy was grabbing him,” Friedman said.\nHe said allowing Ahern to seek charges was a mistake.\n“It seems clear to me that [Hodge] thought it was an accident,” Friedman said. “It’s the kind of incidental stuff that happens to us because we live in cities. That’s not assault and battery. That can happen as you walk down the sidewalk.”\nJeanette Reynoso, Hodge’s mother, said the racial climate in the country has made her fearful for her son’s life.\nHodge this year had a charge of assault and battery against a police officer after he allegedly shoved a Boston officer who ordered him to stop skateboarding near a construction zone. The charge was dismissed after he wrote a letter of apology and agreed to eight hours of community service. He works at a Cambridge call center that offers fund-raising services for nonprofits and progressive political organizations.\n“I’ve trained my son,” Reynoso said. “I’ve told him, don’t resist arrest. We’ll deal with it appropriately once the matter is resolved.”\nShe said the videos, in which Hodge clearly attempts to keep his hands raised, reflected that training.\n“There’s been a lot of innocent lives that are lost going in your pockets,” Reynoso said.\nAhern, not Hodge, was responsible for the chaotic scene, said Hall, the ACLU official.\n“He unreasonably escalates a situation that could have easily been avoided,” Hall said, and the crowd that gathers is plainly aware of the ongoing national conversation about how minorities — particularly young black men — are policed.\n“It’s really unfortunate because this officer’s conduct is inconsistent with the legacy of Chief [Robert] Haas, who recently retired,” Hall said, referring to Cambridge’s reputation as an enlightened, progressive police force. “It’s a waste of taxpayers resources to pursue these matters in court.”\nNestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com .

It's also worth mentioning that this is the last Developer Preview update before Google releases the final Android 7.1.1 build for eligible devices.According to Google, Developer Preview 2 includes “ near-final system behaviors and UI, along with the latest bug fixes and optimizations across the system and Google apps .”In addition, the search giant announced that this update brings the developers features and APIs that have already been introduced in Developer Preview 1. So, those who haven't yet tried out those features, they can now take a look at app shortcuts, round icon resources, and image keyboard support.Also, Developer Preview 2 is supposed to update the SDK build and platform tools in Android Studio , the Android 7.1.1 platform, and the API level 25 emulator system images.Google confirmed that as long as you have an eligible device that's been enrolled in the Android Beta Program , your device should receive the Developer Preview 2 update over the coming weeks without you having to do anything. However, you will also be able to download and flash the update manually. Android 7.1.1 includes the developer features already available on Pixel and Pixel XL devices and adds some optimizations and bug fixes. Google expects to launch the final Android 7.1.1 build sometime in December. The update will be rolled out to all supported preview devices, as well as the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones.",

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nBy Lisa Haven\nWith the election of Donald Trump as our president, many people are pushing the idea that our economy is going to take off like a rocket despite the fact that we have been and are on the greatest unfixable debt binge in world history. If truth be told, the economy was already on its way out due to Obama tripping our debt and I fear that the globalists just might “let it all fall” under Trumps presidency—a president who they deeply detest and will stop at nothing to destroy because he is a nationalist.\nIn the video below I reveal that even though President-Elect Donald Trump is about to take office, and make VERY good changes for America, it won’t come without a backlash from the globalists. I do believe there is a real danger headed our way and the cards are already starting to fall. All that and more in this report….\nGET TIGERSTREAM- https://tigerstream.tv/\nAccording to Michael Snider at the Economic Collapse Blog these 11 things Donald Trump will inherit from Obama:\n#1 Nearly 7 out of every 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings. That means that about two-thirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment.\n#2 Reuters is reporting that U.S. mall investors are poised to lose “billions” of dollars as the “retail apocalypse” in this nation deepens.\n#3 Credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since 2012.\n#4 Approximately 35 percent of all Americans have a debt that is at least 180 days past due.\n#5 The rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a 50 year low.\n#6 The total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost 10 million.\n#7 The number of homeless people in New York City (where Donald Trump is from) has hit a brand new record high.\n#8 About 20 percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents.\n#9 Total household debt in the United States has now reached a grand total of 12.3 trillion dollars.\n#10 The total amount of corporate debt in the U.S. has nearly doubled since the end of 2007.\n#11 When Barack Obama entered the White House, the U.S. government was 10.6 trillion dollars in debt. Today, the U.S. national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of $19,842,173,949,869.58.\nPlease remember virtually every stock market crash came after a major bond crash, and today, bonds are beginning to crash in a massive way. So please be ready, you never know what tomorrow holds.\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nMore Critical Reads You Need to Hear by Lisa Haven!

      "text": "Google, other tech giants outline ways to improve IoT security They think it's time to close security loopholes in connected home devices. Save Reuters / George Frey \nGoogle, Intel, Microsoft, Verizon, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and a handful of other tech industry giants joined former FCC Chief Technologist Dale Hatfield to form the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group in 2010, in an attempt to develop a set of best practices for broadband management and security. Today, BITAG laid out its recommendations for a rapidly growing industry within the world of online communication: the Internet of Things. \nConnected home devices occupy the wild west in terms of security and privacy practices; there's little to no regulation in terms of the software that powers smart homes. BITAG says some IoT devices have security vulnerabilities relating to outdated software, unauthenticated and unencrypted communications, data leaks, malware, and service interruptions. \nThis isn't just speculation: IoT devices enabled two widely publicized DDoS attacks in October, one that took out the internet across the United States and another that disabled the website of security researcher Brian Krebs. The Krebs attack infiltrated an estimated 145,000 IoT devices, mainly security cameras and DVRs. \nBITAG recommends a handful of security standards for IoT devices, including timely, automated and secure software updates, password protection, and increased testing of customization options. The group also suggests implementing encryption best practices, plus the ability for these devices, particularly home alarm systems, to function if internet connectivity or the cloud fails. BITAG even wants to establish an industry cybersecurity program that includes a seal for certified \"secure\" devices. \nBITAG doesn't have any actionable power to enforce these recommendations, but its report can influence regulatory discussions in the future. \n*Verizon has acquired AOL, Engadget's parent company. However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.",

      "text": "on Tuesday November 22, 2016 @06:40PM from the problem-for-democracy dept. According to a new study reported by The Wall Street Journal , Google's search results tend to lean liberal. \"An analysis by online-search marketer CanIRank.com found that 50 recent searches for political terms on Google surfaced more liberal-leaning webpages than conservative ones , as rated by a panel of four people.\" The Denver Channel reports: \"Minimum wage\" tended to yield more liberal results, while \"does gun control reduce crime\" resulted in more conservative ones. Searches for \"financial regulation\" and \"federal reserve\" found mostly nonpartisan links. CanIRank used the opinions of four people to determine how liberal or conservative each website was. For 16 percent of the political search terms studied, no right-leaning results showed up at all on the first page of results. CanIRank noted this could be a problem for democracy. A different study found most people click on one of the first five search results. Users rarely move on to the second page. A Google spokesperson said in an email to the WSJ: \"From the beginning, our approach to search has been to provide the most relevant answers and results to our users, and it would undermine people's trust in our results, and our company, if we were to change course.\" According to Google, their results are \"determined by algorithms using hundreds of factors\" and \"reflect the content and information that is available on the internet.\"",

      "text": "Google+ Pinterest \nSeveral years ago, I worked as an in-house copywriter and designer for a prominent marketing firm. When I first applied for the job I didn’t have any of the credentials my employers were looking for, and yet I got the job anyway, out of a pool of more qualified competitors. Why did I get chosen? The boss liked my story. \nI had no experience with working at a firm, nor was I technical enough to get deeply involved in the backend work. But my cover letter told them that I would be able to communicate clearly and effectively with their customers, while at the same time putting them at ease and perhaps making them laugh a little. I am pretty funny, after all. \nThe stories we tell prospective employers have a dramatic impact on whether or not we will be successful at what we do. They can literally make or break your career, so it’s important to choose and develop them wisely. What is Storytelling? \nYou may be thinking to yourself, ‘ I’m a designer – why do I need to worry about telling stories? ‘ But storytelling is more than literally sitting down and writing a tale of heroics or romance or wizards who speak Latin. \nWe encounter storytelling in everyday aspects of our lives, like when we see a man pull a dog out of a busy intersection, or when we watch a group of protesters march by, carrying hand-painted signs for a cause they believe in. All of these things are stories; they’re tiny moments of people taking action and affecting the world around them. Because at the heart of it, that’s all a story really is. \nI’ll bet that every movie you’ve ever seen goes something like this: there’s a person who does something in reaction to something that happened around them, which in turn causes another thing to happen that the person also has to do something about, and so on. \nSee? Story isn’t that complicated after all. Everyone already knows the basics. The key is incorporating them effectively in the way you communicate with your clients and your viewers. Articulate the Vision For Your Clients \nA few years ago, story artist Emma Coats tweeted a series of essential “story basics,” guidelines that she used at Pixar to create gripping narratives. Much of her advice had to do with simplifying and focusing on essentials that had a universal application. One of my favorites was #14: \n“ Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it. “ \nWhat’s the essential thing you are trying to convey to your audience? When you walk into a client meeting, what do you want them to take away the most? You aren’t selling them on a website, or a branding campaign. You’re selling them on a story, an idea, a dream. \nYour client dreams of something bigger than just “website” or “brand.” They dream of loyal customers who say glowing things about them. They dream of changing the world through the work they do. They dream of some story that, as the designer, it’s your job to uncover. Words or Images? \nAs designers, visuals are highly important in our work. We use pictures to tell stories all the time – from the smiling mother pushing a shopping cart in a print ad to a sun-kissed row of crops on a site about sustainable farming. But what about words? You may think writing is the job of the writers, and it is, but that’s not the end of it. \nWorking with type means working with words – arranging them in a way that will reach out and grab the reader’s attention. Just like images, words can tell a different story depending on the way they look. Typography is a much more expressive medium than most people give it credit for. Traditional print designers typically have a good handle on this idea, but for web designers, the merits of a strong background in type can sometimes be overlooked a bit. \nBut what about the actual words themselves? Just because you’re not a professional author doesn’t mean your words aren’t valuable. Plenty of designers and artists have catapulted to tremendous success simply because they wrote or blogged about something that other people found valuable. \nAustin Kleon’s bestselling book, Steal Like An Artist , is a great example of this. Kleon wrote the original blog post as an illustrated transcription of a talk he gave at Broome Community College in New York. Soon, it went viral, and within just a couple of years, the print version was selling like crazy. \nKleon had a story to tell that resonated with many people – not because he was paid to tell it, but because it was a simple truth that he had to share. In Conclusion \nThe most important thing you can do as a creative professional is capture your audience’s imagination. A true visionary has a narrative, and tells the story of the work in whatever way he or she can. \nRemember, nobody buys your skills – they buy an idea , a vision, a dream of how they can reach their business and personal goals with your help. They buy the story that tells the why, not the what, of what you do. Use the personality, passion, and drama of your stories to inform your designs. The more specific your stories, the more in-demand you will be as a designer. \nNo related posts.

      "text": "Shopify’s experimental product shop launches flash sales app Frenzy Posted Google’s AI translation tool seems to have invented its own secret internal language \nShopify’s Garage group is a product skunkworks of sorts, and it’s launching a new app called Frenzy today focused on flash sales, just in time for that most consumerist of holidays – Thanksgiving. Limited release sales are big again, with Yeezy raffles all over the place and Snapchat just dotting the map with expiring Snapbot vending machines for Spectacles. So Frenzy enters the stage at a time when people are very eager to spend money in fast, competitive, bite-sized flurries. \nFrenzy is an app that gives you a central place to put all your hypebeast hopes, where the path to purchase is as easy as using Apple Pay (which is dangerously easy). Frenzy is based on Shopify’s backend to hopefully ensure the app doesn’t crash while you’re scrambling to acquire whatever thing has captured the world’s attention for the next five minutes. \nThe Frenzy app will work with partner retailers and brands, so it should cover a range of bases in one place, which is more convenient for a consumer vs. looking around at vertical-specific retailers and/or chartering helicopters . \nI may have engaged in some frenzied online ordering a time or two myself, and the app looks to streamline in all the ways that anxious buyers with twitchy ordering fingers will appreciate, getting you from browse to checkout in as few as taps as possible (while still showing off the product with nice big images). \nFrenzy’s first sale launches tomorrow afternoon in partnership with Kith, and additional merchants including Love Your Melon, Raised by Wolves and Off the Hook are following up with subsequent flash sales over the course of the weekend. 0",

      "text": "via pixabay.com/Hans-2 Stay on target Google tried to buy company making cheeseburgers with plants instead of ... Bay Area brains hacked brewer’s yeast to make vegan cheese If, like me, you’re planning on making some sort of cheesy concoction for dinner tonight, know this: You’re actually not doing your body a disservice. In fact, you might be extending your lifespan by a few years by indulging in one of the most perfect foods out there.\nA new study from Nature Science suggests that consuming aged cheeses with the compound spermidine seems to extend the lifespan of mammals, based on tests with rodents. Rodents and cheese. Of course. It makes too much sense.\nBut rats and mice weren’t the only test subjects to be examined. Italians were also queried on how much cheese they eat and their resulting health changes were studied accordingly. Both the risk of high blood pressure and heart failure seemed to go down as cheese intake went up. It’s all thanks to spermidine, a polyamine compound that’s found in certain cheeses, mushrooms and even semen (hence the name.) First found in semen, it was found to extend lab rats’ lifespan even when it wasn’t given to the rats until their middle age.\nWhy is spermidine the bee’s knees? It’s said to induce a process known as autophagy, which pushes heart cells to shut down parts of themselves that don’t work properly or are no longer necessary. This results in a better number of “good” cells, so bodily functions are improved. This was proven in studies with mice given spermidine who tended to have improved heart function and lower blood pressure, which contributed to longer lifespans.\nIt’s a bit too early to assume you can just eat all the cheese you want to stack benefits or anything insane like that, but this is critical research that could lead to the improvement of health in patients out there suffering from high blood pressure or other circulatory ailments.",

      "title": "Is DeepMind’s Health-Care App a Solution, or a Problem?",
      "text": "DeepMind, Google’s artificial intelligence outfit, wants to streamline health care by using machine learning to provide medics with intelligent notifications. But not everyone is happy with the piles of data being shared with the company.\nThe project will provide medics across a number of London hospitals with alerts about patients via an app called Streams . The app is meant to provide easy access to patient histories and test results for nurses and doctors. But its AI will also learn to track patterns in patients’ blood test data and flag cases that show early signs of kidney injury to the appropriate doctors.\nDeepMind has signed a five-year contract with the U.K.’s National Health Service to provide the app, according to the BBC . In return, DeepMind gets access to records belonging to over 1.6 million patients who are registered with one of the Royal Free NHS Trust’s three London hospitals.\n\nDeepMind wants to make better use of medical records. The new agreement is actually an overhaul to an existing contract that came under fire earlier this year as part of an investigation by New Scientist . A freedom of information request showed that the Royal Free Hospital Trust had already entered into a data-sharing agreement with DeepMind, but the partnership had failed to register the app with the U.K. government’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The new contract rectifies that oversight.\nBut some critics still worry about the arrangement. Speaking to the Financial Times , Julia Powles, a lawyer from the University of Cambridge who specializes in technology, said that DeepMind is getting “swift and broad access into the NHS, on the back of persuasive but unproven promises of efficiency and innovation.” She added that there’s no real way of knowing what the company is doing with the data.\nFor its part, DeepMind argues that the software will help streamline health care at the hospitals by “freeing up clinicians’ time from juggling multiple pager, desktop-based, and paper systems.” Ultimately, the company claims that once the software is fully rolled out it could “redirect over half a million hours per year away from admin and towards direct patient care.” It also points out that patient data is encrypted, and is used only by DeepMind, not the larger organization of Google.\nIt’s not the only health-related project that DeepMind is working on. The company is also using its machine learning approaches to help University College Hospital streamline its radiotherapy treatments , and with Moorfields Eye Hospital to spot the early signs of visual degeneration .\nMuch rests on the underlying aims of DeepMind. Its critics clearly suspect that these projects are a way to obtain large quantities of data that would otherwise be off-limits to it. But if its goal is to simply make health-care services as efficient as possible, then there’s little other way to enlist its help than offering up such large data sets. With any luck the mantras of “first, do no harm” and “don’t be evil” can happily co-exist.\n(Read more: BBC , Financial Times , “ DeepMind Will Use AI to Streamline Targeted Cancer Treatment ,” “ DeepMind’s First Medical Research Gig Will Use AI to Diagnose Eye Disease ”)\nLearn more about machine learning at EmTech Digital 2017.\nRegister now",

      "text": "January 13th, 2016 | Analysis 113 comments \nThe new year has begun with a confirmed Google update. However, what was initially believed to be either a change to Panda or Penguin is in fact a core ranking algorithm update. Here, we take a look at the fresh data from the Searchmetrics Suite. Background to Google update \nWe were expecting a Penguin update for the start of 2016. Initial analyses from the weekend 9/10 January were focused on this. The changes in the Google rankings were considerable on a global scale and various services that measure changes in Google search results came to similar conclusions. \nMeanwhile several Google employees have spoken about the update via Twitter: John Mueller and Gary Illyes have confirmed that the observed turbulence is in fact due to a Google update – not the expected Penguin update, but an update to the core ranking algorithm. Analysis: lots of change, few observable patterns \nWe have pulled fresh research data from the Searchmetrics Suite to analyze the changes in Google search results. We observed massive changes in the top 100 websites by SEO Visibility (our flagship indicator for online performance) – 50% of the websites that are now amongst the winners and losers are different to before the update. This holds true for both desktop and mobile SERPs. We have tried to detect any patterns that are characteristic of a quality update, which we will now have a closer look at. Check your visibility now Content quality is decisive \nWe drew attention to the volatility of the search results following last update of 2015 – Phantom III / Quality Update . This volatility matches again with the current data. In particular in the USA publisher websites with pieces of content that rank with brand keywords and entities have witnessed heavy losses in visibility. Brands, on the other hand, have seen a boost in rankings. This trend is not yet noticeable in other international markets, which could indicate that the update has not yet been rolled out globally. \nLet’s take a look at the biggest loser in the US – theatlantic.com . This publisher has primarily lost with old URLs that ranked for brand keywords and entities: \nIt is apparent that many loser domains are classic print publishers and their losses in rankings mainly stem from older content pieces. Additional publisher who lost rankings are newyorker.com , vanityfair.com , arstechnica.com , fastcompany.com and economist.com . \nThese losses amongst publishers are mainly compensated by corresponding gains amongst brands such as alaskaair.com . \nParallel to this development many publishers have actually won in Google.com search results. Particularly those publishers with current or holistic content. Top winner according to our most recent Suite data is gq.com . On gq.com the biggest winning URL is a comprehensive article about NFL star Tom Brady, shown here in the screenshot on the left. \nThe article contains photos and a video and a lot of text (more than 3000 words including an interview). A test with Content Optimization in the Searchmetrics Suite shows that the article covers all important subtopics about entity Tom Brady. \nAdditioanl publishers who gained visibility are time.com , qz.com , howstuffworks.com , politico.com and inquisitr.com . \nWhether a publisher or brands won or lost for a specific keyword is dependent on the individual QDF score that Google calculates according to current events and user behavior, particularly search volume. For topics that are current, obviously publishers with current content witnessed visibility gains. \nIn summary, the quality of the content is absolutely decisive for rankings. User intent instead of content \nOne group of winners is particularly suprising for SEOs: educational games. Domains such as brainpop.com and mathplayground.com with landing pages such as this: \nThe screenshot is no cropped, this is actually the complete page. If you are thinking of cloacking or hidden content, just take a look at the Google cache: \nFrom a classical SEO perspective, these rankings can hardly be explained. There is only one possible explanation: user intent. If someone is searching for “ how to write a sentence ” and finds a game such as this, then the user intention is fulfilled. Also the type of content (interactive game) has a well above average time-on-site. According to SimilarWeb, the duration of an average visit to BrainPOP is more than 8 minutes, with a bounce rate below 20%. \nEven though the site regained rankings, BrainPOP is a good example of the downside of having a lot of pages with low amounts of content: each page only ranks for a few keywords, as our Content Performance analysis shows quite well: \nConclusion : High quality, longform content pieces that cover a topic in-depth are the winners in many areas. But the sheer amount of content is not decisive for rankings, rather the question of whether the content is relevant and fulfils the user intention. De-indexed guitar tab pages \nWebsites that offer guitar tabs have been completely de-indexed in some cases. Let’s take a look at the visibility of ultimate-guitar.com as an example: \n\nThis change, being de-indexed, has been implemented globally. This has also been carried out for guitartab.com in the US: Check your visibility now \nDue to the branch specific nature of this complete de-indexation of thousands of URLs, we suspect this change was implemented manually. In addition, ranking positions have been filled by pages with effectively the same content (guitar tabs). The former market leader Ultimate Guitar still ranks for some keywords, however, typically with relatively low quality subpages in correspondingly low ranking positions. The complete domain has not been de-indexed. While the subdomain tabs.ultimate-guitar.com has been completely de-indexed, the editorial content can still be found in the Google index. \nAs always we will continue to monitor the data and keep you abreast of any further changes. Have you noticed any changes in your rankings or have any more info about the update? – Let us know in the comments below. \nWho’s writing this stuff?

      "text": "DeepMind, the British AI firm owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, has signed a new five-year deal to use data collected by the UK’s National Health Service. The agreement with the NHS Royal Free Hospital Trust in London replaces a previous deal that attracted controversy over its lack of official oversight. Under the terms of the new deal, DeepMind will handle personally identifiable medical records for some 1.6 million patients, including medical history dating back five years. The agreement also includes stricter data regulation, including \"technical audits\" of DeepMind's systems.\nUsing data from the Royal Free, DeepMind has built an app named Streams that alerts doctors when patients are in danger of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) — a common but often overlooked condition. \"10,000 people a year are dying from acute kidney injury, these are entirely preventable deaths,\" Mustafa Suleyman, head of DeepMind Health, told The Financial Times . \"We can trigger an alert that allows nurses or doctors to take preventative action, like giving intravenous antibiotics when your kidneys are dehydrated, to prevent escalation to the ICU.\" The app is currently being tested in pilot schemes, and will be rolled out to select NHS hospitals in 2017. In the future, its functionality could be expanded to handle data for other conditions in addition to AKI.\nDeepMind isn't using AI to analyze the data, but says that could happen in future \nDespite DeepMind’s assurances that it is following every necessary safety regulation in handling patients’ medical records, many experts are still wary about the deal. One criticism is that DeepMind’s parent company Alphabet is essentially mining the NHS for data (collected at the expense of the UK taxpayer) which it will then use to develop services it will sell to other countries. While DeepMind says it’s not using the data to train its \"machine learning algorithms,\" and that this would require a new legal agreement, it is using it to create an API for managing health data via apps. This is something that the company could potentially monetize in future, although when asked whether this was the intention by TechCrunch , Suleyman only said: \"I don’t know.\"\nThe company is currently paid by the NHS to create the Streams app, but says it charges only a \"modest fee\" that is \"almost nothing.\" The partnership between DeepMind and the NHS is currently under examination by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office and the country’s National Data Guardian.",

      "text": "Google Launchpad. Photo credit: Tech in Asia Indonesia.\nAfter Google’s two-time success with holding its Launchpad program in January and June this year, the tech giant is back for a third time. Startups in this batch receive funding and six months of training at Google’s Launchpad Space in San Francisco, beginning at the end of January next year.\nPreviously, Google only accepted applications from startups based in Indonesia, India, Brazil, and Mexico. In this batch, Google includes five more countries: Argentina, Colombia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nHere are the six Indonesian startups that made it.\nSnapcart Photo credit: Snapcart .\nSnapcart enables consumers to exchange shopping receipts for cashback. In return, companies get information on consumers’ shopping habits based on the receipts submitted to the app.\nThe startup received US$1.6 million in a pre-series A round from Wavemaker Partners, Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV), Ardent Capital, and SPH Media Fund.\nQlue The Qlue app in action. Photo credit: Qlue .\nQlue is an online rating and reporting app for government and private services. Users send their complaints along with photos as evidence, which are then passed on to related service providers as a call to action.\nFor example, if you wish to complain about the city’s waste-management program for not picking up your trash on weekends, you can submit a review with a photo of your trash on Qlue. The app notifies waste management officials, who will contact you to solve the problem.\nThe startup announced in May that it received series A funding of over US$1 million from telecommunications company Prasetia Dwidharma, which is part of Indonesian conglomerate Astra Group.\niGrow \niGrow helps consumers invest in farming crops and monitor it from afar. You can purchase seeds from iGrow and watch as farmers grow and turn your seeds into fresh produce, which is then sold to partner markets. The returns from the produce sold are split equally between you and the farmer.\nThe startup connects three parts of the farming industry: investors, farmers, and buyers of produce.\nIn June, iGrow raised a seed round of undisclosed amount from East Ventures and 500 Startups.\nJurnal Jurnal.id. Photo credit: Jurnal .\nJurnal is accounting software for small and medium enterprises. Users can create invoices and receipts, as well as manage assets, inventory, and storage.\nJurnal received series A funding in February from East Ventures, Fenox VC, and angel investor Budi Setiadharma.\nMapan \nMapan’s ad campaign, targeting stay-at-home parents in Indonesia’s neighborhoods. \nMapan is an online platform that puts a spin on the traditional community raffle meeting in Indonesia, known as arisan . Women and men in an Indonesian neighborhood meet up every month to socialize and put a fixed amount of money in a raffle. The winner walks away with all the money in the raffle.\nMapan takes it a step further by inviting members – typically stay-at-home parents – to trade the money for household items from its catalog. The meeting coordinator gathers all the raffle money to purchase the group’s chosen household item from Mapan and has it delivered to the meeting venue, while the winner of Arisan Mapan (Mapan’s raffle meeting) goes home with the item.\nThe service is developed by Ruma , a startup that’s using tech to help people in suburban or rural areas connect their purchasing power to buy goods. Ruma is backed by Omidyar Network and other impact funds.\nPicMix Photo credit: Picmix .\nPicMix is an Indonesian startup offering photo-editing software. The startup allows users to edit and share photo and video content. It’s currently expanding to Instagram territory: users can upload their pictures for likes and displays on the website.\nPicMix received series A funding of US$1 million from Gobi Partners and US$2 million from an undisclosed investor in April 2016.\nThis post 6 Indonesian startups that made it to the third batch of Google Launchpad appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nLamenting the dominant share Facebook and Google have in the digital advertising market has become a common motif in media owner circles. But some feel publishers need to get better at standing their ground. \nIn this latest instalment of our Confessions series , in which we grant anonymity in exchange for candor, we spoke to a publishing executive at a national newspaper, who is frustrated at how slow publishers continue to be when responding to the biggest threats in digital media, whether it’s how to deal with the platforms, or believing in the “mirage” of promised revenue created by ad tech. \nExcerpts lightly edited for clarity. Advertisement \nWhat’s your biggest concern? Publishers must stop giving away their best assets — their journalism and direct monetization — for scale. Does Facebook value quality journalism? I see scant evidence that it does. Whether that’s all the issues around fake news and the inability to police it, or whether it’s making the offer to publishers: ‘Give me all your journalism for nothing, and we’ll collect all the audience data, and keep it within a walled garden.’ On what level does that seem a good idea? The promise is that you get 100 percent of the pennies that you create from the advertising revenue. If that looks like an attractive proposition, then you’re in a pretty poor state. \nSo is it a pipe dream to think there’s meaningful revenue from publishing to platforms? The key word is meaningful. We’re long past the point of thinking advertising alone pays for the cost of quality journalism. You’re grabbing for pennies. I’m sick of ad tech vendors knocking at my door, promising to give me 10-30 percent increase in yields. For starters, they can’t, but even if they could it wouldn’t make any difference, because you’re talking pennies. And Facebook is ad tech. You’re encouraging consumption of journalism on a platform other than your own. And for what end? A few pennies. It’s the most ridiculous deal that anyone could strike. And it’s because publishers are so desperate that it seems in any way attractive. \nBut Facebook is useful for audience development. I understand why people get hooked on it. People still think that scale will lead them to a path of nirvana. But scale leads to increases in supply, and supply leads to prices trending to zero. So I struggle with the economics of scale when it comes to publishing — it leads people down a lot of blind allies and cliff edges. \nFacebook is a great marketing machine. Creative agencies, media agencies and publishers — none of us have business models that are actually aligned to what a client is trying to achieve. But Facebook does. It’s data-centric, has massive scale, the creative is straightforward and the media buying is push-button. The business models of creative and media agencies, and publishers are historic, legacy set-ups, which have the P&L of the individual component part at the heart of their decision making, rather than the client’s interest. That has to create gross inefficiencies and lack of performance, frankly. \nHow so? Broadly speaking, publishers are really hard to do business with. We’re all individual, separate, unconnected. Our technologies, reporting, analytics, and the opportunities we offer to market are all so distinct and different. And that used to be a good thing, but in today’s world it matters more how efficiently you can squeeze the delivery of a campaign out, so suddenly everyone being different isn’t so good. It means we create points of friction. And every time a big technology company becomes 1 percent easier to do business with, we all become 5 percent less easy to do business with. There’s a disproportionate effect. \nWhat is being done to remedy that? Publishers haven’t got their shit together. We’ve responded to a digital marketplace by over complicating ourselves with different currencies, different pricing and offers, different ad sizes. There’s a degree of standardization, but not much. Native ad deals are good, because they can sum up the essence of what the individual brand stands for, and that can be crafted to what an advertising brand wants to do. But we’ve responded to the digital world by overcomplicating. Our analytics don’t match up — there’s still no measurement that can really allow you to compare digital, with TV, with press, in a really effective way that’s been adopted by the industry. So we just make things harder for the advertiser and the agency, whose P&Ls are under as much stress as everyone else’s. \nSo, what positive things are happening? Media owners are still being incredibly innovative. The minute we try to squash all innovation out of the industry, we’ll become anodyne and commoditized. And I’m encouraged to see people beginning to recognise the value of their journalism, and not being so seduced by value of scale and giving it all away. \nBut what bothers me is it’s just too slow. We were slow to recognize the decline of print, slow to recognize the failed promise of digital advertising, and slow to recognize that the promise of ad tech was a mirage, to a large extent. We’re slow to change our business models, and we’re slow to get our act together as a group of publishers. We’re fighting lean, mean, fast-moving machines. Let’s step to it. Related ",

      "text": "Google's Pixel phones get lift-to-wake and double-tap features The intuitive phone-waking \"moves\" were first seen on Google's Moto devices. Share Save \nGoogle's well-reviewed Pixel and Pixel XL are the Android phones to have right now, but they're still missing some much-liked features from the Nexus 6P and 5X . Namely, the models lack the \"Moves\" that let you double-tap or merely lift the phone to wake it up. However, some Canadians are reporting that those functions are available in the latest OTA update, so folks in other regions should see them soon, too. \niPhone owners received a \"raise to wake\" feature with OS X , though Apple arguably borrowed the idea from earlier Moto \"Active Display\" models. While the Motorola brand is no longer in Google's hands, Lenovo is giving Moto owners the latest Nougat updates pretty quickly, including features like Daydream VR . The Pixel models, however, are still the ones to have if you want all of Google's newest treats first. \nAs Droid Life details, you'll need to activate the new features once you get the OTA update (or if you're brave enough to sideload it). To do so, just go to \"Moves\" in the general settings, and flip on \"double-tap to check phone\" and \"lift to check phone",

      "text": "Google WiFi mesh networking crushes the competition in new test Google WiFi mesh networking crushes the competition in new test By Ryan Whitwam   9:10 am Comment \nWhile Apple is getting out of the router business , Google is doubling down. Or maybe tripling down, if you really buy into mesh networking. Google WiFi is set to ship in the next few weeks, and a third-party test of Google’s new wireless solution shows it clobbering other mesh networking systems. \nGoogle WiFi is not Mountain View’s first attempt at selling a consumer router. In fact, the last one wasn’t even very long ago. Just over a year ago Google released the OnHub router. This device was billed as a hub for smart home devices with easier setup and slick management via a mobile app. Although, after numerous updates the OnHub has virtually no smart home features and even basic things like network attached storage don’t work. \nGoogle says the the OnHub isn’t dead, but Google WiFi is clearly the direction the company wants to go. You can get a single 802.11ac router for $129, but the magic comes into play when you have more than one to form a mesh network in your home. A three-pack clocks in at $299, which should be enough to cover a 4,500 square foot home. As you move around the house, Google WiFi and similar mesh routers can shift your connection to different nodes to keep your speeds as high as possible. \nThe test performed by Allion USA didn’t make use of three routers. It used two routers in a typical 3,000 square foot home, split into two levels with one router on each. They tested Google WiFi, Eero, and Luma in the same environment. The results were very kind to Google’s product. \nAccording to Allion USA, Google WiFi was 75% faster than Eero and twice as fast as Luma in the living room. This was a centralized location with good access to the signal, but Google WiFi fared even better at the periphery of the network. In an upstairs bedroom on the opposite side of the house from the router, Google WiFi was about 10% faster than Luma and a whopping five times faster than Eero. When in close proximity to the router, Google WiFi still won out with at least 20% faster speeds. \nThese tests were done independently by Allion USA, but in cooperation with Google. Not to imply there’s anything untoward going on here, but Google probably wouldn’t have told us anything about the test if Google WiFi hadn’t won handily. Google WiFi is available for pre-order right now at the Google Store, Amazon , and more. The shipping date is currently listed as December 5th. Tagged In",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nI wonder how many of you out there know exactly who Tucker Carlson is, from Fox News of course, but never really knew what his official role or “title” was at Fox, at least not until recently when he took over the 7pm slot after Gretta Van Susteren’s hasty departure. I seem to remember him stopping by Fox and Friends a lot pn the weekends, but besides that, I can’t seem to put my finger on what his former role was.\nWhy do I bring it up then? Because in his new role, with his own show, he can be outright ruthless. If nothing else, Bill O’Reilly would be rather intimidating in person because of his enormous height and build, not to mention his constant interrupting, but after watching Tucker twice this week, I’d take my chances going toe to toe with O’Reilly any day. If Tucker was on much earlier than 7pm, there might need to be a special rating not to scare small children.\nEarlier this week, I posted: Tucker Carlson Ruthlessly Annihilates Liberal Reporter on Live TV because I couldn’t help but notice after watching the interview live, after Tucker was finished eviscerating his guest live, within 2-3 minutes of cutting to commercial, Fox already had the clip up on YouTube. They must have known it was going to be a crowd pleaser. In the article and the video below, this time Tucker chews up and spits out an over privileged, whining, safe-spacer, and his performance is brilliant. Enjoy!\nChicks on the Right writes:\nHampshire College in Massachusetts has removed all flags from campus. Why? Because some lilac-scented snowflake burned the American flag after the presidential election.\nMembers of the campus community originally lowered the flag to half-staff after the election.\nThat move offended a lot of people, and the flag was found burned on Veterans Day.\n“It is a disrespect. That shouldn’t have happened in the first place,” Hampshire College President Johnathan Lash said .\nOfficials replaced the flag, which they also flew at half-staff over claims that the flag represents “racism and hatred.” Military veterans and their families were completely outraged, so the school decided to remove the flags completely.\nSchool officials are expected to talk to the college community about “properly utilizing flags in the future.”\nTucker Carlson interviewed one of the students who supports the removal of the American flag. Everyone, meet Daniel Vogel.\nI kinda want his picture on my punching bag. I feel like it would really help me reach my full potential in my workouts.\nVogel supports the complete removal of the flag, because it’s used by oppressive forces– like police officers and the U.S. Army.\nCarlson had the best response EVER.\n“You said, ‘Think about the groups who use the flag– from police officers to the U.S. Army. These are the forces on the ground that make oppression happen.’ Now the obvious point is– obviously– if the police and the army were to go away, sensitive college students like you would be eaten alive,” Carlson said.\nOh, it gets better. Carlson asked Vogel why it’s always the rich liberal kids who are burning American flags, and he didn’t have an answer. But Vogel did say that he’s super privileged to go to that college, and he recognizes that his parents were only able to accumulate their wealth and pay his way because of slaves, so there’s that.\nThat’s the problem with my generation. Self-loathing, wealthy students like Vogel waste all of their time “standing up” for the laborers in this country by burning flags and holding cry-ins. They actually think they’re making a difference. They actually think they’re fighting for the “greater good” by crying and burning things. Their parents are spending thousands of dollars a year so these students can sit around and pretend to care about minorities and the middle class. Then these social justice warriors graduate and become history teachers. (That’s what Vogel wants to do. If that doesn’t make you weep for the future, I don’t know what will.)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN THE NEWSLETTER HERE\nHey Vogel– don’t you have some new artisanal bread recipe you need to try out or something?\nFOR MORE ON LIBERALISM: THE IDEOLOGY OF HATE, GENOCIDE, & IDIOCY:\nTucker Carlson Ruthlessly Annihilates Liberal Reporter on Live TV (Video)​\n12 Liberals Who Absolutely Deserve the Karma of a Trump Presidency (Video)\nVeterans Are Dying Everywhere; VA Wants To Perform Sex-Change Operations\nScientists: 40% Of People Have Newly Discovered Brain Parasite (Video)\nDisbarment Charges Are Filed Against Baltimore State Attorney Mosby (Video)\nObama Changed U.S. Citizenship Oath Specifically to Accommodate Sharia and Islamic Law\nVideo: Sharpton Begs for Mercy as Megyn Destroys Him on National TV\nNew World Order’s Plan for the Fall of America Upon Us?

      "text": "Last year, Google release Android 6.0 Marshmallow a little more than one year ago. This update introduced a new feature that let you virtually add the amount of storage you had on a microSD card with your internal storage capacity. This was a surprising move as Google has generally not been a fan of SD cards. They removed SD card slots from their Nexus phones and didn’t include one in the Pixel or Pixel XL .\nGoogle’s reasoning behind this move was due to performance issues. They don’t want the customer to blame the phone or the operating system because of slow performance from an SD card. The people at the SD Association have acknowledged this issue and have just announced a new class of SD cards. The Application Performance Class was introduced in the organization’s SD 5.1 specification and this comes with the first App Performance Class1 (otherwise known as A1).\nThis new Application Performance Class will evolve over time as hardware improves, but it serves as a way for consumers to know their microSD card is fast enough for applications. The A1 app Performance Class comes with minimum random read performance inputs/outputs per second (1500 IOPS), minimum random write performance (500 IOPS) and minimum sustained sequential performance (10 MB/sec).\nIt’s unclear if this move will push companies like Google to offer better support for SD cards, but it’s a great move for consumers who know what they’re looking for. The SD Association is even taking steps to make it easy for the customer to know if they have the right SD card or not. In the video, they explain that the recommended App Performance Class will be printed on the box of their smartphones.\nSo if the OEM recommends you get an A1 class microSD card, then it will be placed right on the box. This way the customer knows to go into a store and buy a microSD card with the A1 rating.\n\nSource: SD Association \n",

      "title": "Google perpetuates cycle of confusion, renames Google Cast back to Chromecast - The Verge",
      "text": "Google appears to be removing the Google Cast name and switching it back to the original Chromecast moniker. As noted by A ndroid Police , Google has already renamed the @GoogleCast Twitter account back to @Chromecast, and the Google Cast website now describes Google Cast as “Chromecast built-in.”\nThe Google Cast name was originally introduced when Google began expanding Chromecasting to other devices; earlier this year, Google renamed the Chromecast app to a matching “Google Cast” name. The name change was a nod to the fact that there were now lots of non-Chromecast products out there that had Casting built in, a decision that seemed to make sense at the time.\nGoogle Cast is now called Chromecast again Then, earlier this month, Google renamed the Google Cast app again to be called Google Home , making it a (confusingly named) one stop shop for controlling all Chomecast, Google Cast, and Google Home products (of which there is only one). This also sort of made sense, since Google clearly wants to focus attention on Home as the hub of its connected devices. \nFrom Google Cast ➡ @Chromecast . New name on Twitter, same device you know, stream from and love. pic.twitter.com/MnWEj39GuG \n— Google Chromecast (@Chromecast) November 22, 2016 So, to recap: Google’s system for streaming media from one device to another is called Casting. Any device that displays that media is a Chromecast. And you control it all through the Google Home app. At least for now, since at this rate it’s possible that Google will decide to change the naming scheme again in a few months.",

      "text": "Photo: NewsFlash Related News \nA commercial driver, Taiwo Oladepo, on Wednesday prayed an Agege Customary Court in Lagos to dissolve his 11-year-old marriage over alleged lack of care and submission by the woman. \nThe 35-year-old Mr. Oladepo, father of four, resides at Number 29, Anthony Nwosu, Ileke Estate, Meiran, Lagos. \nHe claimed that his 36-year-old wife, Biola, was troublesome, disobedient, not submissive and not caring. \n“My wife is too troublesome; she is stubborn, arrogant and not submissive. She is also lazy and wayward. \n“There has been no peace in this marriage; we live like cat and rat,” he told the court. \nThe petitioner submitted that his wife went out and returned any time she liked, adding that each time he asked her where she had been, she told him: “Go and ask Google’’. \n“I am no longer interested in the union,” he submitted. \nResponding, Biola, a petty trader, denied the allegations. \nShe said that the petitioner lacked respect for her and beat her regularly. \n“There was a time his friends tried to caution him about his attitude toward me. \n“The beating is unbearable but l kept bearing it because of my children,” she said. \nShe added that her husband had illicit affairs with different women. \nShe consented to the dissolution of the marriage, but appealed to the court to give her the custody of the children, urging that her husband should be responsible for the children’s education and healthcare. \nThe Court President, Philip Williams, adjourned the case till January 31, 2017 for judgment. \n(NAN)",

      "text": "\nGoogle Cast is going away, at least as a brand name.\nGoogle has been quietly removing the term ‘Google Cast’ for TVs and connected speakers that work with the Chromecast streaming media device family. Instead, Google will now refer to Google Cast as “Chromecast built-in”. Why the name change? It appears that Google simply wants to consolidate its streaming media branding under a more familiar name, and that might be the best thing to do. The name ‘Google Cast’ might cause some confusion among consumers who want to buy a TV or speaker that works with a Chromecast.\nSee also: Chromecast Ultra announced: 4K video streaming, HDR and more for $69 October 4, 2016 The news was announced Tuesday on the official Google Cast Twitter account:\nFrom Google Cast ➡ @Chromecast . New name on Twitter, same device you know, stream from and love. pic.twitter.com/MnWEj39GuG \n— Google Chromecast (@Chromecast) November 22, 2016 \n\nThis name change shouldn’t come as a huge shock, as the official Google Cast app already got a name change to Google Home a few weeks ago, just before the connected speaker with the same name was first announced. All of these name changes might be a bit difficult to keep up with for now, but it’ll likely cause much less confusion in the future for consumers.",

      "title": "Google AdWords Expanded Text Ads: Best Practices For The New Format",
      "text": "Expanded Text Ads (ETAs), announced in July of 2016, are considered by most industry observers to be the biggest change to Google Adwords in 16 years.\nGoogle’s new ETAs provide for an increase of 50 percent more ad space. Plus, ETAs pack in a few other exciting features as well.\nNumerous strategies and best practices have been developed over the years for the standard text ad format, but unfortunately, most of these don’t translate to expanded text ads. And, businesses are now having to scramble to update their ads before Google stops supporting the old format in January.\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of how to best handle expanded text ads, let’s get to know them a bit better.\nDissecting the Expanded Text Ad Below is a comparison between the expanded text ad format and the standard text ad format.\n\nSource \nThe components of the expanded text ad are as follows:\nTwo Headlines (Shown in lavender in the left side of the image above) As opposed to standard text ads, ETAs have two headlines — a main headline and a secondary headline. Each headline can use up to 30 characters, as compared to the prior format of one headline with 25 characters.\nDisplay URL and Path Fields (Shown in Green) When creating ETAs, the final URL has to be entered first (above the headlines) and the display URL is created automatically based on that. There are two optional path fields available to extend the display URL by up to 15 characters each.\nDescription (Shown in Gray) ETAs have one long description field with a maximum length of 80 characters. This compares to two fields of 35 characters each with standard text ads.\nNow that we’ve gone over the guts of what makes ETAs, let’s get started on some best practices in order to take full advantage of them.\n1) Use Keywords and Convincing Copy in Your Headlines The main headline is the section that most people will see first and pay attention to. Put your most vital information here and make sure to include the main keyword you are targeting in the associated ad group. If you have a long keyword term, then just put your entire keyword in the main headline.\nThe secondary headline is best for supporting information. This is where you’ll reference the main benefit or USP of your product or service, or stress the urgency of your offer.\nKeep in mind that your secondary headline may not always be shown in full. This is because, while you’re allowed up to 30 characters, Google determines ad display based on pixel-count. For example, wider characters such as “W” take up more space. So, if your two headlines go over the allowed number of pixels, Google may trim down your secondary headline. In most cases, your ad preview will show how your ad will look but it is a good idea to allow some breathing room. \n\nUnlike standard text ads, you can now do so much more after adding your keywords. You have some creative freedom to craft a headline that demands attention. Use language that will appeal to your target audience to convince them to interact with your ad. This combination is sure to increase your click-through rates considerably.\nBelow is an example of an expanded text ad that has been very successful. It blends in keywords (DDoS Protection and Stop DDoS) very well with urgency and value-add.\n\nHere is another example of a compelling ETA. It combines keywords (User Behavior Analytics) effectively with an attractive offer (Free Guide) and the target audience (CISO).\n\n2) Utilize the Description to Differentiate Your Product or Service After grabbing attention with your headline, use the description to provide supplementary information to convince searchers to click through to your page. The best way to utilize this section is to include an additional benefit, a feature, and a  call-to-action (CTA) or offer. A CTA such as “Start Free Trial,” “Shop Now” or “Download Free Guide” will let users know exactly what to expect on your landing page and will boost conversions.\nRemember, the description is the final attempt to get a searcher to click-through to your site instead of others—so use your extra description space wisely. Be sure to differentiate your product or service from the competition and make sure that users know why your brand is their best option.\n3) Make the Best of the New Display URL The two new display URL path fields are optional, but you will almost always want to use these. They are excellent places for adding your keywords. If you have a long keyword, you can break it up and use both path fields for your keyword. Otherwise use one field for the keyword and use the other for a call-to-action, especially if you were not able to do this in the description field.\n\nIf you are creating an ad for a keyword containing a competitor name or a trademarked term, you are not allowed to use this keyword in the headlines or the description. But Google does allow you to use such a keyword in the URL path fields. This is the only way that you can get a competitor or trademarked term in your ad copy.\n4) Mobile Ad Guidelines Given that a large chunk of your audience will be using mobile devices to view your ads, you need to make sure that your ad works well on mobile.\nWith standard text ads, Adwords allowed you to create separate mobile ads. However, ETAs don’t differentiate between devices, which means that the same ad and the same copy will be displayed to searchers across all devices. ETAs viewed from a mobile device may have headlines broken up into two lines if they’re too long. Because of this, it is important to format your ads in a way that will work effectively both on desktop and mobile devices.\nThe mobile preview feature in the ad editor will show you how your mobile ad will likely look and you can adjust your copy based on that.\n\n5) A/B Test Your New and Old Format Ads While ETAs may show up for all the keywords in your ad group, they won’t necessarily attract more clicks than your standard text ads. In fact, it’s possible that you may even see a decline in your click through rate (CTR).\nInstead of dropping your old ads right away, try adding ETAs to the same ad groups with old ads that have served you well in the past. Compare the performance of the two, and alter and evolve your ETAs until they match or surpass your standard text ads.\nIn most of our tests though, the expanded text ads have performed significantly better than standard ads. Below are some A/B tests that we have run.\nA/B Test 1: The 2 ETAs below had a combined CTR of 10.9% - an improvement of 26% over the already excellent 8.62% CTR of the old standard text ad during the same timeframe.\n\nA/B Test 2: The ETA below had a CTR of 5.49% - an improvement of 54% over the standard text ad.\n\nA/B Test 3: The ETA below had a CTR of 3.36% - an improvement of 167% over the standard text ad.\n\n6) Increasing Quality Score with ETAs Having a good quality score for your keywords and ads is an absolute must for success with AdWords. In order to achieve high quality scores, you have to ensure that your ads are as relevant as possible to user search queries. It is also important to achieve a high click through rate for your ads, as this provides a direct signal to Google that users are finding your ad useful. There are a few key things to take into account when creating ETAs which will help your quality score.\nYou should always include keywords in your headline as well as the display URL path fields. If you are bidding on a competitor name or trademarked term, and do not use it anywhere in your ad copy, you will get a very low quality score. So it is crucial to add these in the path fields of the display URL as we noted in the last section.\nYou should also use as many ad extensions as possible with your ads. When combined with ETAs, this greatly increases the amount of screen space that you can claim with your ad, leading to high CTRs and high quality scores.\nUse ad extensions to further elaborate on the features, benefits, attributes and offers related to your products and services. Since you likely had to shorten these in your main ad, you can use extensions to fill in the gaps. Also add reviews, ratings, location and call information if you have these available, and they are relevant for your business.\nFor example, consider the ad below that combines an ETA with call, callout, review, and sitelinks (with 2 line descriptions) ad extensions. That’s a significant chunk of Google’s search results page!\n\n7) Changing Old Ads to the New Format If you have a lot of standard text ads in your account, changing them all over to expanded text ads may seem a bit daunting. You can make your job a little easier by adding new ads in bulk.\nYou can download your current ads to a CSV file, make all your changes, and then upload them back to your Adwords account. Using this approach will add new expanded text ads in the same ad groups and campaigns as your current ads. It will not remove any of your current ads. Here’s how you do it.\nExport Your Current Ads Step 1: In your AdWords account, click the Campaigns menu, then click on the Ads tab\nStep 2: Make sure the “All Enabled Ads” option is selected\nStep 3: Click Edit > Download Spreadsheet\n\nStep 4:  Choose Excel .CSV format\nStep 5: Click “Advanced editing” and uncheck all boxes except “All Editable Columns”. Then click Download and save the file on your machine. \n\nMake Changes Step 1: Open the CSV file in Excel\nStep 2: For each ad that you want to create an expanded text ad for, add values in the Headline 1, Headline 2, Description, Path 1 and Path 2 columns. You can use values in the Ad, Description line 1 and Description line 2 columns (in the same row) as a guide since these represent your current ad.\n\nStep 3: Delete the Ad, Description line 1, Description line 2 and Display URL values from the same row.\nStep 4: Go to the Ad Type column and change “Text ad” to “Expanded text ad”\n\nStep 5: Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 for each expanded text ad you want to create. NOTE: If you are new to this process, it will be best if you try and add only one expanded text ad the first time. In this case, you should just delete all rows other than the row you just edited.\nStep 6: Save the file as a CSV\nImport Your New Ads Step 1: In your AdWords account, click the Campaigns menu, then click on the Ads tab\nStep 2: Click Edit > Upload Spreadsheet\nStep 3: Choose the file you saved and click Upload and Preview\n\nStep 4:  Google will now show you the number of ads that will be added. This should be the no. of new expanded text ads that you added in step 2 of the Make Changes section above. If there are any problems with the data you added, it will be shown in this box.\n\nStep 5: Click on Preview changes. Even if you had any errors in step 4 above, you should do this to determine exactly where the problems are.\nStep 6: Verify that each expanded text ad is shown correctly in the preview\n\nStep 7: If everything looks good, click Approve changes to add your new ads. If you see any problems here, click Reject changes. Go back to your CSV file in Excel, fix the problems and then try again. \nConclusion Now that you’ve got a better grasp on expanded text ads and how to use them, you can get started on your own ads. Remember, you don’t want to pause your standard ads just yet—these new processes are going to take a bit of practice before you become an expert.\nThe clock is quickly running out; Google’s last day of standard text ad support is January 31, at which time we’ll all be forced to adopt the new expanded text ad format. Rather than scrambling at the last minute, it’s best to get started now. Work out the kinks and find out the best ad copy that works for you.",

      "text": "Google drops 'Cast' branding in favor of 'Chromecast built-in' It appears to be going with the name you're more likely to recognize. Share Save \nHas that seemingly ubiquitous Google Cast branding on media devices felt uninspiring, or even a bit confusing? Google might just agree with you. The company has been phasing out the Google Cast name over the course of recent weeks, both for its own products as well as supporting hardware from third parties like Toshiba and Vizio . Instead, it's increasingly referring to embedded streaming technology as \" Chromecast built-in.\" To top things off, Google just renamed its @googlecast Twitter account to @chromecast. \nA handful of Google sites, including its Android TV page, still reference Google Cast. It's also less likely to go away for developers. \nBut why the name change now, especially when Google actually moved away from the Chromecast label a while back? We've asked the company for its take. However, it wouldn't be surprising if this is a matter of brand recognition combined with Google's growing hardware ambitions . The odds are that you're more familiar with Chromecast devices than the code that powers them -- \"Chromecast built-in\" gives you a clearer idea of what's possible, and reminds you that Google makes its own streaming gear. From Google Cast ➡ @Chromecast . New name on Twitter, same device you know, stream from and love. pic.twitter.com/MnWEj39GuG ",

      "text": "Brooks Kraft | Getty Images In the runup to the election, President-elect Donald Trump falsely accused Google of manipulating search results to favor Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, demonstrating how little he understands the company's technology and business, said Wall Street analysts. \nWow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media! \n\"We will have a president who does not understand tech, does not understand how these companies work and through a single Tweet could destroy market value,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani.\nPiper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster in a note to investors on Nov. 17 wrote that Trump's suggestion that Google could rig the election doesn't take into account how Google's search algorithms self-regulate, filter results and suggest queries.\n\nNothing has changed about Google parent Alphabet's fundamental business post-election, but investors reacted by dumping tech stocks and investing in sectors Trump seems to favor, said analysts. \n\n\"The Trump administration seems to be more pro-industrials, pro-building, pro-manufacturing and significantly less favored towards technology,\" said Daryanani. \nAlphabet 's stock has rallied the past week after a postelection slump. The stock closed at $785 per share on Tuesday and is trading roughly flat year to date. The shares were down 1 percent midafternoon Thursday at around $777.\nThe vast majority of analysts who cover the stock — 93 percent — recommend buying it, according to Factset and none changed their position since the election. \n\nUnlike Apple , which is headed for a clash with Trump , and Amazon , which the president-elect threatened with \"such problems,\" Google has largely avoided being singled out. \"That's not to say Trump won't go after Google at some point,\" said Daryanani. \nGoogle has 75 percent of the global desktop search engine market, according to Netmarketshare . \n\nHere are some areas where the next administration might effect Alphabet, according to analysts. \n\n\nBeck Diefenbach | Reuters Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 2016. Immigration for high-skilled workers \n\nTrump has said he will clamp down on immigration, raising concerns that he will neglect to increase the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers, a top priority for tech companies . Trump does not mention H-1B visas in his immigration policy . The government currently caps the number of H-1B visas issued each year at 65,000.\nImmigration reform is desperately needed to enable tech companies to hire the world's top engineers and remain competitive, Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said at a conference Nov. 10. \nGoogle is among the top employers of the H-1B temporary visa program and many of the company's U.S. employees are immigrants , including CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet co-founder Sergey Brin . Trump's pick for chief strategist Steve Bannon said there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley in an interview last year.\nRegardless, the 65,000 cap on H-1B visas is mandated by Congress, high-skilled immigration reform is not clearly divided along party lines and Trump's website makes no mention of H-1B visas. \n\nshow chapters Google's Eric Schmidt: New president should be congratulated      Thursday, 10 Nov 2016 | 1:56 PM ET | 00:52 Revolving door and regulation \n\nGoogle has spent $11.85 million in lobbying efforts so far this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics . The company enjoyed unusually close ties with the Obama administration , according to watchdog group Google Transparency Project . Obama named former Googler Megan Smith as the U.S. chief technology officer in 2014.\n\"The Obama administration was very tech friendly and tech savvy,\" said Daryanani. \n\nTrump has expressed his disdain for over-regulation which suggests he could be more friendly to mergers and acquisitions, though he has flip-flopped on the issue. That said, the Federal Communications Commission is also expected to overturn some Obama administration policies that seemed to favor Google in fights with telecoms and cable companies, Reuters reported.\nThe president-elect named Republicans Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison to oversee his telecom policy at the FCC, which is expected to reject Chairman Tom Wheeler's plans to open up the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes, according to Reuters sources . Cable companies opposed the measure, which would allow competition from companies like Google.\nUnder a Trump administration, Obama's net neutrality rules — which require internet service providers to treat all data equally and were championed by internet companies — may be rolled back, analysts speculated. Both Eisenach and Jamison and most Republicans oppose the rules. \nGoogle is facing an antitrust investigation from the European Union. It is unclear how Trump's protectionist proposals, if enacted, could alter sentiment toward U.S. companies and play into the investigation, analysts said. \nGiven Google's European antitrust issues and the potential for new U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust regulations , Trump could get more aggressive in terms of going after large companies like Google, said Daryanani. \n\nTrade and tax \nIt is uncertain how Trump's proposed trade policies could impact Alphabet, said Wedbush analyst James Dix. Trump has said he will raise tariffs on trade and has called on U.S. companies to bring jobs back from abroad. Google and Google-powered devices are made overseas including in China and most of Alphabet's revenue comes from overseas. \nThere is nothing in Trump's tax plan that would hurt Alphabet. In fact, the company stands to benefit. \nThe business tax rate would be reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent, which would bump up Alphabet's net income. Also, Trump has said that he will offer a one-time tax repatriation holiday to allow U.S. companies to bring back overseas profits at a 10 percent tax rate instead of 35 percent under the current law. Alphabet holds $49.7 billion outside the U.S.\n\"We believe, given Google's low levels of debt, this would be deployed via increased share buybacks, consistent with what investors want,\" wrote Munster.\nPrivacy and security \nIn an open letter issued by the Internet Association on Nov. 14, Google and other internet companies called on Trump to protect encryption and curb surveillance during his presidency. Trump does not specifically mention encryption or government surveillance programs on his website, which promises an immediate review of all U.S. cyberdefenses and vulnerabilities. \nThat said, when Apple refused to comply with a court order to de-crypt a terrorist's iPhone for the FBI earlier this year, Trump called for a consumer boycott . Trump's pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions , at the time argued that government must have access to the phone , saying it was \"a more serious issue than Tim Cook understands.\" \nIf Trump continues to weigh on Alphabet's stock, it's a rare opportunity to buy, said analysts.\n\n\"The tech industry is in more control of its own destiny than Donald Trump and will work past these issues, partially offsetting this temporary headwind,\" wrote Munster. \nAlphabet declined to comment for this story. \nA spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— With reporting from CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan and Ari Levy.",

      "text": "Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review: Stumbling out of the gate The first phone with Google's Tango tech is here, but you don't need one. Screen size 6.4 inches From $499 \nI just spent 15 minutes wandering around the office, trying to shoot ghouls in the face with lightning. Before that, I dropped a virtual rococo sofa into the empty space next to my desk, just to see if it would fit. And before that, I measured... well, everything. Welcome to the augmented life, courtesy of Google and Lenovo. Google has spent more than two years taking its \"Tango\" technology from project to full-blown product . The goal: to help our gadgets examine the world around them and overlay information -- or even whole new worlds -- on top of the reality we already know. Along the way, Google tapped Lenovo to help craft the first consumer-ready Tango device: an enormous slab of a phone called the Phab 2 Pro . And now it's here. \nIf the Tango stuff alone didn't make the Phab 2 Pro a groundbreaking device, this is also the first Lenovo-branded smartphone to land in the United States. Too bad it's not quite ready for primetime. Engadget Score First widely available Tango phone Reasonably priced for bleeding-edge tech Excellent battery life if you don't use Tango Reassuring build quality Tango is still a work in progress Huge size could be a deal-breaker Cameras are pretty lousy Lenovo's software is rough around the edges Summary Google's world-sensing Tango technology is finally here, crammed inside Lenovo's Phab 2 new Pro. Alas, the software and the hardware here fall short. The phone itself is well-built and packs an enormous battery, but an oversized body and a pair of lackluster cameras could spoil things for the average user. Then there's Tango. It's brimming with promise, but bugs and performance hiccups keep the tech from reaching its full potential. We're glad the Phab 2 Pro exists and that it might spur the development of improved Tango-enabled hardware, but this phone is best left to early adopters. Hardware \nI can't emphasize this enough: The Phab 2 Pro ($500) is enormous. Then again, how could it be anything but? We have plenty of things to thank for that, from the phone's 6.4-inch IPS LCD screen to the bank of capacitive buttons below it, to the massive 4,050mAh battery under the hood. Of course, the real reason the Phab 2 Pro is so big is because of all the Tango tech Google helped squeeze inside. It's worth remembering that Google's Tango reference device for developers was a tablet with a 7-inch screen, one of NVIDIA's Tegra K1 chipsets and two -- two! -- batteries. \nThat Google and Lenovo managed to squeeze all the requisite bits into a mostly pocketable smartphone is a feat unto itself. There are, after all, plenty of non-standard parts here. Just look at the Phab 2's back if you don't believe me. Nestled between the 16-megapixel camera and the fingerprint sensor are two more cameras -- one has an infrared emitter to determine how far things are from the phone, and the other is a wide-angle camera with a fisheye lens that works as part of Tango's motion tracking system. Turns out, Lenovo had to punch a hole in the phone's main circuit board to make room for all those sensors. \nThose cameras and sensors work in tandem with a customized version of Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 652 processor. We've seen more conventional versions of this mid-range chip pop up in devices like ASUS's new ZenFone , but the version we have here has been tuned to more accurately timestamp the data captured by all of the phone's sensors. Why? To keep the phone's location in lockstep with all the crazy AR stuff you'll see on screen. Also onboard are 4GB of RAM, an Adreno 510 GPU, 64GB of storage, a micro-USB port and a tray that takes either two SIM cards or a SIM card and a microSD card as big as 128GB.

The last time I played with a non-Phab phone this big was three years ago, when Sony launched a version of its Xperia Z Ultra running a clean version Android in the Google Play Store. Since then, the market has coalesced around big smartphones with screens about 5.5 inches big. Years of similarly sized devices, then, means the Phab 2 Pro feels extra unwieldy. \nIt would've been more of a problem if Lenovo hadn't done such a good job putting the Phab 2 Pro together; the body is carved out of a single block of aluminum and the screen is covered by a sheet of Gorilla Glass that's ever-so-slightly curved around the edges for that subtle \"2.5D\" effect everyone seems to love. The aesthetic is pleasant enough if you're into minimalist design, and big-phone fans are probably going to drool too. If you're thinking of getting one, though, best if you can get hands-on before taking the plunge. Display and sound \nThe 6.4-inch screen on the Phab 2 Pro is indeed massive, but mostly unremarkable. Lenovo went with an \"assertive\" IPS LCD screen, which basically means the panel can optimize colors and contrast on the pixel level. It's a handy trick for when you're traipsing around outdoors -- it's excellent under direct sunlight -- but the screen is otherwise forgettable. \nDon't get me wrong: Its 2,560 x 1,440 resolution means it's still plenty crisp, even if it isn't as pixel dense as other devices because of how big the panel is. Color reproduction is accurate too, though it'll definitely feel a little flat if you're coming from a device with an AMOLED screen like the Galaxy S7. What's more, brightness is respectable -- this screen is just a touch dimmer than the iPhone 7 Plus' -- and viewing angles are also pretty great. I half-expected the screen to be worse since it would have been a likely place for Lenovo to cut corners on a $500 phone. \nThe sound quality lags behind screen quality, but that's no surprise. The Phab 2 Pro has a single speaker carved into its bottom edge, which makes for anemic, muddy sounding music, with bass notes utterly lacking in oomph. It's fine for sound effects in Tango-enabled games, but headphones are otherwise a must. It helps that the Phab 2 Pro ships with a Dolby Atmos app that launches automatically when headphones are plugged in. Included are presets for music, movies, games and voices (say, for podcasts), and in general they added a decent amount of oomph to my audio. Music in particular felt a little punchier and more expansive, though the results seemed to vary from song to song. Software \nMotorola has long been a fan of near-stock Android , and I'm glad its parent company Lenovo seems just as fond of it. The Phab 2 Pro ships with a build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow that has been left almost completely untouched. Seriously, there are no extra widgets, no visual junk, no bloatware. If you put the Tango-specific stuff aside, there are but a few add-ons: an app for simple file sharing, another for cloud backups, a sound recorder, a Dolby Atmos app for audio tuning and Accuweather. The rest of Lenovo's work on the software front is much subtler, and largely meant to make using such a big phone easier. \nRather than picking up the phone to see what time it is, for instance, you can toggle an option to wake the device by double-tapping the screen. Still another option causes the lock screen's PIN input pad and the phone's dialer pad to slide to the left or right depending on how the Phab 2 is tilted so you don't have to stretch your thumbs across the screen. Gallery: Lenovo Phab 2 Pro software tour | 15 Photos 15 +11 \nAnd if you're in luck if you've been looking for a smarter alternative to the traditional home button. There's an option for a floating on-screen button that provides quick access to all three traditional Android navigation keys, plus the screen lock, calculator, audio recorder and flashlight. I don't know about you, but I don't need to whip out a calculator all that often, so the inability to change any of those shortcuts is a little frustrating. You can add a second page of app shortcuts too, though the resulting grid of icons looks pretty ugly. \nLenovo's light touch with software is appreciated, but it's far from perfect. Certain apps (here's looking at you, Gmail) offer notifications that are hard to read because some of the text is too dark against the translucent gray notification shade. The problem is even worse when you're using a dark wallpaper, and surprise: a good chunk of the included wallpapers, including the one that's on by default, do indeed fall into that category. Life with Tango \nAs I write this, there are 35 Tango apps available in the Google Play Store, and broadly speaking they fall into one of two categories: tools and games. I'm not going to dissect all of them -- not unless you all really, really want me to -- but there are recurring themes across these apps that speak to the larger experience of living with Tango. \nDespite all the whimsical, weird stuff we've seen Tango do in the past, Google is making it clear the tech can help you get stuff done too. The Phab 2 Pro ships with Google's Measure app, for one, which does exactly what its name suggests. Fire up the app, point at something, tap to drop an anchor, then tap to drop an anchor at that something's endpoint. Congratulations, you just measured something without having to grab a tape measure. The Lowe's Vision app has a similar trick, and when Tango's sensors cooperate, the results can be very accurate indeed. \nThat's definitely not a given, though. Let's say you're measuring the edge of a box or a desk. The depth sensor sometimes has trouble figuring out where the edge begins, and you have to maneuver just right to tap on the correct spot. (To Google's credit, Measure says it offers estimates instead of hard numbers.) \nTango recurring theme #1: The Phab 2 Pro occasionally fails at figuring out what it's pointed at, even in bright conditions. \nSpeaking of, we've seen Lowe's app used in Tango demos for ages now. In fact, the Phab 2 Pro will even be sold in select Lowe's stores. Even so, it's still fun filling an empty room with virtual ovens, sofas and end tables. Online retailer Wayfair has a similar app, which generally seems to work much better; the dressers and couches and cabinets I've dropped into the world around me were faster to load and didn't randomly appear right on top of me as in the Lowe's app. In fact, the Wayfair app is a joy to use at least partially because it doesn't try to do too much -- just plop furniture down and that's it. Same goes for Amazon's Product Preview app, which lets you see how different TVs would look on your wall. It does one thing, and does it well. \nTango recurring theme #2: When it comes to augmented reality apps, the simpler the better. \nTango's tools aren't just about seeing how junk fits in your home, by the way. One of my early favorites is Signal Mapper, which prompts you to wander around and visualize how strong your WiFi signal is (future versions will support cellular networks too). Keep at it long enough and you're left with a signal strength heat map that doubles as a rough blueprint of... wherever you happened to be. Then there are apps like Cydalion, meant to help the visually impaired get around more easily. In brief, these apps provide audio and touch feedback when they start getting too close to a nearby object. \nTango recurring theme #3: The technology might not be perfect yet, but the potential here is just astounding. \nSo yes, there are plenty of Tango utilities for you to play with. But let's be real: The first thing I did after receiving the Phab 2 Pro was load up a handful of games. As it turns out, though, games are where Tango's shortcomings become most apparent. We've seen some of these augmented reality games before, like Domino World , which scans your surroundings and lets you build convoluted structures out of those tiny tiles. But there's a tendency for the app to think a flat surface like a tabletop goes on longer than it does, so you'll often build a long string of dominos that jut out the air, just waiting to be knocked over. \nOther games, like Woorld , are heavier on the whimsy. Designed in part by Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi, Woorld turns the space around you into a playground where the only real goal is figuring out how to find new pieces -- like a sun, clouds, sprouts and picnic tables -- to add your tiny domain. It's cute, it's fun and I blew the better part of an afternoon on it. Woorld is, by the way, the one game I played that really threw the Phab 2 Pro for a loop. It was the second time I had fired up the game, and less than 10 minutes after I started plopping cottages and clouds and sprouts on a conference room desk, the real-world view provided by the RGB camera nearly ground to a halt. \nI'm not exactly sure what caused the issue -- maybe a memory leak somewhere -- but it hasn't happened again. Suffice to say, this sort of laggy behavior was an exception, not the rule. I'm actually still surprised that the Phab 2 Pro performed these AR tasks as well as it did, but I probably shouldn't have been: This phone was supposed to launch at the end of the summer, and it's clear Google and Lenovo used the extra time to to tighten up \nEven so, the software is buggy. Playing Phantogeist , the ghost-blasting game I mentioned in the beginning of this review, was great until said ghost spookily hunkered down inside a wall, rendering my lightning-gun-thing useless. When it wandered back into the field, I nuked it from a distance and continued doing that to all its nasty, non-corporeal friends. \nTango recurring theme #4: When everything works the way it's supposed to, Tango can feel like magic. \nThese past two years have turned Tango into a functional product, but it's a long way from seamlessly good. There were, however, plenty of those moments where everything came together just so and I felt I like I was playing with a tricorder pulled out of storage on the USS Enterprise. Some of these issues will be addressed in future Tango hardware -- Google's Tango program lead Johnny Lee has said more is coming -- but here's hoping software fixes patch up some of these early troubles. The potential benefits are just too great to give up on. Camera \nSince the Phab 2 Pro's 16-megapixel camera plays such an important role in making Tango's augmented reality work, you'd think Lenovo would've chosen a top-flight sensor. Not quite, but it has its moments. When the conditions are right -- by which I mean there's plenty of light -- the camera yields detailed shots with colors that are mostly true to life. Pro tip: You'll probably want HDR mode on all the time to give your photos a dose of verve that would otherwise be missing. \nMy biggest gripe so far has been the finicky autofocus, an issue that only gets more bothersome in low light. Our office already has a Christmas tree in the lobby, and it posed no problem for the iPhone 7 Plus or the Galaxy S7 . The Phab 2 Pro, on the other hand, refused to lock onto the tree no matter how many times I tapped to focus on the screen. This doesn't happen all the time, but it's a pervasive enough issue that Lenovo should really issue a software update to address it. \nI wish I could say the 8-megapixel front camera was better, but it has a lot of trouble accurately rendering colors in selfies. Take me, for example: Around this time of year I'm sort of a pale, milky coffee color, an observation backed up by selfies taken with the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S7. For reasons beyond comprehension, though, the Phab 2 Pro's front camera made me a deep orange-brown. That's with the face-smoothing mode off and everything else set to auto too. Seriously disappointing, Lenovo. Gallery: Lenovo Phab 2 Pro camera samples | 23 Photos 23 +19 \nThe camera app itself isn't much to write home about, either. Sure, there might not be much in way of manual controls, but there are eight scene modes, a \"touchup\" mode for cleaning up your face in selfies and some basic white balance and exposure controls. The thing is, they're tucked away inside a settings menu making them easy to miss. It's just bad design. (Then again, looking at the interface Lenovo slapped together, is another bit of bad design really a surprise?) \nSince the Phab 2 Pro is all about augmenting reality, it's no shock that there's an AR mode within the camera app too. Tapping the AR button brings up a live view of what's in front of you (duh) along with options to turn that space into some sort of bizarre fairy garden (complete with freaky child-fairy) or a playground for a kitty, a puppy or a chubby, oddly designed dragon. Sound familiar? These sorts of AR tricks figured prominently in Sony smartphones like the Xperia X line , where they were just as hokey. They're good for a chuckle or two, but the novelty doesn't last long (unless you have kids). At least the Phab 2 Pro does a better job dispelling the heat that tends to build up during intense AR kitty play sessions. Performance and battery life \nWe've already established that, beyond the occasional hiccup, the Phab 2 Pro can keep Tango apps running at a decent clip. But what about everything else? Even though the Snapdragon 625 is specifically tuned for Tango, the Phab 2 Pro should be able to handle most people's daily routines without issue. My days, for instance, are filled with lots of frantic app launching and multitasking; I'm constantly bouncing between Slack, Outlook, Spotify, Trello, Twitter, Instagram, Soundcloud and more for hours on end. \nThe Phab 2 Pro took that mild insanity like a champ, with occasional stutters punctuating long stretches of smoothness. Not bad. If your day features a lot of hardcore gaming, however, you might want to look elsewhere. Graphically intense games like Asphalt 8 (with the visual settings cranked to the max) sometimes proved to be a little much for the Phab 2 Pro. In other words, don't freak out if you see the occasional jerkiness or dropped frame. Though this is an important device, you're not exactly getting flagship-level power. Google Pixel",

I could do that — they do the same thing I do.’ ”\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Tiger Shaw, who runs the US Ski Team, wants that exact scene to play out again, a thousand times over, when the first World Cup skiing event in New England in 25 years is held at Killington in Vermont this weekend.\n“So many people say their exposure to ski racing is watching the Olympics or a World Cup, and then saying, ‘That’s what I want to do,’ ” said Shaw, president and CEO of the US Ski and Snowboard Association. “We’re hoping that happens with thousands of kids at Killington.”\nKillington’s women’s giant slalom and slalom events will be the first World Cup races in New England since Waterville Valley hosted the World Cup finals in 1991. Parisien won the women’s giant slalom that day, and it remains one of her most treasured victories because in addition to being a breakthrough both personally and for the US ski team — “Parisien takes giant step for US skiers” was the Globe’s headline — it was basically a home win.\nAP file photo\nJulie Parisien was 19 when she posted her first World Cup victory, at Waterville Valley in 1991.\nAdvertisement\n“It was like a family get-together race,” said Parisien, a registered nurse who lives in Maine with her husband, Tim Nuce, and their four children. “It was a beautiful spring day, and it was like I was meant to win here because everybody’s here to see me win.”\nSince Parisien’s Waterville victory, the Northeast has produced some of US skiing’s biggest names, such as New Hampshire native Bode Miller and Burke Mountain Academy’s Mikaela Shiffrin, who will be among the favorites to win at Killington. But their grandest stages have been elsewhere, from the Rockies to Europe and beyond.\nGlobe archive\nThe Globe’s article following Parisien’s victory in 1991.\nThere’s no clear-cut reason for World Cup ski racing’s absence from New England. Instead, it’s been a combination of factors: ski racing politics, areas tending to hang on to their events, and extremely high costs associated with putting on an event.\n“It’s about time. We have so many fabulous mountains here,” Parisien said. “We’ve had so many athletes from the Northeast that I think people would have loved to have seen. They really should have had a men’s event at some point here.”\nCannon held the first New England World Cup in 1967, and others have been at Sugarloaf, Stratton, and Waterville Valley. Some of ski racing’s biggest names have recorded victories in New England, including Jean-Claude Killy, Ingemar Stenmark, Tamara McKinney, Vreni Schneider, Alberto Tomba, and Phil and Steve Mahre.\nAP file photo\nTamara McKinney (center) won three World Cup events at Waterville Valley in the 1980s.\nSince taking over as head of the USSA in 2014, Shaw — who is from Vermont, went to college at Dartmouth, and was a distinguished ski racer himself — has been interested in increasing ski racing’s exposure in New England as he searches for and develops new talent. This weekend is a logical step in that effort, he said.\n“It moves it into the stratosphere because of the proximity of so many ski racers and resorts,’’ he said. “So many people are coming. It’s going to have a big impact.”\nYears ago, another accomplished skier saw what Shaw is looking for. Stenmark, the legendary slalom and giant slalom specialist from Sweden, was among the many internationals to attend the same World Juniors at Sugarloaf as the Parisiens.\nJulie Parisien said her parents tell a story about riding a chairlift with Stenmark and talking about ski racing.\n“I remember the story of him saying, ‘I’ve been watching all these little kids skiing here and this is such a great mountain, and such a difficult mountain, and there are some very, very good skiers,’ ” she said.\nHer parents then informed Stenmark that their four children were among the young skiers he’d seen.\n“And Stenmark says something like, ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if they make it onto the US ski team,’ ’’ Parisien said.\nNew England’s World Cup history Past New England World Cup skiing events, with event winners (S — slalom; GS — giant slalom; D — downhill):\n1 967, Cannon Mountain : Marielle Goitschel (S); Christine Beranger (GS); Isabelle Mir (D); Jean-Claude Killy (S, GS, D).\n1969, Waterville Valley : Kiki Cutter (S); Bernadette Rauter (GS); Jean-Noel Augert (S); Dumeng Giovanoli (GS).\n1971, Sugarloaf : Michelle Jacot (GS); Annemarie Moser-Proell (D); Gustavo Thoeni (GS); Stefano Anzi (D); Bernhard Russi (D).\n1978, Waterville Valley : Lise-Marie Morerod (GS); Andreas Wenzel (GS).\n1978, Stratton : Perrine Pelen (S); Hanni Wenzel (GS); Steve Mahre (S); Phil Mahre (GS).\n1980, Waterville Valley : Perrine Pelen (S); Hanni Wenzel (GS); Ingemar Stenmark (S); Hans Enn (GS).\n1982, Waterville Valley : Ursula Konzett (S); Irene Epple (GS).\n1983, Waterville Valley : Roswitha Steiner (S); Tamara McKinney (GS).\n1984, Waterville Valley : Tamara McKinney (S, GS).\n1985, Waterville Valley : Tamara McKinney (S); Vreni Schneider (GS).\n*1986, Waterville Valley : Roswitha Steiner (S); Vreni Schneider (GS).\n**1986, Waterville Valley : Erika Hess (S); Vreni Schneider (GS).\n1989, Waterville Valley : Alberto Tomba (S); Urs Kaelin (GS).\n1991, Waterville Valley : Pernilla Wiberg (S); Julie Parisien (GS); Thomas Fogdoe (S); Alberto Tomba (GS).\n*-spring; **-fall; sources: FIS-Ski.com; Boston Globe\nKillington World Cup schedule Giant slalom: Saturday, 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.\nSlalom: Sunday, 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.\nTV: Saturday and Sunday, NBC, 3 p.m. Follow Matt Pepin on Twitter at @mattpep15 .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Christina Prignano Globe staff November 23, 2016\nWhether it was senioritis or simply because he isn’t running for reelection, President Obama did not appear to worry about what anyone thought of his pun-heavy final Thanksgiving turkey pardon Wednesday.\nObama (or perhaps his speechwriters) managed to get several turkey or Thanksgiving-related puns into his remarks as he and his two nephews declared turkeys Tater and Tot spared from the holiday table.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s a roundup of the best puns:\nOn his final year as president: “Malia and Sasha, by the way, are thankful that this is my final presidential turkey pardon. What I haven’t told them yet is that we are going to do this every year from now on. No cameras. Just us. Every year. No way I’m cutting this habit cold turkey.”\nOn the turkeys of Thanksgivings past: Get Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

Sign up for more newsletters here “And it is my great privilege — well, it’s my privilege — actually, let’s just say it’s my job to grant them clemency this afternoon. As I do, I want to take a moment to recognize the brave turkeys who weren’t so lucky, who didn’t get to ride the gravy train to freedom who met their fate with courage and sacrifice — and proved that they weren’t chicken.”\nOn the spirit of the holiday: View Story Obama pardons his final Thanksgiving turkey President Obama is getting the holiday mood started at the White House with the traditional pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.\n“So, later today, the Obama family will participate in our traditional Thanksgiving service project. And when somebody at your table tells you that you’ve been hogging all the side dishes and you can’t have any more, I hope you respond with a creed that sums up the spirit of a hungry people: Yes, We Cran. That was good. You don’t think that’s funny? Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I’m doing this, so we’re not leaving any room for leftovers.”\nOn holiday traffic: “And so let’s get on with the pardoning because it’s Wednesday afternoon and everyone knows that Thanksgiving traffic can put people in a fowl mood.”\nChristina Prignano can be reached at christina.prignano@globe.com .

      "title": "Five Trump business ties that pose conflicts",
      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nPresident-elect Donald Trump waved as he arrived at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in New Jersey this past weekend.\nBy Bernard Condon Associated Press November 23, 2016\nNEW YORK — After Ivanka Trump appeared on CBS’s ‘‘60 Minutes’’ wearing a $10,800 bracelet from her jewelry line, someone at her company sent photos from the interview to fashion writers to drum up free publicity. A firestorm of criticism erupted over the impropriety of profiting off the presidency, and the company apologized.\nIf only the bracelet brouhaha was the end of it.\nAdvertisement\nExperts on government ethics are warning President-elect Donald Trump that he’ll never shake suspicions of a clash between his private interests and the public good if he doesn’t sell off his vast holdings, which include roughly 500 companies in more than a dozen countries. They say just the appearance of conflicts is likely to tie up the new administration in investigations, lawsuits, and squabbles, stoked perhaps by angry Oval Office tweets.\n‘‘People are itching to sue Donald Trump and stick him under oath,’’ said Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here In an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, Trump insisted that the ‘‘law’s totally on my side,’’ and ethics experts agree that federal conflicts of interest rules largely exempt the president from running his businesses the way he pleases while in office. His company, The Trump Organization, had no comment on the conflicts issue, other than a statement reiterating its plans to transfer control of the company to three of the president-elect’s adult children.\nPainter doesn’t think that goes far enough. In a letter to Trump last week, he joined watchdog groups and ethics lawyers from both Democratic and Republican administrations in predicting ‘‘rampant, inescapable’’ conflicts that will engulf the new administration if the president-elect does not liquidate his business holdings.\nA look at five areas where conflicts may arise:\nNEW HOTEL\nAdvertisement\nFor use of the government-owned Old Post Office for his new Washington hotel, Trump agreed on annual rent to the government in a contract that was signed more than three years ago.\nSo what possibly could be the problem now?\nPlenty, according to Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University who has studied the contract. In addition to base rent, the president-elect agreed to additional annual payments based on various financial measures of how well the hotel is doing. Schooner says such payments typically require drawn out negotiations each year.\n‘‘How can anyone expect a government employee to negotiate with the Trump family at arm’s length and treat the Trump family like any other contractor?’’ Schooner asks.\nSchooner thinks Trump should terminate the contract because, even if the Trump family acts honorably, the appearance a conflict will spread doubt throughout the contracting system. Federal rules prohibit government employees and elected officials from striking contracting deals with the government for just this reason, though the president is exempted.\n‘‘The U.S. government pays over $400 billion in contracts a year,’’ Schooner says. ‘‘Why should other contractors have to follow the rule if the President of the United States doesn’t have to?’’\nAs president, Trump will have the authority to appoint a new head to the General Services Administration, the federal agency that signed the lease with Trump and will negotiate the rent each year.\nBusiness at the hotel could get a lift if foreign dignitaries decide to stay at the new hotel to curry favor with the new president.\nIn addition to the Washington hotel, Trump Organization leases land from some local governments, including for a golf course in New York City and one in Florida.\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\nTrump’s extensive operations abroad raise the possibility that his foreign policy could be shaped by his business interests, and vice versa. Trump has struck real estate deals in South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Uruguay, Panama, India and Turkey, among other countries.\nIn June, Turkish media reported that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for Trump’s name to be removed from the Trump Towers in Istanbul because of what Erdogan characterized as anti-Muslim comments by the candidate. A NATO member, Turkey is a key ally in fighting the Islamic State group in Syria.\nIn India, the newspaper Economic Times reported that Trump held a meeting in New York a week after his election with business partners who put up the Trump Towers Pune in the western part of the country. The president-elect also has a Trump-branded residential tower in nearly Mumbai with another company.\nKenneth Gross, head of political law at the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, says Trump’s business ties will raise suspicions that he is getting special deals abroad because he is president, and that this runs the risk of violating the Emolument Clause. That is a section of the U.S. Constitution that forbids public officials from receiving gifts from foreign governments and foreign-controlled companies without the consent of Congress.\n‘‘He can’t avoid conflicts,’’ said Gross, ‘‘unless he sells his assets.’’\nTRUMP LENDER\nOne of Trump’s biggest lenders is Deutsche Bank, a German giant in settlement negotiations with the Department of Justice on its role in the mortgage blowup that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. The hit to Deutsche could be substantial, with the government reportedly demanding $14 billion.\nWill a Justice Department under Trump go easy on the bank? It’s not clear anyone will know. Trump will nominate the head of that agency, too.\nOne possible response is for Trump to make sure the Deutsche case is handled by career civil servants at Justice, and any appointee like the Attorney General is recused. A career civil servant doesn’t have to worry about being fired if he goes against Trump’s wishes, but may still worry about displeasing bosses connected to the president.\nMore than 300 positions at Justice are currently held by presidential appointees.\nTAX AUDIT\nThe odds that the IRS will rule against Trump may be no different than before he was elected, but it’s difficult to know for sure.\nTrump has cited a long running audit by the Internal Revenue Service in refusing to release his tax returns. If he is under scrutiny, it’s not surprising. In his Oct. 9 debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump confirmed he used a $916 million loss in 1995 to avoid paying federal taxes for years.\nThe president nominates the commissioner of the IRS who, assuming the Senate approves, serves for five years.\nTrump will also get to make appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, which rules on labor disputes. In July, the board ruled against Trump in a case involving workers trying to unionize at the Trump Hotel Las Vegas. The Trump Organization lists six other hotels in the U.S. on its website.\nFLURRY OF LAWSUITS\nTrump said Friday that he agreed to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits alleging fraud at his Trump University so he could focus on preparing for his presidency. But this could also bring problems, as Trump himself has acknowledged previously.\n‘‘When you start settling cases, you know what happens?’’ the president-elect said earlier this year. ‘‘Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler.’’\nPainter, the ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, predicts the political divide in Washington is going to make things worse.\n‘‘The plaintiff’s lawyers are going to get in there because they can get a good settlement, and Trump’s political enemies are going to egg it on,’’ says Painter. ‘‘You put that all together and you’re going to have a lot of potential for litigation.’’\nPainter says Trump should sell his ownership stakes to minimize the danger the new president gets distracted by lawsuits. He adds, though, that this is just a partial fix. The famously litigious Trump already is facing numerous lawsuits.\nAsked to sum up his view on Trump’s situation, Painter replies, ‘‘A mess, a mess.’’",

      "title": "Journalists report Google warnings about ‘government-backed attackers’",
      "text": "November 23 at 4:26 PM Follow @ErikWemple Several journalists Wednesday reported receiving notifications from Google about “government-backed attackers” attempting to steal their passwords. Julia Ioffe, a prominent magazine writer who did a much-trafficked profile of Melania Trump this year, is among those who have received this particular alert.\nContacted about the matter, Ioffe passed along screenshots of the Google missives:\nEzra Klein, editor in chief of Vox, tweeted out his encounter with the alert:\nWell, this is a scary message to get from Google: pic.twitter.com/ZgUIft54h5\n— Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) November 23, 2016\nAs did Greg Ferenstein of the Ferenstein Wire :\nwell, that's interesting: pic.twitter.com/Dj1Kd7s23d\n— Greg Ferenstein (@ferenstein) November 23, 2016\nGarance Franke-Ruta of Yahoo News responded to Ferenstein:\n@ferenstein I got the same thing today and so did several others I know\n— Garance Franke-Ruta (@thegarance) November 23, 2016\nThese notices arrive just as journalists and digerati everywhere are freaking out about whether they can ever again share a candid thought over email and other forms of electronic communication. While journalists generally spend presidential election campaigns scrutinizing candidates, 2016 saw their own conduct come under scrutiny via hacked emails posted on WikiLeaks. Such correspondence between reporters and the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee showed reporters engaged in embarrassing forms of favor-currying behavior. The director of national intelligence’s office and homeland security department issued a statement pointing the finger at a foreign power: “The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.”\nJust last week, the New York Times convened a large meeting for its journalists on how to deal with safety and security threats on the Internet and non-Internet.\nKlein tells the Erik Wemple Blog that he’s preparing to check with Google on the matter. This latest development comes after a campaign season in which Klein received anti-Semitic abuse, along with his colleagues at Vox — “everyone at Vox got anti-Semitic [mail] sent to their homes,” he reports. Yet Klein cautions that he doesn’t have “reason to think these things are related.” More: “I read Google’s message much more as Russian or Chinese or Iranian or [pick your country] is trying to affect US politics by hacking the accounts of journalists. But that’s just my read – I have no real info here.”\nAs for Ioffe, she filed a police report over the anti-Semitic abuse that followed her GQ profile of Melania Trump . When this blog asked her whether she’d checked with Google on this matter, she replied via email, “No. I have actual work to do. F[—] these guys. They’re tangling with the wrong Jewess. And you can Quote: me on that.” She also passed along a link to this tweet:\nHow shocking and unpredictable: Trump wins the election, and Moscow becomes exponentially more brazen.\n— Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) November 23, 2016\nA spokesperson for Google indicated that the screen shot shared by Klein on Twitter appeared authentic, as did the one sent to this blog by Ioffe. The company issued this statement:\nSince 2012, we’ve notified users when we believe their Google Accounts are being targeted by government-backed attackers. We send these warnings out of an abundance of caution — they do not indicate that a user’s account has already been compromised or that a more widespread attack is occurring when they receive the notice. Anyone that receives one should follow the instructions in the warning, and we further recommend that all users routinely do a Google Account Security Checkup at g.co/securitycheckup[g.co] .",

      "text": "The White House Releases Paper On What It Wants To Do With AI \nWhen I warn about the robot apocalypse, no one takes me seriously. But they really need to start. Google’s DeepMind, which is currently one of the world’s most advanced machine learning systems, has just racked up another incredible win, this time against an expert in lip-reading . \nThat might not sound that special, it’s not a cut-throat game of chess, for example, but it really is astonishing. That’s because the advanced pattern and particular facial recognition is one of the most complex cognitive processes humans can do. It’s also what nearly one-quarter of our brain mass is dedicated to. Now that we’ve lost this to the machines, it’s only a matter of time before they replace us. \nResearchers at Oxford University helped with the tests. The human lip-reader and DeepMind watched and analyzed hours of BBC broadcasts and then each gave their best estimation of what was said. \nThe squishy meat-bag only got 12.4 percent of its words correct, while DeepMind managed an impeccable 46 percent. It’s worth noting that the human regularly analyzes security footage and provides testimony in court. So… that’s comforting. \nTo be fair, this is awesome for a lot of reasons. Google will likely try to implement this recognition into its Google Now service so that it can use visual recognition to supplement speech analysis. It could also be a boon for the hearing impaired, provided easier and more universal access to basic services. And I’d be remiss to hand-wave that away. But, this is another nail in humanity’s coffin. Robots are already mastering driving; they can even paint and compose music. They can even write their own code, which is essentially the entire point of machine learning systems like DeepMind. And while that’s really cool from a “Wow, look at that!” perspective, we really need to shore up our defenses against the bots if we want to survive the next few decades. After all, top minds like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are terrified of the potential of AI. \nI’m warning you: you need to get ready now. Or you could be an idiot and invite something like Google’s Home or the Amazon Echo . But seriously. Don’t do it. You’re basically inviting the AI INTO YOUR HOUSE. Share",

      "title": "Nextcloud: an Open-source Dropbox, Google Drive Alternative",
      "text": "By Kristi Progri November 23, 2016 \nIt’s Open Source Week at SitePoint! All week we’re publishing articles focused on everything Open Source, Free Software and Community, so keep checking the OSW tag for the latest updates. \nFile storage services like Dropbox , Google Drive and OneDrive are very popular these days. They automatically sync your files to the cloud and across your various devices, making your data highly accessible and ensuring that it’s not easily lost. \nThey offer a certain amount of free storage, but if you’re looking to store most or all of your files online, you’ll need to pay for them. Their fees are not particularly high, but still, it would be nice to have a free alternative. \nFortunately, there are alternatives. One of them is Nextcloud , an open-source alternative to Dropbox and the others that you install and maintain on your own server . \nLet’s take a look at some of the reasons to consider using Nextcloud. What’s Wrong with the Big Players? \nIt’s reasonable to ask why we should bother setting up something on our own server when services like Dropbox and Drive are so easy to use. They’re basically plug-and-play, and are supported and maintained by large companies that have a stake in providing a secure and reliable service. \nThey do have downsides, though. Of course, there are the fees, which are fixed, not tailored to everyone’s needs, and could change at any time. \nBy using them, you’re also entrusting your data to companies that don’t entirely deserve your trust . They can mess with your data at any time, if they so choose, as highlighted in Apple’s terms and conditions : \nApple reserves the right at all times to determine whether Content is appropriate … and may pre-screen, move, refuse, modify and/or remove Content at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion … \nThey could, of course, just shut down. (That doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.) They can also get bought out. Remember Sunrise calendar? Exactly what they did with their calendar app when Microsoft bought them. Taking Back Control \nNextcloud is a cloud software alternative that gives you full control over your data. It’s designed for both individuals and organizations with many users. It’s a relatively young project, being a fork of the similar ownCloud project, which is also worth checking out and comparing. \nHaving control of your own data is pretty attractive, but how does Nextcloud stack up against the commercial players in other ways, such as features and security? Let’s take a look. Security & custom two-factor authentication (2FA) \nOn the security side, Nextcloud provides documentation to explain security best practices. Unsafe or controversial functions are strictly refused, and mandatory code is reviewed by two more reviewers to make sure that everything is bulletproof (or as much as it can get). \nFurthermore, the Nextcloud authentication system is two factored. Active sessions can be invalidated through the list, by removing the user in the admin settings or by changing passwords. Admins can enable or disable two-factor authentication for users on the command line. \nWhile other proprietary services like Dropbox offer 2FA as well, Nextcloud allows you to “force” enable or disable 2FA for specific members of the organization. With a little bit of tweaking, you can also create your own 2FA provider, to avoid being locked in with a specific 2FA app. Huge advantage for those concerned with security here. Encryption \nNextcloud also offers server-side encryption, which is not enabled out of the box (to offer a better user experience for newcomers). Nextcloud servers encrypt remote data, but your local storage operates without encryption by default. It’s important to be aware that the encryption does increase the file size by 35%, which isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker if you’re concerned about security. \nNote: Once enabled, server-side encryption cannot be disabled within the admin dashboard. So be sure to back up user encryption keys regularly. If a key is lost, that data cannot be accessed anymore. Federation Sharing \nAnother feature Nextcloud offers is Federation Sharing , which mounts file shares from remote Nextcloud servers (or other servers which support it, such as ownCloud-powered servers) to create your own cluster of clouds. Imagine this as Folders in Dropbox or Google Drive you are invited to collaborate and have access to. However, in this case it’s using an open protocol, which is compatible with many other providers (such as ownCloud). Mounted Shares will give you direct access to the Folder you are invited to, so your server space won’t be used up for your own copy of files. Image courtesy of Nextcloud \nThis allows for decentralized file sharing, no matter where the data is stored, with flexible admin privileges to set individual user permissions. You can use a Federated Cloud ID to share files with fellow Nextclouders based on your username (for example: username@example.com/nextcloud ). Server Information App Image courtesy of Nextcloud \nWith the server information app you can also check the performance of your Nextcloud Server. This can come in handy for troubleshooting or making improvements on your server. The app is part of the Nextcloud installation, so you don’t need to install anything manually to use it. It lets you track: CPU load and memory usage number of active users over time number of shares in various categories storage statistics server settings like PHP version, database type and size, memory limits and more. Installing Nextcloud on your own server \nIt’s surprisingly easy to install a Nextcloud instance on your own server, regardless if it’s a shared host or if you have root access to it. We won’t go too deep into the process here, but if you’re not comfortable with the command line, there are also user-friendly drag-and-drop options. (This makes sense, as a solid open-source alternative preferably won’t scare the average user away.) \nCheck out the brief installation instructions to install your very own personal cloud instance. It shouldn’t take your more than a few minutes as the process is pretty straightforward. \nAfter that, you might want to install a client for your desktop or mobile , which will be able to access your Nextcloud instance. There’s one available for every platform, and you can even use any other WebDAV client (such as ownCloud) to access your Nextcloud instance. \nNextcloud gives users a wide range of opportunities to customize it based on their needs. Nextcloud Apps work like browser extensions, except that some of them enable core functionalities (such as Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.). You can try developing your own apps as well. Nextcloud Box Image courtesy of Nextcloud \nTo cater to users who want more control over their data, without going through the hassle of system administration, Nextcloud partnered with Canonical and WDLabs to come up with the Nextcloud box , a private cloud and IoT solution for home users . The box is made of a WDLabs’s 1 TB USB3 hard drive powered by a Raspberry Pi 2. Snappy Ubuntu Core is the default operating system installed on the microSD card. On the server side, it runs with the Apache web server, MySQL, and the latest Nextcloud version. \nThe box serves as a small local server for your home network. By default, the Nextcloud Box only works on the network it’s connected to (like your home LAN). It requires configuration of encryption (https) and router ports to reach it from outside your home network. \nSome use cases the Nextcloud box could fit right into would be a shared local network within a family, where everyone has access from every device. It seems to be also a solid jumpstart for small startups or teams to use within their physical space to share files with each other. A big plus point here is that one would actually know where their data is in physical space, rather in some big data center of Amazon in the desert. However, the box is not an all-round solution, but rather a reference device to show off Nextcloud’s capabilities. \nThe Nextcloud box sets you back $80 (Raspberry Pi 2 not included) and can be ordered from the Nextcloud website. Upcoming Nextcloud features \nNextcloud 11 is scheduled for release in December 2016 with various new features, setting it further apart from its predecessor, ownCloud.

      "text": "Google is well on its way from being a company synonymous with search and the web to a brand name well known for its hardware products . We’re now familiar with the Chromecast name; the streaming stick has been Google’s Trojan horse into the living room , selling millions of units and establishing the search giant’s software as a viable media nexus. Now, there’s the Google Home smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s Echo, as well the company’s new flagship Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones . \nAll of these products are on sale for Black Friday this week, and you can pick them up on discount from a number of different retailers. Verizon is only the authorized Pixel and Pixel XL seller in the US, besides the Play Store. So phone deals are contingent on joining Verizon’s network, or already being a part of it. For Home and Chromecast, you’ll be able to shop around at a few different places. \nHere’s where to start when it comes to picking up Google gadgets starting tomorrow. And be sure to check out are other deal roundups at The Verge’s Black Friday hub . \nGoogle Home Google Home for $99 from Verizon (usually $129) Google Home for $99 at Best Buy (usually $129) Pixel and Pixel XL (Verizon only) Google Pixel or Pixel XL with 32GB of storage for $240 and Pixel or Pixel XL with 128GB of storage for $360 (The catch: you have to pay $649.99 up front; the difference will be deducted from your wireless bill month to month over the next two years) Get the Pixel 32GB for $10 a month or the Pixel 128GB for just $15 a month (valid only November 24th and November 25th) Save $200 on Pixel and Pixel XL when switching to Verizon or adding a line to an existing account (valid only November 24th to November 27th; valid for any Android smartphone priced $400 or higher) Save $100 on Pixel or Pixel XL when upgrading as a current customer (valid for any Android smartphone $400 or higher) Chromecast Google Chromecast for $25 at Staples (usually $35) Google Chromecast for $25 at Target (usually $35)",

      "text": "  @07:45PM from the rise-of-the-machines dept. After a little over a month of learning more languages to translate beyond Spanish, Google's recently announced Neural Machine Translation system has used deep learning to develop its own internal language . TechCrunch reports: GNMT's creators were curious about something. If you teach the translation system to translate English to Korean and vice versa, and also English to Japanese and vice versa... could it translate Korean to Japanese, without resorting to English as a bridge between them? They made this helpful gif to illustrate the idea of what they call \"zero-shot translation\" (it's the orange one). As it turns out -- yes! It produces \"reasonable\" translations between two languages that it has not explicitly linked in any way. Remember, no English allowed. But this raised a second question. If the computer is able to make connections between concepts and words that have not been formally linked... does that mean that the computer has formed a concept of shared meaning for those words, meaning at a deeper level than simply that one word or phrase is the equivalent of another? In other words, has the computer developed its own internal language to represent the concepts it uses to translate between other languages? Based on how various sentences are related to one another in the memory space of the neural network, Google's language and AI boffins think that it has. The paper describing the researchers' work (primarily on efficient multi-language translation but touching on the mysterious interlingua) can be read at Arxiv .",

      "text": "Stay on target How Actual Gamers Would Behave In Westworld The White House Releases Paper On What It Wants To Do With AI When I warn about the robot apocalypse, no one takes me seriously. But they really need to start. Google’s DeepMind, which is currently one of the world’s most advanced machine learning systems, has just racked up another incredible win, this time against an expert in lip-reading .\nThat might not sound that special, it’s not a cut-throat game of chess, for example, but it really is astonishing. That’s because the advanced pattern and particular facial recognition is one of the most complex cognitive processes humans can do. It’s also what nearly one-quarter of our brain mass is dedicated to. Now that we’ve lost this to the machines, it’s only a matter of time before they replace us.\nResearchers at Oxford University helped with the tests. The human lip-reader and DeepMind watched and analyzed hours of BBC broadcasts and then each gave their best estimation of what was said.\nThe squishy meat-bag only got 12.4 percent of its words correct, while DeepMind managed an impeccable 46 percent. It’s worth noting that the human regularly analyzes security footage and provides testimony in court. So… that’s comforting.\nTo be fair, this is awesome for a lot of reasons. Google will likely try to implement this recognition into its Google Now service so that it can use visual recognition to supplement speech analysis. It could also be a boon for the hearing impaired, provided easier and more universal access to basic services. And I’d be remiss to hand-wave that away. But, this is another nail in humanity’s coffin. Robots are already mastering driving; they can even paint and compose music. They can even write their own code, which is essentially the entire point of machine learning systems like DeepMind. And while that’s really cool from a “Wow, look at that!” perspective, we really need to shore up our defenses against the bots if we want to survive the next few decades. After all, top minds like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are terrified of the potential of AI.\nI’m warning you: you need to get ready now. Or you could be an idiot and invite something like Google’s Home or the Amazon Echo . But seriously. Don’t do it. You’re basically inviting the AI INTO YOUR HOUSE.",

      "title": "The AI behind Google Translate has created its own language for translating between languages",
      "text": "Google translate might have once been delivering funny results, but it has been constantly improving and is now approaching human levels of capabilities in its translations.\nThe Artificial Intelligence delivering translations between languages has created a model of its own, for translating between languages it has previously not been trained to handle. Google calls this Zero Shot translation.\nArtificial intelligences are trained for tasks, which usually involves feeding in tons of data, and the more data that is fed into the system, the more accurate it gets. For example, to train the AI to translate between English and Spanish, the English versions and the acceptable Spanish versions are fed into the machine.\nSay the artificial intelligence is trained to translate between English and Spanish, then trained to translate between Italian and Spanish, the machine can fairly accurately translate between English and Italian on its own. This may seem like a trivial task for humans, but for machines, it is particularly challenging. This is the first time machines have demonstrated capabilities of handling translation tasks they were previously untrained for.\n\nIn September, Google switched from Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) to Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) for handling translations between Chinese and English . The Chinese and English language pair has historically been difficult for machines to translate, and Google managed to get its system close to human levels of translation by using bilingual people to train the system.\nThe developments were announced by Google in a blog post , and was accompanied by a research paper published on Arxiv .\nIn November, Google Translate got its biggest ever update , with GNMT rolled out for eight language pairs. French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish were added to English and Chinese, making GNMT available for 35 percent of the translation requests on Google. Google planned to add GNMT for all 103 languages in Google Translate. That would mean feeding in data for 103^2 language pairs, and the artificial intelligence would have to handle 10,609 models.\nGoogle tackled this problem by allowing a single system to translate between multiple languages. The knowledge required for translation is shared across language pairs, and this forces the system to better use its modelling powers. When the translation knowledge was shared, curious Google Engineers checked if the AI could translate between language pairs it was not explicitly trained on before. This was the first time machine based translation has successfully translated sentences using knowledge gained from training to tranlsate other languages.\n\nGoogle engineers were curious about how the AI was managing to do this. Using a plotter integrated into TensorFlow, Google engineers peeked into the mind of the artificial intelligence, to see what was going on.\nThe coloured dots in the image are phrases with the similar meanings bunched together. In the zoomed in view, phrases from three different languages, are grouped together. This is evidence that the machine is saving information about the meaning of the phrases, instead of just phrase translations. The models created by the machine shows what Google calls a “universal interlingua representation.”\nGoogle celebrated ten years of machine based translations earlier this year. Over one billion words are translated every day.\nThe post The AI behind Google Translate has created its own language for translating between languages appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Google is opening a new space in Berlin for tech entrepreneurs, according to a company blog post . \nThe \"Campus Berlin\" tech hub will be based in Kreuzberg — a trendy neighbourhood in Berlin that's home to a number of tech startups. It will open in Autumn 2017. \nThe search giant said Berlin's startup scene has grown rapidly over the last five years to become one of Europe's leading ecosystems. \n\"We are firmly convinced that the future holds more growth potential for entrepreneurs and we want to contribute our part,\" said Mary Grove, director of Google for Entrepreneurs and Campus, in the post. \"Our goal for Campus Berlin is to support the existing startup ecosystem even more and to promote entrepreneurship.\" \nA number of UK tech startups have relocated to the relatively cheap city as a result of Brexit, which could inhibit their ability to access the 500 million people in the European market and make it difficult for them to hire, The Financial Times reports . \nGrove added that there will be an emphasis on providing entrepreneurs with \"practical knowledge\" in areas like product management and design. Campus Berlin will also run established Campus programs like \"Campus for Moms\" and \"Founders over 50\" in a bid to increase diversity in the Berlin tech ecosystem. \nGoogle already has six Campus buildings in cities around the world, with the others in London, Tel Aviv, Seoul, Warsaw, Sao Paulo, and Madrid. \nIn Berlin, Google will be competing with startup space providers like Factory and WeWork which also offer desk space to entrepreneurs. \nThe Campus spaces are designed to help entrepreneurs to form and build their businesses alongside other founders that are doing the same thing. Google claims that startups in its Campuses have raised €260 million (£220 million) and created more than 4,600 new jobs. \n\"We ourselves began in a garage nearly two decades ago and today we celebrate our entrepreneurial roots,\" Google writes on the Campus website . \"Google for Entrepreneurs partners with startup communities and builds Campuses where entrepreneurs can learn, connect, and create companies that will change the world. \n\"Since 2011, we’ve launched Campuses and formed partnerships that support entrepreneurs across 125 countries.\"",

      "text": "66 shares \nResearchers from Google’s UK-based artificial intelligence division DeepMind have collaborated with scientists from the University of Oxford to develop the world’s most advanced lip-reading software – and it probably reads lips better than you. \nTo accomplish this, the researchers fed thousands of hours of TV footage from the BBC to a neural network, training it to annotate videos based on mouth movement analysis with an accuracy of 46.8 percent. \nFor context, when tasked with captioning the same video, a professional human lip-reader proved to be almost four times less efficient, accurately guessing the right word only 12.4 percent of the time. \nThe research builds upon previously published work by the University of Oxford that used similar techniques to build a lip-reading app called LipNet that could read video recordings of volunteers speaking in simple sentences with an accuracy of over 90 percent. \nHowever, unlike Oxford’s program, DeepMind’s software – dubbed “Watch, Listen, Attend, and Spell” – was trained and tested on much more challenging footage. \nIn the process, Google’s neural network watched 5,000 hours of footage from popular TV shows including Newsnight , Question Time and The World Today . The videos featured over 110,000 different sentences and approximately 17,500 unique words. By comparison, LipNet read a total of 51 unique words. \nHere’s how the Google researchers sum up the scope and goals of their study: \nThe goal of this work is to recognise phrases and sentences being spoken by a talking face, with or without the audio. Unlike previous works that have focussed on recognising a limited number of words or phrases, we tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos \nDeep Mind speculates that besides coming in handy to individuals with impaired hearing, the newly developed software could also support a wide range of applications, including annotating films as well as communicating to digital assistants like Siri and Alexa simply by using lip gestures.",

      "text": "Joe Fedewa Nov 24th, 2016 \nGoogle can’t seem to decide on a name for casting. It started as simply “Chromecast” with the launch of the popular $35 device. The device stayed “Chromecast,” but the technology behind it was changed to “Google Cast.” Now, Google has changed the name again. This time it’s “Chromecast Built-In.” \n“Chromecast Built-In” is the name for the tech that allows you to cast things to TVs and speakers. The name change was announced on Twitter along with a new name for the account. It does make a lot more sense this way. Chromecast is the device everyone knows and loves. Now you simply buy a device with the Chromecast built-in. Makes sense.",

      "text": "Google's AI can translate language pairs it has never seen If it can convert English to Korean and Japanese, it can automatically do Korean to Japanese. Share Save \nGoogle's AI is not just better at grasping languages like Mandarin , but can now translate between two languages it hasn't even trained on. In a research paper , Google reveals how it uses its own \"interlingua\" to internally represent phrases, regardless of the language. The resulting \"zero-shot\" deep learning lets it translate a language pair with \"reasonable\" accuracy, as long as it has translated them both into another common language. \nThe company recently switched its Translate feature to the deep-learning Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system. That's an \"end-to-end learning framework that learns from millions of examples,\" the company says, and has drastically improved translation quality. The problem is, Google Translate works with 103 languages, meaning there are 5,253 language \"pairs\" to be translated. If you multiply that by the millions of examples needed for training, it's insanely CPU intensive. \nAfter training the system with several language pairs like English-to-Japanese and English-to-Korean, researchers wondered if they could translate a pair that the system hadn't learned yet. In other words, can the system do a \"zero-shot\" translation between Japanese and Korean? \"Impressively, the answer is yes -- it can generate reasonable Korean to Japanese translations, even though it has never been taught to do so,\" Google says. \nEven the researchers aren't 100 percent sure of how it works, because deep learning networks are notoriously difficult to understand. However, they were able to peek into a three-language model using a 3D representation of the internal data (above). When zooming in, the researchers noticed that the system automatically groups sentences with the same meanings from three different languages. \nIn essence, it developed its own \"interlingua\" internal representation for similar phrases or sentences. \"This means the network must be encoding something about the semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations,\" the researchers write. \"We interpret this as a sign of existence of an interlingua in the network.\" \nIn one experiment, for instance, the team merged 12 language pairs into a model the same size as for a single pair. Despite the drastically reduced code base, they achieved \"only slightly lower translation quality\" than with a dedicated two-language model. \"Our approach has been shown to work reliably in a Google-scale production setting and enables us to scale to a large number of languages quickly,\" the team says. Bear in mind that it only started seriously working on AI for languages a short time ago, so its rapid progress is pretty scary -- especially if you're a professional translator.",

      "text": "\nSome users of Google Play have begun seeing ‘feature ratings’ for games in Google’s marketplace, according to Android Police , who have received screenshots of the changes. The shift takes the familiar “one rating fits all” approach and breaks it down into more detailed aspects including gameplay, controls and graphics.\nThe idea makes a lot of sense, as a game might have brilliant gameplay and graphics but be let down by sub-standard controls. In cases like this the game might still be worth installing, assuming you have an Android controller . Or, a game might have beautiful and enticing graphics but simply awful gameplay that makes it not even worth a trial run.\nAndroid Police \nIf you want to see if you have the feature enabled on your device, head to the games section of Google Play, pick an app and scroll down to the normal overall rating. Below that you’ll either see the usual review highlights, or you’ll see circular feature ratings before the review highlights start.\nIf you can see the new feature ratings you’ll also be able to submit game reviews that take advantage of these new granular ratings. After first assigning an overall rating for the game you’ll see an additional three screens for rating each individual aspect of the game mentioned above.\nLet us know if you like this new option and if you’ve got the feature on your phone.",

      "title": "This startup wants to be the Google for your personal data",
      "text": "\nPicture this: It’s an awfully busy day. In midst of all the chaos an email lands in your inbox, from your boss demanding certain documents urgently. What do you do? Spend next 30 minutes frantically searching for the documents across your multiple accounts. No luck. Panic sets in.\nWhat if there was an easier way to do the same task in less than 5 minutes? That’s VaultEdge .\nThis new startup is aiming to be the Google for your personal data.\nVaultEdge is a vault that will automatically organize all your documents from multiple accounts into categories like taxes, bill, and so on. It will let you search all your files from one place.\nThe web app currently supports Dropbox, Gmail, Google Drive, and Outlook. Evernote and Slack will also be added in a month, along with Windows desktop.\nHere is how it works Sign up with VaultEdge and give it access to all the accounts you would like it to organize and pull out files from. The application will use a spider search technique to search your mails and files, and it will categorize all of them under relevant fields.\nIf you are looking for something, VaultEdge uses machine learning to pull out the relevant information. The algorithm behind the application is trained to identify words like bills, salary slip, tax, and 12 other such categories. Even if the words are not mentioned in the body of the text, the algorithm has the intelligence to search through the attached document and filter it accordingly.\nThe technology behind VaultEdge can also create sub categories. Suppose you have multiple bills – mobile phone, electricity, water, and so on. The system will filter each under the name of the company, like Airtel bill or Vodafone bill. To make it easier, the document description will mention the time and period when the bill was generated and when you received it.\nUsually, VaultEdge stores your documents on the cloud. But if you are worried about the security of your sensitive documents, you can choose not to store the data. In any case, the documents you click on will open in the original source.\nThere is really no need to worry, founder and CEO Sajeev Aravindan explains. “Our encryption is far superior. The data is broken down into thousands and thousands of tiny pieces. Each of these is encrypted.” So if a hacker is looking to play nasty with your data, it will take them years to crack the code, he adds.\nFounder and CEO of VaultEdge, Sajeev Aravindan (Second from left), with his team. Photo credit: VaultEdge.  \nThe story so far Sajeev was working with NetApp as a worldwide technology architect for storage and analytics when the idea struck him. “I would have at least 50 documents open at one time; some on my home computer and some at work. It was difficult to keep track of every document. I would download one document multiple times, having forgotten where I stored it,” Sajeev says.\nWhat if all his digital data was accessible from one place, auto-classified and auto-tagged, so that he could easily find his documents, he thought. Sajeev soon started toying with the idea of using vault-like document storage for individual users.\nHe employed his experience of working with such a technology at NetApp for enterprise users. He was excited about its potential but kept his nerves. To convince himself that a product like this could work for mass consumption, he first turned to his colleagues, friends, and family for feedback.\nBy August 2015, he was convinced the product will be well received. By September, he quit his plush corporate job, even before the product was built.\nAfter 12 long months of dealing with technical glitches and cost issues, Sajeev released the first private beta in April of 2016 with around 50 users. It was followed by a second beta soon after, with 100 users.\nIn September, Sajeev decided to debut VaultEdge on Product Hunt , an online compendium of tech launches. The three-year-old website lets founders and people interested in tech post new products such as apps or podcasts, and users can upvote, downvote, and chat about them.\nProminent CEOs and VCs of Silicon Valley hang around on Product Hunt, so the verdict there could make or break a product. VaultEdge received 150 upvotes, and it got 661 signups in a day.\n“We had to close the signups because there were too many to handle in a day. We had accounts with over 1 terabyte data. Processing such high data takes time,” Sajeev says.\nVaultEdge launched for the public in October and has already garnered over 1,000 users. On a usual day, VaultEdge gets about 10 signups, with a maximum of 20.\n\nWhat next? Sajeev believes the product has unlimited potential. In the future, he wants to take a cue from Google and add a semantic search feature. Semantic search takes the context of the searched topic into consideration besides just the words typed in. It then throws up the most accurate option to the user.\nFor instance, if you type “INR to USD” in Google search, it will show a relevant currency converter as the top feed, instead of a link. You can do the calculations right there on the Google page.\nSajeev wants to use the concept to let data travel to the user, than the other way around. “Suppose you get a mail from boss asking for your tax-filing documents. VaultEdge can recognize the request and will automatically pull it out and attach it in the reply mail,” he explains.\nIt will be extended to images also, so that you can find your places, people, and events through pictures.\nHowever, that feature will be a reality when VaultEdge’s machine learning is 100 percent accurate. “As new users join, the machine will be trained to identify new and more complex keywords. When we are near accuracy, like Google, we will be able to bring data to the user,” Sajeev says. At present, he pegs VaultEdges’ accuracy at 80 percent.\nTech in Asia tried out the application, and we see what Sajeev says about accuracy. You might see your diet plan under bills or your tax computation under electricity. But when we checked again after a week, some of those misplaced documents had found their way back to the right place.\nShow me the money Sajeev hasn’t yet initiated talks with any angel investors or VCs, and he expects to keep it that way for some time. “When we are big enough, investors will seek us out,” he says.\nNo advertising model for him either. He is fierce about protecting the privacy of his users, and intends to keep the platform private and ad-free.\nSo how does VaultEdge plan to earn? It’s still early days, but the company is working on a freemium model, where basic services are provided free of charge while advanced features must be paid for. For VaultEdge, users start with the freemium pack, which will allow 60 days of data search. For advanced packs, VaultEdge plans to charge US$3 a month for a gold subscription, and US$5 for platinum.\nBut the question is, are users ready to pay for the service? After all VaultEdge isn’t alone in this space. There are companies like CloudO and FindO , and more recently Meta , which is in beta stage. Sajeev acknowledges the competition. “These companies offer more of search feature, while our unique point is automatic classification and categorization,” he says.\n“In India, it may be difficult to get paid customers for classification, but I think once they use VaultEdge, they will see the value in it. In markets like the US, the paid model will definitely work,” Sajeev adds.\nThis post This startup wants to be the Google for your personal data appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

      "text": " Google+\nJim Davis/Globe Staff\nLoco on West Broadway in South Boston is one of three hot spots in the area owned by the same duo.\nBy Janelle Nanos Globe Staff November 25, 2016\nOn Friday night, the twentysomethings in South Boston begin a familiar migratory pattern.\nHead to Loco on West Broadway with the post-work crush and scan the room for a spot to snag tacos. If there’s a wait (and there typically is), the hostess will send you across the street to Lincoln, where you can grab a beer at the bar and keep an eye out for the text alert that your table is ready. Back at Loco, sip margaritas and snack on ceviche. Done early? Pinball back across the street and make the switch to wine at Capo, just a few doors down from Lincoln.\nAdvertisement\nThe exact triangulation might shift from week to week, but one thing is certain: No matter who covers the check, the same people are profiting, because the three hot spots all share an owner.\nIn fact, several restaurant groups in Boston have found their destiny in density, opening eateries in clusters along one block or square. And they’ll argue that they’re not cannibalizing their business, but building on it.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign The three restaurants along West Broadway — Loco, Lincoln, and Capo — are owned by the same duo, Michael Conlon and Eric Aulenback. Together with their Loco co-owner Michael Shaw, they have helped transform a strip of Southie that only a few years ago was awash in Irish pubs, cheap pizza, and dollar stores.\nJim Davis/Globe Staff\nCapo is on West Broadway in South Boston.\nCome December, they’ll expand their offerings further and open a swanky, subterranean lounge beneath Capo. An adjacent takeaway counter, featuring Italian meatball platters and lasagna trays, is scheduled to open early next year.\nClusters aren’t always intentional, said Todd Smith, the president of the Corbett Restaurant Group, a commercial real estate firm in Boston, but when they happen it can be fortuitous for all involved. Customers’ status as a “regular” is transferrable from one space to the next. Owners and chefs can share resources and staff, which can be a boon in an industry that’s facing a labor shortage. And if done well, such groupings can help shape a neighborhood.\nAdvertisement\n“We see a lot of them, particularly in emerging neighborhoods, with someone seizing the opportunity to create a dining destination,” Smith said. And it can help shape careers (see: Barbara Lynch setting up shop in the South End and Fort Point, Garrett Harker reinvigorating Kenmore Square, or the Grafton Group expanding through Harvard Square).\nIn Davis Square, chef Joe Cassinelli saw promise in the neighborhood’s high density of students, young professionals, and families when he opened his Neapolitan pizzeria, Posto, in 2009. He began serving upscale Mexican fare at The Painted Burro down the street in 2012, and in 2015, he opened Rosebud American Kitchen & Bar, which is situated halfway between the two.\nThe entire cluster spans one-tenth of a mile.\nJim Davis/Globe Staff\nLincoln also is on West Broadway in South Boston.\nHaving three different landlords, leases, and concepts isn’t simple, no matter how close by they are, Cassinelli said. And things have gotten far more complicated as he’s expanded outward, with new restaurants in Waltham and Brookline.\nBut running a trio of restaurants alongside one another does have its perks: The Painted Burro smokes its meats in Rosebud’s kitchen. Rosebud’s pastry chef bakes her pies in Posto’s ovens. And the Rosebud’s patio is actually owned by the Painted Burro’s landlord. The sister restaurants have one reservationist, who often fields back-to-back calls as people search for a table on a Saturday night. When the manager at Posto noticed one customer had hit her 100th reservation within the group, they threw her an around-the world-dinner, ushering her among the three locations for appetizers, dinner, and dessert.\nChef Joshua Smith’s takeover of Moody Street in Waltham was a response, in part, to the fact that Boston’s public health inspectors have cracked down on chefs making their own sausages and pates. So he headed west to make, cure, and sell his own aged meats, opening Moody’s Delicatessen & Provisions in 2013 with fewer restrictions in the suburbs.\nSmith’s concept quickly took off, enabling him to acquire the storefront next door and open The Backroom wine bar in 2015. This year, he opened his 10,000-square-foot New England Charcuterie meat processing operations in a warehouse just a few miles from Moody Street. And early next year, he’ll begin selling smoked meats and baked goods just a few doors down from the original deli, using the deli’s ovens for all his baking.\n“We get to use the infrastructure that we already built,” Smith said. “It’s house made — it’s just house made two doors down.”\nWhile clusters like Smith’s literally feed off each other, chef Tiffani Faison says her Fenway restaurants operate as islands, rarely interacting. She has two spots in the neighborhood, Sweet Cheeks and Tiger Mama, and will open her third, Fool’s Errand, in January.\nDoubling down on one location hasn’t been without some fears and consequences. In light of events like the Marathon bombing, she said she sometimes worries about the risk of having several restaurants in close proximity.\n“We have moments talking about what if something really bad happened in our neighborhood?” Faison admitted. “I would lose everything at this point in my career.”\nThere’s also the challenge of becoming too associated with one part of the city, as if it’s your turf.\n“There is a little sort of negative connotation, like ‘She wants to own the Fenway, she wants to be the queen of the Fenway,’ ’’ she said.\nIt’s a reality that every restaurateur faces when they go deep in a neighborhood, said Harker, who, after setting up a cluster with Lynch in the South End, established his own a few blocks down in Kenmore Square. That’s where he now manages operations for three of his seven restaurants, Eastern Standard, Island Creek Oyster Bar, and The Hawthorne.\nHe said he’s always eyeing new sites, but “I would think twice about going in on the Fenway neighborhood because right now it’s got someone at the forefront in Tiffani [Faison].”\nHarker said that building the original triad gave him enough visibility and a hospitality team big enough to begin expanding elsewhere. Row 34 opened in Fort Point in 2013, and in the last 18 months, he’s launched three new restaurants outside Boston, in Watertown, Burlington, and Portsmouth, N.H. (there are also plans to open one in Harvard Square next year).\nJim Davis/Globe Staff\nMichael Connelly, Eric Aulenback and Mike Shaw are restaurant owners in South Boston.\nAnd while most of the city’s cluster owners cite Harker as the best exemplar of the trend, he said he purposely chose not to leverage Eastern Standard’s success when he opened Island Creek Oyster Bar on the same block in 2010, hiring a separate public relations team and architect for the project.\nBut after Island Creek’s debut, sales spiked at both locations, he said, as it cemented Kenmore Square as a destination for a night out. Overflow crowds from both restaurants now spill into The Hawthorne for cocktails. Between the Kenmore cluster and the expanding portfolio of properties, there’s been lots of talk about a Harker empire .\nNot that he’s ever going to call it that.\n“Boston does not like empire building,” he said. To deflect the spotlight, he promotes the chefs involved with each new endeavor, and has still not named his restaurant group.\n“I like to say that I’m a fear-based person. I have a fear of failure. I also have fear that I’m going to lose good people. . . . It’s balancing those two fears that have steered the course of the growth of yet-to-be-named empire,” he said.\nBut, he added, having a hub keeps him centered.\n“Home base for me will never be my car. It will always be Kenmore Square.”\nJanelle Nanos can be reached at janelle.nanos@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @janellenanos .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Kenneth Singletary Globe Staff November 24, 2016\nAretha Franklin sang the national anthem today in Detroit before the Lions took on the Vikings in the first NFL game of the day, and she took a long time in doing it. And Twitter noticed.\nBut she also put her heart and soul into it, as only the Queen of Soul can. And Twitter noticed that, too.\nAdvertisement\nFranklin’s version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” clocked in at about 4 minutes and 35 seconds. It was noticeably leisurely. She also played the piano, and the musical pace was solemn and methodical. Her voice was pure, clear, and filled with emotion. Franklin, who is 74 and is closely associated with Detroit, was a national treasure singing the national anthem in a manner that invited — and perhaps required — listeners to really stop and hear the music.\nMaybe it was just what was needed after a stunning election and divisive political campaign.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign On the football field, dozens of people held a mammoth American flag, fluttering it throughout the music.\nTwitter immediately weighed in:\nYes it's longer than usual but hey, it's Aretha Franklin. What a beautiful rendition...she's not called the Queen of Soul for nothing. https://t.co/zY9eqo4Rck\n— Olivia Heath (@Liv_Heath) November 24, 2016 It's hard to appreciate with family members around but Aretha Franklin's SSB was the most beautiful, soulful, moving performance\n— Tyler Rist (@tyler_rist9) November 24, 2016 Aretha likely sd to herself, Imma sing it MY WAY.Rousing performance, superb artistry, troubling tensions in the true meaning of the anthem.\n— Seychelles_Green (@activistHistori) November 24, 2016 Just pulled up the Aretha Franklin national anthem on YouTube, started it, took a nap, woke up and heard the end. #napsrock\n— Preston Rash (@chancarpoke) November 24, 2016 Possibly one of the best graphics in TV history!! #Lions #Thanksgiving #NFL #ARETHAFRANKLIN pic.twitter.com/av5w09hUJ9\n— Dan Leach (@DanLeach971) November 24, 2016\nJose Juarez/Associated Press\nAretha Franklin performed the national anthem before an NFL football game between the Detroit Lions and the Minnesota Vikings in Detroit.",

      "text": " Google+\nBob Pearson for The Boston Globe\nThe grow room known as \"The Green Mile\" at the Medicine Man marijuana dispensary in Denver.\nBy Joshua Miller Globe Staff November 25, 2016\nRetail shops selling marijuana may not open in Massachusetts until the middle of 2018 — or later — if lawmakers engaged in ongoing backroom discussions succeed in delaying parts of the legalization measure recently approved by voters, according to two people familiar with the conversations.\nSome legislators are also angling to push back the Dec. 15 starting date for when residents could legally grow marijuana at home, the people familiar with the conversations said. It would still be legal to possess and use the drug starting Dec. 15, and lawmakers have not given any indication they plan to change that date.\nAdvertisement\nThe discussions mark the first indication of specific delays lawmakers are envisioning, after several state officials expressed concern about the timeline for implementing the voter-approved law.\nOfficials such as Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, who will oversee the new industry, have expressed worry that allowing stores to begin offering recreational marijuana in January 2018 — as stipulated in the ballot measure — would not give regulators enough time to set up appropriate oversight to protect public health and safety.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign “We probably need to agree to extend the implementation date, so we can take an in-depth look at how the ballot question was written,” said House majority leader Ronald Mariano, a Quincy Democrat. Mariano pointed to the tax rate for retail marijuana sales and other licensing issues that he said were not adequately addressed in the referendum.\nThe legalization initiative, which passed 54 to 46 percent , is a law like any other, which means the House and Senate can change it through the normal legislative process.\nThere is preliminary talk of advancing legislation to adjust the measure in sparsely attended informal legislative sessions in the next few weeks. But that maneuver would require unanimous legislative agreement, because a single representative or senator can derail informal proceedings.\nAdvertisement\nMariano cautioned that, because of the nature of end-of-the-year sessions, any bill that could move before the new year would require a consensus.\n“The only way it’s going to get done informally is if the House and Senate agree, and the governor’s willing to sign it,” he said.\nGovernor Charlie Baker has repeatedly emphasized he will uphold the voters’ will, but has expressed openness to changes in the marijuana measure for the sake of public safety.\n“The administration looks forward to working with legislators and is committed to responsibly implementing the law, while adhering to the will of the voters,” said Baker spokeswoman Lizzy Guyton.\nThe potential actions of the Legislature left victorious proponents — Question 4 garnered more than 1.7 million votes in favor — dismayed.\n“We don’t want to see anything changed,” said Jim Borghesani, spokesman for the Massachusetts legalization effort. “I don’t understand why the Legislature wouldn’t just let the regulators tackle the issues of legalization and then, with regulators’ advice, make any changes later.”\nThe law calls for the treasurer to appoint a three-member regulatory body, the Cannabis Control Commission. Borghesani said lawmakers should wait for the commission to create regulations and issue guidance to State House leaders before taking action.\nAlmost every top elected official in the state, including Baker and Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston, opposed the legalization referendum. So, too, did the Catholic Church and a statewide groups of doctors, hospitals, cities and towns, law enforcement officials, and businesses.\nThey expressed concern that the marijuana tax rate was too low to cover the cost of regulation and enforcement, that the language regulating marijuana-infused edibles such as brownies was too vague, and that protections in the law to ensure people under 21 don’t get the drug were too lax.\nIn TV ads, they warned about the risks of increased impaired driving and a proliferation of marijuana shops in hometown neighborhoods.\nBut their arguments did not move enough voters.\nSenator Jason M. Lewis, an authority on the industry and a leader of the opposition, did not directly respond to questions about the legislative discussions on Wednesday.\nBut he said Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg is meeting with leaders of the marijuana ballot campaign and other legalization advocates to “discuss how best to move forward together to implement the new law.”\nLewis, a Winchester Democrat, said that “we intend to fully respect the will of the voters. There are numerous issues and policy details that will need to be addressed by the Legislature. Our intention is to pursue a transparent and collaborative process that will engage all relevant stakeholders and members of the public, and to work as quickly and expeditiously as possible.”\nRosenberg, one of the few public officials to back the legalization measure, told reporters Monday that he plans to meet with legalization supporters in the coming days.\n“We have a law that we have to implement, and it’s the will of the voters,” the Amherst Democrat said. “I’m going to be meeting with some of the proponents over the next week to have that conversation to assure them that we hear the voters voted. We want to work with them because we’re going to need to make some changes in the law. But we’re going to respect the principle here, which is: The voters have spoken.”\nAlso on Monday, House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo told reporters he will abide by the decision of voters. But the Winthrop Democrat said there will have to be changes to the law “to make it more implementable and, somewhat, for the safety of the people of the Commonwealth.”\nBeacon Hill doesn’t have a sterling record when it comes to implementing voter initiatives.\nThe state’s earlier rollout of the voter-approved medical marijuana law was rife with charges of conflicts of interest, political favoritism, and questionable vetting of marijuana companies. Even though voters approved marijuana for medical use in November 2012, the first dispensary did not open until summer 2015.\nIf legislators tinker with parts of the referendum legalizing recreational marijuana, it will be a rare but not unheard of occurrence.\nIn 2000, voters passed a ballot initiative incrementally reducing the state income tax rate from 5.85 percent to 5 percent. The first ticks downward took place at the beginning of 2001 and 2002. But then the Legislature, facing tough economic times, froze the final tax cut.\nInstead, legislators set a series of economic growth thresholds that would — more slowly than voters intended — lower the tax rate to 5 percent, but only if the state economy was humming along.\nMore than 15 years after Massachusetts voters spoke on that dollars-and-cents issue, the income tax rate still has not fallen to 5 percent.\nJim O’Sullivan of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nDanny Moloshok/REUTERS/file 2014\nActress Florence Henderson.\nBy Lynn Elber AP Television Writer November 25, 2016\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Florence Henderson, the wholesome actress who went from Broadway star to television icon when she became Carol Brady, the ever-cheerful matriarch of ‘‘The Brady Bunch,’’ has died, her manager and her publicist said. She was 82.\nHenderson died Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being hospitalized the day before, said her publicist, David Brokaw. Henderson had suffered heart failure, her manager Kayla Pressman said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nFamily and friends had surrounded Henderson’s hospital bedside, Pressman said.\nOn the surface, ‘‘The Brady Bunch’’ resembled just another innocuous TV sitcom about a family living in suburban America and getting into a different wacky situation each week.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign But well after it ended its initial run, in 1974, the show resonated with audiences, and it returned to television in various forms again and again, including ‘‘The Brady Bunch Hour’’ in 1977, ‘‘The Brady Brides’’ in 1981 and ‘‘The Bradys’’ in 1990. It was also seen endlessly in reruns.\n‘‘It represents what people always wanted: a loving family. It’s such a gentle, innocent, sweet show, and I guess it proved there’s always an audience for that,’’ Henderson said in 1999.\nPremiering in 1969, it also was among the first shows to introduce to television the blended family. As its theme song reminded viewers each week, Henderson’s Carol was a single mother raising three daughters when she met her TV husband, Robert Reed’s Mike Brady, a single father who was raising three boys.\nAdvertisement\nThe eight of them became ‘‘The Brady Bunch,’’ with a quirky housekeeper, played by Ann B. Davis, thrown into the mix.\nThe blonde, ever-smiling Henderson was already a Broadway star when the show began, having originated the title role in the musical ‘‘Fanny.’’ But after ‘‘The Brady Bunch,’’ she would always be known to fans as Carol Brady.\n‘‘We had to have security guards with us. Fans were hanging on our doors. We couldn’t go out by ourselves. We were like the Beatles!’’ she said of the attention the show brought the cast.\nLike the Beatles, there was even a Saturday morning cartoon version called ‘‘Brady Kids,’’ although Henderson was not in that show.\nShe and Reed did return, however, for ‘‘The Brady Bunch Hour, ‘‘The Brady Brides’’ and ‘‘The Bradys.’’ So did most of the original cast.\nShe was also back again in 1995 when a new cast was assembled for ‘‘The Brady Bunch Movie,’’ a playful spoof of the original show. This time she was Grandma Brady opposite Shelly Long’s Carol. Numerous memoirs also kept interest in the show alive, as cast members revealed they were more than just siblings off camera. Barry Williams, who played eldest son Greg Brady, would confess to having a crush on his TV stepmom. Henderson, in her own book, denied having any relationship with Williams, but did acknowledge a fling with former New York City mayor John Lindsay.\nHenderson was a 19-year-old drama student in New York when she landed a one-line role in the play ‘‘Wish You Were Here.’’\nRichard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were so impressed they made her the female lead in a 1952 road tour of ‘‘Oklahoma!’’ When the show returned to Broadway for a revival in 1954, she continued in the role and won rave reviews.\n‘‘She is the real thing, right of of a butter churn somewhere,’’ wrote Walter Kerr of the New York Herald Tribune.\nTo broaden her career, Henderson took acting, dancing, singing and guitar lessons, even studying French and Italian.\nShe went on to play Maria in a road production of ‘‘The Sound of Music,’’ was Nellie Forbush in a revival of ‘‘South Pacific’’ and was back on Broadway with Jose Ferrer in ‘‘The Girl Who Came to Supper’’ in 1963.\nShe made her movie debut in 1970 in ‘‘Song of Norway,’’ based on the 1944 operetta with music by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg.\nHer career nearly came to an end in 1965 when she suddenly lost her hearing while appearing in ‘‘The King and I’’ in Los Angeles. She was diagnosed with a hereditary condition called osteosclerosis.\n‘‘Corrective surgery in both ears restored my hearing,’’ she said in 2007.\nAs her TV career blossomed with ‘‘The Brady Bunch,’’ Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host ‘‘The Tonight Show’’ for the vacationing Johnny Carson.\nFor eight years she also commuted to Nashville to conduct a cooking and talk series, ‘‘Country Kitchen,’’ on The Nashville Network. The show resulted in a book, ‘‘Florence Henderson’s Short Cut Cooking.’’\nAfter ‘‘The Brady Bunch’’ ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including ‘‘Hart to Hart,’’ ‘’Fantasy Island’’ and ‘‘The Love Boat.’’\nIn later years she also made guest appearances on such shows as ‘‘Roseanne, ‘‘Ally McBeal’’ and ‘‘The King of Queens.’’\nFlorence Agnes Henderson was born Feb. 14, 1934, in the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. She was the 10th child of a tobacco sharecropper of Irish descent.\nIn grade school, she joined the choir at a Catholic church in Rockport, Ind.\nAfter high school she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a two-year program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, her studies financed by a theatrical couple who had been impressed by her singing when they saw her perform in high school.\nShe dropped out of the program after one year, however, to take the role in ‘‘Wish You Were There.’’\nHenderson married theater executive Ira Bernstein and the couple had four children before the union ended in divorce after 29 years.\nHer second husband, John Kappas, died in 2002.\nPressman said she is survived by her children; Barbara, Joseph, Robert and Lizzie, their respective spouses, and five grandchildren.\nThe late AP writer Bob Thomas contributed to this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/CARLO ALLEGRI\nDonald Trump.\nBy Nelson D. Schwartz New York Times news service November 25, 2016\nFollowing up on a campaign promise that appealed directly to his Rust Belt base, President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday that he had reached out to the Carrier air conditioner company in Indiana to ask it not to move more than 2,000 factory jobs from Indiana to Mexico.\nIn a Twitter post Thursday morning, Trump said: “I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS — Will know soon!”\nI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016 Advertisement\nDuring both the primary and general election campaigns, Trump frequently cited the February decision by Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, to close two Indiana factories and move production to Mexico as an example of how NAFTA and other free-trade agreements had failed U.S. workers.\nIn a recent New York Times article, workers at one plant in Indianapolis warned that they would withdraw their support for Trump if he did not keep his promise to bring back jobs from abroad.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign The two plants — a Carrier factory employing more than 1,400 workers in Indianapolis and a United Technologies plant with 700 employees in Huntington — are profitable but pay workers $15 to $26 an hour — about what the company’s workers in Monterrey, Mexico, earn in a day.\nIn a time of slow economic growth and intense pressure from Wall Street to improve profits, moving production south of the border seemed like too good of an opportunity for United Technologies’ executives to pass up.\nHowever, a shaky video of the announcement on the Carrier factory floor — and the furious reaction of workers — went viral in February. It caught Trump’s attention, prompting a furor throughout the campaign.\nAdvertisement\nIn a Twitter post Thursday after Trump’s tweet, Carrier confirmed that the president-elect had reached out but refused to say what steps, if any, management was now considering.\n“Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together,” the company said. “Nothing to announce at this time.”\nFor workers in Indianapolis, the Twitter exchange provided a ray of hope on an otherwise anxious Thanksgiving holiday.\n“Everyone is posting about it on Facebook, and there’s a lot of excitement,” said Paul Roell, who has worked at Carrier for 17 years and was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump in the election.\n“I’m a little more optimistic now,” he said. “Others are saying, let’s see if he’s really going to do this.”\n“I was very surprised to see it on Thanksgiving today,” Roell added. “I figured he’d be like everyone else today, with his family, not thinking of Carrier.”\nEarlier in the week, Indiana state officials had come to the factory to describe what benefits workers could expect as layoffs approached, Roell said. The first production lines are expected to shut down in August.\n“If he can get them to stay here, I’m all for it,” said Robin Maynard, a Trump supporter. “I’m hoping he can get stuff done and also save me from having to look for a new job.”\nOther workers, especially those who did not support Trump in the election, were more skeptical.\n“It’s baloney,” said Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins, who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and earns more than $21 an hour, well above what similar blue-collar jobs pay in the area.\n“I could see him reaching out to Carrier, but I don’t think anything will happen,” said Shanklin-Hawkins, who added that she “reluctantly” voted for Hillary Clinton this month. “He can try and talk to them, and it’s good that he mentioned it, but I think Carrier will still leave.”",

      "text": " Google+\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nVolunteers prepared meals for the homeless to serve to the homeless during an interfaith Thanksgiving dinner at the Cathedral Church of Saint Paul in Boston.\n November 25, 2016\nFellowship: They keep their faith as they feed the homeless Downtown Boston’s Cathedral Church of St. Paul is a place of spiritual and physical refuge for the homeless but also an interfaith community where Episcopalians worship alongside Muslims.\nOn Thursday, the church was a place of fellowship, as volunteers of both faiths worked shoulder to shoulder preparing a feast and then sat together to share it.\nAdvertisement\nAlmost all the food, expected to feed about 200, was donated by Ibrahim Ibrahim, who owns the Black Seed Cafe & Grill next door.\nIbrahim said he has contributed turkeys and side dishes for 16 years, in appreciation of space the church provides for Muslim prayers and to nurture a community.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign “We are a brotherhood of human beings first, before anything else,” Ibrahim said. “I’m happy to see people of all backgrounds get together. Nothing is better than that.”\nAs Ibrahim spoke, the Rev. Jep Streit, dean of the cathedral, interjected: “I know they don’t have saints in Islam, but this guy’s a saint.”\nHayfaa Ali, religious programs coordinator at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, helped organize the volunteers and said unlike some organizations providing holiday meals, the church encourages volunteers to eat alongside the homeless. “This is sitting down and chatting with them, being in their company, treating them like anyone else,” she said.\nAdvertisement\nChristopher Haubrich is a member of the church’s community for the homeless, called MANNA, or Many Angels Needed Now and Always. Haubrich recently moved into a home after living on the streets off and on for 25 years.\nScanning the diverse crowd, Haubrich said, “This is how it should be every day.”\n“I would like to have a poster of this sitting in Donald Trump’s Oval Office,” he added, “saying everybody can get along.”\n— Jeremy Fox, Globe Correspondent\nSolidarity: A show of unity in a broken year Keith Bedford/Globe Staff\nTanya Nixon-Silver (right) hugged Soledad Vera at a solidarity walk Thursday.\nThey came from across Jamaica Plain and nearby neighborhoods, about 100 grandparents, moms and dads, children and babies, with roots in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.\nWith dogs straining at leashes and kids rumbling along in strollers, on vibrantly hued bicycles and, in the case of 5-year-old Brendan Bailey, a wooden-slatted wagon, the throng circled Jamaica Pond on Thursday morning as one, after months that strained bonds of family and community.\n“I figured Thanksgiving would be tough for a lot of people this year,” said Erin Ryerson, 34, who organized the “solidarity stroll.”\nStanding with her husband, Hal; baby, Loretta; and French mastiff, Judah, Ryerson became emotional describing the recent election. “I was crushed,” the West Roxbury resident said. “This was definitely born out of a need to do something, anything.”\nTo Kai and Sarah Johnson, the day was a chance to teach their daughters, Isla, Emmaline, and Bella, the value of inclusion by joining with neighbors of all backgrounds.\n“It’s exactly why we live in this area,” Kai Johnson, 31, said of the gathering’s diversity. “It’s JP, and that’s part of the strength of this community.”\nSix-year-old Isla said she has Muslim and immigrant friends at the nearby Curley School.\n“There are a lot of people who are scared of Donald Trump in my class, including the teachers,” she said. “We’re showing people that . . . we still care for our city.”\nThe crowd completed its circle of the pond around 10 a.m., gathering beside the boathouse to sing John Lennon’s “Imagine” as a light sleet began to fall. Before leaving to prepare their holiday feasts, they shook hands, hugged, and laughed together, as a community.\n— Jeremy Fox, Globe Correspondent\nRemembering: A year after his death, family of beloved train conductor celebrates life Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff\nThe headstone of Jephthe Chery was adorned at Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park. He was killed on Thanksgiving day last year outside of a Fenway Park bar.\nJephthe Chery should have been preparing to celebrate his 31st birthday this weekend. And maybe in the past year, he might have achieved his dream of becoming a locomotive engineer.\nBut his life was cut short early on Thanksgiving last year — a day before his birthday — in a hail of gunfire outside a popular bar near Fenway Park. He was struck by a bullet intended for someone else.\nThe past year has been hard for his mother, Rose Chery, and her family. The pain sparked by his death has not fully eased, even with the passage of time. Sometimes, Chery forgets to eat for the day and has to push herself to get up and get going.\n“It’s like they just took my heart,” Chery said, her voice weary.\nFollowing her son’s death, Chery joined support groups and started therapy once a week. Each day is an attempt at healing. She hopes to find comfort from family and friends as they plan a weekend of events to commemorate her son’s life. Chery said she wants “to make people remember him.”\nOn Saturday, family and friends plan to gather outside of Who’s On First , the bar where Jephthe Chery was slain. They will hold candles and photos of him. The troublesome bar was closed after the shooting. Three others were injured but survived. (A 26-year-old man was charged in connection with the shooting.)\nOn Sunday, what would have been Chery’s birthday, a memorial service is scheduled in Canton.\nThanksgiving Day was spent with her beloved son at Fairview Cemetery in Hyde Park, where she laid a single flower on his grave.\n“I used to have my son with me, and he brought happiness in my family,” Chery said. “I don’t want people to forget him.”\n— Jan Ransom, Globe Staff\nHeartfelt: Heart transplant patient benefits from kindness of strangers David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nIsaac Cosme and his wife, Monica, at Massachusetts General Hospital.\nIt was the breathing tube that tipped him off. They’d actually done the surgery, and it had worked. Isaac Cosme had a new heart.\nAfter months of waiting and hoping, Cosme couldn’t believe his good fortune as he sat in a Massachusetts General Hospital meeting room, getting ready to spend Thanksgiving with his wife, Monica.\nThe past few months have been difficult for the Cosme family, which has been dealing with Isaac’s diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. The disease releases abnormal proteins that damage the heart, and it can be fatal.\nBut the procedure last week was a big step toward getting better, and the 44-year-old is focused on how lucky he is. The medical drama didn’t faze him, so neither does the prospect of the bone marrow transplant he needs next.\n“I am going to be in good hands,” Cosme said, “so why am I going to be worried?”\nIt all seems like a dream, beginning when shortness of breath and numbness in his feet heralded crisis. Even when the doctors knocked him out, they weren’t sure the donor heart would be right. They told him he would find out when he came to.\nCosme is thankful to be at one of the few hospitals that can provide the treatment he needs, and to God for guiding him there. He’s grateful for his doctors. For Monica, who took care of the kids and anchored their home.\nAnd the whole family is moved by the generosity of the person who made a heart available to save his life.\nCosme hoped to spend the holiday in Springfield with his family, but he wasn’t quite ready. He was set for discharge Friday instead.\nNot what they had in mind, but as husband and wife prepared for a hospital turkey dinner, they repeated their new mantra: Every day now is “extra.”\n— Andy Rosen, Globe Staff",

      "title": "LG issuing full refunds for faulty Nexus 5X devices",
      "text": "\nBack in September 2015, Google announced the Nexus 5X (along with the Nexus 6P ) that was manufactured by LG. Recently, a few owners of the device have started complaining, as they have been experiencing what appears to be a hardware issue, which causes the phone to get stuck in a boot loop. Not a first for LG! \nIn cases like these, the normal procedure is to send the phone back to the manufacturer to get it fixed or to get a new/refurbished unit. But seeing as the Nexus 5X is out of production and that spare parts are apparently not available anymore, LG has decided to take a different approach.\nSee also: LG V30 will have no ticker, according to Evan Blass (Update: secondary screen to stay?) 4 days ago According to an email from LG sent to a few of its customers, the company is now offering refunds (of the full purchase price) for devices affected by this issue. As always, this process does take quite a bit of time, as customers will have to wait for up to four weeks to get the refund.\nYou can check out a part of the official email that was posted on Reddit below:\nWe're sorry to hear that you've experienced a problem with your LGH790 and appreciate you giving us the opportunity to provide a warranty repair. We have received your device at our repair facility but currently a part to complete the repair is out of stock and is no longer available. To rectify this issue, we would like to offer you a refund for the full amount of your device. That amount will be determined by your sales receipt. Your refund can take approximately 4 weeks to receive due to the holiday.\nWe have to say that LG is handling this situation quite well. Getting a full refund for a device you have been using for up to a year is something that I think most people could live with. However, it must be mentioned that the LG V10 has suffered bootloop issues in the past, along with the G4, so owners of those affected devices are obviously not going to be quite as happy.\nHave you had any issues with your Nexus 5X? If you have, let us know in the comments below.",

      "text": "Home > Startups > Meet the seven startups selected for Google’s Launchpad Accelerator Meet the seven startups selected for Google’s Launchpad Accelerator | 0 Comments \nGoogle has selected seven Indian startups to be part of the third edition of its Launchpad Accelerator, a six-month long intensive mentoring programme from Google for mid to late stage startups. These firms will join those from Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The two-week all-expenses paid bootcamp begins on 30 January 2017 at Launchpad Space in San Francisco. Additionally, each startup will get $50,000 in equity-free funding, the company said in a statement. \nThe seven start-ups will receive tailored expert guidance from Google engineers, product managers and other mentors from top technology companies and VCs in Silicon Valley. Additionally, they will receive equity-free support credits for Google products and work closely with Google for six months in their home countries. \n“Over the last one year, thirteen Indian startups have participated in the program and many have already gained from the program and have successfully raised funding. Nestaway who was part of our first batch from India closed a $30 million Series C investment. MagicPin that offers deals and discounts for Restaurants, Spas, Salons implemented a progressive web app that has helped them to drive over 10% of their total daily transactions.

      "text": "Opposable Thumbs — Google DeepMind could invent the next generation of AI by playing Starcraft 2 How Google’s AI research team has teamed up with Blizzard to further deep learning in AI. Nick Cowen (UK) - Share this story \nThe announcement at BlizzCon 2016 that met with the most muted response was arguably the most revolutionary. \nWhile new content for the likes of Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm , Overwatch , and Diablo III drew appreciative roars from the Blizzard faithful, the news that Google’s DeepMind branch—which is dedicated to developing sophisticated Intelligence—would be teaming up with the makers of Starcraft 2 to further its research on AI elicited more of a murmur. \nPerhaps the lack of enthusiasm was down to taste. After all, why would the plans of AI scientists be of interest to Starcraft 2 players? As it turns out, if the collaboration between DeepMind and Blizzard is what its developers hope it could be, players will see very tangible benefits—and so will many others outside the video game space. \nAI has been an integral part of video games for quite some time now, and as Starcraft 2 ’s executive producer Chris Sigaty points out, the AI that DeepMind hopes to develop won’t be the first to play the Blizzard RTS. Currently the games uses a scripted AI. It's created by a team of designers and engineers that have an understanding of the way the game plays, with their expertise placed into a script and fed a list of conditions. For example, if X amount of resources is collected, the AI should spend the value of Y on Z units. \n\"They’re elaborate and interesting to play against; there’s some random choice and specific choices that happen,\" says Sigaty. \"They can expand on their terrain, gather resources—basically do the things you need to do in Starcraft 2 . But these [AI] are scripted. They’re predictable and ultimately, unless it cheats, there’s not an AI out there who can beat a human.\" Further Reading Google’s DeepMind AI to use 1 million NHS eye scans to spot common diseases earlier \nThis holds true for Starcraft 2— the best e-sports players routinely beat AI opponents. The aim DeepMind is to develop an AI that plays the game the same way as a human, potentially one that can beat the best players, which widens the potential for deep learning. And the DeepMind team has already had some success in the gaming field: in March this year, the team’s AI AlphaGo saw off the world-class Go player Lee Sedol in a best-of-five series that it won 4-1—leaping what was a major hurdle for AIs in the past. It's not (just) a game \nOriol Vinyals, one of the research scientists at DeepMind, says that Starcraft 2 may help AI research take a massive step forward, because a game in which pieces (or in this case units) aren’t static and movement isn’t turn-based helps create a better benchmark for AI development. Enlarge / DeepMind's Oriol Vinyals says that Starcraft 2 may help AI research take a massive step forward. \n\"We feel that the complexity of Starcraft 2 enables us to now start testing algorithms that perhaps some years ago we were not ready to tackle,\" he says. \nIn Starcraft 2 , much of the information a player needs to succeed in a match is initially hidden, and players are required to scout terrain while managing resources and building units in order to ascertain their opponent’s position. Static AI views the movement on the board as parcels of data, and in order for DeepMind to use Starcraft 2 as a learning experience, that data has to be kept hidden—in much the same way it would be for a human player. \n\"The process is more complex because the game hides units and players don’t know where the enemy is. It focuses on planning and resource management and then players have to factor in whether they’ve played their opponent before, and how they approach them with this knowledge,\" says Vinyals. Enlarge / Starcraft 2 's complexity makes it a challenging choice for developing AI. \n\"These are all very critical AI challenges that we’ll be able to tackle with this new environment. Crucially, even if it isn’t immediately successful, you can start building benchmarks with how it performs, which allows us to keep pushing the envelope on the state-of-the-art which is great. Again, by making it open, everyone can add their ideas to help with the process.\" \nThe collaboration between Blizzard and DeepMind isn’t a closed shop. As part of the announcement at the BlizzCon keynote, Vinyals said that Starcraft 2 ’s AI research environment would be open to any developers, hobbyists, or players who wanted to get involved. DeepMind is putting out the call in a global sense because it needs the world at large to help with this huge challenge. The API is planned for release as a patch for the game in the first quarter of 2017, and will be available to players as part of the free Starter Edition. But, as Vinyals notes, there is a lot of work to be done ahead of the launch. Further Reading Demystifying artificial intelligence: No, the Singularity is not just around the corner \n\"The collaboration started very recently,\" he says. \"The first step is to build the environment, which allows us to place our [AI] agent in it and have it start to make observations while playing. We’re focused totally on building that environment because we have to release it to the public; it has to be a benchmark for other AI researchers as well. There are many people researching AI so making sure that environment is something they can all use is very important.\" \n“The next step would be introducing the agent. We haven't tackled that yet except on a simplistic level.” ",

      "text": "on Friday November 25, 2016 @09:00AM from the they-are-coming dept. A new AI tool created by Google and Oxford University researchers could significantly improve the success of lip-reading and understanding for the hearing impaired. In a recently released paper on the work, the pair explained how the Google DeepMind-powered system was able to correctly interpret more words than a trained human expert. From a report: To accomplish the task, a cohort of scientists fed thousands of hours of TV footage -- 5000 to be precise -- from the BBC to a neural network. It was made to watch six different TV shows, which aired between the period of January 2010 and December 2015. This included 118,000 difference sentences and some 17,500 unique words. To understand the progress, it successfully deciphered words with a 46.8 percent accuracy . The neural network had to recognize the same based on mouth movement analysis. The under 50 percent accuracy might seem laughable to you but let me put things in perspective for you. When the same set of TV shows were shown to a professional lip-reader, they were able to decipher only 12.4 percent of words without error. Thus, one can understand the great difference in the capability of the AI as compared to a human expert in that particular field.",

      "text": "print \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai AP \nWhen the world shifted from desktop to smartphones, there was one thing that didn't change — the existence of a screen on both devices. \nThe screen shrunk, but it remained the medium through which we interact with computers. \nFor Google, that meant its core online advertising business — visible search ads on a web page — remained intact, and stayed lucrative. \nToday, Google may be at the beginning of a new shift — one toward artificially intelligent virtual assistants — where we use our voice to interact with technology, instead of our eyes. \nThe problem with voice assistants is they do not have a screen on which to display ads. \nAnd analysts have noticed. On the last earnings call for Alphabet , Google's parent company, analysts repeatedly asked CEO Sundar Pichai whether voice searches would be harder for the company to monetise with ads. Pichai did not have a specific answer, although he reassured investors that he believed the new medium would expand Google's business. \nVirtual assistants, basically voice-activated mini computers, are becoming more intelligent and increasingly accessible. A spokesperson for Google told Business Insider that its mobile voice searches tripled between 2014 and 2015. \nAmazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's \"OK Google\" Assistant are competing to become the most intelligent digital-helpers in the virtual assistant race. \nThe hardware surrounding this technology is expanding too — Amazon and Google have each released a mini-wifi speaker for the home. You can tell the Amazon Echo or Google Home to play music, look up recipe ideas, find local restaurants, and a variety of other conversational tasks. \nThe side effect of all this is that in the short-term the available real-estate for ads will shrink. You could insert sponsored suggestions into a voice-search assistant's answers, but it would never offer as many ads as a Google search results page. \nThat's a side effect that analysts want to know more about. \nBrian Nowak, Morgan Stanley's internet analyst, asked Pichai on the earnings call to talk about what the company might need to put in place to \"monetize search in a voice world as well as you do in a phone or desktop world.\" \nPichai responded without directly answering the question, he said: \"we are in very early days,\" that one team \"talked about\" ways to integrate third parties, and \"I think we will evolve it a lot in the coming years.\" \nPeter Stabler, a senior research analyst at Wells Fargo, asked Pichai if voice queries are \"much more skewed to less commercial activity\"? \nPichai responded by saying that, instead of replacing search on desktop and mobile, voice search provides an additional way for users to interact with Google. \"The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie,\" he said. \nGoogle Home Google \nWhile it might indeed expand the pie, history shows that legacy media businesses are often vulnerable to new media tech. \nThe newspaper business has struggled to adapt to the internet. Many newspapers have closed. And entirely new digital news organisations have flourished in a business once dominated by a paper product. Similarly, the television business is fighting a fierce regard action against video-on-demand over the internet. \nFrom that perspective, screen-based search starts to look like a legacy media business and voice-based search is a vast, open arena with no dominant players. That is exactly the kind of market that new tech startups seek to disrupt. \nGoogle, of course, has a track record of solving complex problems, and monetizing products. Four years ago there were worries it might stumble on the transition from desktop search to mobile search . In 2012, the company actually warned that mobile was hurting revenue growth . Since then, of course, Google has gone from strength to strength and it remains the dominant search provider on mobile screens. \nGoogle is no doubt thinking about these issues already, and developing plans to enhance its dominance. But until those plans are unveiled, these are the three questions analysts would really like Pichai to answer: How big a slice of consumers' internet time will voice search take? Will that slice be big enough to significantly reduce the number of searches done on mobile and desktop screens? And how easy is it to generate revenue from voice assistants? \nDisclosure: This author used to be an employee at Google and currently owns Alphabet stock. ",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSome very alarming news has broken over the last 24 hours that third party presidential candidate Jill Stein was able to raise the millions needed (and then some), to be able to pay for the recount democrats are looking to use to stop Trump before he is ever sworn in on Inauguration Day.\nMany media outlets are reporting that Stein already has the money , and considering how easy that would be to verify, there is no reason to think she doesn’t. What could be debated, is how she raised the money so quickly, but does it really matter?\nAccording to Anonymous, who do you think provided the funds so quickly? None other than George Soros. This is one of the many political land mines I warned about when I said that voting may be over, but this election is far from finished yet.\nThis news is NOT to be taken lightly either. When you consider the tremendous amount of information We the People never would have known (and Trump probably wouldn’t have won without), that came from rogue hacking groups like Anonymous and WikiLeaks, this is a very serious development. Furthermore, since Jill Stein has the money, and since she is a third party who is requesting the recount, her request should be carried out.\nDo you really think Democrats and Soros would go through all this if they didn’t have the outcome already planned? In the following video, I review the developing news, explain why the claims of “Russian hacking” spawning the idea for the recount are total nonsense, but caution Trump supporters not to take this lightly at all. Remember, George Soros is connected to the voting machines in all three major states in question…\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN THE NEWSLETTER HERE\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nFor those of you who are finally starting to realize there is major trouble on the horizon, largely as a result of the corruption within our own government and the 2016 election, the failure of the U.S. Dollar and Western banks, deteriorating conditions here domestically, or perhaps even because of nuclear tensions reaching all new heights, then I suggest you get your FREE GUIDE for how to survive Martial Law here , because if/when things begin to go south, by then it will be too late to do anything about it.\nFor anyone with no idea where to begin making preparations, a very good, and very inexpensive tool to teach you how and what you should be preparing, is a book called “Conquering the Collapse.” Since I’ve practically worn out my own iPad reading my copy, in the following link I provide you with a review of the book: Be Ready For Any Emergency – The Crucial Guide For Any Family’s Safety (Videos) . You can learn more about the coming crisis in the links at the bottom under the heading titled, “If nothing else, these links are essential.” The writing is on the wall everywhere… Begin preparing….\nConservative Daily Post writes:\nHacking Group “Anonymous” Has Issued A CHILLING Announcement\nSomething seriously bad is happening right now and it’s about to shift the face of democracy in the free world.\nGeorge Soros is well known by now for his donations to BLM and other extreme leftist groups, not to mention the millions he’s given Hillary.\nThings just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote.\nWhat is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement:\n“It’s over, folks.\nThey are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground.\nThey are going to “find” that the results were indeed “hacked”. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week.\nAll 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen.\nStart preparing for the news to pour in, NOW.\nWhen Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.”\nThere is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn’t work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin—the other 2 states are even cheaper.\nThis is BAD News\nTrump may have taken Michigan, but it won’t matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months?\nI’m a realist—I call it like it is and I don’t care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nIt’s already happening. Multiple fake “computer experts” have stated there are “anomalies” in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia, however we already know that narrative is FALSE, because Wikileaks was working WITH members of our own intelligence community who could no longer stand the corruption:\nU.S. Intelligence Stopped a Silent Obama/Clinton Coup; Now You’re Needed\nSo then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is “detected”, a recount can be initiated (even if the “foul play” is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary).\nRogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly.\nBut wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system.\nGo to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations!\nThis Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative!\nThat’s not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn’t be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep!\nJill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that’s not even possible.\nFOR OTHER NEWS ON TROUBLE STIRRED UP AND FINANCED BY SOROS:\n100,000 Person Soros-Funded Group Pushing ‘Sanctuary Campus’ Anti-Trump Protests\nAttention: Expect Obama To Run Dangerously Wild Until Inauguration Day\nWhy Isn’t Obama Trying to Stop Planned BLM Chaos, Rioting, and Violence?\nGeorge Soros Is Leading Trump Directly Into a Violent No-Win Situation\nBlack Lives Matter Beats and Drags Old Man by Car Down Street for Voting Trump\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "title": "Florence Henderson, Mother of The Brady Bunch, Dead at 82",
      "text": "Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp \nFlorence Henderson , the actress best known for playing matriarch Carol Brady on '70s sitcom The Brady Bunch , passed away on Thursday in Los Angeles from heart failure. She was 82. \nHenderson was mostly a stage actress and television personality until she landed the part on The Brady Bunch in 1969. The series ran on ABC from 1969 to 1974, and offered viewers a light, escapist sitcom during a tumultuous time in America. It thrived in syndication, and spawned numerous TV movies and reunion specials, spin-offs and two feature films. Henderson played the perpetually chipper mother of Marcia, Jan and Cindy who married Mike Brady and blended their six children together. \nShe began her career as a stage actress in the 1950s, starring in Fanny and The Girl Who Came to Supper , Noël Coward's last original Broadway musical, on Broadway. \nShe started appearing on TV in the '50s, and was a memorable panelist on game shows like Match Game and Password . She appeared many times on The Tonight Show with both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson , and even hosted the show once in 1962 when the show was between hosts. She was also a contributor to Today in 1959 and 1960. \nStars we've lost in 2016 \nAfter The Brady Bunch , she guest-starred on shows including Ally McBeal , 30 Rock andreality shows like The Surreal Life . In 2010, Henderson competed on Dancing With the Stars (coming back to sit in the audience just three days before her death) and in 2013, she'd begun hosting a cooking show, Who's Cooking with Florence Henderson , on RLTV. \nHenderson was born on Feb. 14, 1934, the youngest of 10 children, in Dale, Ind., near the Kentucky border. Her family was very poor, and she began working at age 8. After high school she moved to New York and began studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which led to her first New York stage role in Wish You Were Here in 1952. \nShe was married to Ira Bernstein, a Broadway casting director and general manager, from 1956 to 1985. They had four children together. In 1987, she married Dr. John Kappas, to whom she was married until his death in 2002. \nShe's survived by two daughters, two sons, and five grandchildren.",

      "text": " Google+\n November 25, 2016\nF or the definition of a vicious cycle, look no further than a recent Globe story describing the criminal justice system’s practice of assessing “fine time” — that is, incarcerating poor defendants who are unable to pay money owed to the state.\nA report issued by a state Senate committee found about 100 individuals last year, in three Massachusetts counties, who were sent to jail because they didn’t have money to pay accumulated debts such as counsel fees, court costs, probation fines, or other obligations. Putting them in jail makes it even harder for them to find work, leaving them more likely to relapse into criminal behavior — and then start the cycle all over again.\nAdvertisement\nThe court system needs to adopt clear guidelines for judges, compelling them to look closely at defendants’ capacity to pay before putting them behind bars. Only defendants who have a realistic ability to pay fines but choose not to should face imprisonment.\nThe need for reform was clearly illustrated by the case of a 27-year-old homeless man, James K., who in the spring of 2015 stood before a judge for about 45 seconds in a Dudley courtroom, according to the report. He owed $1,100 in fines from an old criminal case. James told the judge he was poor, to which the judge said: “OK. All right, he’s gonna be surrendered on the fines. He’ll be incarcerated. . . . Thirty dollars a day they’re gonna give you at the jail, OK?” Indeed, Massachusetts law allows judges to send defendants to jail to “work off” their debt at the rate of $30 per day. But “no one is supposed to go to jail unless they are found in contempt of the court by refusing to pay,” said state Senator Michael Barrett, who oversaw the committee that issued the report. James, who had spent the night before in a shelter, truly didn’t have the money. He then went on to spend 36 days in jail on “fine time.” He hadn’t spent a single day in jail on the original charges, from a drug arrest, that first brought him into court.\nIn nearly half of the examined cases, the legislative committee found that defendants didn’t have the assistance of attorneys, or weren’t offered it, when judges considered whether to incarcerate them for their inability to pay fines, which represents a potential violation of constitutional rights. That’s also what happened to James: He wasn’t asked whether he wished to have an attorney. The review also found that courts did a poor job evaluating a defendant’s financial difficulties. “Judges must inquire ability to pay in a pretty searching and methodical way, not make a snap judgment on a gut instinct. Is it a function of contempt of authority or simple poverty?” said Barrett.\nView Story Study finds scores of inmates who serve fine-time They call it “fine-time”: A defendant claims to be poor and cannot afford court-imposed fees, and is sent to jail to “pay off” his debt.\nThe problem is that the judiciary lacks clear guidelines when confronting a defendant who has not paid a fee or a fine. The good news is that there is a working group, established by the Trial Court, already charged with proposing policy changes to “ensure that fines and fees are not unduly punitive and do not disproportionately affect those without adequate financial means.” A report is expected next month. The Legislature should also make it a priority to follow the report’s recommendation of doubling the credit for “fine time” served to $60 per day.\nAnother part of the solution, though, is thinking more carefully about when it’s appropriate to assess fines in the first place. Fines and fees that don’t actually work to deter crime, or only punish offenders who are poor by setting them up to lose their liberty, have no place in Massachusetts.",

      "text": " Google+\nS.N. Jacobson\nMK2 at Bay Area Maker Fair in 2015.\nBy Scott Kirsner Globe C0lumnist November 25, 2016\nHAYWARD, Calif. — On a sunny afternoon in this industrial town south of Oakland, Gui Cavalcanti is examining a trencher. It’s a nasty-looking, toothy piece of equipment that you’d ordinarily attach to the front of a Bobcat vehicle if you needed to dig a ditch in rocky soil. But Cavalcanti wonders how the trencher would work affixed to the arm of a massive warrior robot. “We want weapons that are dangerous to other robots — that can tear hoses and cut wires — but that don’t immediately risk killing the robot’s pilot,” he says.\nCavalcanti and his cofounders at MegaBots have a vision that you can summarize in three words: Giant. Fighting. Robots. “We are an entertainment company that builds robots,” he says, “and we’re trying to make robot battles a sport,” a hybrid of NASCAR, Transformers, and Ultimate Fighting Championship. Or perhaps an extra-large version of the TV series “Battlebots,” with human pilots sitting in the cockpit of the 16-foot-tall robots instead of safely outside of the ring, twiddling remote controls.\nAdvertisement\n“The idea that we can invent a completely new form of sports entertainment for the 21st century is a very big idea,” says Joshua Adler, a New Hampshire-based investor who was the first to back MegaBots. “Most professional sports were invented not in the 20th century, but in the 19th century. We think the time is right to introduce some new sports for the millennial generation and beyond.”\nIt won’t be easy, but MegaBots has already overcome some very long odds since it was founded in Somerville in 2014.\nCavalcanti studied engineering at Olin College in Needham, and then went to work for Boston Dynamics, a company that designed first-of-a-kind walking robots like BigDog and Atlas for the Department of Defense. (It’s now owned by Google.) Cavalcanti later helped create Artisan’s Asylum in Somerville, a communal workshop for artists, hobbyists, and entrepreneurs. He was also a contestant on a short-lived reality show on Discovery Channel called “The Big Brain Theory,” where teams competed in engineering challenges like bridge-building.\nAbout three years ago, he was brainstorming with Adler about different kinds of jobs that robots might be able to perform. “I was thinking about using robots to detect and fix pipeline leaks, and then we brainstormed about the construction industry — maybe they could lay bricks faster,” Adler says.\nMegaBots\nEarly MegaBots designs had the bot walking on two legs; more recently, the company has been using tank-like treads.\nEventually, Cavalcanti half-jokingly tossed out the idea of two robots fighting. “We were trying to be studious, and think about societally beneficial uses,” Adler says. “But I was like, ‘Giant robot battles — who wouldn’t watch that?’ I felt like somebody had to do it, and why not us?”\nAdvertisement\nIn June 2014, Adler wrote a check to allow Cavalcanti to form the company and start the design process. But other investors were hard to find in Boston, even after MegaBots had built a prototype robot that looked cool, but didn’t do much. “It was too early for us,” says Bob Higgins of Causeway Media Partners in Cambridge, a firm that invests in sports, media, and technology ventures.\nA crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter failed to raise the hoped-for $1.8 million, bringing in just $65,000. (The company received none of the cash, in accordance with the website’s rules.)\n“It probably would’ve been curtains at the end of 2014,” Adler says, if not for a sugar daddy who materialized at the last minute. Cavalcanti had met Carl Bass, chief executive of the design software company Autodesk, at a conference, and shown him concept drawings of what the MegaBots would look like. Bass wanted to get the team using Autodesk’s software for the project — instead of a competitor’s. That conversation turned into an offer of free workspace in San Francisco, a monetary lifeline, and a collaboration with the California-based company. Cavalcanti and MegaBots cofounder Matt Oehrlein packed up and headed west in December 2015.\nThey showed off versions of the robot — including one that blasted a car with grapefruit-sized paintballs — at various festivals around the Bay Area. But it wasn’t until Cavalcanti and Oehrlein decided to challenge Kuratas, a Japanese-made giant robot, to a duel that the notion of robot battles really started to build momentum. A YouTube video posted in June 2015 observed, “You have a giant robot, we have a giant robot. We have a duty to the science fiction lovers of this world to fight them to the death.” It has been seen more than 7 million times, and it led to another Kickstarter campaign, which sought to raise funds to prepare for the face-off. That one successfully raised $554,000.\nThe company has now raised just over $4 million in funding. Investors in California, Adler says, “were not obsessed with the plausibility of the idea, but the size of the idea. They wanted to know, ‘What is the maximum potential of this if this works? That’s the lesson they’ve learned from companies like Google and Facebook and Uber.”\nScott Kirsner/Globe Staff\nThe MegaBots Mark II robot in the Hayward, Calif. industrial facility where MegaBots designs and builds its robots.\nIn a rented warehouse in Hayward, MegaBots employees are racing to finish the third version of the robot — the one that will take on Kuratas. The initial challenge video said that the US vs. Japan match would take place in mid-2016, but that deadline blew by, and Cavalcanti now doesn’t want to be specific about when it might happen. As they test different weaponry, or gauge how serious it would be if a robot keeled over with the pilot inside, they’re producing short videos for YouTube. Some of the members of the MegaBots production crew also worked on the long-running science show “Mythbusters,” filmed just a few miles up the highway. (“Mythbusters” co-host Jamie Hyneman has also done some consulting work for MegaBots, but says via e-mail, “I detest competitions.”)\nCavalcanti says the objective is to accumulate an online following before negotiating with networks who might want to become the ESPN of the future robot fighting league. “What you see on YouTube is a very deliberate strategy,” he says. “We want to own our brand, produce our own content, and build our own audience.” At that point, he adds, “the conversations with the networks are very different, versus when you go in with zero leverage.”\nMegaBots\nThe GunCam Alpha Prototype.\nGreg Munson, co-creator of the show “Battlebots,” which just finished its second season on ABC, says that approach may prove wise.\nBut there will still be challenges on the way to becoming anything approaching a mainstream sport. One is how expensive it will be for a team to build its own MegaBot to participate in the league; Cavalcanti estimates it at about $500,000 for parts, not including assembly time. By contrast, building a Battlebot costs about $15,000 to $20,000, Munson says. Another challenge, he adds, will be forging a set of rules so that clashes will be exciting, as opposed to “rip-your-face-off-boring.”\n“The challenge Gui and Matt have as they’re building the sport is to ensure that the entertainment value is there — things like which weapons are going to be awesome but not kill the pilots,” Munson says. They’ll also need to raise even more capital.\nDespite the hurdles, Munson is enthusiastic about MegaBots. “I don’t know about you, but I’d have a front row seat to watch two giant mechs battle,” he says, describing Battlebots and MegaBots as cousins. “We’re the smaller, anyone-can-get-into-it league, and MegaBots is the next level up.”\nOne direction for the future of entertainment is that it will be dominated by videogames, movies, and immersive virtual reality, which can all be enjoyed without leaving home. But the founders and backers of MegaBots are betting that in-person events will still have pull.\n“People want reasons to come together and have fun and cheer,” Adler says. “I don’t see how giant robot battles can fail.”\nScott Kirsner can be reached at kirsner@pobox.com .

      "text": " Google+\nHanna Barczyk for The Boston Globe\nBy Sasha Chanoff November 25, 2016\nT he Obama administration’s decision to bring in 110,000 refugees next year, a small percentage of the overall immigration the United States will see from around the world, will benefit America in significant ways.\nRefugee resettlement has played a valuable role in revitalizing towns and cities that have declined and stagnated economically. Contrary to anti-refugee rhetoric that shuns and maligns, refugees contribute to job growth, our economy, and our lives.\nAdvertisement\nAs a bellwether town for the impact of refugees on a local community, Lewiston, Maine, stands as an important national example. In 2001, Somali refugees from across the United States began arriving en masse, drawn by cheap rents and safe school opportunities. The mayor asked them to stop coming. “Our city is maxed out financially, physically, and emotionally,” he wrote in an open letter. At that time, similar to today, antirefugee rhetoric emboldened xenophobia. A white supremacist group came to Lewiston to protest what they considered an invasion.\nBut Somalis saw a chance to open businesses in a town that had declined since the 1970s with the loss of the mill industry. Restaurants and shops took root in the decaying town center that residents referred to as “the combat zone.” It’s taken hard work and cooperative spirit, but Somalis today are integrated, and some, like Zamzam Mohamud, whom the mayor appointed to the school board, have become icons of community engagement. Crime has gone down, according to the police chief. A few years after Somalis began arriving, Inc. magazine named Lewiston one of the best places to do business in America.\nThis is not a unique story. St Louis has one of the largest Bosnian refugee populations in the country, many of them Muslims. They began arriving two decades ago and rebuilt their lives and brought prosperity. A local bank took a chance early on, providing loans to buy houses, invest in properties, and open restaurants, bakeries, repair shops, trucking businesses, and cleaning companies. Bosnian entrepreneurship has created jobs and opportunities for other Americans as well. The population of some 70,000 is credited with bolstering sagging school enrollment, invigorating the city center, revitalizing neighborhoods, and stabilizing the city’s decline.\nBosnians in Utica, N.Y., along with Somalis, Burmese, and other refugees stemmed the tide of population decline there and have contributed to such a high degree that the mayor of Utica continues to welcome refugees, including Syrians. A PBS NewsHour report highlights that “Utica’s commitment to resettle refugees isn’t purely humanitarian — its open-door policy is also a pioneering economic tool for revitalizing the Rust Belt.”\nWhile some express concern that refugees take jobs away from Americans, I certainly didn’t see that in my own work as a refugee job developer in the 1990s in Boston, where refugees often took positions that employers couldn’t otherwise fill. More broadly, The New York Times cites a recent study indicating that immigration is “integral to the nation’s economic growth because immigrants bring new ideas and add to an American labor force that would be shrinking without them.”\nAdvertisement\nRefugee resettlement, of course, is not a uniformly rosy picture. Today’s refugees, similar to Irish, German, Italian, and other immigrants who arrived in previous centuries, struggle to gain a foothold in America, and, in addition, grapple with the traumas of warfare.\nBut we are not at risk of being overrun or harmed by terrorists, as those with little knowledge of our refugee resettlement program claim. Rather, we have an effective system to select carefully those with few or no other options for survival, who then go through an average of two years of interviews, vetting, and security checks before they can finally travel here.\nMore than 3.2 million refugees have come to the United States since 1975. They are social workers, farmers, artisans, shopkeepers, doctors, teachers, engineers and others. They can apply for a green card after a year and citizenship after five, with additional security checks at each point. They go to school, marry, raise families, and contribute to our ethos of hard work, striving, and resilience. Those of us who know them understand that they better us as a nation.\nWhen we are welcoming, a national characteristic rooted in our founders’ search for freedom from persecution and tyranny, we strengthen the social and economic fabric of our towns and cities, and the moral character that has distinguished us. When we malign and shut out refugees, we are not only harming them, we are also limiting our own ability to prosper.\nSasha Chanoff is the founder and executive director of RefugePoint, a humanitarian organization aiding refugees, and the co-author (along with David Chanoff) of From Crisis to Calling: Finding Your Moral Center in the Toughest Decisions.

      "text": "Add these 5 calendars to Google Calendar Add these 5 calendars to Google Calendar Subscribing to existing and curated calendars is a great way to put your Google Calendar to work for you. Here are five important calendars to get you started. Add these 5 calendars to Google Calendar 0 Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET \nOnce you get into the habit of regularly adding events and tasks to your calendar, it can become an irreplaceable asset to your digital organization. But calendars can be used for so much more than scheduling meetings or remembering birthdays. \nYou can subscribe to existing calendars, share calendars with your friends or family or even keep up with when your favorite show will return to TV. \nHere are some of the most useful things you can add to your Google Calendar to put it to work for you. Weather \nBefore it met its untimely demise, one of my favorite features of Sunrise Calendar was its inline display of the weather forecast. Fortunately, Google has a weather feature built into Google Calendar, at least for the web client. Enlarge Image Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET \nTo enable weather forecasts, go to calendar.google.com and login to your account. Click on the cog icon dropdown in the upper right and select Settings . Scroll down to location and enter your home ZIP code. Below that, beside Show weather based on my location , select either Celsius or Fahrenheit. \nA 5-day forecast will now appear in the upper right portion of each day display in the calendar. Favorite sports team schedule \nAnother helpful inbuilt function is the ability to add interesting calendars. Outside the usual holiday calendars or birthdays are sports. You can choose from baseball, basketball, cricket, football, hockey, rugby and soccer. Each category has a list of included leagues, ranging from collegiate to minor and major leagues from around the world. \nAfter you narrow down the results to the proper league, find your favorite team and click Subscribe . Once the selected team's schedule is available, it will automatically appear in your calendar. TV episodes \nSadly, Google's selection of calendars to add is fairly limited. If you want more, such as a custom calendar including when all your favorite television shows air and or return to television, you're going to have to do some manual configuration. \nSeveral services will allow you to sign up, add your favorite shows and export them to a Google Calendar for a monthly fee. However, PoGDesign TV Schedule & Episode Calendar will allow you to do this completely free of charge. Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET \nOpen your browser and head to www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat and click Register . Fill out the appropriate forms and begin adding television shows to your filter. Once you have added all your favorite shows, right click the .iCal button at the top of the page and copy the address URL. Go to calendar.google.com and click the drop down menu beside Other calendars . Select Add by URL , paste the iCal URL in the text field and click Add Calendar . The days and air times of your selected shows will now be added to your Google Calendar automatically. Movie releases \nYou can also add a calendar with all the release dates of new movies for individual countries. For the US, the best movie release calendar I came across was provided by First Showing . (For other countries, you can add a Google Calendar that is built from IMDb's release schedules here .) \nTo add the calendar to your Google Calendar, go to firstshowing.net/schedule2016 . Click on the Google Calendar button. This will open the web view of the calendar. Click the Google Calendar button with the plus sign in the lower right corner. When your own Google Calendar loads, confirm that you want to subscribe to the calendar. \nYou will now see all the major upcoming movie releases in the US for all of 2016. Facebook events Enlarge Image Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET \nFor the most part, I've always made it a point to avoid Facebook events. They're mostly filled with spammy invitations from people I knew in high school and haven't spoken with since. However, if you subscribe to events from your favorite artists, bands or venues, you can receive notifications for events you actually care about that are happening near you. \nYou can subscribe to these events in your Google Calendar by navigating to facebook.com/events and right-clicking Upcoming Events under the Events Happening This Week section in the right sidebar. Copy the address URL and go to calendar.google.com . Click the drop-down menu beside Other calendars and select Add by URL . Paste the calendar URL in the text field and click Add Calendar . Bonus: Skimm Ahead \nIf you're looking for something a little different, theSkimm just released its curated calendar, called Skimm Ahead, which has all the important stuff you could hope to follow on a calendar. It will add events for things like upcoming airings of popular TV shows and movie releases, holidays, important events and more. And for stuff like Father's Day or July 4, Skimm Ahead will remind you well in advance to make reservations or purchase a gift so you don't wait until the last minute. \nThe downside? It doesn't integrate with Google Calendar, it's only available on iOS and will cost you $2.99 per month. But the value in following a highly curated calendar is undeniable. Share your voice ",

      "text": "The next time you enter a query into Google's search engine or consult the company’s map service for directions to a movie theater, remember that a big brain is working behind the scenes to provide relevant search results and make sure you don't get lost while driving.\nWell, not a real brain per se, but the Google Brain research team. As Fortune's Roger Parloff wrote , the Google Brain research team has created over 1,000 so-called deep learning projects that have supercharged many of Google's products over the past few years like YouTube, translation, and photos. With deep learning , researchers can feed huge amounts of data into software systems called neural nets that learn to recognize patterns within the vast information faster than humans.\nIn an interview with Fortune , one of Google Brain's co-founders and leaders, Jeff Dean, talks about cutting-edge A.I. research, the challenges involved, and using A.I. in its products. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat are some challenges researchers face with pushing the field of artificial intelligence? \nA lot of human learning comes from unsupervised learning where you're just sort of observing the world around you and understanding how things behave. That's a very active area of machine-learning research, but it's not a solved problem to the extent that supervised learning is.\nSo unsupervised learning refers to how one learns from observation and perception, and if computers could observe and perceive on their own that could help solve more complex problems? \nRight, human vision is trained mostly by unsupervised learning. You're a small child and you observe the world, but occasionally you get a supervised signal where someone would say, \"That's a giraffe” or “That's a car.\" And that's your natural mental model of the world in response to that small amount of supervised data you got.\nWe need to use more of a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. We're not really there yet, in terms of how most of our machine learning systems work.\nCan you explain the A.I. technique called reinforcement learning? \nThe idea behind reinforcement learning is you don't necessarily know the actions you might take, so you explore the sequence of actions you should take by taking one that you think is a good idea and then observing how the world reacts. Like in a board game where you can react to how your opponent plays. Eventually after a whole sequence of these actions you get some sort of reward signal.\nReinforcement learning is the idea of being able to assign credit or blame to all the actions you took along the way while you were getting that reward signal. It's really effective in some domains today.\nI think where reinforcement learning has some challenges is when the action-state you may take is incredibly broad and large. A human operating in the real world might take an incredibly broad set of actions at any given moment. Whereas in a board game there's a limited set of moves you can take, and the rules of the game constrain things a bit and the reward signal is also much clearer. You either won or lost.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nIf my goal was to make a cup of coffee or something, there's a whole bunch of actions I might want to take, and the reward signal is a little less clear.\nBut you can still break the steps down, right? For instance, while making a cup of coffee, you could learn that you didn't fully ground the beans before they were brewed--and that it resulted in bad coffee. \nRight. I think one of the things about reinforcement learning is that it tends to require exploration. So using it in the context of physical systems is somewhat hard. We are starting to try to use it in robotics. When a robot has to actually take some action, it’s limited to the number of sets of actions it can take in a given day. Whereas in computer simulations, it's much easier to use a lot of computers and get a million examples.\nIs Google incorporating reinforcement learning in the core search product? \nThe main place we've applied reinforcement learning in our core products is through collaboration between DeepMind [the AI startup Google bought in 2014] and our data center operations folks. They used reinforcement learning to set the air conditioning knobs within the data center and to achieve the same, safe cooling operations and operating conditions with much lower power usage . They were able to explore which knob settings make sense and how they reacted when you turn something this way or that way.\nThrough reinforcement learning they were able to discover knob settings for these 18 or however many knobs that weren't considered by the people doing that task. People who knew about the system were like, \"Oh, that's a weird setting,\" but then it turned out that it worked pretty well.\nWhat makes a task more appropriate for incorporating reinforcement learning? \nThe data center scenario works well because there are not that many different actions you can take at a time. There's like 18 knobs, you turn a knob up or down, and you're there. The outcome is pretty measurable. You have a reward for better power usage assuming you're operating within the appropriate margins of acceptable temperatures. From that perspective, it's almost an ideal reinforcement learning problem.\nAn example of a messier reinforcement learning problem is perhaps trying to use it in what search results should I show. There's a much broader set of search results I can show in response to different queries, and the reward signal is a little noisy. Like if a user looks at a search result and likes it or doesn't like it, that's not that obvious.\nHow would you even measure if they didn't like a certain result? \nRight. It's a bit tricky. I think that's an example of where reinforcement learning is maybe not quite mature enough to really operate in these incredibly unconstrained environments where the reward signals are less crisp.\nWhat are some of the biggest challenges in applying what you've learned doing research to actual products people use each day? \nOne of the things is that a lot of machine learning solutions and research into those solutions can be reused in different domains. For example, we collaborated with our Map team on some research. They wanted to be able to read all the business names and signs that appeared in street images to understand the world better, and know if something's a pizzeria or whatever.\nIt turns out that to actually find text in these images, you can train a machine learning model where you give it some example data where people have drawn circles or boxes around the text. You can actually use that to train a model to detect which pixels in the image contain text.\nThat turns out to be a generally useful capability, and a different part of the Map team is able to reuse that for a satellite-imagery analysis task where they wanted to find roof tops in the U.S. or around the world to estimate the location of solar panel installations on rooftops.\nFor more about Google, watch: \n\nAnd then we've found that the same kind of model can help us on preliminary work on medical imaging problems. Now you have medical images and you're trying to find interesting parts of those images that are clinically relevant.\n ",

      "text": " Google+\nThe author’s children, Noel and Natalia, with Florence Henderson.\nBy Michael Vega Globe Staff November 25, 2016\nI still carry Florence Henderson’s business card. Florence gave it to me some eight years ago when we first met at the airport in Indianapolis. We were headed home the day after she had performed “America the Beautiful” and I had covered the Indianapolis 500 for The Boston Globe.\nI fished her well-worn card out of my wallet Friday morning, the day after Thanksgiving, to fondly remember the chance encounter I had with the woman whose enduring role as Carol Brady on “The Brady Bunch” made her so beloved.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Florence Henderson passed away on Thanksgiving Night from heart failure at age 82, a generation was left to mourn the loss of America’s Mom.”\nMe? I simply mourned the loss of a woman with whom I struck up a fast friendship that day as we stood side-by-side, collecting our belongings at the TSA security checkpoint at the Indianapolis airport.\nAt first, truth be told, I didn’t even notice Florence standing there beside me as I collected my carry-on luggage after passing through the metal detector. It wasn’t until I noticed the exuberant reaction of TSA security workers who were all abuzz over Florence’s presence that I glimpsed a petite blonde woman out of the corner of my right eye.\nView Story Florence Henderson, ‘The Brady Bunch’ mom, dead at 82 Florence Henderson went from Broadway star to television icon when she became Carol Brady, the ever-cheerful matriarch of “The Brady Bunch.”\nPhotos: Henderson through the years Saying goodbye to Florence Henderson\nWhen I turned to see what all the fuss was about, I was stunned to see Florence standing next to me.\nIf a comic-strip thought balloon had suddenly popped up over my head at the time, it would have read: “Holy (expletive)! It’s Florence Henderson!’’\nThe author and Florence Henderson.\nAdvertisement\nI immediately seized upon the opportunity to extend my hand and introduce myself.\n“You know, for the better part of two decades, I’ve been covering the Indianapolis 500 for The Boston Globe,’’ I said, “and I have to confess every year the moment that has given me the biggest goose pimples is at the start of the race when you sing ‘America the Beautiful’ and Jim Nabors sings ‘Back Home Again in Indiana.’”\nI told her how it remained a powerful moment that intensified each year I covered “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” because it signaled that it was time to go racing. I confessed to her that I had even become emotional about it that year.\nFlorence smiled widely. He sparkling blue eyes grew wide. She thanked me with warmth and appreciation.\nAs we strolled through the Indianapolis airport to our gates, we chatted about our destinations. I was headed home to Boston, I told her. She was headed to New York, she told me, to collect a Gracie Award for her self-named cable TV show on Retirement Living TV.\nAs it happened, when we reached our gates, our flights were delayed. So I seized upon another opportunity: “Florence, would you care to join me for coffee and a scone?”\nShe nodded. “Yes, that would be nice.”\nWe settled with our refreshments in a quiet corner of the waiting area, across the hall from our gates. We chatted about travel, our jobs, our families. But never once did I broach the subject about “The Brady Bunch.” It would have been too crass. I wanted to get to know Florence Henderson. Not just about Carol Brady.\nAs we sat there, chatting, three women approached us.\n“Do you think it would be OK if we got her autograph?” one of the women asked me.\n“I don’t know,’’ I replied. “Why don’t you ask her?’’\n“Of course it would be OK,’’ Florence said.\nAnd in that moment, it dawned on me why Florence felt so at ease in my company. It was, perhaps, that my imposing physical stature gave the rest of the world the outward appearance Florence Henderson was traveling with a private security guard.\nWhen one of the ladies handed me a camera and asked if Florence would pose for a photograph, she politely obliged.\nI took the picture.\nAfter they thanked her, Florence turned to me and said, “You know, in all my years of show business, I’ve learned one thing: It’s easy to be nice. It takes hard work to be mean.”\nAnd that, in essence, is what made Florence Henderson such a lovely lady.\nThat sentiment she shared resonated for me Friday when I studied the business card she handed me that day.\nShe gave it to me after I had mentioned I had set out to make some travel arrangements for the NBA Finals, anticipating a Celtics-Lakers matchup. I was surprised to learn she was a big sports fan, and an even bigger fan of the Celtics, largely because of her admiration for Larry Bird, with whom she shared a similar background having grown up in rural Southern Indiana.\nI was on my way back to Boston to resume coverage of the Celtics’ playoff run to the Eastern Conference finals against the Detroit Pistons. When I told her how I was anticipating a Celtics-Lakers matchup in the NBA Finals, and had made plans to stay at a Marriott hotel in Marina del Rey, Florence perked up.\n“Marina del Rey! Why, I live there! I know that hotel!”\nI seized upon another opportunity: “Well, Florence, I want to make you a promise: If the Celtics play the Lakers in the NBA Finals, I would love to take you out to lunch if I get out there.”\n“I would love that,’’ she said, handing me her card and, even, writing out her home address on it.\nIt cemented a friendship, and my unwavering status as a card-carrying member of the Florence Henderson fan club.\nMy boss, Joe Sullivan, roared with delight when I returned and told him how I had met Florence Henderson on the way home from Indy. I even showed him her card as proof. I told him how I had wanted him to join me for lunch with Florence if we got out to LA. Joe roared even harder.\nSadly, I never made it out to L.A. for the NBA Finals.\nI had been informed that I would be needed to cover a NASCAR race in Michigan to advance the big July race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. As we sat next to each other on press row, soaking up the Celtics’ series-clinching victory over Detroit in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, Joe Sullivan turned to me and asked, “Well, Mike, the Celtics are headed to the NBA Finals. What do you think about that?’’\n“Joe,’’ I replied. “I’m happy for the Celtics, but I have to say I’m a bit crestfallen for myself, because I know I won’t be having lunch with Florence Henderson.”\nJoe let out a huge belly laugh.\nI covered the first two games of the NBA Finals in Boston, but pulled away to head back to Detroit to cover the NASCAR race. I had called and left message on Florence’s voicemail that, sadly, I wouldn’t be coming out to L.A. because I had been dispatched to another assignment.\nAs I was leaving Ford Racing headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., after an interview session with several drivers and car owners, my cellphone rang. I fumbled around for my phone and nearly swerved off the road when I heard a familiar voice on the other end say, “Hello, Michael, it’s Florence Henderson . . .”\nI literally pulled into a parking lot to take the call.\n“Florence, I’m so sorry to tell you, but my boss has decided not to send me to L.A., because I’ve got to cover a NASCAR race here in Michigan in preparation for a race in New Hampshire in a few weeks,’’ I said. “So I’m afraid we won’t be able to have lunch together, like I promised.”\n“What is your boss’s name?” she asked.\n“Joe Sullivan.”\n“Well, you need to tell Joe Sullivan he needs to send you out here to cover the NBA Finals!” she said, firmly but jokingly.\n“I’ll let him know,’’ I said. “But I was sort of selfishly hoping to have him come join us for lunch, so he could meet you . . . and so he could pick up the tab.”\nIt wasn’t until later that year, when the Red Sox were out in Anaheim for a divisional series against the Angels, that I finally met up with Florence for lunch. We had played phone tag the first couple of days I was out on the West Coast. Florence finally caught up with me on a Friday afternoon as I was sitting in the middle of a pregame press conference with Angels manager Mike Scioscia.\nWhen I fumbled for my phone and saw “Florence Henderson” on the caller I.D., I knew it was a call I had to take.\n“Florence, hi, I’m in the middle of a press conference with Mike Scioscia, but I’m glad you called,’’ I said.\n“Mike Scioscia! I loved him when he played for the Dodgers! Please tell him I said hello,’’ Florence requested.\n“I’ll make sure to do that.”\nWe set a lunch date for the next day at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey. I scribbled down the specific directions Florence gave me regarding the best route to avoid traffic.\nWhen the press conference was over, I walked up to Scioscia and said, “Oh, by the way, Florence Henderson says hello.”\nScioscia looked at me in surprise. “How do you know Florence Henderson?”\n“Oh,’’ I shrugged, rather nonchalantly. “We go way back.’’\nThat evening, the Sox beat the Angels to clinch the series, leaving me free to enjoy lunch with Florence on Saturday afternoon at Marina del Rey.\nBecause of traffic, I was late arriving the Ritz by a half hour, but Florence was there waiting for me in the lobby when I finally pulled up. She couldn’t have been more gracious, even giving me a peck on the cheek when we saw each other.\nAs we settled into our table to lunch al fresco on a veranda overlooking the marina, Florence reported that she could only stay until 3:30 because she had made early dinner plans with Carol Burnett.\nI chuckled to myself when I imagined what Florence’s calendar that day had looked like:\n“Lunch with Mike Vega.’’\n“Dinner with Carol Burnett.”\n“Florence,’’ I said, “You should’ve told Carol Burnett she could have joined us for lunch.”\nInstead, Florence Henderson chose to spend the afternoon with me. I felt honored and privileged to dine with America’s Mom. I complimented her on her cable TV show, which I had watched, and remarked how she was a great interviewer, a skill she had honed as one of the first female guest hosts of the “Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.”\nWhen I told her how she was beloved by a generation of fans my age as an iconic matriarch, Florence admitted she never fully appreciated that until she was invited to a gala at Universal Studios and was approached by Jodie Foster, who shared in that adoration of her.\nAt the end, I promised to invite Florence as my date to the Texas Motor Speedway Media Dinner at Indy the following year. Sadly, I was unable to attend the race in 2009 when I fell ill. When I returned in 2010, I had Florence on my arm.\nI felt the eyes of the racing world on us when we walked into the swank seafood restaurant in downtown Indy. My media colleagues were left agape when I walked in with Florence, . I felt like I was in a tsunami of paparazzi.\nWe sat next to each other, but we hardly spoke because she was busy engaged in dinner conversation with the other guests at our table. At the end of the dinner, she obliged when someone asked if she could pose for a photo. Then, turning to me, she asked, “Can someone take a photo of me and Mike?”\nI felt like the awkward big kid who had come to the dance with the Homecoming Queen.\nWhen I posted that treasured photo on my Facebook page as my new profile picture, I immediately got an angry response from my 10-year-old daughter, Natalia, who demanded to know why her photo had been replaced by one of Florence and me.\nNatalia’s hard-line stance softened when she and her younger brother, Noel, and my wife, Barbara, got to finally meet Florence at a Sunday brunch in Marina del Rey, the day after I had covered Boston College’s 35-7 loss at Southern Cal in 2013.\nShe brought autographed photos for the kids and a bound copy of script synopses from her show for Barb and myself.\nMy colleague, Christopher L. Gasper, joined us at brunch and peppered Florence with questions about her career and her role as Carol Brady on “The Brady Bunch.” We all posed for a photo afterward. It was the last time I saw her.\nWe kept up through the years, with phone calls, texts, and Christmas cards, hers always one of the first to arrive in the mail.\nWhen she appeared as a contestant on “Dancing with the Stars,” it became appointment television in our household. I texted her that I would try to coalesce the media vote on her behalf.\nLate last month, my wife got word that Florence would be appearing at a corporate function at Gillette Stadium and that maybe it would be nice to see her. I texted Florence, but she didn’t text back until after she had arrived late at night.\nShe would be going nonstop, she said, and would depart soon afterward, leaving no time for a visit. She sent along her best wishes to Barb and the kids.\nI texted back: “Florence, you are without a doubt the hardest-working (and most beloved) woman in show business! All our love, The Vegas.”\nShe replied, simply, with three emojis: two smiley faces and a heart.\nThat was Florence Henderson. A lovely lady.",

      "text": " Google+\nDavid Becker/Reuters\nDemonstrators protested the election of Donald Trump at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Las Vegas.\nBy Michelle Singletary Washington Post November 25, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Boycotts have long been a way for consumers to voice their discontent.\nIf money walks, policies or business practices sometimes change.\nAdvertisement\nBut would a boycott work against President-elect Donald Trump, who has angered many people by his actions and politics and who has a vast corporate empire that could create conflicts of interest?\nThere is a growing campaign on Twitter with the hashtag #grabyourwallet to boycott companies that do business with Trump or carry Trump-branded merchandise, including items sold by his daughter Ivanka.\nI asked readers to share their thoughts on this financial protest. Here’s what folks had to say, starting with those who support a boycott:\n■ “Boycotting Trump products by voting with your dollars is a peaceful, effective way for people to demonstrate their democratic views,” one reader wrote. “I hope this social media boycott effort builds momentum as we engage in the holiday shopping season.”\n■ Lorna Gilkey of Alexandria, Quote: : “I will not support any company that would seek to help a man who ran on a platform of hatred.”\nAdvertisement\n■ Debbie Anderson of Summerville, Quote: : “I’m a big believer of letting my dollars do my talking. While I realize my pittance doesn’t make a difference for a huge company, if people band together, we can effect change.”\n■ “I think the real issue here is the lack of a firewall between Trump’s business and the presidency,” wrote Dina from Philadelphia. “Even if these are the most honest people in the world, the appearance of a conflict of interest can never go away if his children are running his business. Of course they are going to consult their father about business issues. Of course, they will have access to information that the average businessperson will not. As president, can he make any decision without considering the impact to his business? You cannot expect that what is best for Trump Inc. will always be best for America.”\nHere are comments from readers opposed to a Trump boycott:\n■ Jan McCarthy of Keswick, Quote: : “I think the attempts to boycott the Trump brand, and anything else these protesters are doing, are pure spite and revenge. I will be contacting these same retailers with my opposing view, and will not buy any products from any of them who capitulate and kowtow to these boycott bullies.”\n■ “I can understand why people would want to boycott anything connected to Trump products and services,” wrote Stephanie Battles of Mitchellville, Md. “However we must realize that there are unintended consequences. A boycott will harm workers.”\n■ Leslie Stompor of Naperville, Quote: : “I don’t think it makes sense to boycott stores that carry Trump products. Just don’t buy the Trump stuff, and the stores will stop carrying it all on their own. Vote with your dollar!”\nI’ve waged my own boycotts when I’ve felt aggrieved or objected to a way company is doing business. I’m just glad that I live in a country where you have the freedom to support or protest a cause so that your voice can be heard.\nMichelle Singletary can be reached at michelle.singletary @washpost.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Megan Woolhouse Globe Staff November 26, 2016\nT he thief who plucked the package from Kate Brozek’s front porch in Jamaica Plain did not exactly win the lottery. The pilfered parcel contained a $35 jumpsuit ordered from the online consignment store poshmark.com .\nOver in East Boston, scoundrels swiped a pair of $60 shoes from Joanne Pomodoro’s porch. And in West Roxbury, someone snatched an auto part delivered to Victor DiModica’s doorstep.\nAdvertisement\n“I still can’t believe someone had the nerve to just walk right up, take the package, and walk away,” DiModica said.\nPorch piracy has become so common — and such an annoyance — that retailers, the Postal Service, and other carriers are deploying an array of high- and low-tech countermeasures to protect packages. FedEx now allows some customers receiving computers and expensive electronics to put their packages on hold for pickup at one of its retail outlets, and Amazon.com has installed secure lockers at 7-Elevens and Speedways in and around Boston to keep deliveries safe. US Postal Service carriers will often take the added step of tucking deliveries out of public view.\nThe package theft threat has been a boon for home security companies, boosting demand for video cameras, infrared motion detectors, and $200 “video doorbells” that let homeowners monitor every move on their doorsteps. Want to address a stranger on your porch even though you are at work? You can communicate through a video intercom linked to your mobile phone.\n“There’s a boatload of stuff for sale on the Internet” to help consumers, said Chris Caplice, executive director of MIT’s Center for Transportation & Logistics. “That’s because it’s a problem. It’s a nonsuccessful delivery, so it has a cost and businesses are very much trying to improve that.”\nThe severity of the problem is difficult to quantify. Research by Edelman Intelligence found that nearly 11 million US homeowners had a package stolen within the past year, but like many other studies of its kind, it was paid for by a home security company .\nAdvertisement\nThe US Postal Service and FedEx expect their holiday deliveries to surge to record highs this year, but they do not disclose data on package thefts. Online retail giant Amazon declined to provide data on delivery volumes, never mind thefts.\nTo take just one local example, just two days before Thanksgiving, Cambridge police issued an advisory noting that 116 packages had been stolen this year from residences, with an increase in November over prior months. A majority of the thefts occurred during the daytime from front porches and unlocked apartment lobbies.\nThere is a growing trove of video evidence of package thefts available on the Internet, thanks to the proliferation of camera-equipped home security systems, including SimpliSafe and Blink, which are both made by Boston-area companies.\nPeter Besen, CEO of Blink, an offshoot of semiconductor company Immedia Inc. in Andover, said although the company is not yet a year old, sales of its security systems have grown 10 percent month over month because the system works so well.\nring.com\nA video screengrab from ring.com.\n“You can see what’s going on in real time, with less than a second delay,” Besen said. “You can call the police and the person is actually captured in the video.”\nCapturing a person by video is, of course, different than actually capturing a thief.\nBoston police Lieutenant Detective Michael McCarthy said police have issued fliers and used social media to warn residents about package thefts, particularly in dense neighborhoods like South Boston and the South End that tend to be targeted.\nMcCarthy said police recently arrested an unidentified person “responsible for a number of thefts” in South Boston.\nLast December, a Haverhill duo were arrested for staking out delivery trucks and scooping up packages as fast as delivery trucks could dole them out. Sophisticated porch pirates in California hacked the locations of UPS trucks to intercept deliveries last year. Residents of Corona, Calif., fed up after a rash of package thefts, left decoy boxes containing dog excrement on their porches in an effort to surprise thieves.\nEast Boston resident Joanne Pomodoro said she gave up ordering merchandise online after a pair of shoes from Urban Outfitters was taken from her doorstep in October. The retailer replaced the shoes, but Pomodoro, a social worker, said after experiencing problems with other deliveries that arrived late or to the wrong address, the theft was the last straw.\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nA package on the deck of a home on Putnam Avenue in Cambridge.\n“I’ve had it,” she said.\nBrozek, the Jamaica Plain resident whose jumpsuit was swiped, also found a low-cost solution.\n“Most of my Christmas shopping will be through Amazon,” she said, “and I’ll get those things delivered to work.”\nAmazon customers can also order the Ring “video doorbell,” which is only available online. The doorbell includes a two-way intercom, one-way camera, and motion sensor. A homeowner alerted to activity at the doorstep can confront an intruder directly from a cellphone using the doorbell intercom.\nJamie Siminoff, the company’s 40-year-old founder, said homeowners might ask a carrier to place a package in a hidden spot or surprise an intruder by saying, “Can I help you?” even if they’re not physically at home.\nA startled intruder might run away, he said, although it didn’t work out that way for DiModica, the West Roxbury resident whose auto part was stolen.\nThe 59-year-old installed a Ring doorbell at his two-family home to complement a home security system he had installed after a rash of burglaries in his neighborhood.\nThe car part he ordered on eBay arrived at his doorstep while he was at his job as manager of a Cambridge plumbing company.\nHe never got the delivery. Instead of the package, all he has now is a video of someone stealing it from his porch and hiding their face from the camera.\nDiModica doesn’t blame Ring, saying the system alerted him to an intruder on his cellphone, but he was too busy at work to respond.\n“He still got away with it,” DiModica said.\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nA package on the steps of a home on Beacon Street.\nMegan Woolhouse can be reached at megan.woolhouse@globe.com .",
