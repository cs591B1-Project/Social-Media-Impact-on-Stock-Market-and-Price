      "text": "Six Pixels of Separation - The Blog November 7, 2016 8:32 AM Samsung Brand Challenges, Instagram Goes After Amazon and Apple Is A Dongle Company - The Week's CTRL ALT Delete Segment On CHOM 97.7 FM \nEvery Monday morning at 7:10 am, I am a guest contributor on CHOM 97.7 FM radio broadcasting out of Montreal (home base). It's not a long segment - about 5 to 10 minutes every week - about everything that is happening in the world of technology and digital media. The good folks at CHOM 97.7 FM are posting these segments weekly on iHeart Radio, if you're interested in hearing more of me blathering away. I'm really excited about this opportunity, because this is the radio station that I grew up on listening to, and it really is a fun treat to be invited to the Mornings Rock with Terry and Heather B. morning show. The segment is called, CTRL ALT Delete with Mitch Joel . \nThis week we discussed: If you thought the whole Samsung Note 7 debacle was bad enough, the company just announced that a recall of close to 3 million Samsung washing machines after reports of... wait for it... explosions. Phones, washing machines... if the TVs come next, what is this brand to do? What is Instagram ? Many of us would say that it is one of the largest (and most popular) places to create and share images/videos. Over half a billion people use it. It is owned by Facebook . What if I told you that there's a thriving global marketplace on Instagram (that the brand has yet to acknowledge)? Now, what if I told you that Instagram is finally waking up to this , and it's going to start allowing people to both identify and eventually purchase products that they come across in photos from brands in their feed. Can Instagram make a run at Amazon ? Last week, I told you how excited I was about Apple 's new line of MacBook Pro computers. I bought mine. I'm still waiting on it. Well, imagine my surprise when I found out that every single connecting cable and dongle that I have won't work on this new computer? The MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are based on the new USB-C standard, and used for everything from video output to charging the computer. So... I'm not the only one with countless chargers and dongles that are now useless. Plus, buying new ones are quite expensive. Apple's solution ? After hearing enough complaints, they've decided to slash the price on accessories that use the new type of plugs. Many journalist are making the claim that Apple is in the dongle and charger business, and no longer in the computer manufacturing business. App of the week: Must . By Mitch Joel \nRelated Posts:",

      "text": "0 The new iPhone 7 smartphone is displayed inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S7 smartphone is seen at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, July 28, 2016. Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji Previous 1 of 2 Next \nApple and Samsung have been dominating the smartphone industry for a number of years now. The two tech giants will always be pitted against each other as both companies produce the world’s most popular mobile devices. Apple and Samsung currently have their respective flagship handsets out in the market, but exactly which of the two rival phones is better, the iPhone 7 or the Galaxy S7? \nWhile some analysts consider the iPhone 7 as a slightly remodelled iPhone 6S, the fact still remains that it is Apple’s best smartphone yet. The Samsung Galaxy S7, meanwhile, launched back in March to great reviews. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Design \nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 is extremely well-crafted, featuring a glass body framed in metal. But with all its appeal, the Galaxy S7’s glass housing cracks rather easily. The Samsung flagship phone is available in five colours: black, white, silver, gold and pink gold. \nWhile the iPhone 7 might be the most attractive phone Apple has made, it still sports the same look as the iPhone 6. The handset is not heavy on the hand and is smaller than its Samsung rival due to its screen size. The iPhone 7 is available in five colours: silver, gold, rose gold, black and jet black. \nBoth phones are water resistant, but the Galaxy S7 is slightly better with its IP68 certification. This basically means that the Samsung phone can be somehow submerged into water while the IP67-rated iPhone 7 can only endure rain showers. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Display \nThe Galaxy S7 has a rich 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with 1,440 x 2,560 pixel resolution screen. Its Gorilla Glass 4 screen protector can reportedly tolerate a number of drops. \nThe 4.7-inch iPhone 7 features Apple’s Retina HD display with 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution. It displays colours and objects better than its predecessor. The new iPhone variant is also equipped with 3D Touch technology which allows users to access content via pressure-sensitive mechanics. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Performance \nThe Australian variant of the Galaxy S7 comes with Samsung’s own Exynos 8890 octa-core processor. The chipset is one of the best in the business and it makes the S7 one powerful computing machine. It has a 32 GB storage capacity with 4 GB of RAM. It comes with an expandable microSD slot that supports up to 256 GB. The US model of the S7, which is also distributed in other select regions, equips a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor and comes with an optional 64 GB internal storage. \nThe iPhone 7 is powered by the new A10 Fusion quad-core chipset, which is supposedly 40 percent faster than its predecessor, the A9. The new chipset can handle continuous and heavy chores. The iPhone 7 rarely lags and remains fluid and snappy on continuous use. Its stereo speakers are clean and crisp, but the missing headphone jack is a downside. The Apple smartphone has 4 GB of RAM and is available in three storage options: 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Camera \nThe Galaxy S7 has a 12 MP primary camera and a 5 MP secondary camera. The S7 main camera stands out with its dual pixel technology that provides faster focus. \nThe iPhone 7 also has a 12 MP camera that features a new quad LED flash that’s 50 percent brighter than that of the iPhone 6S. Although the Apple smartphone has a better secondary shooter at 7 MP, the Galaxy S7’s 5 MP selfie snapper can squeeze in more objects with its wider lens. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Battery & Charging \nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 is backed by a non-removable 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery that can provide 22 hours of talk time and 62 hours of music play. The iPhone 7 also has the same battery type but only with 1,960 mAh capacity. \nAccording to Trusted Reviews , the Galaxy S7 can last a whole day of regular use, while the iPhone 7 drains itself by night time. The Samsung handset also charges faster than the Apple flagship. The Galaxy S7 is fully charged within 75 minutes, while the iPhone takes an hour and a half to get to 100 percent battery life. The S7 also has wireless charging support which the iPhone 7 lacks. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Price \nThe iPhone 7’s 32 GB model is currently priced at $1,079 at the online Apple store. The 128 GB variant is available for $1,229 while the 256 GB model is priced at $1,379. The Galaxy S7 is available for $1,149 at the Samsung shop. \nThere are better deals available out there from other retailers, though. Kogan , for example, offers the iPhone 7’s 32 GB and 128 GB model at $999 and $1,219, respectively. They currently sell the Galaxy S7 at just $749. \nApple iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Verdict \nThe iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7 are two of the world’s best handsets. Both are capable and user-friendly. While the Galaxy S7 may have the bigger screen size, better camera and battery, the iPhone 7 boasts of its functional durability, loud speakers and innovative design. Any choice between the two is an excellent choice.",

      "text": "  Apple is selling refurbished iPhones again after an entire decade A refurbished iPhone is still considered quite a beneficial choice. EnStars on Nov 09, 2016 08:14 PM EST Tag : applie , iphones , refurbished iphones Sign Up for Newsletter NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 16: One of the first customers to buy a new iPhone walks out of an Apple store in Manhattan on September 16, 2016 in New York City. People around the globe waited in long lines to be among the first to purchase both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The phones offer longer battery life, faster browsing, a better camera and do not have a traditional headphone jack. Spencer Platt/Getty Images (Photo : Getty Images/Spencer Platt) \nWhen something is refurbished, it basically undergoes through a process of renewal and update which makes it fit to use in the modern day. \nSimilarly, if an iPhone is refurbished it means that it is a new yet old version of a phone which is fit to use for present times. This isn't a bad idea at all if discussed further. \nFor instance, the fact that Apple is selling these refurbished iPhones themselves and it is not some third party vendor, it ensures quality. If it is Apple then one can be sure that these old iPhone models are bound to be of good quality. Advertisement \nSecondly, this act increases the interaction between Apple and their customers. According to The Verge , this is the second time Apple is pulling off a stunt like this. The last time they did this was in 2007 and it was quite a success. \nFinally, refurbished phones are always much cheaper than they used to be. \nFor example, according to The Next Web , a 16 GB iPhone 6S is selling for USD 450. A 6S Plus 64 GB is selling for a mere USD 589. All of these include free shipping as well. \nIf this is not a good deal, then nothing is, the reason being that the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are not very old models. Yet when they came out before, they were very costly. \nNow that the 7 took the spotlight, their price has reduced but their model, their function, their usage, and their modern feel is still very up to date. \nApart from such, all refurbished phones sold from Apple will also get a full year's worth of factory warranty. \nFinally, all the new phones will be sold with new batteries and outer shells. This means the phone will almost literally be as good as new and no one would even be able to say it is refurbished. \n ",

      "text": "Apple TV Apps Can Now Be Purchased On iOS & macOS Devices   17:12 PST \nIt is clear that Apple does envision a future in which all of their products and services are linked to each other regardless of whether it runs on iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and so on. We’re already seeing that happen with iOS and macOS where you can sync your calendar, notes, contacts, and even receive phone calls and messages from your phone on your Mac. \nNow the good news for Apple TV owners is that if you come across a tvOS app while browsing on your macOS or iOS device, you’ll be able to purchase it and have it downloaded to your Apple TV when you launch it. Prior to this, tvOS app searches were pretty much limited to the Apple TV, meaning that sometimes you might forget or it might not be as convenient, like when you’re outside. \nBefore you get too excited, note that the iTunes App Store still won’t display tvOS exclusive apps. Instead how this works is through the iTunes Link Maker , meaning that websites can put a direct link to their Apple TV app on their website, which in turn will let iOS/macOS users purchase it via their tablets, phones, or computers and then download it on their Apple TV. \nFor users who have automatic downloads enabled on the Apple TV, this means that when you fire up the device you won’t need to go search for it as it should download itself automatically. \nFiled in Apple > Gadgets .

      "text": "Apple Pay Now The 5th Most Popular Online Payment Platform   17:11 PST \nEarlier this year Apple announced that Apple Pay would be coming to the web . Prior to this Apple Pay was only usable via brick and mortar retailers, but web payment meant that iOS users could soon use their mobile devices to authenticate their purchases and payments made online. \nSo how is Apple Pay for the web doing? While Apple Pay in real life doesn’t really seem to have gotten the amount of traction that many had expected, Apple Pay for the web seems to be doing pretty well . According to a report from SimilarTech , they claim that Apple Pay is currently the 5th most popular online payment platform at the moment. \nUnsurprisingly PayPal and PayPal Subscribe are currently the most popular, followed by Stripe in 3rd place and Braintree in 4th. Granted 5th place is exactly as glamorous as being in the top 3 or even in the first place, but given that Apple Pay has managed to beat out quite a lot of other platforms is pretty impressive considering that it is a much more recent option. \nWe can only expect that Apple Pay’s adoption for the web will grow, thanks to the introduction of Touch ID on the new MacBook Pros that will help facilitate the process. Whether or not Apple Pay will eventually manage to overthrow the likes of an established institution like PayPal remains to be seen. \nFiled in Apple > Web . Read more about apple pay .

      "title": "How Donald Trump's election as US President could affect Apple - AppleInsider (press release) (blog)",
      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Wednesday, November 09, 2016, 03:08 pm PT (06:08 pm ET) Anticipating the full impact of the election of Donald Trump is difficult because his campaign offered little in terms of real policy proposals, instead favoring high energy crowd rallies and the drawing of media attention through the use of incredible and often shocking comments. There are some clues as to what he might make priorities in his administration however. Source: Wall Street Journal An empowered FBI surveillance state While Trump's rival Hillary Clinton had worked with Silicon Valley tech leaders to draft articulated policies related to citizens' encryption rights, privacy, patent reform and education, Trump's website made no mention of any substantial ideas related to technology, innovation, privacy, intellectual property or education. However, Trump has garnered support from operatives in the Federal Bureau of Investigations, who used their positions to influence the election by teasing the prospect of an ongoing investigation into Clinton's email use. Last winter, when the FBI sought to force Apple to write code exploiting the security features of its own software, Apple pushed back while Trump, on the campaign trail, built a case for government interference in encryption tools. FBI director James Comey has a vast public record of desperately wanting to break encryption FBI director James Comey has a vast public record of desperately wanting to break encryption. Trump threatened a boycott of Apple, and professed the use of a Samsung Android phone, a platform that uses ineffective encryption that's easy to exploit. A Trump administration with a cozy relationship with surveillance-state investigators could leverage his position to attack his business rivals and anyone else he considered a threat. Trump regularly threatened to attack journalists and media outlets during his campaign, in the mold of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a dictator who Trump has regularly praised. Members of Congress--including prominent Republicans--have refused to empower the FBI to force companies like Apple to install security backdoors into their products. However, under the duress of an event similar to 9/11, citizens' rights to privacy could be slashed in a manner similar to the Patriot Act, legislation that Trump's running mate supported. Jobs at risk from isolationism Tech executives, including HP's chief executive Meg Whitman, herself a Republican candidate for California Governor in 2010, offered some bleak assessments of Trump's plans to, for example, add a 35 percent tariff on imported goods, noting that this \"would sink this country into a recession. It would penalize global companies that are trying to be competitive globally.\" Trump certainly gained some populist support by suggesting he would seek to induce companies like Apple to bring manufacturing jobs to the United States, as well as place caps on H-1B visas that many tech companies use to bring in skilled foreign workers. However, Apple has already attempted to create manufacturing jobs domestically, ranging from sourcing materials for its Mac Pro from American firms to obtaining iPhone screens and certain silicon components from domestic factories. Trump's plan to add a 35 percent tariff on imported goods \"would sink this country into a recession,\" - Meg Whitman The problem with bringing Shenzhen-style mass manufacturing to the United States is that America lacks the vast supply chain infrastructure and specialized tool and die experts that China has cultivated for decades. Further, American workers are largely not interested in working out of dorms in the massive manufacturing plants required to build tens of millions of devices on tight schedules to support Apple's blockbuster product launches. Instead, Apple has focused on creating app economy jobs in the U.S., investing in efforts to build an App Store marketplace and Xcode developer tools to support entrepreneurial software creation. Apple has paid out billions of dollars to domestic developers, creating high quality employment for modern knowledge workers. The rapid, large scale investment in the iOS App ecosystem has resulted in high paying jobs that attract talent to tech centers in San Francisco and Silicon Valley (including Facebook and Twitter), as well as spreading to other expanding tech scenes in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin, Boston, New York, Washington DC, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Miami and other cities around the country. By introducing caps on visas, rapidly growing tech companies in the U.S. will find it more difficult to bring in talent acquihired elsewhere, making it more attractive for companies like Apple to simply expand their overseas operations. Apple has already stepped up its efforts to build international development and research campuses, including facilities based in Ottawa, Canada ; Cambridge, England ; Herzliya, Israel ; Bengaluru, India , Shanghai, China ; Yokohama, Japan and many other sites. While perfect for exciting crowds, Trump's proposed protectionist policies would interfere with America's emerging markets related to app development and new technologies ranging from virtual reality to augmented reality and self-driving vehicles, with the likely unintended consequence of moving more valuable employment overseas, keeping tax-paying visa workers employed in foreign countries where they wouldn't contribute anything to America's tax base. New taxes on foreign earnings International companies like Apple are required by the United States to pay domestic taxes on foreign income, but only if those earnings are brought back into the U.S. Because of this, Apple has amassed over $200 billion in foreign earnings that it has held as being \"reinvested overseas.\" Trump's idea to tax foreign earnings at 10 percent was falsely portrayed by a poorly written Financial Times article by Daniel Thomas and Vanessa Houlder to sound like a tax holiday. Instead, Trump's proposal would levy a tax on overseas earnings whether they were imported or not. Such a plan would create chaos for companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others that are already being targeted by the European Commission, looking for ways to grab corporate cash at the expense of those companies' investors and employees. This would be particularly difficult if a Trump administration were also seeking to set up protectionist economic walls at the same time, potentially triggering a global recession related to economic uncertainty. American sharia and anti-intellectualism attacking tech employees Trump, along with his running mate Mike Pence, are climate change deniers who refuse to accept the findings of the global scientific community. Clean energy and power efficiency are not only rare economic opportunities for American business, but climate change itself is playing a major role in the increase of storm severity and in changes that are affecting existing businesses, notably agriculture. Apple has focused resources on addressing climate-related energy issues, but if U.S. policy shifts toward attacking science rather that listening to it, it will become more difficult and expensive for domestic companies to develop and invest in the technology needed to understand and respond to climate threats as they develop. If U.S. policy shifts toward attacking science rather that listening to it, it will become more difficult and expensive for domestic companies to develop and invest in the technology needed Rather than investing in renewable energy, Pence voted against it , as well as voting against limits on pollution. Pence, as governor of Indiana, has instead focused on religious lawmaking, signing the \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act\" designed to allow discrimination against others based on their sexual orientation. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff both took issue with the law as bad for business, with Benioff threatening to suspend all business in the state if it continued. Pence also voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a measure Apple supported in its efforts to support and attract diverse talent base among its suppliers and partners. On a national level, the less well-known Pence is likely to continue promoting an agenda of marginalizing minorities on a Federal level, causing new problems for businesses trying to recruit talent and forcing competent workers to seek employment in countries where religious laws aren't a factor. Trump rhetoric no guide to actual policy While Trump campaigned on a variety of slogans, the reality is that nobody knows what Trump will actually do. Many of his positions have radically changed, even many times just over the course of his campaign. While Trump campaigned on a variety of slogans, the reality is that nobody knows what Trump will actually do Trump has frequently crossed his own political party, but has also demonstrated a disinterest in actually acting as president, suggesting that he would delegate decisions to others while using the position to serve his own needs. While portraying himself as both a conservative and as a \"blue collar billionaire,\" Trump effectively promised to end abortion and to bring manufacturing back to the Rust Belt. But Trump has promised lots of things, and his own personal history includes no previous interest in anti-abortion politics nor in employing American workers. That makes it virtually impossible to imagine what a thin skinned Twitter agitator, who refused to reveal any of his tax returns (keeping a secret of the parties he owes money to internationally) might do when given control over the American presidency, with the authority to command the military and appoint Supreme Court nominees. Prior to becoming president, Trump also faces two federal trials over alleged federal racketeering related to his Trump University and allegedly defrauding consumers and the elderly, as well as a New York state investigation into his Trump Foundation.

      "text": "Anguel Dimov \nStuffing, or dressing as some call it, is perhaps one of my favorite parts of a holiday meal. There are so many delicious flavors and textures going on – it’s hard not to go back for seconds! \nThis apple and chestnut stuffing is basically the best of holidays combined in a single dish. The onions, celery, and fresh sage give the dish the savory feel you’d expect (and they smell wonderful when you’re cooking). But then the apple interjects crisp, slightly sweet bites; and chestnuts make it extra special for the occasion. If you’ve only ever made the boxed variety, stuffing from scratch may seem like a challenging dish to prepare; thankfully, this version is easy to pull together. With all the craziness of holiday meals, it’s nice to have at least one low-stress dish up your sleeve. \nOne of the tricks to a delicious stuffing is to get the bread right. It’s important to select a high quality loaf. This recipe features whole grain bread which is not only healthier, but also makes it extra sturdy (a good thing for baked stuffing). Toasting the bread cubes is a necessary first step. You want to toast the bread until its golden brown on the outside and dry through the center. This way, the bread will soak up the fragrant broth – without getting too soft and mushy. I don’t know about you, but a soggy bread stuffing makes me a bit sad. \nA quick note on preparing stuffing: I know there’s the age-old question of whether stuffing should be cooked inside or outside of the bird. My preference is to cook my stuffing on it’s own (rather than inside the bird). This helps to better control the cooking times required for each, and frankly, it eliminates the concern of bacteria. However, if you insist on stuffing your bird, you could most definitely give this recipe a go. It’ll be delicious either way! \nFor other stuffing recipes ideas, try this traditional bread stuffing with zucchini and mushrooms , or for something a little bit different, try this bulger stuffing with dried fruit .

      "text": "Ireland lodges appeal against Apple tax ruling Thursday, November 10, 2016 By Daniel McConnellPolitical Editor \nThe Government has restated its “profound disagreement” with the European Commission’s analysis which concluded Ireland gave Apple €13bn worth of State Aid. As a result, Ireland is now seeking an annulment of the decision. \nYesterday, Ireland’s appeal of the Apple tax ruling was lodged in the European Courts, ahead of tomorrow’s deadline. \nIn August, the European Commission ruled that Apple should pay €13bn in back taxes to Ireland. \nHowever, the Government here said the money is not in fact owed to Ireland and will appeal on that basis. \n“The Government disagrees profoundly with the Commission’s analysis in the Apple case, and our position on all aspects of the case is very well known,” a spokesman for Finance Minister Michael Noonan said last night. \nAfter those disagreements, Mr Noonan arranged for an appeal to be brought before the European courts. \n“Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union, asking it to annul the decision of the Commission,” the spokesman added. \nAttorney general Marie Whelan’s office has been preparing the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings. Our application will be lodged in the General Court of the EU. \n“As this topic is the subject of open legal proceedings, it will not be possible to comment further, in particular on any of the individual elements of the State’s legal case in defence of our position. This is important to ensure we do not prejudice our own legal case,” Mr Noonan’s spokesman said. \nThe US has said it might seek some of the €13bn after the European Commission said other countries might be able to stake a claim to the money, if it can prove the tax should have been paid there instead. \n© Irish Examiner Ltd.

Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) are fighting to retake buy points. Meanwhile, Nvidia ( NVDA ), Walt Disney ( DIS ), Acacia Communications ( ACIA ), e.l.f. Beauty ( ELF ) and a trio of department stores report earnings. Stocks To Watch \nApple fell last week, undercutting its 50-day moving average and its 110.33 buy point. The iPhone maker retook that entry on Monday. Shares fell as low as 108.05 on Wednesday, but settled down 0.2% to 110.88 on the stock market today , back above the pivot point. \nAlphabet briefly retook its 813.98 buy point on Tuesday, but closed below that level. Shares closed down 0.8% to 805.59, settling just below the 50-day line. Nvidia \nNvidia will report quarterly earnings after Thursday's closing bell. \nEstimates: EPS should climb 29.5% to 57 cents, with sales also up 25% to $1.69 billion. \nStock: Nvidia shares fell 1.7% Wednesday, but are still near record highs and have been in a strong uptrend for the last six months. With its chips serving PC gaming, autonomous driving and AI industries, Nvidia is well-position to offer insight into those markets. Walt Disney \nWalt Disney will report Q3 results after the close. \nEstimates: EPS should fall 3% to $1.16 as revenue rises fractionally to $13.516 billion. \nStock: Disney rose 0.3% as shares have been in a funk for nearly a year. Despite big box office hits, investors are worried about ESPN subscription losses and declining viewership. The post-earnings conference call has been key in recent quarters. Acacia Communications \nAcacia will report Q3 earnings after the close. \nEstimates: EPS of 84 cents on revenue of $130.92 million. There are no year-earlier comparisons for the May IPO. \nStock: Acacia shrugged off early losses, rebounding for a 2.4% gain. The fiber-optic components maker was red hot until early September, when shares began to tumble. Acacia has already raised Q3 guidance twice, so the focus may be on any guidance Acacia gives. e.l.f. Beauty \nE.l.f. Beauty will report Q3 earnings after the market close. \nEstimates: EPS of 1 cent and revenue of $53.95. There's no year-over-year comparisons for the recent IPO. \nStock: E.l.f. Beauty, which makes low-cost makeup sold at Target ( TGT ), Wal-Mart ( WMT ), and CVS Health ( CVS ), came public in late September and ran up for the first week. Since then the stock has been consolidating in a constructive fashion. \nShares fell 3.2% Wednesday. \nMacy's will report Q3 results before the market open. \nEstimates: EPS down 27% to 41 cents. Revenue off 4% to $5.63817 billion. \nStock: Macy's shares rose 1.35% Wednesday, continuing to move sideways after plunging from July 2015 to May 2016. \nInvestors may be more interested in Macy's holiday quarter outlook than its Q3 results. They'll also want to know how Macy's is doing in terms of boosting e-commerce sales and handling online rivals such as Amazon.com ( AMZN ). Kohl's \nKohl's will report Q3 results before the market open. \nEstimates: EPS down nearly 7% to 70 cents with sales down about 2% to $4.325 billion. \nStock: Kohl's rose 3.9%. The stock has been moving sideways after a downturn, forming a three-month base over its 200-day line. \nAs with Macy's, Kohl's holiday outlook will be key. Nordstrom \nNordstrom will report earnings after the close \nEstimates: EPS down 10.5% to 41 cents with sales up nearly 5% to $3.485 billion. \nStock: Nordstrom climbed 0.5%, trying to find support at its 50-day line. Shares briefly broke out of a base in early October but pulled with the market in the past two weeks. Other Earnings \nMichael Kors ( KORS ): Michael Kors, apparel and accessories maker and retailer, is expected to report EPS fell 13% to 88 cents and sales dip to $1.084 billion. \nMicrosemi ( MSCC ): Microsemi, chipmaker, should deliver 23% EPS growth to 90 cents as sales jump 36% to $448.07 million.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Target Black Friday ad arrives with Apple iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 The retailer offers the first deals on iPads, providing actual discounts instead of selling them at full price with store gift cards like in past years. | Topic: Hardware \nTarget is offering Kindle Fire tablet deals as a Thanksgiving doorbuster. \nAs Black Friday approaches, the ad from one of the big guns has leaked. Target is the first to fall -- we're still waiting on Best Buy and Walmart -- and as befits its status as one of the nation's leading retailers, it's the first one to include any Apple iPads, the former darling of Black Friday ads. And in a break from the past couple of years, the store appears to be offering straight-up discounts rather than selling the tablets for the full price then giving out store gift cards as the enticement. \nTarget highlights three Apple tablets in particular, including the iPad Pro, which has typically not been the, ahem, target of discounts. The base 9.7-inch model, regularly priced at $599, will be $150 less on Black Friday. If you look the size but don't need the more advanced features of the Pro, Target also has the iPad Air 2 for $274, or $125 less than the regular price. Finally, the venerable iPad mini 2 comes in just under $200 ($199.79) or about $70 less than Apple's current price. Black Friday 2016",

      "text": "Apple has been an a longstanding partner with the (RED) organization in its fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It will continue to back that fight presumably by donating at least some of the proceeds it makes from selling special edition Beats Pill+ and Beats Solo3 wireless headphones.\nThe products are now listed on Apple’s website with a new “Citrus Red” color, an option costing no different than other colors — the Pill+ at $229.95 and the Solo3 at $299.95 . Availability of these (PRODUCT)RED merchandise has not been pushed yet.\nThere has been much progress in the treatment, perhaps elimination of AIDS in a patient and the correction of the history of how HIV/AIDS came about in the US. But there’s always the need for more research to cover more ground worldwide [in (RED)’s case, specifically in Africa] and more money for it.\nApple has been supporting the effort, founded by U2 lead singer Bono, since its inception in 2006 with a special red iPod nano.\nThe post World AIDS Day is December 1 — Beats Solo3 in (PRODUCT)RED color previewed appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "In a curious turn of events, the French news site 01NetTV managed to get its hands on a MacBook Pro review unit, complete with Apple's newfangled Touch Bar. Typically, Apple doles out review units to select publications with embargoes that expire at the same time. So how did 01NetTV came to post a mini-review of Apple's refreshed notebook before anyone else? Well, I suppose that's a question for another day, but for now we can take a closer look at what appears to be the very first spotting of Apple's MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar out in the wild. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nHere are all the states where marijuana is now legal Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go President Trump could be really bad news for T-Mobile ",

      "text": "11/09/16 AT 9:46 PM Close \nAhead of the release of Apple’s iOS 10.2 update, the Cupertino giant is rolling out a very minor version change to iOS 10.1.1 that appears to not have anything new to bring to iPhones and iPads. The release of the minor update comes a more than a week after iOS 10.1.1 was launched to Apple’s iOS-running devices. \nAccording to MacRumors , the new update is very minor, it does not come with a very different build code. While the iOS 10.1.1 software update has the build number of 14B100, the new update comes with 14B150 as its build number. The addition of 50 could only mean very minor changes that are unlikely to be felt by the average user. \nSince the changelog for the new update has yet to be updated, it is still not clear what kind of fixes and changes update 14B150 comes with. Furthermore, Apple’s new update is not really that needed if your device is already running iOS 10.1.1. In fact, 9To5Mac says users who already have the 14B100 update “won’t be able to, nor need to, download” the minor update. Related Stories",

      "text": "TWEET It's been more than two months since Nintendo first joined Apple onstage to announce Super Mario Run . There's still plenty we don't know about the mobile game, but, as its December release date draws closer, more details are starting to come in. Here's a quick rundown of everything we've learned about Super Mario Run in the past few weeks. Super Mario Run release date is still on track According to video game industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto, who's reported on Super Mario Run development in the past, the game is still on schedule for its promised December launch. \n5) Super Mario Run is on track for a December release. DeNA had to cooperate closely with Nintendo - on both the client and server side. We still don't have a specific release date, but you can signup for notifications in the Apple App Store to find out as soon as it launches (over 20 million people have already signed up). Super Mario Run is also set to land on Android devices ... eventually , but that might not happen until next year. Is Super Mario Run headed for the Nintendo Switch? \nSuper Mario Run might be a mobile game, but it could be headed to the Nintendo Switch too. A recent Japanese patent filed by Nintendo reveals potential plans to bring the side-scroller to its upcoming console. \nThe patent in question was re-published on gaming forum NeoGAF . It clearly mentions Super Mario Run by name and then suggests the game could run on \"home video game machines.\" That doesn't guarantee Super Mario Run will launch on the Nintendo Switch, but we wouldn't rule out the possibility. Super Mario Run release will be even bigger than planned \nSuper Mario Run was originally set to launch in 100 countries this year. Late last month, Nintendo upped that number to 150 countries during a presentation to investors . \nThe company also explained how pricing will work for the mobile game. Super Mario Run will be available as a free download that includes a limited demo. From there, players will have to pay a one-time fee to access the full experience. Super Mario Run release could be as big as Pokémon Go Nintendo obviously has high hopes for Super Mario Run , but it could be difficult to follow the runaway success of Niantic's Pokémon Go . Speaking to Bloomberg , Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said the company expects its new mobile game to do just as well. \"This time we're using Mario , that's a very important intellectual property for us,\" he said. \"And that's what [Shigeru] Miyamoto's team is working on now: making sure it spreads out just as quickly as Pokémon Go .\" Super Mario Run : Made with Unity Earlier this month, Unity Technologies revealed that it's working with Nintendo to launch Super Mario Run . \nWe are thrilled that the legendary creators @NintendoAmerica are bringing Mario to mobile for the first time, and it's #madewithunity https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwMtEetVMAATAPB.jpg:large Unity's software engine is a popular choice for video game developers. The company boasts a number of successful titles developed using its technology, including Crossy Road , Monument Valley and Pokémon Go . That should put Super Mario Run in good company once it launches next month. Super Mario Run: Everything we still don't know Despite everything we've learned about Super Mario Run in the past few weeks, there's even more that we still don't know. The specific price is still a mystery, though we're guessing it will come in at around $5. The official release date is also unclear, but we wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo just barely makes its December deadline. Hopefully, Nintendo will clear up those questions soon, but until then we'll keep an eye out for any more information. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "Pinterest \nThe latest MacBook Pro from Apple may have angered many for the expensive price tag and the fact that they only come with USB-C ports, but like it or not, the new MacBook Pro are one of the most popular laptops of all time, according to this report at least. Slice Intelligence, a company that measures all digital commerce activity and customer loyalty, says that in just five days, Apple has sold more new MacBook Pro than its competitors. \nAccording to the report, after just five days, the new MacBook Pro have “accumulated more revenue than any other laptop this year”. Apple has outsold the combined sales of the Dell XPS 13 and 15, and has sold almost four times as many units as the Microsoft Surface Book. It’s still behind the 12” MacBook sales, but the MacBook has been available since April 2015. \nBut of course, this is an individual report and does not reflect the sales of laptops worldwide. Slice Intelligence analyses data by looking at email receipts among its panel of 4.4 million online shoppers, and track online sales only. Earlier this month, Phil Schiller, the marketing executive of Apple, mentioned that the new MacBook Pro have set new online sales record, beating previous sales for “pro Apple notebooks”, but I guess we will need to wait for an official sales report from Apple to see if its latest MacBook Pro are indeed so popular.",

By enrolling via Apple’s beta testing website , users can have access to the beta versions of upcoming macOS Sierra and iOS betas. Since beta software is typically rife with bugs, however, users are advised to install it on a secondary machine, as per MacRumors . \nThe second beta version of macOS 10.12.2 comes a week after the first beta went live for developers and beta testers to download. It isn’t known yet when Apple plans to roll out the official 10.12.2 update, but when it does, users would be delighted to know that they’ll be getting new and redesigned Unicode 9 emojis with the software update. The same set of emojis will arrive with the iOS 10.2 update for iPhones and iPads and the watchOS 3.1.1 update for the Apple Watch.  ",

      "title": "The best iPhone 7 deals for November",
      "text": "Apple iPhone 7 Plus \nSince their launch, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have sold better than expected . As we approach the holidays, demand for Apple’s latest smartphone is expected to increase. Fortunately, retailers are offering various deals and trade-in offers to help offset the cost of the new iPhone. \nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best iPhone 7 deals you can get today. You’ll notice there are no T-Mobile deals at the moment, but fear not. There’s a reason they call themselves the “Uncarrier” network and it’s likely they’ll have something to offer as we inch closer to Black Friday. In the meantime, here are the deals you can act on now. Verizon Wireless \nVerizon’s iPhone 7 deal is pretty straightforward: Buy a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with monthly device payments, trade in your old iPhone, and received up to a $300 credit you can apply to your new phone. The iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S will snag you a $100 credit, whereas the iPhone SE will land you a $200 credit. Meanwhile, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will get you a $300 credit. The phones must be in good working and cosmetic condition to qualify and the trade-in credit will be applied to your monthly bill over 24 months. Earlier in the year Verizon offered a slightly stronger deal with a $650 credit. Nevertheless, its current offer is still a great way to lower the cost of admission for a new iPhone. AT&T \nAT&T is currently offering one of the best iPhone deals you’ll find. It requires that you purchase your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus via AT&T’s Next plan, but otherwise you’ll get a generous $650 credit when you trade-in your older iPhone. This is the same promo AT&T offered earlier in the season and essentially guarantees you a new iPhone 7 on the house. Target \nSprint users who want to save on Apple’s latest iPhone will want to make sure they shop at Target. The retailer is taking $100 off the cost of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus when you purchase from them and activate your phone on Sprint. (The savings also apply to Verizon and AT&T, but their trade-in promos above offer a better incentive). Just make sure to act fast because this sale ends Saturday, November 5. Best Buy \nBest Buy is offering its customers a free $100 egift card with the purchase and activation of any Verizon smartphone, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While that’s not as strong as the Verizon offer previously mentioned, it’s a respectable alternative, especially if you don’t have an iPhone you can currently trade in. Sam’s Club \nLeaked copies of Samsung’s Black Friday ad indicate that the retailer will offer its members a $250 Sam’s Club Gift Card and a waived activation fee with the purchase of any iPhone. Keep in mind this is a gift card and not a credit, so you’re still responsible for the full price of your iPhone. Also, Sam’s Club memberships start at $45 per year.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nApple’s most recent earnings report hinted at tough times ahead — the company reported iPhone shipments of 45 million and $28 billion in profit for the quarter, down about 5.3 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, from the same quarter last year. But some territories, particularly the United States and Great Britain, bucked the downward trend. According to market research firm Kantar , the Cupertino, California-based company’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the countries’ best-selling smartphones in September. \nLast quarter, Apple’s top-of-the-line iPhone models made up 17.1 percent of all handsets sold in Great Britain and 15.1 percent of those sold in the U.S., Kantar Consumer Insight Director Lauren Guenveur reported. “In the U.S., the new [iPhone] models made an impact,” she wrote. And they performed especially well in Britain. Strength across Apple’s iPhone portfolio drove sales of iOS devices to 40.6 percent — a 2.4 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Kantar reported that the iPhone SE performed especially well, representing 8.5 percent of sales in the country. \nMore: Apple’s iPhone nabbed 104 percent of the smartphone industry profits this past quarter \nBut it wasn’t just Apple’s new crop of devices that flew off the shelves. The iPhone 6s was the second best-selling device in the U.S. in September, contributing to an overall growth of iOS sales in the country to 34.2 percent. \nSales were boosted in part by the popularity of large-screen devices. Kantar said that 47 percent of smartphone owners cited the size of the screen as the main driver of their satisfaction. And the continued travails of one of Apple’s biggest competitors helped, too. According to Kantar, sales of the beleaguered Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which has since been recalled, posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9 percent to 33.8 percent of U.S. smartphone sales in the third quarter. \nThe firm projects a difficult quarter ahead for the Seoul, South Korea-based smartphone maker. “The holiday sales season may prove to be more challenging than normal for Samsung, who competes head to head with Apple during this crucial time of year,” Kantar reported. “Fallout from the Note 7 recall could have an unintended impact on continuing sales of other, similarly named Samsung devices (chiefly the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge), as consumers may not always understand the difference between model names.” \nMore: Apple beats fourth-quarter revenue estimates, but sees iPhone sales fall \nWord of the iPhone 7’s growth may help allay fears among investors that shipments would suffer through the holiday season. Kantar noted that constrained supply, especially in China, played a major part in iPhone’s weaker-than-expected third quarter performance. “[With] supply constrained on the iPhone 7, and particularly the 7 Plus, this positive turn for Apple is a good sign, suggesting that as supply grows to meet demand, Apple will be able to turn the tide in urban China.” \nDuring its most recent earnings conference, Apple noted that iPhone sales were “up” year-on-year in “33 of [the] top 40” markets. “Our results for the September quarter were very strong,” CEO Tim Cook said. “We’re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: these are the best iPhones we’ve ever made.” Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge",

      "text": "72 I'm switching, to Windows 10! I stopped using Apple mobile devices years ago because they are overpriced, inflexible, and do not have options such as MicroSD card slots. But I still use my 2012 15\" Macbook Pro Retina on a daily basis, and have a 2016 iMac. I was waiting for the new Macbook Pro to be released, and what a disappointment it is! They have 4 USB-C ports, and that's it! No SD card slot. No HDMI port. No USB 3 port. No RJ-45 jack. I literally have zero devices I could connect to a new Macbook without adapters! And of course, the one I would want is a whopping $2,700. I was hoping they might introduce a less expensive 1080p model, but that didn't happen. Fed up with Apple, I just ordered an HP Envy 15 with Windows 10 Pro. It has all of the aforementioned ports that the Macbook Pro does not have. It has 7th generation core i7 processors, 512GB SSD drive, 16 GB of RAM, backlit keyboard, and you have a choice of 1k up to 4k displays. I settled on the 1080p display because I don't need or want 4k. All this for only $1,099! I'm going to add $500 to my kids college fund, and still save over $1,000. I am disappointed with my new iMac as well. It has Core i5 processors, 1 TB fusion drive with 28GB SSD -- And it's a dog! Except for the MacOS components which are on the SSD drive, other apps run slowly. So I have a slow computer that I paid $1,500 for. I'm going to trade it in on a Windows 10 PC with i7 processors and a large SSD drive, and 12-16 GB of RAM. This will be the last time I vent about Apple -- Good riddance!",

      "text": "I stopped using Apple mobile devices years ago because they are overpriced, inflexible, and do not have options such as MicroSD card slots. But I still use my 2012 15\" Macbook Pro Retina on a daily basis, and have a 2016 iMac. I was waiting for the new Macbook Pro to be released, and what a disappointment it is! They have 4 USB-C ports, and that's it! No SD card slot. No HDMI port. No USB 3 port. No RJ-45 jack. I literally have zero devices I could connect to a new Macbook without adapters! And of course, the one I would want is a whopping $2,700. I was hoping they might introduce a less expensive 1080p model, but that didn't happen.\n\nFed up with Apple, I just ordered an HP Envy 15 with Windows 10 Pro. It has all of the aforementioned ports that the Macbook Pro does not have. It has 7th generation core i7 processors, 512GB SSD drive, 16 GB of RAM, backlit keyboard, and you have a choice of 1k up to 4k displays. I settled on the 1080p display because I don't need or want 4k. All this for only $1,099! I'm going to add $500 to my kids college fund, and still save over $1,000.\n\nI am disappointed with my new iMac as well. It has Core i5 processors, 1 TB fusion drive with 28GB SSD -- And it's a dog! Except for the MacOS components which are on the SSD drive, other apps run slowly. So I have a slow computer that I paid $1,500 for. I'm going to trade it in on a Windows 10 PC with i7 processors and a large SSD drive, and 12-16 GB of RAM.\n\nThis will be the last time I vent about Apple -- Good riddance! ",

      "text": "Report Inappropriate Content ‎11-09-2016 08:47 PM Last night my family was watching Apple TV and all of a sudden we got disconnected from the wireless network. I have spent no less than 6 hours trying to diagnose the problem to no avail. Here are all the details:- the router's green light continuously flashes. It sometimes goes solid green for a few seconds but then starts blinking again.- I know the issue is with the router because I have connected my laptop directly to the cable modem and can reach the internet successfully.- I have power cycled the router, but that doesn't do the trick (that normally fixes any issue I've had with the router in the past.- I have clicked the blue refresh button on the back of the router but that did not work.- I clicked and held the small/hidden reset button on the back of the modem for 10 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds, but nothing works.- I have plugged my laptop directly to the router using an Ethernet cable and have tried accessing 192.168.1.1 but that did not work- I have tried accessing the router webpage (linksyssmartwifi.com?) but no luck.- I have PINGED the router but there's no response.- I tried ipconfig \\release and ipconfig \\renew but that did not helpAs you can see, I have tried a lot, but nothing is working. Not sure why I am all of a sudden experiencing this problem. I do believe new firmware was just released and could my router have automatically installed the new firmware and is now experiencing this problem?I just can't seem to access the wireless router in any capacity. Can't connect to it wirelessly and more puzzlingly is the fact that I can't even connect to the router using an Ethernet connectionThoughts on next steps to take? Thanks so much for any help you can provide.Bradley",

      "text": "Apple offers refurbished iPhone discounts Submitted by Frank Macey on November 9, 2016 - 9:23am \nShopping for a new iPhone? Apple has started offering the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at discounts ranging from $80 to $110 off. These savings are on Apple certified refurbished iPhones. In addition to saving 15 percent, Apple's refurbished devices come with a full one-year warranty just like new products. Currently this is the only place to find entry-level models with 16 GB of storage. \nPurchasing the iPhone 6s new costs more, however the latest models start at 32 GB of storage. Both the refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models are available in a variety of colors, including rose gold. Originally launched in September 2015, these devices have many upgrades over the iPhone 6. Second-generation Touch ID sensors, the Apple A9 processor, and an updated 12-megapixel camera are highlights. The iPhone 6s Plus also features optical image stabilization. \nAll of the refurbished iPhones are unlocked, SIM-free models that can be used on a variety of carriers. Of course, just like on new devices an extended 2-year AppleCare+ warranty can be added for $129. All refurbished iPhones contain a brand new battery and new outer case with no wear and tear. Internal components are thoroughly tested and certified by Apple. Buying a refurb iPhone is a great way to save some cash if you don't need the latest and greatest model. \nThe only drawback is these iPhones must be purchased outright, with no financing or installment plan available from a carrier subscription. Take advantage of this opportunity while it's available, as the last time Apple sold refurbished iPhones was way back in 2008.",

      "text": "Douglas Soltys \nNovember 9, 2016 8:33am \nApple finally updated its Macbook Pro line of laptops after four long years. In an event one day prior, Microsoft introduced its Surface Studio. The CanCon team asks if Microsoft has managed to take Apple’s title as the king of (post) PC’s. \nIn an attempt to mimic Apple’s circa 1981 open letter to IBM, Slack wrote an open letter to Microsoft congratulating the company on Teams, Microsoft’s competitor to Slack. The CanCon crew speculates on whether the ad was a PR blunder or three flame emojis. \nCanada’s tech landscape is rapidly growing, and along with it, so does the demand for specialized tech talent. The new Canadian government released a plan proving to Canadian tech companies that it is tuned in to the needs of the tech community. \nThe strategy, among other things, outlines a fast-track visa program that will allow “highly-skilled, low-risk workers” into Canada. The CanCon crew invites friend of the pod Chris Plunkett , director of external relations at Communitech, to talk about the logistics of implementing the new program. \nTune in as CanCon’s podcast crew – Erin Bury , Managing Director of 88 Creative, Gerrit De Vynck , Canadian tech reporter for Bloomberg, Patrick O’Rourke , Senior Editor for MobileSyrup, and Douglas Soltys , BetaKit Editor in Chief – weighs in on the Mac vs PC debate and digs deep into the realities of the current government love-fest. \nHave some hot takes on our hot takes? Maybe you want to suggest a topic for a future podcast! Perhaps you have a burning question about something you read in tech news that we didn’t cover. , post a comment below with the answer or question, or better yet, rate CanCon 5-stars on iTunes and post your thoughts there.

      "text": "For the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is offering its customers the opportunity to get refurbished iPhones.\nThe tech giant this week launched a new sales program for the iPhone, known as the Apple Certified Refurbished store. Customers who head over there will be able to pick up a refurbished iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The iPhone joins Apple’s many other products, including Macs, iPods, and other items already on sale in its digital marketplace for refurbished devices.\nThe move is a notable one for Apple AAPL , which has focused most of its retail attention in recent years on selling brand-new devices. While Apple has offered refurbished Macs for years, its online marketplace has only been home to new iPhones. In fact, Apple hasn’t sold refurbished iPhones at retail since the smartphone’s launch in 2007.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nSelling a refurbished iPhone, however, is in keeping with Apple’s desire to be a leader in electronics recycling and other green initiatives. Apple is investing heavily in recycling programs in hopes of getting its old hardware back from customers. It then decides whether to refurbish the hardware and sell it again or break it down and mine its parts for recycling. The company even has a sophisticated robot, named Liam, that can systematically remove components in devices like the iPhone so they can be reused in other units.\nAlthough there is still a bit of a stigma attached to buying refurbished electronics and some will wonder what might be wrong with the hardware that it needed to be fixed up, some of that fear is unfounded. In many cases, devices are returned to companies for little reason other than the customer didn’t want it after purchase. In other cases, refurbished devices might never have been opened and returned before the owner could even try them out. In those cases, customers are effectively getting a brand-new handset that Apple or any other company simply can’t sell as new any longer.\nGetting a refurbished iPhone also saves folks some cash. Apple’s iPhone 6s has a starting price of $549 when it’s purchased new. Buying a refurbished iPhone 6s from Apple will set customers back $449 to start. On the iPhone 6s Plus side, customers can similarly save $100 or more off the sticker price.\nFor more about Apple MacBook Pro, watch:\nLike brand-new iPhones, the refurbished handsets Apple is selling come with new batteries and outer shells. They also come with a one-year warranty.",

      "title": "Apple Watch 3 release date, rumours, price, features, design everything you need to know",
      "text": "Smartwatches have been around for a couple of years now. Yes, you were right to be wary on day one, but things have come a long way since then, and they've quickly transformed into the latest must-have luxury. Next on this hit-list of desirable wearable tech will be the Apple Watch 3, with the eagerly-awaited smartwatch set to build on the existing Apple Watch Series 2 with all manner of new features and functions. So, what can you expect when the Apple Watch 3 release date rolls round? Well, despite still being the better part of a year away, the rumour mill has been churning and plenty has already been tipped for the third-generation wearable. From a radical redesign to an integrated camera, here's everything you need to know about the Apple Watch 3. Apple Watch 3 release date: You've got quite the wait ahead Related: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S Holding out for the Apple Watch 3 release date? Well, you better make sure you're comfortable, because you've got one heck of a wait ahead. Given that the Apple Watch 2 only went on sale back in September, chances are the next-generation model won't touch down until that time next year. No, Apple hasn't yet confirmed its official plans, and yes, the original Apple Watch fell earlier in the year, but that happened with iPhones and iPads too. We now appear to be in an annual Apple Watch update cycle, and it makes sense for the smartwatch to drop alongside the new iPhone in September 2017. After all, without an accompanying iPhone, the Apple Watch is pretty much just a nice paperweight. Although this far out from launch it's a bit tricky to say exactly when the third-gen wearable will appear from under Cupertino's shroud of mystery, right now, we'd tentatively pencil September 2017 into your diary. It won't be the star of the show though. In what's expected to be arguably Apple's biggest product reveal in recent years, the Apple Watch 3 will likely have to share the stage with the eagerly awaited iPhone 8 – a handset that's widely thought to feature a radical redesign (about time) with across-the-board specs improvements. Apple Watch 3 design: Could a circular smartwatch finally be on the way from Apple? Related: Best Apple Watch straps What a square! No, not you, the existing Apple Watch. Despite having only adopted square forms to date, the Apple Watch is already the best-looking smartwatch out there. If latest reports are to be believed, however, it could be about to get a whole lot easier on the eye too. Prefer circles to squares? Well then it might be worth holding off for the Apple Watch 3, because it's been suggested the upcoming device could start playing nice with soft, flowing edges. It's not like circular smartwatches haven't been done – just look at the LG G Watch R, Huawei Watch and Moto 360 – it's just they've not really been done particularly well, yet. These claims are still shrouded in a fair bit of speculation though (and preceded the Apple Watch 2) so maybe don't go getting your hopes up just yet. While we'd all love to see a round Apple Watch, what's looking more likely is that the big-A will put much of its design efforts into a run of new straps. We're not just talking about additional colour schemes or materials either. A number of patents have emerged, showing Apple is working on a series of smart straps. From bands than can change colour at the touch of a button to those that hide a hidden Mac-friendly charging port, Apple has been working on a number of ideas on how to improve its wearables without tampering with the tech at the core. Perhaps the most exciting of these ideas is the potential addition of a strap with a second screen built in. According to approved patents, this additional panel could be used to display additional information such as battery life or app-reactive details that don't fit on the primary screen. As cool as all this sounds, we'd be hugely surprised if any of these improvements arrived in time for a 2017 release. Sorry wannabe Apple Watch 3 owners, but it all sounds just a little too futuristic to drop in the coming months. Expect something pretty damn familiar, if not a little skinnier, then. Apple Watch 3 features: Gesture controls and a camera reportedly inbound Related: Apple Watch tips and tricks What new skills can the Apple Watch 3 add? Well, with integrated GPS and a waterproof body having already made it to the realms of reality aboard the Apple Watch 2, you'd be forgiven for thinking there wasn't much left for the next-gen offering to add. You'd be wrong though. According to a number of leaks and plenty of speculation, the Apple Watch 3 will play host to a mass of new options and abilities. Headline amongst these could be the arrival of an integrated camera. Why the chuff would you ever want a camera attached to your wrist? Well if you've got thoughts of sticking your arm out in order to capture your latest holiday snaps, forget it. The small, user-facing camera will instead reportedly enable contortion-free, voice-activated selfie options and, more importantly, on-the-fly FaceTiming without the fuss. Like the smart straps, this is something Apple is known to be working on and considering – thanks patents – but is still far from a dead cert for the Apple Watch 3. It's not the only new feature on the list of possibilities, either. Elsewhere, Apple is working on gesture-based controls that would let you use your Apple Watch without even touching it. Using the timepiece's integrated sensors, the Apple Watch 3 could let you control certain features just by moving your wrist or hand in a certain way. Exact examples are currently unclear, but if that camera does make an appearance, we can see gestures such as the opening and closing of a first being used to capture snaps. That's not where the new feature list will end either. New technology could also be added to the underside-mounted heart rate tracker, with Apple known to be working on improvements to the health-monitoring sensor, and the screen has been tipped for a boost. Yes, the Apple Watch 2's screen was brighter than the original model's, but no sharper. Although image quality isn't a big deal on such a small panel, it's possible the Apple Watch 3 could sharpen things up slightly, especially if that coveted round panel becomes a reality. Apple Watch 3 software: Get ready for the arrival of watchOS 4 Related: 9 watchOS 3 features to get excited about As well as offering hardware improvements, expect to see the Apple Watch 3 bring new software skills to the table. Again, Apple patents have offered an early insight on what's to come, with a new input method potentially on the cards for the wearable. Making the device's expansive menu options easier to navigate, long lists could be subbed out for 3D content cubes. Confused? Don't be. Essentially a list in 3D form, these would offer more visual delights when trying to tailor your watch to your wants and needs. They would also be controlled by the Digital Crown, meaning you can keep the screen finger-free for easier viewing. Just one of a number of software updates thought to be headed to the Apple Watch 3, you can expect to hear plenty more about Apple's watchOS 4 updates well before the new device drops too. The company's annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June will likely see the software showcased before an autumn rollout to new and existing devices. Apple Watch 3 price: Get saving those pennies It's a good job that there's still many months separating you and the Apple Watch 3 release date. Why? Well it gives you plenty of time to get saving. No, the Apple Watch isn't Apple's most expensive device on the Cupertino company's roster, but with prices currently starting at £369 for the 38mm and £399 for the 42mm Apple Watch 2 with a Sport Band strap, it's far from an affordable accessory either. Although we wouldn't expect Apple to hike the price too much, the addition of a round face would surely see the asking fee increase. What's more, given the recent dip in the pound (once again, thanks Brexit), there's a good chance the Apple Watch 3 will line up more expensive than its predecessors. Exactly how things will pan out is still far from certain. If you're after the Apple Watch 3 though, we'd get saving now. Stay tuned for all the latest Apple Watch 3 rumours and leaks. This page will be updated with the latest details as new things emerge.",

(Photo : Bloomberg via Getty Images/Chris Ratcliffe) Apple Inc. iPhone 6S smartphone devices in rose gold sit on display at the Apple Inc. store at Covent Garden in London, U.K., on Friday, Sept. 25, 2015. The latest models, following a hugely popular design overhaul last year that added bigger screens, may not match the success of previous releases, according to analysts. \niPhone hunters were surprised to find out that Apple is selling refurbished units in its online store. This is the first time that Apple has done this in years. Among the refurbished iPhones listed for sale are a rose gold 64GB iPhone 6S plus for $589 as well as a silver 16GB 6S Plus for only $529. Buyers get 15% off compared to buying a new iPhone. Most of the used iPhones being sold were originally released September 2015 which are only a few generations away from Apple's current flagship iPhone model. Advertisement \nThe Verge reported that these refurbished phones come with a new outer casing and battery. Buyers can choose from a wide variety of units and some phones, like the iPhone 6s Plus, even comes in all four colors. All refurbished items come with a one-year factory warranty just like new iPhone units. It's completely hard to tell which unit is new and which is refurbished with all these features. Finally, these iPhone units also come unlocked without a SIM card. \nReports say that this is actually the first time that Apple is selling refurbished phones. It has sold refurbished iPads , Mac computers, MacBooks and accessories before and is still selling them online. There are also reports that these refurbished items may be from the company's iPhone Upgrade Program which means these phones may not be in bad shape at all. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, The Next Web reported that selling old stuff was really not new to Apple and in fact, it has been doing so about a decade ago. Their online store initially offered refurbished phones in 2007 allowing consumers to purchase previous generation phones for a reasonable price. \nRefurbished iPhones from Apple's online store also come with free shipping and returns. As mentioned in their refurbished iPhone site, Apple declares quality in their refurbished items. Buyers are also warned that supply is limited for each refurbished model and a unit is guaranteed once they have received full payment for it. \n© 2016 Mstars News, All rights reserved.

      "text": "New 2016 MacBook Pro Release Date, Device Specs Announced; Apple To Retain Its Basic Notebook Form By Monique Austin   09, 10:30 pm The new 2016 MacBook Pro, with evolved Touch Bar.(Photo : Apple/YouTube) \nFans start to queue as the new 2016 MacBook Pro release date has been announced, with Apple boasting the evolved Touch Bar and other device specs, saying that the MacBook Pro will remain as a notebook device. Last 27 October, Apple announced the release of the MacBook Pro at an event in San Francisco. Advertisement \nApple's new 2016 Macbook Pro features USB-C ports and a Retina display. It also features the highly talked about multi Touch Bar and a versatile strip display that replaces several keys such as the escape, work, and control keys found in a standard QWERTY keyboard. \nOn 2 November, Apple's Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Philip Schiller revealed in an interview with The Independent the organization's arrangements and response to the announcement of the new 2016 MacBook Pro release. According to the interview, all Mac and iOs gadgets will always be treated as separate from the other and that Apple will not try to integrate the two devices together. \nSchiller further discussed that it is part of Apple's thinking about how to take the notebook to the next level. He said that while others are trying to turn the device into the tablet, the new 2016 MacBook Pro \"is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook.\" He proudly added that the shape of the new 2016 MacBook Pro is something that has been with Apple for the last 25 years and it is probably going to be with the company for another 25 years because \"there's something eternal about the basic notebook form factor.\" \nApple's new 2016 Macbook Pro is currently being for sold for $1,499 for the 13-inch model that does not feature a Touch Bar, while the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar and Touch ID model is being sold for $1,799. On the other hand, the price of the new 15-inch model of the new 2016 MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 but may be sold to as much as $4,299 depending on device specs and accessories. \n  Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple may sit atop the smartphone tree, but the iPhone 7 didn't exactly provide customers with a much-needed overhaul. That's something the company will reportedly look to change in next year's update, and a vital clue pointing to this may have just been uncovered. After deep-diving into the Cupertino giant's most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing (a document which we imagine holds the answers to all of life's key questions), multinational banking company JP Morgan came across a purchase order for what may be OLED panels. The order extends for an entire year, and is valued at around $4 billion. The Cupertino giant has long been expected to offer an iPhone with OLED display - the same as rivals Samsung - and the iPhone 8 could be the perfect opportunity to finally unveil the change. As AppleInsider notes, this uncovered order coincides with an \"off-balance sheet obligation\" for the same amount from Q3, which could be related to Apple sourcing panels from Sammy itself. But while some signs point to the South Korean company providing screens to its rival, it's also likely it isn't the only supplier. After all, Sharp's CEO recently revealed that Apple is shifting to OLED screens, while Japan Display has also confirmed plans to move to OLED mass production. But what are the benefits of such a move? Well, despite Apple always opting to roll out LCD screens with the iPhone, OLED is widely considered to be the better option. The latter allows for pixels to emit individual light, leading to improved efficiency, while also offering stronger shades of dark colours. Despite all this, it's important to remember that we still sit almost a year away from anything being official, so make sure to season any rumours with salt.

For Apple, all refurbished phones comes have the same one year warranty as new iPhones, and go through the same government certifications as a new iPhone does. \nApple iPhone 6s series was launched in September 2015, and comes with the A9 processor, a 12MP rear camera, 5MP front camera, and 3D Touch on the display. With the iPhone 7, Apple has upgraded the camera, battery and processor and included water and dust resistance. In case of the iPhone 7 Plus, there’s also a new dual camera setup with a Portrait mode for Bokeh style photos. \nApple’s new iPhone 7 series starts at Rs 60,000 in India, although older models of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are now available at discounts on online websites. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "PayPal couldn’t have timed this announcement better. The company has just announced that the PayPal app for iOS 10 on Apple devices now support Siri integration.\nTransferring money to someone is now as easy as saying, “Hey Siri, send Bill $50 using PayPal,” says PayPal’s Meron Colbeci. When commanded to do so, Siri will throw up a PayPal notification with the details that you specified and you can then approve or deny the transaction.\n\nThe service will be available to citizens in 30 countries, a list that includes USA, many European countries, China, Thailand, Mexico, and more importantly, India.\nWe’re curious to see how PayPal will deal with security, however. Can anyone just grab your phone and ask Siri to send your contacts money? We assume (hope) that there will be stringent security measures in place, but PayPal hasn’t outlined those measures just yet.\nWith PM Modi banning Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and limiting cash transactions until year end, we will be forced to rely on digital payment services like PayPal, FreeCharge and others.\nWe wonder when Apple/Android Pay will actually make its way to India though.\nThe post PayPal brings Siri integration to iOS 10 app for Apple iPhone and iPad; payments now just a “Hey Siri” away appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "iPhone 8 release date, specs rumors: 10th anniversary iPhone to feature OLED display",
      "text": "  \n(Apple) Apple's iPhone 8 is rumored to sport a major overhaul in design and features. \nApple's iPhone 8 has been plagued by rumors even before the release of the iPhone 7. This is mostly because the 2017 iPhone 8 will mark the lineup's 10th anniversary. And for that, it means that the company may be working to make the iPhone 8 the best ever. \nSome people were displeased when the iPhone 7 was unveiled because not much changed with the smartphone's major design or features, apart from the moderately received lack of a headphone jack. But the next iPhone is going to be a game changer, if predictions and supposed leaks are to be believed. \nFor one thing, the upcoming iPhone iteration is said to be named either the \"iPhone 8\" or \"iPhone 10,\" to commemorate its 10th anniversary. This means Apple will be skipping the S version of the iPhone 7. \nDesign-wise, there has been talk of the iPhone 8 sporting an all-glass body with aluminum on its sides as support. However, there is also a rumor going around that stainless steel will be used for at least one of the iPhone 8 variants, of which there are speculated to be three . A 4.7-inch version, a 5-inch version, and a 5.5-inch version are all said to be coming in 2017. And while 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches are common with the lineup, a middle-ground 5-inch model is something new. However, there are other reports saying that it will be a higher-end 5.8-inch variant instead. Advertisement \nAs for its display, Digital Spy reports that the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display, which is a first in iPhone history. And while Apple has always gone with LCD screens, an OLED display is definitely far better. It should be noted that other brands have already adopted OLED displays in their lineups, like Samsung. \nIt is also expected that a huge redesign will be made on the next iPhone, with the screen taking up the entire front surface of the handheld device. This means edge-to-edge display on all four sides and a home button that is directly embedded within the screen. It was previously reported that the Cupertino-based tech giant had filed a patent for a new fingerprint sensor that can be fully integrated within the display. \nSince Apple has yet to confirm if any of these are true, readers should take this news with a grain of salt for now.

      "text": "  03:00 AM EST Metaswitch Accession Unified Communications Client Goes Native for Apple iPhone Tight integration with iOS 10 through Apple CallKit provides seamless native dialer capabilities \nSAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - November 10, 2016) - Cloud native communications software leader Metaswitch today announced significantly enhanced support for Accession Communicator Unified Communications (UC) on Apple iPhones, enabled by tight integration with iOS 10 using Apple CallKit. CallKit provides programmatic access to a wide range of native dialer functionality that was previously unavailable to third party applications. \nUsers of Accession on iPhone can now accept calls via the lock screen and decide whether or not to put Accession on hold to take a cellular call. If their iPhone is locked, they now get a full-screen announcement of their inbound Accession calls, and can answer with a swipe, just as they can for cellular calls. Users can also store and return calls from the Recent Calls list and use Siri to place calls. Caller ID and call blocking are also enabled, as are CarPlay and other Bluetooth devices. \n\"This native dialer functionality makes Accession even easier to use for iPhone users, who represent a significant portion of our subscriber base,\" said Nathan Patrick, chief technology officer for Sonic . \"The ability to use Accession seamlessly and intuitively, as they would any deeply-embedded Apple application, is extremely beneficial. Metaswitch has taken full and early advantage of CallKit's capabilities.\" \nMetaswitch Accession UC brings together multiple communications capabilities, including telephony, unified messaging, instant messaging, presence, video conferencing and collaboration, using a unified interface that is accessible from almost any desktop or mobile device. \n\"Metaswitch engineering has a long history of rapid innovation with cutting-edge technologies to enable our carrier customers to lead the market in service delivery,\" said Chris Carabello, senior director of product marketing for Metaswitch. \"The seamless integration of Accession and iOS gives them the tools they need to outpace their competition and gain market share in the attractive UC segment.\" \nThese new capabilities will be in the next Accession update, available later this month through the Apple App Store.

      "text": "– A + Apple CEO Tim Cook urges employees to 'move forward together' in memo on 2016 presidential election By Mikey Campbell \nWednesday, November 09, 2016, 11:46 pm PT (02:46 am ET) \nFollowing one of the most bitterly contested —both by candidates and their respective constituencies —presidential elections in modern American history, Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday sent out a company-wide memo addressing employee concerns about what comes next.\n\n\n\n\nIn a copy of the memo, obtained by BuzzFeed News , Cook encourages his staff to reach out to colleagues \"if they are feeling anxious\" about the recent election. \n\nDonald Trump in the early hours of Wednesday morning capped a long and controversial presidential campaign with an upset victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Though Cook fell short of mentioning Trump by name, the business magnate turned populist politician is clearly the subject of today's memo. \n\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeated unsavory remarks regarding people of color, women, the LGBTQ community and others, actions seemingly at odds with Apple's public fight for diversity and inclusion. Acknowledging the angst felt by some employees, Cook reassured his team that Apple \"is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world —regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\n\nBeyond political leanings, Trump targeted Apple directly when he promised to force the company to manufacture its products in the U.S. \n\nIn February, Trump again lashed out at Apple, calling for a boycott of the company's goods over its stance in an ongoing debate over device encryption and national security. At the time, Apple had refused to help government agents access data from an iPhone tied to last year's San Bernardino terror attacks, saying that doing so would leave millions of consumer devices at risk.\n\nA few months later, it was reported that Apple withheld money and support from the Republican National Convention due to Trump's comments on minorities, women and immigrants. Apple has in the past supported the event.\n\nTeam,\n\nI've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\n\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: \"If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.\" This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\n\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world —regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\n\nI've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\n\nLet's move forward —together!\n\nBest,\n\nTim \n\n.@Apple CEO Tim Cook addresses 2016 election, urges employees to 'move forward together'",

      "title": "Tim Cook to Apple staff: We’ll ‘move forward together’ following Trump election win",
      "text": "Zipline raises $25 million to deliver medical supplies by drone \nTim Cook has rallied staff at Apple following Donald Trump’s historic and controversial U.S. election win by reassuring them that the company will “move forward together” despite political divisions and tension. \nAs part of his campaign, Trump indicated his desire for Apple to manufacture its products in the U.S., rather than China and other parts of the world. While it remains unclear if these comments form part of the President-elect’s policy on technology and business, the fact that he will enter the White House in January will be of concern to many at Apple. In response to that uncertainty, Cook told employees in a company-wide memo — reported by BuzzFeed — to “be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.” \n“Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large,” the Apple CEO added. \nBut it isn’t just the future of Apple — or any other U.S. company — that has been shaken by the election result. The campaign itself has created divides and tensions among the U.S. population, and that includes Apple’s own staff, which numbers some 76,000 direct hires in the country. \n“Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” Cook said in the memo. \n“Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,” he added. \nHere’s Cook’s full letter below. Note that he didn’t reference Trump by name, nor his comments about Apple: \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, Featured Image: Mike Deerkoski / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE 0",

      "text": "Teamleader scores €10M Series B to help SMEs go digital Posted Tim Cook to Apple staff: We’ll ‘move forward together’ following Trump election win \nBelgium startup Teamleader , which began life while co-founders Jeroen De Wit, Willem Delbare and Mathias De Loore were studying together at university, has raised €10 million in Series A funding. The round is led by previous backer Fortino Capital. \nTeamleader’s cloud platform aims to help SMEs go digital, offering an all-in-one solution for things like CRM, invoicing, project management and customer offers. \n“Our original company was a web building company founded in 2008 when we were still in high school,” says Teamleader co-founder and CEO Jeroen De Wit. \n“We noticed that our SME customers always ran into the same problems: managing their customer base (CRM), creating and sending offers to leads and the invoicing process. Since these were the exact problems that we were facing, and since we couldn’t find a solution on the market that we liked, we developed a tool ourselves”. \nBy the time its founders graduated in July 2012 they had an MVP ready. “We convinced a few of our web agency customers to try it out, and based on their feedback we kept improving the product,” adds De Wit. \nSince then the startup has come a long way. As well as two funding rounds prior to today’s Series B, bringing total funding to €13.5 million, Teamleader opened offices in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, in addition to Belgium, something that its CEO says reflects a “multi-local” approach. \n“We try to get as close to our customers as possible in every country,” he says. “We always hire local people, provide support in local language and integrate with local accounting software or other integrations”. France and Italy will soon follow. \nMeanwhile, De Wit tells me the startup has three main competitors. The first is DIY solutions and spreadsheets like Excel. The second is standalone tools with limited integration, meaning data is siloed and data entry often has to repeated. The third are the other existing all-in-one corporate tools, which he says are often too expensive for SMEs. 0",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 Vlad Soroka, the winner of Ukrainian Mobile Development Championship and iOS Team Lead at Erminesoft, discovered a developer task, for which Apple had not provided any clear solution. Los Angeles-Long Beach, CA (1888PressRelease) November 10, 2016 - Apple TV 4 micro console was released in September, 2015, and Erminesoft's iOS developers darted exploring and applying possibilities offered by it. It should be noted that there is little documentation on tvOS, so after 2 month of creating an application for Apple TV, Vlad Soroka discovered something interesting in operation of Siri Remote. Siri Remote is a brand new remote control device for 4th Generation Apple TV console. Thanks to accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in it, this console serves not as a remote control device, but as a gaming controller as well, which interacts with the interface with the help of multi-touch gestures. While there are facilities for establishing several tasks for one zone (left and right parts of touchable area), Apple documentation mentions only one of them (putting finger to it). The task was to obtain various actions while touching this or that part of console's surface. Vlad discovered this feasibility in the context of observing video options. In fact, the console could imply and react on more preset actions than the manufacturer claimed. While Apple did not provide developers with obvious solution, Vlad's dedication and explorative mindset allowed resolving this hidden challenge. Technical details and solution suggested by Vlad are shared with the community, contributing to common goal in widening digital horizons and inspiring for creation of better software products. http://erminesoft.com/",

      "text": "Posted on November 10, 2016 \nFrom Chick-fil-A One to Apple Pay, everybody is trying to give somebody a new, branded and mobile way to pay. But are all these “Pay” products really up to the job? Ken Allen, SVP of operations at Socure, joined Karen Webster to discuss the overabundance of digital wallets in the market and how fraud and digital identity fit within these payment methods. Share \nIt’s not hard to find a wide range of merchants and businesses jumping at the opportunity to offer their customers a branded way to pay. \nThe consumer landscape is flooded with “Pays” — with many businesses hoping to create a closed-loop payment experience that will drive loyalty and capture customer information. \nBut let’s face it, not everyone can pull off what Starbucks has done. \nNonetheless, as “Pays” continue to hit the market, hoping to grab the attention and downloads of consumers, Ken Allen , SVP of Operations at Socure , said that it’s easy to see the similarities between the increase in digital wallets and the popularity of prepaid not that long ago. \nMostly because digital wallets have given prepaid payments a new lease on life. \nA new lease on life, Allen said, can expose consumers and those merchants to a whole new set of risks — namely, whether the card that is being provisioned to fund these “Pays” is a set of valid credentials for a legitimate consumer. \n“Ultimately, you’re connecting to some type of stored value or a pass through that still is a person doing a transaction someplace, but now, you’ve opened it up to a more digital space with more risk for the cardholder and the merchant,” Allen said. \n\nWhen Going Digital Gets Risky \nAllen’s opinion is that these digital wallets come with a unique set of risks, as they’re more open, yet lack the fraud controls that even prepaid cards have. \n“It’s a mixed bag of a new version of prepaid, but at the end of the day, I don’t know that it really closes the loop on some of the risks,” he explained. \nTraditionally, prepaid cards were physical cards that were bought for a single use by customers shopping at a retail store or kiosk. Now, with digital wallets, that concept is truly digital, taking place typically within a proprietary mobile app downloaded by the consumer. \nOf course, the digital enrollment itself can open customers up to security vulnerabilities. \n“It’s the provisioning of that wallet that is the risk entry point initially, and that just isn’t understood by all these wallet plays out there,” Allen said. \nFor example, fast-casual dining chain Tropical Smoothie allows customers to use its mobile app as a way to pay with their phone, but Allen said it’s not clear what verification is being done on the payment credentials being enrolled. \n“That scares me as a consumer, knowing that the controls might not be there,” he added. “How do you know you’re dealing with the right person and that they don’t load my credentials on a wallet and put stored value there?” \nUnfortunately, many of the wallets out there may not have the necessary security controls and guarantees to keep out fraud. \nAllen’s point is that, if a merchant doesn’t have a rock solid way of provisioning that account into the proliferation of the “Pay” of the day, they’re potentially opening themselves up to fraudulent activity because they have no way to authenticate that consumer. \nWhile experimenting with new digital capabilities is a good thing, Allen pointed out that many of the stores and businesses putting out wallets don’t have the strong eCommerce background and market sophistication to understand all the risks they are taking on. This means the jump from retail to wallet/quasi-digital is a significant move for many of these players. \n\nPutting Mobile To Work \nThough Allen does have concerns about the security of digital wallets, he noted that digital wallets do have one thing prepaid cards do not: powerful information. \nAfter all, with mobile comes access to capabilities like geolocation and biometric authentication, and these can provide more data for security decisions to be made on. \n“The phone isn’t just an enablement to pay; they need to be checking the geolocation, device and other aspects,” Allen explained, adding that this type of data can serve as the basis for approving or making the decision on transactions. \nIf he were tasked with fixing the digital wallet problem, Allen said, he would start with implementing a more authenticated provisioning process and setting up security controls around the device itself. \nWhy? Because, he explained, a wallet represents four things — a person with a device that loaded some value on it doing a transaction — and there needs to be some form of control on each component that will enable the account, allowing it to transact securely. \nAfter all, in today’s payments landscape, especially with the adoption of EMV, there’s no question that fraud is going digital. \nIt’s not just about eCommerce or mobile commerce, Allen said; it’s now essentially just wallet commerce — a whole new umbrella of opportunity fueled by a diminishing supply of physical card fraud that can be committed. \nIn this quasi-digital environment, where channels are merging and customer-present, digitally enabled transactions are becoming more commonplace, it’s going to take even more work to authenticate consumers and secure transactions. \n“The burden of proof on where [transactions] are going to go through and who’s going to hold the liability when I’m standing in front of a POS with a device that has a wallet stored to it that might not be mine,” Allen explained, “I don’t know how that’s going to get worked out.” ",

      "text": "Apple’s CEO on Trump Elected President of the US: It’s OK to Be Disappointed GO Tim Cook sends email to company employees after US elections Nov 10, 2016 09:33 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Republican Donald Trump is the new President of the United States and technology giants can’t be pleased with the outcome of the elections , especially because companies might have to fight against changes that they do not necessarily agree with in the next four years. Apple is one of the companies that have already been involved in disputes with Donald Trump, and CEO Tim Cook himself disagreed with some of the statements that the Republican made in the last few months. And in an email submitted to employees, and obtained by Buzzfeed , Cook explains that “the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” acknowledging that some company workers are disappointed with the result of the elections. “I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings,” Tim Cook explained in his email that you can read in full after the jump. “Uncertainties ahead” What’s interesting is that Tim Cook hasn’t referred to Donald Trump by name in this email, choosing instead to discuss the company’s position in the next years and pledging for diversity and equality, just like he did in the past. He also talks about “uncertainties ahead,” although no specifics are provided, but it’s very clear that Tim Cook, just like some Apple employees, expects the company to be impacted by some of the changes that will be proposed by Donald Trump in the next four years. “Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious,” he says. In case you’re wondering how come that Tim Cook didn’t congratulate Donald Trump for the win, keep in mind that this is an internal mail that’s not directly addressed to the President of the US. On the other hand, Tim Cook hasn’t released a public statement either, so it’s very clear that Apple isn’t pleased with the outcome of the presidential race.",

      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook reacts to Donald Trump's election Apple CEO Tim Cook reacts to Donald Trump's election Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + The stunning results of the 2016 US Presidential elections have sent tech companies stocks down with some losing more than others, and it's interesting to see how these companies react to the news of a Donald Trump presidency. It's particularly interesting to see the reaction of the US and world's biggest tech company, Apple, makers of the iPhone. Not only because of its sheer size, but also because it is the only company that has an openly gay man as its chief executive officer and because of its solid track record in respecting LGBT rights. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is in many ways a defender of more traditional values, and while nobody expects any radical changes in US policies towards people of different color, religion and sexual orientation, it's a fact that Trump has spoken against some of these minorities. Not only this, Trump has also called Apple to unlock the phone of the San Bernardino shooter despite the fact that this has the real potential to compromise the security for all of its iPhone users, and he's also called for Apple to move manufacturing to the United States. Apple CEO Tim Cook sent a cool and short notice to all Apple employees, calling all to move forward and be assured that Apple will stand by its North Star. Here's the full text of Cook's email: \"Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best,",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith iOS 10, Apple added the ability for six categories of application to integrate with the iOS personal assistant, Siri. One of these groups was mobile payments. The PayPal app for iOS has now been updated with this integration, so you can use natural language voice queries to send and receive money. \nUsing your contact address book, queries like ‘Hey Siri send David $20 using PayPal’ will bring up a confirmation sheet in the Siri conversation with one button to confirm. \nWhen sending money, the recipient will receive an email letting them know that you are trying to give them some cash. They can then log in with their PayPal account, or create a new one, to accept the funds. \nThanks to the flexibility of Apple’s Siri SDK implementation, you can make formal or informal requests about money. \nAs long as you include the word ‘PayPal’, iOS will associate the question with the app and route it properly. This means shorthand requests like ‘PayPal Benjamin £5’ and slang queries like ‘Shoot John $10 with PayPal’ will all work. \nThe PayPal support for Siri is localized around the world, so you can use Siri to send money in 30 countries, spanning an array of languages including English, French, Finnish, German, Italian and Hebrew. \nTo start using PayPal with Siri, just update or install the app from the App Store. The app is free but obviously you’ll need to connect your PayPal account to a funding source (like a bank account) to actually send or receive funds.

      "text": "Download our iOS app How to Enable Automatic Downloads in tvOS 10 on Apple TV tvOS 10 lets you enable Automatic Downloads on your Apple TV in order to automatically download universal apps on the big screen. \nJust like iOS and macOS, tvOS 10 has got “Automatic Downloads” feature. Once enabled, whenever you purchase any tvOS supported app on your iPhone or iPad , it will be automatically downloaded on your Apple TV as well. \nI find Auto-downloads on tvOS 10 very useful as it allows you to download your favorite universal app on Apple TV with ease. There are several apps like Netflix which I enjoy using on my iPhone and iPad and hence using them on the big TV screen gives me more fun. How to Turn on Automatic Downloads in tvOS 10 on Apple TV By default, Auto-Downloads is disabled in tvOS 10. Make sure you use the same iCloud account both on your iOS device and Apple TV. In case you use Family Sharing , Automatic Downloads will not install your family members’ universal apps automatically on your Apple TV’s Home screen. \nStep #1. Open Settings on your Apple TV. \nStep #2. Next, you need to click on the Apps section located at the top-level menu. \nStep #3. Now, make sure to set the Automatically Install Apps option to On. \nFrom now onwards, if you download any universal iOS app on our iPhone, it will be automatically downloaded on your Apple TV as well. \nHow to Disable Automatic Downloads in tvOS 10 on Apple TV \nNo longer want apps to be downloaded on your Apple TV automatically? You can quickly turn off this feature. \nStep #1. Open Settings → Apps section. \nStep #2. Now, set the Automatically Install Apps to Off. \nHow to Find Universal iOS Apps in tvOS 10 App Store on Apple TV \nYou can check out the availability of tvOS versions of iOS apps easily. If you don’t want to keep auto-downloads turned on and instead wish to keep an eye on the tvOS versions of iOS apps in order to download only specific ones, it can be a good option. \nStep #1. Open App Store → Purchase tab. \nStep #2. In the left-hand corner, you need to click on Not on This App TV .

      "text": "Renders Of Alleged Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD Tablet Leaked  23 PST \nWhile Apple’s iPad might still be one of the top-selling tablets in the market today, Verizon has been quietly pushing out its own series of Ellipsis tablets . Whether or not the tablet is doing well is unclear, but we’re guessing that it must be doing OK for Verizon to keep continuing the trend over the past few years. \nThat being said, it looks like Verizon has a new Ellipsis tablet in the works. According to famed leakster Evan Blass , he recently tweeted out renderings of what appears to be the upcoming Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD tablet. Apparently it will come in two color options: midnight blue and arctic grey. \nUnfortunately in terms of specs we are really clueless as to what kind of hardware might be under its hood. We can only assume that the “8” in its name implies its screen size, and the “HD” might also imply its resolution, which we guess will either be 720p for those who want to be super particular, or it could also imply 1080p . \nWe also can assume that it will feature LTE connectivity given that it is a Verizon tablet, but other than that it’s really anyone’s guess. That being said, Verizon’s Ellipsis tablets have never been particularly high-end anyway so don’t expect too much. However they have proven to be affordable so we guess there’s that. \nFiled in Rumors > Tablets . Read more about Verizon . Related Articles",

      "text": "Siri - Principal Software Engineer \nThe multinational has an unmarked office near Cambridge train station that's currently home to a team of roughly 30 people working on voice recognition technology. However, the office can accommodate significantly more staff, according to a source. \nThe job description for the Principal Software Engineer role gives a bit more insight into what Apple does in Cambridge. \n\"Want to work on the cutting edge of software engineering, machine learning and big data?\" it reads. \"Join Apple’s Siri team in Cambridge, UK, and be part of revolutionising human-machine interaction!\" \nIt continues: \"You will be joining a highly talented team of software engineers and machine learning scientists to develop the next generation of Siri. We use world class tools and software engineering practices, and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence with a single aim: make a real difference to the lives of the hundreds of millions of Siri users.\" \nAt the time of writing, some 218 people had applied for the Software Engineer/Senior Software Engineer role, according to LinkedIn. \nApple Maps/Skitch \nSavills \nSome of the roles are flexible, with Apple letting people work from home for part of the week. The job ad for the Siri Operations Engineer role reads: \"Note — the role can be based remotely but the successful candidate will be required to work from the Cambridge office at least 3 days a week.\" \nApple's Cambridge office is home to many of the employees from VocalIQ — a voice recognition startup that was spun out from the university and acquired by Apple in 2015 for up to $100 million (£80 million). \nVocalIQ's software — designed to help computers and people speak to each other in a more natural dialogue — hasn't found its way into Siri yet , according to an artificial intelligence (AI) expert that Business Insider spoke to earlier this year with knowledge of voice recognition platforms. \"I think it’s extremely unlikely that [VocalIQ] is in Siri now,\" the source said. \"In fact, I’m pretty sure it isn’t. But obviously Apple have got it for a reason.\" \nApple is competing with companies like Amazon , Microsoft, and Google when it comes to creating AI-powered personal assistants. Despite a number of impressive hires, including Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Russ Salakhutdinov, one of the world’s leading talents in AI, Apple has been falling behind in the global AI race, according to several reports, including this one from Bloomberg . \nApple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

      "title": "Tim Cook emails all employees to call for unity after divisive presidential election",
      "text": "Reddit \nFollowing the conclusion of an extremely divisive presidential election, Apple CEO Tim Cook has sent an email to all employees calling for unity and for people to move forward together. As Buzzfeed noted, Cook does not reference the president-elect by name. \nCook’s email also reiterates Apple’s own values … Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best, Tim \nApple’s relationship with Trump has so far been a frosty one. Trump called for a boycott of Apple products following the company’s refusal to create a GovOS version of iOS for the FBI . Apple responded by stating that being criticized by Trump ‘ puts the company in standing with other good people.’ Apple also decided to withhold its usual financial and technological support for the GOP convention following its selection of Trump as party nominee. \nCook and Trump do have one thing in common, however: they both want tax reform that would make it cheaper for the company to repatriate overseas earnings. Cook has repeatedly called for this, and Trump has pledged to reduce taxes on repatriated income from 35% to 10% .",

      "title": "ASUS ZenBook 3 Review",
      "text": "\nBack in May, ASUS announced their latest ultrabook that aims to rival Apple’s new MacBook – the ZenBook 3 . It boasts an aerospace-grade aluminum body measuring 11.9mm thin, a 7.6mm slim bezel, 12.5-inch Full HD display with Gorilla Glass 4, Intel Core i7 CPU, USB-C, and Windows 10 Pro. That said, you can consider the Windows alternative to the MacBook, but is that all there is to it?\nDesign and Construction ASUS’s ZenBook lineup has always been famous for its slim build and premium design. The ZenBook 3 is definitely a member of the family and in fact, can be considered the best representation of that lineup.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the ZenBook 3 features an aerospace-grade aluminum for its body. The top lid carries the company’s signature spun-metal finish found in other Zen devices. The edges, on the other hand, have golden highlights which are a good contrast to the rest of the body’s Royal Blue color.\n\nLift the lid and you will be greeted by the 12.5-inch display bordered by a relatively thin 7.5mm bezel. Above it are the microphones and webcam, while below is the device’s name in gold. Further down, we have a couple of speakers, backlit keyboard, touchpad, and fingerprint sensor.\n\nASUS says that the ZenBook 3’s keys have a travel distance of 0.8mm, which isn’t really much. You’ll still notice the slight travel but feels really shallow even from a laptop standard. Still, we didn’t have trouble adjusting to it.\n\nThe keys are well-made, really quiet and generously spaced. Our only gripe is the positioning of the power button which is located just right above the backspace key, making it prone to accidental presses especially if you’re not used to the layout yet.\n\nAs for the touchpad, it’s smooth and responsive, with good tactile feedback when clicking. The fingerprint scanner, though, is placed inside the touchpad which sometimes limits the space you can use to swipe.\n\nConnectivity-wise, the ZenBook 3 took hints from the MacBook as well and decided to minimize the ports to a single USB-C port which is also used for charging, and a 3.5mm headset jack. The good news is, ASUS is including a universal dock in the package that provides the ZenBook 3 with an SD card reader, LAN, VGA, HDMI, standard USB 3.0 and USB-C port for charging.\n\nOverall, the ASUS ZenBook 3 is one of the most attractive devices in the company’s lineup as well as the ultrabook market. It’s also thin, light at 910g, and easy to carry around. ASUS is also throwing in a leather carrying case in the package.\nDisplay and Multimedia The ZenBook 3 boasts a 12.5-inch Full HD screen with 82% screen-to-body ratio and 178-degree wide viewing angle. The contrast ratio is pegged at 1000:1 with 72% NTSC color gamut. Protecting all of it is Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4. All-in-all, these features give the ZenBook 3 a tough yet, sharp, vibrant display with great colors. Unfortunately, there’s no touch.\n\nGiven that it has a great display, viewing photos and watching videos are a treat. Good thing the ZenBook 3 is equipped with good-sounding speakers as well. To be specific, we’re listening to a quad-speaker surround sound, 5-magnet speakers with 4-channel smart AMP powered by Harman Kardon.\n\nAside from the two speakers located above the keyboard, there are four more located underneath. That said, you won’t be forced to use a headphone or external speaker just to hear good sound.\nOS and Apps \nRunning the operating system is Microsoft’s Windows 10 Pro. As expected, it comes pre-loaded with software like Evernote, Foxit PhantomPDF, McAfee, TeamViewer 10, Dropbox, WPS Office, including a few apps from ASUS. Storage-wise, you’ll get 512GB SSD partitioned into C and D drives.\nPerformance and Benchmarks Powering the ZenBook 3 is an Intel Core i7-7500U CPU clocked 2.7GHz and 16GB of RAM. Performance is great when handling productivity tasks like browsing multiple Chrome tabs, Photoshop, and Office apps. You may also game on it, but only with those that don’t require heavy graphics processing.\n\nAlthough performance is good, heat can be an issue as the bottom right part can become hot to the point that it’s no longer comfortable to put on your lap. The heat also radiates to the top of the keyboard which warms up right palm rest as well as all the keys in that area.\n\n3D Mark benchmark scores:\n* Fire Strike – 728 \n* Sky Diver – 2,975 \n* Cloud Gate – 5,020 \n* Ice Storm – 57,579 \n\nBattery Life Providing juice for the ZenBook 3 is a 40Wh Li-polymer 6-cell battery which ASUS claims to last for 9 hours. True enough, with brightness set to 30 to 40%, it was able to last us for the whole work day with some left for the night. All in all, it clocked for around 10 to 11 hours on average. As for our video loop test (Full HD video on loop in Airplane mode at 50% brightness and volume with headset plugged), it lasted for 11 hours and 20 minutes . Charging from empty to 100% takes about an hour and a half.\nConclusion ASUS really has a killer ultrabook in the form of the ZenBook 3. It has premium build, attractive design, great display and audio, and good performance and battery life. However, the heating is a turn off as most people would like to use it on-the-go without burning their laps. The USB-C port can be an issue for some as well but can be remedied using the universal dock included in the package. Just make sure you don’t lose it.\n\nLastly, the price, at Php79,995 , it’s not light in the pockets, but if you have the budget and looking for an ultrabook that exudes the same aura as the Apple MacBook, the ZenBook 3 is definitely worth considering.\nASUS ZenBook 3 UX390UA specs:\n12.5-inch (16:9) LED-backlit FHD (1920×1080) 60Hz Glare Panel with 72% NTSC\nIntel Core i7 7500U Processor\nIntegrated Intel HD Graphics 520\n16 GB LPDDR3 2133MHz SDRAM\n512GB M.2 SATA\nWi-Fi 802.11 ac (WIDI Support)\nBluetooth\nIlluminated Chiclet Keyboard\nVGA webcam\nCombo audio jack\nUSB 3.1 Type-C\nASUS SonicMaster Premium Technology\nFingerprint scanner\nWindows 10 Pro 64-bit\n296 x 191.2 x 11.9 mm\n910 g\n2-year ASUS Global Warranty\nPros: \n* Premium build\n* Nice design\n* Great display\n* Good performance\n* Good battery life\n* Universal dock included in the package\n* Thin and light\nCons: \n* Bottom part heats up\n* Single USB-C port\n* No touch screen\n* Expensive\nThe post ASUS ZenBook 3 Review appeared first on YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews .\n",

      "title": "Tim Cook asks employees to work together and move forward after surprise Trump victory",
      "text": "Tim Cook sent a letter to Apple employees calling for unity, and quoting the advice of Martin Luther King Jr. “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” The letter does not mention Trump directly. Over the course of his campaign, Trump has directly threatened harsh measures on Apple, including forcing the company to manufacture the phones on American soil.\nThe letter by Cook is an effort to ease the anxiety of employees, where he asks the employees to help each other out. Indirectly addressing the rhetoric used by Trump over the course of his presidential campaign, Cook wrote “Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” A copy of the letter is available with Buzzfeed .\nThe sentiments were echoed by Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, who responded to the Trump victory by saying “Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, had posted an open letter on Medium , that said “I firmly believe that whether you’re building a company or leading a country, a diverse mix of voices and backgrounds and experiences leads to better discussions, better decisions, and better outcomes for everyone.”\nA Trump win could have serious repercussions on technology companies. Tim Cook had held a fundraiser to help support the Clinton campaign. Tim Cook seems to be more anti-Trump than pro-Hillary because he had earlier hosted a fundraiser for Republican candidate Bernie Sanders. Silicon Valley executives apparently had a secret meeting on an Island where they discussed plans to stop Trump from winning the presidency. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Sean Parker, and Elon Musk CEO of SpaceX and Tesla were at the meeting.\nSilicon Valley had collectively rolled its eyes after Trump warned of a bubble in the technology sector. Trump claims that the unicorn companies, startups with a valuation of over a billion dollars, are overvalued and are attracting investments while not being profitable. Silicon Valley collectively rejected this warning . Tech CEOs including Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Steve Wozniak, Pierre Omidyar, Meg Whitman and Marc Benioff all openly supported Clinton in the lead up to the election. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Palmer Luckey of Oculus stood out for their open support for Trump.\nThe post Tim Cook asks employees to work together and move forward after surprise Trump victory appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Home / News / Laptop News / Apple’s Touch Bar arrives on iMac and iPad with this new app Apple’s Touch Bar arrives on iMac and iPad with this new app \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nApple’s new MacBook Pro models may have been controversial, but we can all agree that the Touch Bar is pretty cool. \nThe good news is that two enterprising developers have created a Touch Bar version that will work on your iMac and iPad, if you’re keen to try it out without paying an extortionate fee for the new MacBook Pro notebooks. \nThe Touch Bar is a new input method introduced on the more expensive variants of the MacBook Pro. It’s basically an OLED touchscreen that replaces the top row of function keys on the MacBook keyboard, and will present different controls depending on what software you have open at the time. \nIn a bid to extend this feature beyond the MacBook Pro, Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek have uploaded an app to Github that exports the feature to other devices –and it's available to download on your Mac right now. \nYou can also download it onto your iPad, so that when you connect your tablet to a Mac, the app will run. However, this process is a little more complicated, as it involves side-loading the Github download. Head to this page for instructions on how to do that. \nDespite the innovative Touch Bar, Apple’s new MacBook Pro has been mired in controversy. Most of the anger is directed at the high pricing, as well as Apple’s decision to remove the SD card port. \nBut Apple maintains that the new MacBook Pro is performing extremely well in terms of sales, with Senior VP or Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller recently quoted as saying: “We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there are certainly a lot of people as excited as we are about it.\" \nWatch: MacBook Pro 2016 – First Look \nWhat do you think of the new MacBook Pro? Let us know in the comments.

      "text": "Siri - Principal Software Engineer \nThe multinational has an unmarked office near Cambridge train station that's currently home to a team of roughly 30 people working on voice recognition technology. However, the office can accommodate significantly more staff, according to a source. \nThe job description for the Principal Software Engineer role gives a bit more insight into what Apple does in Cambridge. \n\"Want to work on the cutting edge of software engineering, machine learning and big data?\" it reads. \"Join Apple’s Siri team in Cambridge, UK, and be part of revolutionising human-machine interaction!\" \nIt continues: \"You will be joining a highly talented team of software engineers and machine learning scientists to develop the next generation of Siri. We use world class tools and software engineering practices, and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence with a single aim: make a real difference to the lives of the hundreds of millions of Siri users.\" \nAt the time of writing, some 218 people had applied for the Software Engineer/Senior Software Engineer role, according to LinkedIn. \nApple Maps/Skitch \nSavills \nSome of the roles are flexible, with Apple letting people work from home for part of the week. The job ad for the Siri Operations Engineer role reads: \"Note — the role can be based remotely but the successful candidate will be required to work from the Cambridge office at least 3 days a week.\" \nApple's Cambridge office is home to many of the employees from VocalIQ — a voice recognition startup that was spun out from the university and acquired by Apple in 2015 for up to $100 million (£80 million). \nVocalIQ's software — designed to help computers and people speak to each other in a more natural dialogue — hasn't found its way into Siri yet , according to an artificial intelligence (AI) expert that Business Insider spoke to earlier this year with knowledge of voice recognition platforms. \"I think it’s extremely unlikely that [VocalIQ] is in Siri now,\" the source said. \"In fact, I’m pretty sure it isn’t. But obviously Apple have got it for a reason.\" \nApple is competing with companies like Amazon , Microsoft, and Google when it comes to creating AI-powered personal assistants. Despite a number of impressive hires, including Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) Russ Salakhutdinov, one of the world’s leading talents in AI, Apple has been falling behind in the global AI race, according to several reports, including this one from Bloomberg . \nApple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.",

      "text": "Apple Shares 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Thursday November 10, 2016 5:34 am PST by Joe Rossignol Apple has shared its annual holiday gift guide on its website, with product recommendations such as the 12-inch MacBook, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad Pro , fourth-generation Apple TV , gift cards, and related accessories. The guide also points gift-givers towards various music products, photography products, games, and toys. This year's holiday gift guide is less sophisticated than in previous years, such as in 2015 when Apple split gift recommendations into six categories: gaming, photography, music, fitness, learning, and travel. Nevertheless, this year's list provides a basic overview of some of Apple's most popular products and accessories for those unfamiliar. Apple offers free shipping in several countries: • United States: Free two-day shipping on in-stock items ordered by 5:00 p.m. local time each day, and free next-day shipping on any in-stock iPhone. • United Kingdom: Free next-day delivery on in-stock orders over £40 placed by 19:00 local time each day. Free standard delivery for everything else. • Australia: Free next-business-day delivery to most metro areas on in-stock items over $250 ordered by 2 p.m. local time. Free standard delivery for everything else. • Canada: Free standard shipping on everything. • Western Europe: In countries such as France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, Apple offers free next-day delivery on in-stock orders over €40 placed between 15:00 and 17:00 local time each day. Free standard shipping is generally available otherwise. Free shipping on everything is also available in Italy.",

      "title": "What CEO Tim Cook Said to Apple Employees After Donald Trump's Win",
      "text": "Tim Cook has written a letter to all Apple employees The letter does not refer to Donald Trump by name Cook says it's time for Apple employees to move forward together \n( Also see: Donald Trump's Stunning Victory Over Hillary Clinton Leaves Silicon Valley in Shock ) \nWhile silent in public, Cook did send a memo to all Apple employees - first published online by BuzzFeed - asking them to \"move forward together\", adding Apple \"is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world.\" Interestingly, the memo does not mention president-elect Donald Trump by name anywhere. Here is Tom Cook's letter to Apple employees after Donald Trump's US elections victory in full: \nTeam, \nI've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: \"If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.\" This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world - regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet's move forward - together! \nBest, Tim \nDuring the campaign stage of the 2016 US presidential elections, Cook had made his support for Hillary Clinton pretty clear, and is said to have even hosted a fundraiser for her. Very early in the campaign, Tim Cook was also reportedly on Clinton's list of potential Vice-President nominees.",

The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple's Tim Cook Addresses Trump Election, Calls for Unity by Bryan M. Wolfe November 10, 2016 \nFollowing one of the nastiest U.S. presidential elections in history, Apple CEO Tim Cook has called for unity in a memo to Apple staff. \nAs first noted by Buzzfeed , the CEO said the following: \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, \nOn Tuesday, Donald J. Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States. View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC. All rights reserved. Nothing found :( Try something else",

The commission's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said at the time: \"Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies—this is illegal under EU state aid rules.\"\nNoonan, underlying the Irish government's earlier position on the Apple judgment , said:\nThe government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis and the decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European courts...\nSo in that light, given that the case is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings, I am constrained by what I can say in making any further comment.\nFurther Reading Apple could bring home billions in taxes if US passes a tax holiday Dublin wants to protect what Noonan has described as \"the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.\"\nStateside treasury officials have also attacked the ruling, arguing that it would \"constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US government and its taxpayers.\"\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK",

More >> \nIt looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts. An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "Reddit \nI’ve said more than once that I’m relaxed about Apple’s decision to fit only USB-C ports in the new MacBook Pro. I’d rather have to pay for two adapters and one cable now than be stuck with outdated ports for most of the 4-5 years I expect to keep the machine. \nBut I discovered that Apple did have one more hidden extra cost in store for 2016 MacBook Pro buyers: the $69 (13-inch model) or $79 (15-inch model) power adapter the company sells as an accessory doesn’t include the USB-C cable you need to actually, you know, use it … \nWhat you get in the box is: the power adapter a mains plug that’s all \nThere is no figure-8 extension cable, exactly as with the MacBook Pro itself (it’s available separately for $19), which is perhaps forgivable – not everyone will need one. But there’s also no USB-C cable, rendering the charger completely useless unless you lay out another $19 . If you want both the figure-8 cable and USB-C cable, that brings the total cost of a second charger for the 15-inch MacBook Pro up to $125. \nI’m lazy. I can’t be bothered to move power adapters around, so I always have three: one in the office, one in the living-room and one that lives in my luggage along with a complete set of essential cables. That’s a habit I developed when I was doing a lot of travel, enabling me to pack in ten minutes flat and also ensuring I didn’t forget anything important, but one I still consider worthwhile today. \nSo two additional power adapters would – at Apple prices – add up to $250 on top of what is already an extremely expensive machine . That does, I have to say, leave a rather unpleasant taste in my mouth. \nOf course, there’s no need to pay Apple prices for either cable. Amazon has masses of USB-C to USB-C cables, including ones from respected brands for around half the price of Apple’s cable. Same with figure-8 leads , like a two-pack for $8 . \nBut it’s the principle of the thing. What Apple is selling is not a power adapter in the sense that it has always sold them – something you can take out of the box and start using – but rather one half of a power adapter kit, with the other half sold separately. That, to me, is taking penny-pinching a step too far. Guides",
