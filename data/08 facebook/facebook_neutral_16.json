      "text": "Now you can play Instant Games with your Facebook Messenger app By 0 \nFacebook continues to innovate Messenger as one of its most popular spin-offs. The IM chat app is getting many rivals but it remains to be one of most frequently used today. It’s easy and faster to use. Sometimes, it’s even faster than email. It’s also fun to use with those stickers, emoticons , animations, and games. Other features like Instant Articles , Group Calling , and chatbots that make it more interesting. \nEarlier this year, Facebook rolled out the Flick Hoops as fun game you can play within a Messenger conversation. And now, the top social network is introducing more games you can play on Messenger. Some of the games available include Words with Friends: Frenzy, TRACK & FIELD 100M, SPACE INVADERS, Galaga, EverWing, and PAC-MAN. These are the titles we’re all familiar with. We’re assuming Facebook added them because they are easy to play and control. We’re also guessing one reason could be because each game is lite and not too graphic-heavy. \nThe Facebook Messenger Instant Games will be available in 30 countries for both Android and iOS. To play, launch a conversation with a contact and then click on the game controller icon you see. You can challenge your other friends or choose to play solo. \nAt present, there are about a billion Messenger users taking advantage of the instant messaging app each month. Aside from chat and voice calls, you can connect with your friends by playing games on Messenger with them. It’s just one way of spending time and cultivating relationships with those people that matter to you.",

      "text": "Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely. Photo: Facebook.\nIsrael favorably views the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump’s Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as a peace broker with the Palestinians, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.\nIn an interview published in the Hong Kong-based newspaper’s “This Week in Asia” section , Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said, “We would be so happy if someone could bring peace to the Middle East. We welcome him.”\nHotovely was referring to a suggestion made by Trump during a recent meeting with New York Times representatives that the 35-year-old Kushner — who is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka — could help forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, a goal that has eluded so many past American presidents.\n 1:06 pm 0 New State-of-the-Art Battleship Joins Israeli Naval Fleet to Bolster Maritime Operations, Defense Along Northern Border A new state-of-the-art battleship was inaugurated this week by the Israeli Navy to bolster maritime operations and defense of the northern...\n“I think he’d be very good at it,” Trump said . “I mean he knows it so well. He knows the region, knows the people, knows the players.”\nThe fact that Kushner is a Jew, Hotovely noted, is irrelevant to his potential role. “What matters is that he is American…we will be happy if someone can promote peace,” she said.\nHotovely, the South China Morning Post reported, was visiting Hong Kong to accept a World Health Organization award for Israel’s field hospital expertise. With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holding the foreign affairs portfolio, Hotovely is Israel’s highest-ranking full-time diplomat.\nIn the interview, Hotovely expressed confidence that outgoing President Barack Obama would, during his remaining time in the White House, veto any possible Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli settlements or setting the parameters for a peace deal.\n“I don’t see the American president not vetoing such a resolution because it is against his own interest,” Hotovely said. “His interest is that the sides will come and talk and [doing this] is counter-productive to that.”",

We’re all in it for the big win on this one,” State Police wrote on their Facebook page. \nContact reporter Dan Alexander at Dan.Alexander@townsquaremedia.com.

      "text": "How To Make Bone Broth (Your Go-To Winter Elixir and Skin Food) November 30, 2016 Share on Facebook iStock/Alleko \nBone broth is having a moment. But unlike some other wellness trends (looking at you shake-weight workouts and extreme juice cleanses), bone broth is a tried and true elixir that’s been made for centuries. In fact, your grandma was most likely making bone broth on the regular. Want to be like Grandma? Here’s how to make bone broth in your own kitchen and reap its many wellness benefits. Bone Broth Benefits \nAccording to Sally Fallon , traditional wellness pioneer and author of “Nourishing Broth,” bone broth is “a cure-all in traditional households and the magic ingredient in classic gourmet cuisine.” This broth, made from the bones of chicken, fish, and beef “builds strong bones, assuages sore throats, nurtures the sick, puts vigor in the step and sparkle in love life.” Sign us up. \nFallon also notes bone broth to be healing for the common cold and flu, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, adrenal fatigue, anemia, osteoporosis, leaky gut, anxiety, menopause, nervous system disorders, food allergies, and heart disease. \nAlthough research on bone broth is limited, some small studies have shown benefits of drinking bone broth. A study from the University of Nebraska medical center found that the amino acids produced when making chicken stock (or broth) reduced inflammation in the respiratory system and improved digestion. Dr. Axe notes that research is proving bone broth to have immune boosting properties, plus the ability to reduce allergies, asthma, and arthritis flare-ups. Bone Broth Nutrition \nBone broth’s superstar nutrition status is due to its wide array of amino acids, fats, minerals, collagen, and gelatin. \nAlong with vitamin A and B12, iron, potassium, zinc, and phosphorus, bone broth contains easily absorbable calcium, magnesium, and silicon, vital for whole body health. Bone broth is also packed with a wide array of amino acids including glycine and proline that help to form collagen and sooth and protect joints. Specifically, bone broth is filled with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine–components in cartilage and tissue noted to reduce inflammation and soothe arthritis and joint pain . Bone Broth: Skin Rx \nEach sip of bone broth delivers a dose of skin-loving collagen (composed of the amino acids glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine) for both radiant outsides and insides. In fact, celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Shailene Woodley are hooked, and wellness gurus swear by the stuff for youthful and supple skin. \nNew York City skincare expert, Julia March , is a huge fan of bone broth’s skin-boosting properties. “I highly recommend it to everyone who wants clear and firm skin,” March notes. “Bone soup contains minerals that nourish the skin cells, and they calm inflammation in the body—and consequently on the face as well.” \nCollagen, the main protein found in animal connective tissue, delivers these skin-boosting effects. Consuming collagen has been shown to significantly improve skin elasticity, increase moisture, and increase the density of the dermis, the thick layer of skin beneath the epidermis. Collagen is abundant in bone broth, so sip away! All About The Bones \nSourcing bones for homemade broth is a big deal. Not just any bones will do. \nBones from pasture-raised animals not fed artificial ingredients or given hormones and steroids are the very best choice for your broth. Source quality bones like those from your local farmers market, a sustainable butcher , or health food store. Call ahead and reserve a bag or two of bones. More than likely, the butcher or farmer will be happy to have you taken them off their hands, and may even discount if purchased in bulk. \nBone broth can be made from a variety of different animals including chicken, beef, bison, lamb, fish, and pork. In fact, using different parts of the animal within broth (feet, neck, tail, ears, shank, etc.) and using more than one kind of animal in the broth (i.e. chicken and beef) is one of the best ways to reap a variety of different minerals and an abundance of gelatin and collagen. \nAlthough using bones from feet and necks may sound a bit intimidating, it is truly one of the best ways to use a whole animal–an important sustainability commitment. Bone broth makes use of a byproduct, therefore reducing food waste and honoring the life of an animal. How To Make Bone Broth \nGrab your bones, herbs, and slow cooker! Here’s how to make bone broth in the most delicious and easy way possible. \nAlthough the broth making process can be done with a large pot on the stovetop, a low and slow cooking method with a slow cooker is the most desirable – and safe – method. \nYields about 2-3 quarts \n2 pounds of pasture-raised bones, unfrozen (chicken, turkey, lamb, pork, beef, or a mixture) 2 carrots, roughly chopped 2 stalks of celery, roughly chopped 1 onion, roughly chopped A bundle of fresh herbs such as parsley, oregano, thyme, and rosemary 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar Filtered water \nDirections \nPlace bones in slow cooker and add in carrots, celery, onions, and herbs. \nFill the slow cooker up with water so the bones and vegetables are covered and add in apple cider vinegar (necessary to break down the bones and marrow). \nTurn slow cooker on high for eight hours. \nAfter eight hours, turn down to low heat for the remaining amount of time. Chicken and turkey bone broth is done after 24 hours of cooking, while beef, lamb, and pork bone broth needs 48 hours to cook. If doing a mixture of bones, cook for 36 hours. \nOnce broth has finished cooking, spoon out and discard all the vegetables, herbs, and bones. \nStrain the broth over a large pot with a fine mesh strainer to catch any bones or other bits you may have missed. \nThe final product can be stored for up to six months in freezer-safe containers, such as mason jars, or in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. \nUse bone broth in soups or stews or simply drink a mug in the morning with breakfast. \nRelated On Organic Authority",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nLos Angeles will mark World AIDS Day Thursday with screenings, discussions and events. But as its cities focus on HIV/AIDS awareness, Joel Goldman, managing director of the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in Beverly Hills, said that he feels the U.S. has lost momentum in fighting the spread of the disease. \n\"I think there's a general feeling in the U.S. that HIV is not something that's still a major issue,\" Goldman told KPCC. \nHis foundation's focus this year: calling on the entertainment industry to increase the number of characters and storylines that educate viewers about HIV and AIDS, Goldman said. According to Goldman, there has been a \"lack of engagement\" when it comes to shows discussing the disease. \nAt a panel discussion on Wednesday night at 7 p.m., his organization will bring together representatives from SAG-AFTRA's National LGBT Committee, celebrities and HIV/AIDS activists to discuss the state of the fight against the spread of HIV in the United States. \n\"We've been stagnant,\" he said. \"We still have a lot to do.\" \nIn addition to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation panel, bars, religious institutions and LGBT organizations across L.A. will commemorate World AIDS Day on Wednesday and Thursday with documentary screenings, art installations and a tree lighting. Here are few of those events:",

U.S. Postal Service says it's illegal \nPostal Service warns of ‘get rich quick’ chain letter making rounds on social media Updated: 7:55 PM CST Nov 30, 2016 Share {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! WASHINGTON — \nInspectors with the U.S. Postal Service are sending out a warning against a series of chain letters that have appeared on Facebook as of late. Advertisement \nA ‘Secret Sister’ chain letter prompts users to participate in a $10 gift exchange with others. While it may seem like a good way to spread the gift of giving, there is one issue, the practice is illegal. \nAccording to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the chain letter is a form of gambling, and violates a section of the Postal Lottery Statute. \nChain letters are illegal if they request money, or other items of value, and promise a substantial return for those who participate in the practice. Inspectors say chain letters that ask for small value items, such as picture postcards or recipes, are legal, since such items are not things of value within the meaning of the law. \nAnyone who spots one of the chain letters is encouraged to report the post to Facebook.

You’re stuck with Pelosi — again. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Photo: Michael Reynolds, epa) \nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., won another term on Wednesday as the leader of House Democrats by defeating Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, 134-63. Facebook comments are edited for clarity and grammar: \nThis is great news for Republicans. While liberals pander to transgenders and undocumented immigrants, Republicans have added the white working class to their base and will gain even more power in 2018. \n— Donovan Farr \nI guess Democrats are gluttons for punishment and losing. Keep up the good work liberals! \n— Rich Farrell \nSince Pelosi was first elected as House Speaker, Democrats have lost the House, the Senate and the presidency. Staying the course seems unlikely to yield different results. \n— Ted Wilke \nDemocrats keep doing the same thing expecting a different result. Nobody “wants” Pelosi in the Democratic Party. She just has access to the largest donors and is sold-out to the highest bidders. That’s why Democrats keep losing. They are afraid of losing the money more than losing elections. \n— Chad Clausen Policing the USA \nThis was an opportunity for the Democrats to rebuild themselves. President-elect Donald Trump is going to have the spotlight on him during his term. \nNew Democratic leadership would have allowed them to “fly under the radar” while making platform changes to invigorate support among Millennials, women and minorities. Democrats just gave Trump the chance for a second term. Stupid. Now it will be the status quo. \n— Fernando Mendoza \nYet another example of needing term limits along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \n— Bruce Mort \nTo quote Napoleon: “Never interfere with an enemy while he’s in the process of destroying himself.” \n— Alan Robinson ",

      "text": "\nIf you’re unaware of Tomi Lahren from your Facebook feed or her work on The Blaze , this interview with The Daily Show will give you the full experience. Trevor Noah shares a short clip to give the audience a little background on Lahren’s work — not his first time diving into it — and spends most of the interview in a defensive stance with the outspoken conservative pundit. \nLahren is reportedly more popular than Donald Trump on Facebook and her rhetoric fits right in with plenty of his campaign stances, with a focus on Black Lives Matter. It’s definitely one of the first times we’ve seen Noah get heated during an interview, reminiscent of Jon Stewart taking on Jonah Goldberg or Jim Cramer. The difference is that Noah still seems a little shocked by some of Lahren’s statements. When she drops lines about not seeing color, calling Black Lives Matter a violent organization, and some questionable things about the KKK, you see Noah sorta react with the crowd. \n\nThere’s plenty of groans throughout the appearance, but I’ll give Lahren some credit for sticking to her guns. Those guns might look like the cartoon one from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? but they don’t change throughout the interview. I give more credit to Trevor Noah for not taking it easy and putting some defense up against Lahren the entire time. There’s also a few nice jokes in there. \nAnd I don’t think she ever answered his question. \n(Via The Daily Show )\n",

The Pelicans won 112-94. (Photo: AP Photo/David Goldman) \nDwight Howard has run point on fast breaks before with good results. This was not one of those times. This time things ended with a one-handed pass careening off the backboard. \nI'm not sure if Howard was trying to toss an alley-oop or what the heck happened, but check out the reaction from Mike Muscala on the far left side of the screen. He appears to slam his foot down in disgust. Muscala hustled to get himself open, and Howard just threw it away. I'd be mad too. \nHoward should probably try sticking to being the guy running through the key to slam home the alley-oop. In case you're interested in how fast breaks are done: pic.twitter.com/WcvDuNH4Kl — Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) December 1, 2016 \nThe Hawks went on to lose a close one to the Suns, 109-107.

      "text": "  \nFacebook has put a big emphasis on multimedia in recent years, and it’s where most of us share photos and video online. The social network is free, simple, and doesn’t require us to spend any extra time sharing with friends because that’s what it’s made for. It’s estimated that more than 300 million photos are uploaded each day, making it one of the biggest online photo directories on the planet. \nMore: The art of the poke: A Facebook guide for the uninitiated \nGiven this sheer amount of photos on Facebook, it’s likely that you’ve uploaded a photo or two in the past, especially if you’ve used the service for a considerable amount of time or know people who may have included you in their own photos. But how do you retrieve said photos from Facebook if your computer crashes, or if you decide to deactivate your account and take a break? Well, we’ve come up with this handy guide to help you out. Downloading a single photo using Facebook \nBefore we delve into more advanced alternatives, it’s worth noting that there is an easy way to download your photos one-by-one, or a photo from a friend or Facebook group that catches your eye. To do so, click on the photo in your timeline and select Options in the menu bar that appears when you mouse over the image. Afterward, click Download and select a save location for the resulting file.

      "text": "Getty Images Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Late last year, the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said they would donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares toward a new financial vehicle for charitable purposes. \nNow, Mr. Zuckerberg's chief lieutenant, Sheryl Sandberg, is making her own philanthropic move. \nMs. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, plans to transfer nearly $100 million of her Facebook shares to an existing fund, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. She intends to use the new money in the fund for charitable giving, said a person briefed on the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly about them. \nMs. Sandberg will direct the money to organizations that, among other things, deal with women's empowerment issues, according to the person familiar with her plans. That includes LeanIn.org, a nonprofit group that Ms. Sandberg founded based on her best-selling book about women in the workplace, \"Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead.\" Her plans were reported earlier by Recode. \nMore from the New York Times\nMark Zuckerberg Vows to Donate 99% of His Facebook Shares for Charity \nMark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Pledge $3 Billion to Fighting Disease \nPhilanthropy in Silicon Valley: Big Bets on Big Ideas \nFacebook did not immediately comment on Ms. Sandberg's action. \nMs. Sandberg has a history of charitable donations to groups like LeanIn.org, as well as to anti-poverty efforts in some Bay Area counties. \nLike Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg has signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign founded by the billionaires Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett, that asks the world's wealthiest people to give away at least half their wealth either during their lifetime or upon their death. \nMs. Sandberg's philanthropy has broadened since the sudden death of Dave Goldberg, her husband of more than 10 years, when the couple was on vacation in Mexico last year. She has spoken about the grieving she underwent in the months after his passing, publicly posting about it to her Facebook page. \nAlong with her other causes, Ms. Sandberg's donations will include a gift to OptionB.org, a new charity she plans to start that will be focused on helping others cope with loss and hardship. She is also in the midst of writing \"Option B,\" a book about resilience in the face of hardship. \nMs. Sandberg transferred roughly 880,000 Facebook shares to her \"donor-advised fund,\" which operates much like a charitable savings account and is tax-deductible. The fund is managed by the mutual fund giant Fidelity. \nMr. Zuckerberg and his wife are using a different financial structure, a limited liability company, for their philanthropy. In September, they pledged a chunk of the money — at least $3 billion over the next decade — toward preventing, curing or managing all diseases by the end of the century.",

(AP) — A woman who created a phony Facebook profile of her ex-boyfriend in order to frame the Southern California man for stalking has been sentenced to a year in jail. \nStephani Lawson of Las Vegas was sentenced Wednesday after pleading guilty to perjury and false imprisonment. \nProsecutors say Lawson waged a campaign to get Tyler Parkervest of Irvine, California, arrested last year after the couple broke up. \nCity News Service says Lawson filed eight police reports alleging Parkervest made Facebook threats to kill her and her daughter and at one point held her in his car at knifepoint. \nBut prosecutors say Lawson lied about the attack and sent the threats to herself. \nParkervest was arrested four times and charged with stalking, kidnapping, battery and making threats. The charges were dropped last month. \n___ \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Share this: ",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nThe legendary Swiss chocolate bar Toblerone has changed shape – and people are not happy about this one. \nThere was always something special about this chocolate bar. It always seemed a little more prestigious than your average pack of favourites, and for some reason was the chocolate I always given at Father’s Day. \nThe Daily Mirror published an article on the pressing matter , which revealed that the chocolate bar will be made, in future, with larger gaps between the triangle pieces. They explained that this change was a result of increasing ingredient costs. \nWe are definitely not OK with this. \nTo disguise this change, Toblerone will maintain it’s original size, however the weight of the bar will decrease due to the widened gaps, and effectively less chocolate. \nThe company added this change was necessary to ensure the chocolate stays affordable. \nYes it may be affordable, but nonetheless disturbing. \nUnfortunately and understandably, this recent update to the chocolate bar have left many in distress. As a result, people are searching for a way to return the chocolate to its former glory or, rather re-purpose the snack. \nPeople have taken to social media to submit their ideas on alternate uses for the chocolate bar now that it has become a gappy disaster, like a child missing its two front teeth. \nCheck out the all new purposes for Toblerone here .

      "text": "Chris Pratt Is Playing a Long, Subtle, Excellent Prank on Jennifer Lawrence By Facebook The best part is, she may never know. \nPassengers , the high-concept sci-fi rom-com everyone's clamoring to see, is just three weeks away. From a script by John Spaihts (who is also responsible for the earlier, better versions of Prometheus before Damon Lindelof got his hands on it), the film follows two passengers on a spaceship ( o ) who wake up many years early from cryogenic sleep, with only each other for company. \nOne of the more amusing stories to emerge from its production, though, is the relationship forged by Pratt and Lawrence during filming.

Here's a picture Pratt posted to his personal Instagram yesterday: Loading \nHe posted another hours later: Loading",

Join the Conversation Mark Hinson, Democrat senior writer 9:28 a.m. EST December 1, 2016 Kim Tae-ri, left, and Kim Min-hee play dress-up in “The Handmaiden,” opening Friday. (Photo: Magnolia Pictures) \nNEW THIS WEEK: “Believe,” “The Handmaiden,” “Incarnate” \nThe Accountant \nR, 128 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence. \nBen Affleck, Anna Kendrick. An analyst in the Treasury Department is blackmailed into tracking down a number-cruncher for the underworld and eventually uncovers a solitary CPA with high-functioning autism who happens to be a very good shot. Flashback-heavy action pic directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Jane Got A Gun”), who knows a thing or two about making slick entertainment. The top-shelf supporting cast includes J.K. Simmons, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow, Jean Smart and Jon Bernthal. (B) \nMovies 8: Noon, 2:45, 6:55, 9:40 \nAllied \nR, 124 minutes. Profanity, violence, strong sexual content, nudity, drug use. \nBrad Pitt, Marion Cotillard. During the early days of World War II, an America intelligence officer and a French Resistance fighter pose as a couple while killing Nazis in Morocco and, later, start a family in London. Romantic spy thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis (“Back to the Future,” “Forrest Gump”), who is obviously aiming for an update of “Casablanca” (1942) but misses the mark by several inches. With Josh Dylan and Jared Harris. (B) \nAMC 20 : 1, 4, 7, 10 \nGovernor’s Square: 12:15, 3:20, 7:20, 10:20 \nAlmost Christmas \nPG-13, 112 minutes. Profanity, mild violence, sexual humor, drug use . \nDanny Glover, Gabrielle Union. Bickering, grown siblings spend a long holiday week with their widower dad, who is hiding his plans for selling the family home in Alabama, in this rather predictable ensemble comedy-drama. At times it plays like a warm-fuzzy flick from the Hallmark Channel. But the cast is very game and there a few solid laughs served up with the inevitable burnt casserole. With JB Smoove, Jessie Usher, Kimberly Elise, Mo’Nique, Nicole Ari Parker, Keri Hilson and Omar Epps. Produced by FAMU alum Will Packer. (B-) \nAMC 20: 11:30 a.m., 2:15, 5, 7:45, 10:30 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:25, 3:25, 7:35, 10:20 \nArrival \nPG-13, 116 minutes. Profanity, scary special effects . \nAmy Adams, Jeremy Renner. A linguistics professor, who is still grieving over her dead daughter, is called in by the military to translate the language spoken by aliens who’ve landed some very big spaceships on Earth. The clock is running while the Chinese threaten to attack the outer-space visitors. Well-acted but very pretentious sci-fi snoozer directed by Denis Villeneuve (“Sicario”). With Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg. (C+) \nAMC 20 : 11 a.m., 2, 5:15, 8, 10:50 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:40, 3:40, 7:25, 10:25 \nBad Santa 2 \nR, 92 minutes. Vulgar language, violence, gross bathroom humor, frank sexual humor, graphic nudity, smoking. \nBilly Bob Thornton, Kathy Baker. The booze and bad behavior flows freely when a drunken department store Santa Claus is badgered by his horrendous mom while working a charity event in Chicago. Raunchy comedy sequel to the cult hit directed by Mark Waters (“Mean Girls,” “Vampire Academy”). With Christina Hendricks and Tony Cox. \nAMC 20 : 12:30, 3:15, 5:45, 8:15, 10:45, 11:15 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:05, 2:30, 4:55, 7:30, 9:55 \nBelieve \nPG, 120 minutes. Mild profanity, violence, thematic elements . \nShawnee Smith, Ryan O’Quinn. When his small-town business takes a financial nosedive, the struggling owner announces plans to cancel the annual Christmas pageant until he meets a young boy who believes in miracles. Inspirational film written and directed by cinematographer Billy Dickson (“One Tree Hill”). With Issac Ryan Brown, Danielle Nicolett and Kevin Sizemore. Opened Friday. \nAMC 20: 1:15, 4, 6:45, 9:30 \nBilly Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk \nR, 110 minutes. Profanity, war violence, sexual content, drug use. \nJoe Alwyn, Kristen Stewart. In 2004, combat flashbacks haunt a decorated hero when he returns to Texas from the war in Iraq to do a victory lap during a Dallas Cowboys football game. Directed by the stylistically versatile Ang Lee (“Brokeback Mountain,” “The Ice Storm”), who has made a stirring combat film and a subtle message movie all in one. With Chris Tucker, Vin Diesel, Tim Blake Nelson, Kellie Pickler and Steve Martin (who plays a serious role for once). (B+) \nAMC 20: 4:30 \nBlair Witch (2016) \nR, 89 minutes. Profanity, violence, scary stuff . \nBrandon Scott, Wes Robinson. Pretty college students armed with a variety of cameras and drones venture into the allegedly haunted woods of Black Hills Forest in Maryland where they encounter an angry, supernatural entity in a Hollywood-ified revisit to the shaky-cam horror movie “The Blair Witch Project” from the mid-’90s. Directed by Adam Wingard (“You’re Next,” “The Guest”). \nMovies 8: 7:10, 9:20 \nBoo! A Madea Halloween \nPG-13, 103 minutes. Profanity, violence, suggestive humor, scary stuff, drug use . \nTyler Perry, Cassi Davis. An outspoken, no-nonsense matriarch is called in to keep an eye on her 17-year-old niece, who is determined to sneak away to a frat party on Halloween, and spends the night battling clowns and zombies. Horror-comedy written and sloppily directed by Perry, who also plays three roles. It’s a stupid-fun romp if you can ignore the preachy moral message that Perry hammers home. (B-) \nAMC 20 : 11:15 a.m., 1:45, 7:15, 10 \nDeepwater Horizon \nPG-13, 107 minutes. Profanity, violence, disturbing images, rumbling drill pipe. \nMark Wahlberg, Kate Hudson. In April 2010, as the mega-corporation BP pushes its employees to work faster on an iffy oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, a compromised drill pipe explodes and the crew members fight for their lives in the inferno. Director Peter Berg (“The Rundown,” “Hancock”) takes a hyper-realistic, grunt’s-eye view of an epic environmental disaster. With Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, Trace Adkins, Gina Rodriguez and John Malkovich (trying out an over-boiled Cajun accent). (B-) \nMovies 8: 12:05, 2:25, 4:40, 7:15, 9:35 \nDoctor Strange \nPG-13, 115 minutes. Intense violence, vertigo-inducing special effects . \nBenedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams. After a car crash causes severe nerve damage in his hands, a brilliant and arrogant neurosurgeon heads to the Far East seeking a cure and ends up as a superhero. Marvel Comics-based action pic directed by Scott Derrickson (“The Exorcism of Emily Rose”), who decided to mix the usual Marvel malarkey and overkill with all the special effects from “Inception.” With Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen (playing the evil villain, natch), Benedict Wong and Tilda Swinton. (C+) \nAMC 20 : 11 a.m., 2, 4:45, 7:45, 10:45 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:45, 3:35, 6:50, 9:35 \nThe Edge of Seventeen \nR, 102 minutes. Profanity, frank sexual content, teen drinking, vomit. \nHailee Steinfeld, Haley Lu Richardson. In this rare gem of a teen comedy, a self-centered junior in an Oregon high school feels betrayed and left out when her older brother begins dating her best friend. A disarmingly deep, rich and very funny character study written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (“Post Grad”). With Woody Harrelson, Kyra Sedgwick and Blake Jenner. More, please. (A-) \nAMC 20 : 1:30, 4:15, 6:45, 9:15 \nGovernor’s Square : 1:15, 4:05, 7:15, 10 \nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \nPG-13, 132 minutes. Action violence, mild sexual innuendo, scary special effects . \nEddie Redmayne, Colin Farrell. In 1926, an egg-head wizard named Newt Scamander, who was expelled from Hogwarts School, arrives in New York City during 1926 with a magical suitcase packed with strange, endangered creatures in this J.K. Rowling-penned fantasy flick . Directed by David Yates, who was also behind the camera for the last three “Harry Potter” movies. Yeah, it’s “Doctor Dolittle” meets “Men in Black.” That’s all you need to know. The kids will eat it up. Also featuring Samantha Morton, Ron Perlman, Jon Voight and Katherine Waterston. (B) \nAMC 20 : 11:30 a.m., 12:30, 1:45, 2:45, 3:45, 5, 6, 7, 8:15, 9:15, 10:15 \nIMAX : 1, 4, 7, 9:45 \nGovernor’s Square : Noon, 12:30, 3:15, 3:45, 6:30, 7, 9:35, 10:05 \nHacksaw Ridge \nR, 131 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence, war gore galore, intense situations, racial slurs, bullying, smoking. \nAndrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn. An Army medic, a practicing Seventh-day Adventist who refuses to carry a rifle into combat, saves more than 70 comrades during the heat of battle on Okinawa during World War II. Based on a true story. Directed by Mel Gibson (“Braveheart,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Apocalypto”), whose obsession with guts, blood and gore borders on a mental compulsion. Still, the story is a powerful one and Vaughn provides some much-needed comic relief as a drill sergeant. With Rachel Griffiths, Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer and Sam Worthington. (B+) \nAMC 20 : 11:45 a.m., 3, 6:15, 9:30 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:35, 3:50, 7:05, 10:10 \nThe Handmaiden \nNot rated, 164 minutes.

During the Japanese Occupation of Korea in the ‘30s, a pickpocket is hired as a personal servant for a wealthy heiress and becomes part of an elaborate swindle scheme. Think of it as a disturbing, kinky and erotic twist on “Downton Abbey.” Directed by Chan-wook Park (“Snowpiercer,” “Oldboy”), who is one twisted biscuit but he makes hard-to-forget films. This is another one. Subtitled. Opened Friday. (A-) \nAll Saints Cinema : 6 p.m. (7 p.m. on Saturday and 5 p.m. on Sunday) \nIncarnate \nPG-13, 87 minutes. Profanity, violence, sensuality, disturbing images, scary special effects. \nAaron Eckhart, Breanne Hill. A scientist with the ability to enter the subconscious minds of the possessed must save an 11-year-old boy from the grips of a very powerful demon, while facing the horrors of his troubled past. Directed by Brad Peyton (“San Andreas”). Opened Friday. \nAMC 20 : 12:30, 3, 5:30, 8, 10:30, 11 \nLoving \nPG-13, 123 minutes. Thematic elements, racial slurs . \nJoel Edgerton, Ruth Negga.

Mild profanity, violence, bathroom jokes, rude humor . \nGriffin Gluck, Andrew Daly. A by-the-rules principal and a new student, who is determined to break every rule in the code of conduct handbook, butt heads in many creative ways.

Profanity, brief violence, sexual content, drug use. \nAshton Sanders, Mahershala Ali.

Profanity, manic violence, rude humor, disturbing images, scary special effects. \nJared Leto, Margot Robbie. The government recruits infamous villains such as The Joker, Harley Quinn and Deadshot to go on a deadly mission to slaughter zombie-like creatures and fight a mysterious what-not. In the wake of the truly subversive “Deadpool,” this anti-superhero flick rings false. With Will Smith, Ben Affleck, Viola Davis, Common, Jesse Eisenberg, Tom Hardy, Adam Beach and Jai Courtney. Directed by David Ayer (“Fury,” “End of Watch”), whose hyperactive editing style and jumbled storytelling makes for a dull roar. (C) \nMovies 8: 12:15, 3, 6:50, 9:30 \nSully \nPG-13, 96 minutes. Profanity, intense situations, scary special effects. \nTom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart.

With Laura Linney, Katie Couric and Michael Rapaport.

      "text": "Facebook wants to demystify AI The company revealed a series of videos that attempt to explain how artificial intelligence works. Share Save \nThough movies and TV shows would have us believe that artificial intelligence means machines rising up against us, the truth is much more benign. Indeed, many of us use AI on a regular basis: Just ask Siri for directions to a restaurant or tell Shazam to name a song. This is certainly true of Facebook too, which uses AI and machine learning for a variety of tasks such as identifying images , translating languages and, yes, ranking your News Feed . With such a vested interest in AI, Facebook is releasing a series of videos today to offer a brief introduction to what it is and how it works. \n\"We want to tell people it's not magic,\" says Yann LeCun, Facebook's director of AI research. \"This is not The Terminator . It's real technology that's useful.\" In a blog post released today, LeCun and Joaquin Candela, Facebook's director of applied machine learning, wrote that there is nothing artificial about AI: \"AI is a rigorous science focused on designing intelligent systems and machines, using algorithmic techniques borrowed from the human brain.\" This, LeCun and Candela say, includes the ability to learn from the past and recognize patterns. \nFor example, in one of the videos, LeCun says that in order for a computer to figure out if an image is of a car or a dog, it needs a learning algorithm. This requires millions of samples -- after all, there are hundreds of different kinds of cars and dogs and thousands of ways they can be shown in a photo -- and then that algorithm has to have a \"generalization ability\" in order to take what it has learned and apply it to images it's never seen before. The result might seem magical, yet the process is anything but. \n\"It's more prevalent than you suspect,\" says Candela. \"A lot of experiences simply wouldn't work without AI.\" That's why one in four engineers at Facebook is well-versed in some form of AI. Facebook uses AI to vocally describe what's in a photo to those who are visually impaired and offer quick translations of foreign languages. \nThis groundwork of AI and machine learning paid off when Instagram started to experiment with ranking instead of showing photos in reverse chronological order. \"If none of that had existed, it would've taken a very long time,\" says Candela. But since the company already had years of work on this subject, the team was able to implement the algorithm quickly. \nYet these algorithms have had their fair share of critics. Recent revelations about the rise of fake news on Facebook raise questions about how Newsfeed ranks these stories. LeCun and Candela say, however, that this is largely a product issue and not one with the technology itself. \n\"One thing that is important to explain is that different layers are involved in building an experience with AI or machine learning,\" says LeCun. He compares AI to that of an unbiased oracle. \"It might tell me the probabilities that it'll rain in Mountain View, for example. It doesn't have an opinion. It's likely to have an error in both directions. You can take those unbiased oracles and then build a product experience from that.\" Essentially, Lecun says that when it comes to issues that deal with content, that's more about policies and product design rather than the underlying technology. \nHowever, Candela says that the AI team could help in coming up with guidelines on how to avoid certain pitfalls and dangers. That's one of the reasons why Facebook's AI team is open-sourcing their efforts: so they can improve the dialogue surrounding such matters. \nAs for why they think this AI education is so important: \"AI is going to affect our lives,\" says LeCun. \"It's very important for people to have some idea on how it works and what it can do.\"",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nSylvia Castro Garcia says she was simply helping her jailed brother by posting his thoughts on his Facebook page. Fresno County prosecutors, however, say the information she posted jeopardized the life of a witness in her brother’s murder case – and could have cost another witness her life. \nGarcia, 43, a single mom with three children and a steady job at the Internal Revenue Service in Fresno, is now headed to prison. She pleaded no contest Wednesday in Fresno County Superior Court to a felony charge of conspiring with her brother, Juan Castro Ortiz, to dissuade a witness from testifying against him in his pending murder trial. \nIn an interview from jail before her plea, Garcia admitted to putting her brother’s writings on his Facebook pages and Twitter account that she created for him. But she said her only crime was believing in her brother’s innocence. \n“I’m in here because the system is corrupt and there’s a cover up going on,” she said from the inmates’ side of the visitors room inside the Fresno County Jail. “The Sheriff’s Office has done a lousy job of investigating my brother’s case.” \nProsecutors, however, contend that Garcia published information that has put a witness’s life in jeopardy and could have led to the killing of another witness, Joanna Solorio Maya,who was discovered hacked to death July 13 outside an apartment complex in Mendota. Her murder remains unsolved. \nIn her jailhouse interview, Garcia denied having anything to do with Maya’s death. \nI was doing it for the love of my brother. I am sorry for making the wrong choice. \nSylvia Castro Garcia \nBut after months of denying her role in her brother’s case, Garcia changed her view about her predicament on Wednesday, telling Judge Alvin Harrell III in a handwritten letter: “I am deeply sorry for this mistake that has caused me turmoil.” \n“I ended up doing an unthinkable error,” she wrote. “I was doing it for the love of my brother. I am sorry for making the wrong choice.” \nHarrell accepted Garcia’s no contest plea and scheduled a sentencing hearing on Dec. 30. Under the plea agreement, Garcia faces up to two years in prison. Harrell ordered her held in jail without bail until her sentencing. \nThe plea caught Garcia’s mother, Rosalie Alarcon, and other relatives in the courtroom by surprise. Alarcon said her daughter and son are both innocent. \n“Everybody puts stuff on Facebook,” Alarcon said. “Why is she being singled out?” \nAlarcon said her daughter is the oldest of four children. Garcia also is the single mother of three children; the youngest is 7 years old. She worked for the Internal Revenue Services for 11 years as a clerk. Her only prior offense is a drunken driving conviction in 2014, when she pleaded no contest, court records show. \nIn the jail interview, Garcia said she became of a target of the Sheriff’s Office once she started asking questions about her brother’s case. She said the information she put on Facebook about the witness’ phone number, address and picture had already been posted by the witness. She also said the witness is a Facebook friend of Ortiz. \nThe last entry on Ortiz’s Facebook page is on Nov. 16. It says: “THEY GOT ME AND MY SISTER SYLVIA NOW! we're both locked up. HAHA BUT WE'RE STILL NOT DONE FIGHTING! 187Poetry!” \nOrtiz, 39, was arrested May 30, 2015, after Maya and the other witness told detectives that they saw him shoot Jose DeJesus Fuentes-Martinez, 52, along a canal bank west of Firebaugh. \nEverybody puts stuff on Facebook. Why is she being singled out? \nRosalia Alarcon, the defendant’s mother \nIn her jailhouse interview, Garcia contended that sheriff’s detective Jose Diaz had a conflict in investigating the murder because she said the detective grew up in Mendota, is friends with the surviving witness and her brother, and has dated a friend of that witness. \nSheriff spokesman Tony Botti said none of that is true: “Detective Jose Diaz is not from Mendota; he grew up on the East Coast. He also did not know any of the people involved in this case prior to the investigation. Therefore, we at the Sheriff’s Office do not see any conflict of interest in having Detective Diaz investigate this case.” \nCourt documents say Maya and another woman contacted Mendota police during the early hours of May 30, 2015. Ortiz was arrested later that day near Oller and Ninth streets, carrying a gun, a sheriff’s news release said. \nGarcia said she has read the sheriff’s reports about the case and contends her brother is innocent because detectives tested his hands for gunshot residue, but found none. She said detectives, however, didn’t test Maya’s hands or the hands of the other witness for gunshot residue. “They just picked my brother and closed the case,” she said. “That’s why I’m upset.” \nCourt records give this account of the killing: \nMaya and the other witness told detectives they were with Ortiz when he agreed to give Fuentes-Martinez a ride from Mendota to Firebaugh for a few dollars. On the way to Firebaugh, they said Ortiz pulled his truck over near a canal off Jerrold Avenue, north of Nees Avenue. \nThe witnesses said Ortiz demanded the victim’s wallet. When he refused, he was shot in the chest. Ortiz then drove Maya and the other witness back to Mendota. \nOrtiz was arrested and charged with murder, being a felon in possession of a handgun, and carrying a loaded firearm in public. His trial has been delayed because criminal proceedings were suspended in February when his lawyer called into question his competency to stand trial. \nFound mentally unfit, Ortiz was sent to Atascadero State Hospital. He stayed at the hospital until July, when he returned to the Fresno County Jail after he was declared competent to stand trial. His next court hearing is Thursday. \nCourt records say the surviving witness contacted Diaz at the Sheriff’s Office in March after she saw a posting on Ortiz’s Facebook page. The post included two photographs of the witness, her telephone number, home address and other personal information. \nSo what’s up little homie, how you been? \nJuan Castro Ortiz, according to court records \nUsing a search warrant, Diaz discovered Ortiz had two Facebook accounts under Juan Ortiz and Juan C. Ortiz Poet . \nIn one post on Ortiz’s Facebook page, it says: “My name is Monique and I blame the gutter homie Duck for a murder he didn’t even do. Does anybody want to play with me?” (Duck is the moniker for Ortiz. Monique is the first name of the witness in Ortiz’s case.) \nDiaz also got a warrant to search Garcia’s Facebook page. In one post, it says: “Working on my brother’s 187 diary. Check out his f/b page at Juan C. Ortiz Poet.” (187 is the Penal Code number for murder.) \nGarcia also jokes about her role: “Yes he tells me what to put and when to put. Guess I’m his secretary ...lol.” \nIn August, Diaz interviewed Garcia at her home in San Joaquin and learned Ortiz is sending her letters from jail to post online. “The defendant admitted to setting up and running all of Ortiz’s social media accounts while Ortiz was incarcerated,” court records say. “In fact, she said Ortiz doesn’t even know the passwords.” \nAfter arresting Garcia, Diaz also collected a trove of letters and poems from Ortiz from his sister’s home. From the letters, Diaz discovered that Ortiz was asking people about Maya. “I want to expose Maya and (the other witness) to all!” one letter says. \nDiaz said Ortiz also wrote to Maya in October 2015: “So what’s up little homie, how you been?” \nIn a letter in October, Ortiz included a photograph of Maya and asked someone to “post up any place you might walk in Mendota,” court records say. \nThen in January, Ortiz asked his sister to post pictures of Maya and the other witness on Facebook with transcripts of his case to show their involvement. \nOn Aug. 4, Ortiz wrote another letter to his sister, telling her that he read a newspaper account of a car wreck in which a woman from Mendota was killed. “As cold hearted as it sounds I was kinda hoping it was her,” Ortiz wrote, referring to the witness who has blamed him for shooting Fuentes-Martinez. \n“Cause if it was her, then that means I would beat the murder case,” he wrote. \nAbout two weeks later, Ortiz wrote another letter to Garcia, saying the witness’ testimony “is the only one that can do any real damage to my case. I pray that (she) would make herself unavailable to testify in court at the preliminary hearing and at trial.” \nGarcia also wrote to her brother, telling him that Diaz took “letters, poems, emails, everything” from her home. “I”m sorry I’m such an idiot for keeping everything in my house. It’s my fault if he adds more charges on you. I knew this was gonna happen. I just didn’t think it would happen this soon.” \nIn the end, court records say, Garcia admitted to Diaz: “You know what happens when people open their mouths like that ... nobody can snitch ... (because) snitches gets stitches and end up in ditches.” \nPablo Lopez: 559-441-6434 , @beecourts Juan Castro Ortiz, 39, was arrested May 30, 2015, after two witnesses told detectives that he allegedly shot Jose DeJesus Fuentes-Martinez, 52, on canal bank west of Firebaugh.

      "text": "It started on a Facebook post praising Michelle Obama for her eloquence . \nJoAnn Nietto told the Denver Post one of her friends typed the original status, and then she saw a woman she didn’t know, Dr. Michelle Herren, made a couple comments on it. \n“Doesn’t seem to be speaking too eloquently here, thank god we can’t hear her!” said the first comment, which included a picture of Obama, who appeared to be screaming. “Harvard??? That’s a place for ‘entitled’ folks said all the liberals!” \n“Monkey face and poor ebonic English!!!” She continued in a second comment. “There! I feel better and am still not racist!!! Just calling it like it is!” \nNietto found out the woman was a pediatric anesthesiologist at Denver Health, a public hospital, and decided to report her. \n“It really outraged me to see that she works at Denver Health, which serves a huge minority population,” Nietto told the Denver Post on Wednesday. \nDenver Health said they are looking at options for disciplining Herren, since the First Amendment and other state and federal laws prevent them from firing her for statements made while off-duty. In the meantime, she will not be seeing patients. \nHerren makes $363,000 per year, according to the Denver Post. Her Facebook appears to have been deleted. \nObama, who is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law, has been targeted with these kinds of remarks before. West Virginia Mayor Beverly Clay praised a social media post calling the First Lady an “ape in heels” and subsequently resigned in November. The post was made by Pamela Ramsey Taylor, the director of a government-funded nonprofit, who was also removed from her position.",

      "text": "Facebook’s advice to students interested in artificial intelligence Posted Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures moves into video game publishing \nMath. Math. Oh and perhaps some more math. \nThat’s the gist of the advice to students interested in AI from Facebook’s Yann LeCun and Joaquin Quiñonero Candela who run the company’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and Applied Machine Learning group respectively. \nTech companies often advocate STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), but today’s tips are particularly pointed. The pair specifically note that students should eat their vegetables take Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics as early as possible. \nFrom this list, probability and statistics are perhaps the most interesting. From what I remember about high-school, those two subjects are regularly dismissed as too-obvious strategies for skirting the informal AP Calculus preference of top colleges and universities (AP Statistics is often thought of as a cop-out by students). \nIf differential equations represents the electricity that powers machine learning, statistics represents the gears of the machine itself — as the company touches on in a series of AI explainer videos we linked to at the bottom of this post. \nTo be fair, LeCun and Candela are most likely addressing the college crowd, though its important to consider incentives across all levels of education. Simply, we all could probably use some more statistics in our lives. Beyond math, the two say more math engineering, computer science, economics and neuroscience are also important subjects in today’s economy. How else would a fledgeling machine learning student learn to leverage neuroeconomics and cognitive bias to target ads? \nThe pair also point to philosophy as a necessary prerequisite to understanding knowledge and learning. Amidst all the talk of News Feed bias , it’s important to remember that there is a human behind every application of machine learning. We don’t yet know how to escape the black box problem , but we do know that it will be humans working to figure it out and it would sure help if those humans understood how learning works before they start manipulating data. \nLastly, Facebook turns its attention to the actual mechanics of getting a job in the field of machine learning. Most of these tips are self explanatory: find a professor to work with, consider working with PhD students who have more time on their hands and try to secure an industry-focused internship regardless of your future aspirations to understand how AI works in the real world. \nWhen applying to PhD programs the two note that being able to identify a professor you want to work with is far more important than program ranking. Once there, students should work to address a specific problem and try to release a piece of open source code before all is said and done. Introduction to AI",

      "text": "No Gay at Grandma’s Funeral! Connor Hakes (Facebook). \nConnor Hakes, 23, asked to perform at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church after learning of his grandmother’s death on Nov. 21. \nHakes says he and his family have been longtime members of the parish, so he was saddened when Father Bob J. Lengerich denied his request in a lengthy letter that has since been made public. [Can be viewed at the linked article.] \nIn the letter, Lengerich said he was concerned that Hakes was living a same-sex lifestyle and openly advocating for LGBT rights. \n“Anytime someone sins and then acts in the name of God, it causes scandal,” said Lengerich. “This is the main reason why you cannot (at this time) offer your gifts in service at St. Mary’s.” \nThe letter goes on to say that any person who serves in the church or as a representative of the church must uphold the church’s values. \nThe church suggested Hakes should perform his tribute outside of the church, saying “you are more than welcome to honor your Grandmother with a special tribute in song as long as it is outside of the Mass and outside of the Church, perhaps at the Funeral Home or Parish Hall during the viewing, at the cemetery after the committal and/or even at the luncheon.” \nHakes, who studied singing at Indiana University, says he’s performed at the church for several years, but he wasn’t surprised by Lengerich’s response. \n“It was very clear that he had judged me and formed and opinion about me,” said Hakes. “There was no reason to believe I would be changing his mind.” \nHakes says the church’s decision was partly based on a photo that was posted on Facebook last year, which shows him attending a gay pride rally with friends. \nHakes says he believes his grandparents would be “disgusted” by the church’s decision. \n“Their compassion and empathy was abundant, no matter who you were,” said Hakes. “They saw beyond race, religion, sexuality, and social class. They loved everyone. That is what it means to be a Christian. That is what it means to be Catholic.” \nThe church has responded with their usual mealy mouthed nothingness. It would be a bit more on point if they whacked their parish priest over the head with the need for actual morals. Oh wait…yeah, that won’t happen.",

Join the Conversation Joanna Allhands , The Republic | azcentral.com 6:02 a.m. MST December 1, 2016 3 Shares \nArizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas speaks during a press conference unveiling an update to her education plan \"AZ Kids Can't Wait\" at the Arizona state Capitol in Phoenix on Nov. 29, 2016. (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) \nDiane Douglas's plea for $680 million in additional K-12 funding captured the headlines (as it should — school funding is a huge need). \nBut that only takes up the first few pages of the state education superintendent's 162-page plan for schools . \nThere are more ideas (good and maybe not so) that deserve attention and debate, including: Make report cards more than just grades \nSchool report cards mostly focus on how students did on tests. Their letter grades measure growth as well as how many students scored well in math or reading, but it's still largely a snapshot of academic performance. Douglas says there are lots of other things that can help parents determine a school's quality, including the kinds of arts programs it offers, the number of students enrolled in gifted programs, the variety of science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) classes offered or the social programs available to help at-risk kids. \nGenerally, I agree. I mean, Arizona needs to continue offering letter grades based on academic performance — and they should be rigorous. The majority of schools should not earn an A or a B when so many students statewide aren't proficient in basic skills. But education is about more than just test scores, and parents deserve to know how their school stacks up against others in the areas they value most. 4 takeaways from the new AzMERIT test scores Allow more testing options than AzMERIT \nA bill passed last session allows schools to test their students using state-approved measures other than AzMERIT. But the law forbids D- or F-graded schools from using the menu of approved options, and the state pays for schools to administer only AzMERIT; any other tests must be paid for by schools. \nDouglas argues that those provisions exacerbate the differences between rich, excelling schools and poor, low-achieving ones. Her plan notes that all schools should have equal opportunities to choose the assessments they desire. \nI see her point, but I understand why lawmakers put in those provisions. Perhaps the larger question is whether we need one standardized test to compare performance in every district — and whether AzMERIT continues to be that test. Offer incentives for the most troubled areas \nAdmittedly, there isn't much detail about this in the plan; creating education development zones is mentioned as part of expanding the Zip Code Project , which aims to help the 183,000-plus young adults who are neither in school nor working do something more productive with their lives. It's not clear how these zones fit into that mission, but the plan says they would function something like an economic-development zone for areas that desperately need good teachers and schools. \nTeachers who work in these zones could take advantage of incentives, such as not having to pay state income tax, qualifying for larger school-supply tax credits or getting larger or quicker student-loan repayments. Charter schools also could earn tax incentives for creating campuses in these areas. \nI like the idea in theory if it helps attract and retain quality educators. But as we all know, the devil is in the details. Let's flesh this one out. Get real about what's holding some kids back \nThere are nearly 30,000 homeless kids in Arizona schools — about 3 percent of all students enrolled in public schools. These kids often have to carry everything they own with them to school, at the risk of ridicule from their peers. How do you help these kids arrive at school ready to learn? \nOne of Douglas's proposals involves simply offering a secure, discreet space at schools where kids can leave their pillows, toiletries and other possessions. But there are others to help at-risk kids, and that's smart. They recognize that thousands of kids are coming to school with issues far greater than mastering reading, math and science. If we want to improve their achievement, we have to meet their basic needs first.",

      "text": "Facebook is launching games inside its popular Messenger app. (Photo: Facebook)\nSAN FRANCISCO — Earlier this year, Facebook Messenger took a tentative step into mobile gaming with the launch of a simple basketball game . Shoot a basketball emoji to a friend who taps on that emoji to play a little one-on-one inside the popular messaging app.\nWhen the game racked up more than 1.2 billion plays in three months, Messenger quit playing around.\nStarting Tuesday, friends can face off in titles from arcade classics such as PAC-MAN to more modern favorites such as EverWing. How it works: Start a conversation in the latest version of the iOS or Android Messenger app, tap the game controller icon and choose a game. After a round is finished, people in the conversation can see your score and challenge you back. Messenger users can search for games on Messenger or on Facebook News Feed where they can play solo or challenge friends back in Messenger without downloading any apps.\n“We were shocked by how successful this was and how people really enjoyed not only playing games on Messenger but also challenging their friends,” Messenger chief David Marcus said. “That’s when we decided we needed to build a better gaming experience for people on Messenger and actually let the pros build games, the real game developers instead of us.”\nIt’s game on at Facebook — again. The giant social network, whose popularity soared as addicted users whiled away the hours on FarmVille and Candy Crush Saga, is doubling down on gaming.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook unveiled a new initiative called Facebook Instant Games, an HTML5 gaming platform to play games on Messenger and in the Facebook News Feed on the Web and on mobile.\nMessenger has a game controller icon. The Facebook app has a game bookmark. Seventeen titles are available on both including Words with Friends: Frenzy, SPACE INVADERS and Galaga.\nThis is all part of Facebook’s multi-pronged gaming strategy, says Gartner analyst Brian Blau. Games played a key role in the early days of Facebook on the Web but lost momentum with the mass consumer shift to smartphones. More recently, Facebook released a new desktop gaming platform called GameRoom and its Oculus unit is investing heavily in gaming.\nGames is the latest bid to increase engagement on Facebook Messenger. (Photo: Facebook)\n“It is a content type that many people relate to, and when you have a new platform, games are almost always one of the first app types that make an appearance, and that’s what we are seeing with Messenger,” Blau said.\nInstant Games is the latest effort from Facebook Messenger to entice its 1 billion users to spend more time on the service — and create opportunities to generate revenue down the line. Messenger is taking a page from the playbook of Asian messaging apps such as Tencent’s WeChat and Japan’s Line that have large libraries of money-making mobile games for users to play with friends.\nAt the outset, games will be free and there will be no in-game purchases or advertising, Facebook Messenger says.\nMarcus says it’s “TBD” (to be determined) if and how Messenger makes money from mobile gaming. But eventually Facebook could take up to a 30% cut.\nFacebook makes about $45 million a month in revenue from gaming, according to Piper Jaffray. At the peak in December 2011, it made $65 million a month.\nFacebook famously says its mission is to connect everyone on the planet. It’s also intent on gobbling up every minute you spend online from streaming live video to chatting with businesses to hailing rides. Gaming is a key way to hook people for longer stretches by pushing them to do far more than chat inside the Facebook app and the Facebook Messenger app.\n“Users in general really take to games. They love them as a pastime,” Blau said. “From the younger generations to millennials, they expect that entertainment to be at their fingertips.”\nThat said, games are a “hit-driven business,” he said. The success of Instant Games will depend “on the content, the user interface and other things, too. It’s hard to say how popular it’s going to be,” Blau said.",

      "text": "Message Send So, this is the wedding season again. Every time I log in to my Facebook account, I can see the news feed full of newly married blissful couples and changing relationship status of many people(obviously from ‘single’ or ‘complicated’ to ‘engaged’). I believe in love marriages but I am really stuck at the idea of arrange marriages. I mean, how you can decide about your life in just one meeting. I know that there is enough time to know the person and that enough time is between engagement and marriage. Talking to each other for hours and meeting once or twice in a week for 1 or 2 hours cannot help knowing the person more than a trip with him/her. Travel helps you decide whether you are about to take the right decision or not. How? Here is the explanation: 1. Unveiling The Veil Don’t wait for the first night to unveil the veil. No, no, don’t take it otherwise. I am just talking about the personality traits. When someone is new in a relationship (and obviously when relationship status is ‘engaged’), they behave very nicely. But when someone travels, his/her natural stimuli awaken. It is the time when you can see the real picture. 2. Fears and Strengths While travelling, you get to know if they are open to learn or experience something new. If he/she tries new adventures (marriage is also an adventure) to overcome his/her fears, he/she can be an ideal life partner. Travelling together also helps to know how well they can adapt with the new environment and culture. 3. Meeting New People Your reaction when you meet new people reflects your personality. Travelling together, you will meet many new people, your reaction and getting along with them show how friendly you are and how soon you create a bond with the people. It helps to know whether they can get along with your family. 4. Some Quality Time Spending quality time kick starts a relationship the best way possible. Sitting silently with relaxed state of mind, you can chit-chat or play games. The quality time spent together is healthy for a relationship and brings out some undisclosed facts of each other’s lives. 5. The Little Things Life is all about the little things. The little things and the quirks explain the lifestyle of a person. What’s the first thing they want in the morning, how many times they call their parents and how they dress up? The little good and bad habits will bring out the real person from that ‘perfect marriageable image’. 6. Music Taste Walking or running, talking or eating, driving or partying, music is always there. If you share the same taste in music, the fortune is on your side but if it is not the same you never know which band he or she may pick next. 7. Extreme Reactions Not all travel experiences are smooth or comfortable. There are always some last minute issues. So, how do you react? Extreme happiness, extreme sorrow, extreme panic or extreme silent are the emotions that are necessarily to be experienced before getting hitched. 8. Discovering the Reality Travel is about amazement, thrill, adventure and excitement. We never know what we discover during these expeditions. Who knows you might be a stranger to yourself too and then you get to explore yourself and that too with them beside you (best feeling I guess). 9. Silent Lovers There is peace when you are being isolated with someone. We all know that we cannot talk all the time (in some cases, may be yes). So, if you two enjoy the silence together get hitched soon. Being silent and still enjoying the company of each other make an ideal bond. 10. Lifetime Memories Even if you know that you two belong to each other, taking a trip together will help you earn lifetime memories. ‘Never go on trips with someone you do not love’ Ernest Hemingway said once. But you may try going on a trip with a stranger and who knows you may come back as lovers. × Close",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nOn paper, my life is seemingly perfect. \nI live in a foreign country, a city that can only be described as truly breathtaking. I have a career that I absolutely love, a wonderful family and a handful of close friends. \nMy Facebook is slathered with pictures of my smile, my Instagram is something most travelers aspire to and my suitcase has seen more countries than most of the people I’ve ever met. \nI couldn’t be more thankful for the experiences I’ve had and the life that I have built for myself. \nBut, things are never really “perfect,” are they? Most of us are guilty of creating an online facade, including myself. \nThe truth is, I am so lost that I feel like I am falling, desperately hoping someone will catch me.

There are too many things I want to do, see, feel and be, and I won’t ever have enough time for it all. \nBut then, why is it so easy for me to spend days on end sitting in my apartment, not doing a damn thing? \nPeople think I am brave when I tell them I can move countries, cities, jobs or apartments at the drop of a hat. I guess that shows you just how diverse this illness is. \nMoving countries doesn’t scare me, but a moving bus full of strangers does. \nThey get tired of my excuses. They no longer want to invite me out because they know I will say no. \nAnd I am sorry. The guilt that I feel for that is punishment enough. They think there’s something wrong with me, and maybe there is. \nEven though I want every second of every day to be meaningful, not everyone can fit into the small social crevices that make up the puzzle pieces of life. \nI want to put the copious amounts of love that I have into a constructive connection with other human beings, and I want to be the life of the party without being sincerely intoxicated. \nBut, those things just don’t come easily. \nI’ll agree that my mind is untidy. Thoughts float around and contradict each other at a rate that makes me dizzy and tired. How To Feel Good About Being Alone To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nI want to make new friends, but welcoming new people into my life only increases the chance of me disappointing them. \nIt’s not that I don’t want to meet my friends for coffee next week or go out for dinner tomorrow evening. I just don’t know how I will be feeling that day. \nWill the train be so full that my breath becomes shallow and fast? Will the windows be open so I can steal pockets of fresh air? \nOr, will I begin to feel my body pulsate the second I see a crowd? Will the thought of having to go out in one hour, two days or one week create such panic within me that it makes every single second leading up to the day feel like a torturous and devious hand churning my stomach? \nPlease promise to stick with me through my “excuses,” through my phone calls that might last longer than you had anticipated because my head is so full of thoughts that need to be let out and through the times when I don’t seem as interested in your life as you had hoped. \nAnd I promise that I will try my best to be there for you whenever you need me because, despite my somewhat irrational behavior, I really do love you. \nAnd at times, this illness makes me feel powerless and lonely. I’m so sorry, and thank you for standing by me. \n ",

      "text": "\nIn last week’s stats roundup , I reported how more companies than ever are investing their budgets in Facebook dark posts. \nBut wait just a moment - what exactly are dark posts? \nYou might have heard of dark social or dark web – but this is something different. \nLet’s shine a light on the subject. Social posts for select eyes only \nA dark post is anything a brand might post on Facebook – such as a link, video, photo or status – that will only be seen by a specific or target demographic. \nUnlike a regular published post, a dark post does not show up on a brand’s timeline or on its follower’s organic newsfeed. \nInstead, it appears as an advert for some, but remains hidden to everyone else. \nYou might have heard dark posts also being referred to as ‘unpublished posts’ – they are the same thing, a promoted and targeted post that is not published on your brand page. \nA similar option is available on LinkedIn. Why do brands use them? \nThere are many benefits to using dark posts. \nThe biggest is that unlike organic or boosted posts, they enable brands to carry out A/B testing without cluttering up their own pages and annoying users in the process. \nBy tweaking headlines, call-to-actions and even the time of publication - brands can measure CTR’s and determine what kind of ads are the most effective and why. \nFurther to this, it allows brands to ramp up personalisation . \nWith the ability to post dozens of ads without the fear of backlash, posts can be targeted to a user’s location, interests or previous online behaviour. \nThe idea is that the more targeted they are, the larger the likelihood of engagement. Are they better than boosted posts? \nA recent report from TrackMavens found that businesses are spending on average nearly twice as much on dark posts as they are on boosted posts. \nHowever, despite this increased spend resulting in greater reach and more page likes, boosted posts appear to garner more engagement overall. \nThe average boosted post on Facebook receives 643 total interactions, while the average dark post on Facebook receives 559 total interactions. \nWith the latter having more longevity - staying active for around 42 days - it appears that dark posts are being used as more of a long-term strategy for larger brands. Should you use dark posts with caution? \nWhile dark posts mean improved targeting and testing, brands do need to be wary that they don’t enter into ‘creepy’ marketing territory. \nInstead of increasing engagement, using super-personal details like names has the potential to alienate users instead of attracting them. \nHowever, if used correctly, these types of posts can undoubtedly be a valuable tactic for brands online. \nThe chance to carefully measure how an ad performs, as well as tailor it to a target demographic, could easily outweigh the high cost and potential pitfalls. \nWith a recent survey finding that 46% of users use ad blockers due to annoyance over irrelevant ads - it's sometimes better to be left in the dark. \nPublished 23 November, 2016 by Nikki Gilliland @ Econsultancy \nNikki is a Writer at Econsultancy.

      "text": "Denver Health doctor not taking appointments after racist Facebook post Ryan Haarer, KUSA 1:51   A 9NEWS file photo of Denver Health Medical Center. (Photo: KUSA file photo) \nKUSA - A Denver Health anesthesiologist is taking heat for posting racist comments about First Lady Michelle Obama on Facebook. \nSocial media lit up Thursday after the story broke. \nIn response to another Facebook user’s praise of Obama, Dr. Michelle Herren wrote: “Monkey face and poor ebonic English!!! There! I feel better and am still not racist!!! Just calling it like it is!” \n(Photo: Facebook) \nTwo minutes later she posted an unflattering photo of the First Lady yelling with the comment: “Doesn’t seem to be speaking too eloquently here, thank god we cant hear her! Harvard??? That’s a place for ‘entitled’ folks said all the liberals!” \n(Photo: Facebook) \nDenver Health responded to the posts on Facebook saying that until further notice, Herren “will not be seeing patients or providing anesthesia services at Denver Health Medical Center.” \nJoAnn Nieto saw the post on a friend’s Facebook feed and shared with news outlets. She also contacted the CU Board of Regents as Dr. Herren holds a non-paid faculty appointment at the University of Colorado, as do many Denver Health physicians.“I find in absolutely appalling that she is working at a public institution as well as with many many children who are minorities,” Nieto said in a letter to one board member. “This is completely unacceptable and I sincerely hope that corrective action is taken. I sincerely hope she is relieved of her duties as both a teacher and a practitioner.” The board member responded by saying the Facebook comments “are repugnant and contrary to the University of Colorado’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.” \nThe member explained to Nieto that Herren is not an actual University of Colorado employee. Even so, it’s been requested that the School of Medicine address the issue with the doctor. \nThis is Denver Health’s full statement: \n“Denver Health is deeply disappointed by the remarks posted on social media by Dr. Michelle Herren against the First Lady of the United States. We are offended by the comments made by this individual, who was acting independently in her private capacity. Her views are contrary to the mission and values of Denver Health, and to our staff and patients. Denver Health proudly serves people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and social backgrounds – and our staff and patient population truly reflect our diverse community and nation. We are reaching out to all of our patients, employees and physicians to reinforce our culture, mission and beliefs that all individuals regardless of their race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation are deserving of dignity and respect.” \nCopyright 2016 KUSA",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \n\"Things To Come\" is a French film about a woman in mid-life made by a woman in her early 30s. \nIt stars Isabelle Huppert and is written and directed by Mia Hansen-Løve. It’s the fifth feature film from Hansen-Løve, who started making movies in the early 2000s. Huppert has her beat by a bit — she began her acting career in the early 1970s. But Huppert now seems to be working more than ever. \nIn fact this winter the French actress has two movies in theaters. She also stars in the Paul Verhoven film, \"Elle\" — a role that landed her the award for best actress at the Gotham Independent Film Awards. \nBut her part in \"Things To Come\" is perhaps quieter and more nuanced. In it, Huppert plays a philosophy teacher who is forced to reconsider her life when she learns that her husband is leaving her. \n“Things To Come” had its North American premiere at the Telluride Film Festival. That's where the Frame's host, John Horn, caught up with Mia Hansen-Løve and Isabelle Huppert to discuss the film's inspiration and subtle character portrayals. \nClick the play button above to hear their full conversation or read below for highlights. Interview Highlights: On how Huppert's character approaches her work and her love of teaching: \nIH: I think that's what struck me most when I first read the script was the potential of the possibility for me to be... I wouldn't say funny, but there was a sense of humor — there was a sense of distance that runs constantly throughout the film. That for me was probably the most important because I was sure that the movie was never going to be either too dark or too sentimental. [It] was never going to fall into this kind of cliche. One could feel the potential of nuances in the film — of subtlety. This perfect mixture between lightness and — I wouldn't say heaviness — pain, because there is pain. But the ironical distance that's in the film was very important. It was all there already in the writing of the script and in the dialogues. I think the dialogues are so important for an actress when you read the script for the first time because it's through the dialogues more than the situations, more than the characters that you really project yourself immediately. It happens to me sometimes — to be willing to do a film just because I wanted to say one line. You see yourself through this one line. On what about philosophers Hansen-Løve wanted to show in the film: \nMHL: Both of my parents were philosophy teachers for years and years so it's the world I've been growing up in. I guess there's a connection between the character and my mother somehow. I wouldn't say I made the film in order to pay tribute to her because I don't think you can make a film to play tribute, in general. I think you make a film because you need to express something. It has to do with some intimate necessity. So the goal was not to say 'thank you' or whatever, but there certainly is something in the character that is connected to my mother. Not only the world that I am depicting and that she lives in — this world of teaching and of books — but also this distance, this irony that Isabelle was talking about. It's something that I thought — and now I see things a little bit differently — but I thought, at the time, belonged to my mother than more to me. I was seeing her and seeing other women facing very difficult situations in life and I was admiring them and also curious about where they find the strength. I was wondering, where will I find strength if that happens to me? So I guess for me making the film was a way to find out what freedom is and how you can be free without having solved all the problems. On philosophy as it applies to real-life situations: \nIH: This is obviously what Mia manages to convey in her film. I thought that was also the beauty for me in doing the film. Even in French films, you don't have that many films about philosophy. The way the philosophy infused the film is really attractive. If you say that you're doing a movie about a philosophy teacher, people might think, oh it's going to be very abstract or it's going to be very dry or very conceptual. But in this case, no — philosophy becomes very concrete. First of all, she's a philosophy teacher and that's very important. She's not living in her ideas abstractly. No. She transmits her ideas for the sake of life not for the sake of being in an invented world. She transmits those ideas to the students to be prepared for life — for the movement of life. The way Mia uses philosophy in the film is very concrete as it is for most young students. I noticed that when students come to study philosophy at the end of their studies in France, all of the sudden... Let's say a young student might not be interested in literature, but they very quickly are interested in philosophy because they understand how it comes across so many topics. It becomes political, sociological. It's really concrete. It speaks for your life and your contemporary life. On why Hansen-Løve wrote a film about someone much older than herself: \nMHL: I don't think in terms of age. I've been making films about very different characters. All of my films were some kind of portrait, but they were young men, young girls — very different people. For me they are the same kind of portraits that I do with empathy and love and comprehension. When I start writing a film, I don't have in my mind the concrete information on the character. It really comes from some kind of emotion and identification. So the difference of age that there was at the beginning and that could create a distance between me and the character when I started writing it just tended to become more and more significant the more I went along with the process. At the end, when the film was over, I was like, it's me! It's kind of weird, but for me it really makes sense because I think films are always ways from one point to another. For me, making this film was really about this. It was about joining the character. First I thought it would be a film about my mother and it ended up being a film about me. When I say about me, it's not like it's about me like what the film says. I mean the emotions and the fillings and the quest for freedom. All of this ended up being my own concern at the end. \n“Things to Come” opens in limited release on December 2nd. The film will go into more theaters the following week.

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nDamien Chazelle, the director of \"Whiplash,\" has a new film and it's a throwback to the jazz musicals that used the dance moves of duos such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to captivate audiences. \nThe story of \"La La Land\" uses an old-fashioned genre, but drops it in the middle of contemporary Los Angeles. The male lead, played by Ryan Gosling, is an aspiring jazz pianist struggling to find his audience. Opposite him is Emma Stone's character, a struggling actress working at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. lot. Together, their stories weave into an image of artists moving toward a dream one choice at a time. \nThe Frame's host, John Horn, spoke with Emma Stone at the Telluride Film Festival, where \"La La Land\" had its debut. Interview Highlights: On experiencing difficult auditions: \nI could relate to being an auditioning actor and things not going right. The one I relate to the most is [the] scene where people aren't looking up from their phones. Just keeping their heads down. Or just reading the other side of the scene, and they just never look up to see what you're doing because they've already written you off and this is kind of a courtesy. So, yeah, I've had that kind of experience plenty of times. On relating to the self-doubt that actors face: \nAs a human being I think I related to the story, beyond being an actor. I don't think I know anyone that has any semblance of true humanity in their body [who] doesn't doubt what they're doing from time to time — who they are or what choices they're making or what they should have done differently. I think when I first read it and was thinking about [the part] — and I had a similar thought with \"Birdman,\" even though they're such different movies — I [thought], Is this very esoteric? Is this something that [only] an auditioning actress and jazz musician are going to relate to? Then when I saw the ending and the story of the choices we make and how life unfolds based on the choices we make, I realized it's really not about that at all. As much as it is a love letter to Los Angeles, it is about dreamers and a creative profession. I think it's also just about what happens when you have to make choices in your life that completely alter the course of your life, which we're all doing frequently. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in a scene from \"La La Land.\" Dale Robinette On early inspiration: \nMy first grade teacher put me in a play that was for fifth graders, and there was one part for a first grader. It was called \"No Turkey for Perky.\" It got me out of class because I think I was maybe the loudest kid in class and needed some kind of outlet. She saw that, thank God. I got to do this play and I fell in love from there. I did a lot of youth theater when I was growing up, so as obsessed with films as I was, I watched the same movies over and over. It was like a handful of movies that I watched over and over. Then, as I got older, I started expanding my wheelhouse in terms of what I was watching on film. Theater really started it off for me. I think I knew I wanted to be an actor from age six. On being able to pick and choose: \nThat's always going to be a question that is changing for me. Right now, I think what's been the most exciting is doing things that are challenging and in-depth. I started out doing comedy, so if I could laugh and I could improvise that was the best possible thing. I did \"Battle Of The Sexes,\" where I learned to play tennis — learned to be Billie Jean King in whatever way I could. The rewards of that have been so immense personally, because when you're that invested in something, it really becomes about the journey of what you're doing and not really the outcome of it as much. Although, you of course hope that people enjoy what happened in the end. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in a scene from \"La La Land.\" Dale Robinette On her greatest fears about acting: \nI now understand the reward of being scared by something and learning to do something you didn't think you could do. But I think that maybe came with getting a bit older. I don't know that was my initial thought when I was 15 and auditioning for [parts] in L.A. I think I wanted to make people laugh, but didn't necessarily know what it would mean to scare myself and how much you grow through that. It took some maturing on my part to get to that place. \nNow what scares me is not going for it. I think that scares me more than failing. I learned that through failure, I was like, Well, did I put it all on the line? If the answer's no, then God, that's true failure. So I think now, true failure is not giving it my all, because otherwise I can't control anything else. The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

      "text": "By Alessandra Malito, MarketWatch\nMarketWatch will interview two experts live on Facebook at 2 p.m. on Thurs. Dec. 8\nThe fiduciary rule is set to greatly affect the way retirement accounts are managed, and in turn, perhaps how much investors see in returns.\nPlayers throughout the financial services industry have been busy preparing themselves for the April deadline of the Department of Labor's rule, which came out earlier this year and requires that advisers act in their clients' best interests when overseeing retirement accounts (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-rule-retirement-account-advisers-must-be-fiduciaries-act-in-clients-best-interest-2016-04-08). In the eyes of proponents, it's a victory for retirement savers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-is-a-great-victory-for-retirement-savers-2016-04-20) as its goal is to banish unnecessarily high fees and commissions, and provide more quality advice for those investing for their futures.\nCritics, on the other hand, argue it will orphan small accounts too costly to manage and shut out a variety of investment options, instead focusing on passive choices like exchange-traded funds (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-the-fiduciary-rule-mean-that-active-and-smart-beta-etfs-get-left-behind-2016-10-14), which come at a much lower price point.\nAs part of the rule, clients might need to sign a best interests contract, which states they understand their broker-dealers (http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/02/25/fiduciary-or-broker-many-financial-advisers-wear-both-hats/), who are advisers that sell securities, might receive commissions on the products they recommend. It will also impact (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-retirement-savers-need-to-know-about-the-fiduciary-rule-2015-05-09) individual retirement account rollovers as accounts with too few assets might arguably pay more for less advice. Though there were concerns the rule would not go through under President-elect Donald Trump, it's unlikely the future president will repeal it (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-wont-change-under-a-president-trump-2016-11-09), experts said.\nCompanies such as Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) have already announced (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dear-president-elect-trump-please-do-right-by-investors-2016-11-15) they will stop charging commissions on retirement accounts. The former also said clients will only have the option of opening fee-based individual retirement accounts, as opposed to a percentage-based fee on total assets of a client's account.\nMarketWatch is going to interview Department of Labor assistant secretary Timothy Hauser and Marcia Wagner, an attorney and expert in labor law and fiduciary issues live on Facebook at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, Dec. 8. Certified Financial Planner professionals will earn a one-hour credit of continuing education after watching the session.\nHave a question you'd like to ask them? Let us know your questions in the comments or email them to Alessandra Malito (mailto:amalito@marketwatch.com), and we'll ask them during the live broadcast.\n-Alessandra Malito; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: The fiduciary standard isn't going away, no matter what Trump decides (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-matter-what-trump-decides-on-the-fiduciary-rule-the-standard-will-only-gain-strength-2016-11-22)\nRELATED: 7 dirty words I can't say because I'm a fiduciary (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/7-dirty-words-i-cant-say-because-im-a-fiduciary-2016-06-13)\nRELATED: A repeal of the fiduciary rule may slow -- but not halt -- the trend towards ETFs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-repeal-of-the-fiduciary-rule-may-slow-but-not-halt-the-trend-towards-etfs-2016-11-10)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-01-16 1614ET\n ",

      "title": "From Instagram to WhatsApp: A Timeline of Facebook's Acquisitions (Infographic)",
      "text": "\nSince August 2005, Facebook has acquired 68 companies costing the social media network a total of $23,124,700,000 USD – not including undisclosed payments. \n\nHowever, this is unsurprising since Facebook has established itself as one of the most powerful social media giants in the world, and it has the user count to prove it. As of 2016, just over 10 years after it’s inception, Facebook has a total of 1.7 billion users. \n\nThe below infographic created by TechWyse lists each and every company acquired by Facebook since August 2005. \n\nSome of it’s most memorable purchases include its acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion in April 2012, and Whatsapp Messenger, a mobile group messaging app, for $19 billion – the largest acquisition yet. \n\nUsing the infographic, you’ll also be able to see rising trends in the tech industry with Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR, virtual reality technology, in March of 2014. In contrast, some of Facebook’s earliest purchases include Parakey, an office applications/web OS program in 2007, and ConnectU, a social networking site, which it purchased for $31 million in 2008. \n\nWhile Facebook has not disclosed every acquisition cost, it’s total costs still equals more than the GDP of Fiji, Zimbabwe and Maldives combined! It’s smallest, and first, acquisition was for Aboutface in 2005 for a total of $200K. Since then, Facebook has paid billions of dollars to purchase social networking websites, office applications, travel websites, mobile app developers, software companies, fitness tracking apps and more.\n\nCheck out the below infographic to learn more about the companies Facebook has purchased, and determine for yourself which you think were worth the money. Even more, learn about some of the rising and falling trends that have taken place in the tech industry since 2005.\n",

      "text": "'A Simple Man': Comedian Jim Florentine talks new special, podcast, Facebook   5:08 PM By B.J. Lisko Repository staff writer \nJim Florentine had bought into the family life. The comedian, with a new wife and newer son, had settled into his New Jersey home to begin balancing his life with a touring standup career. \nHis material got slightly tamer but no less funny. He honed it in turning personal experiences including death, suicide and various other challenges into genuine, funny comedy. \nFlorentine even recorded his new, self-released special, “A Simple Man,” and referenced his married life and budding experiences as a father. \nThen came the divorce. \nFlorentine insists his breakup is nothing special, although the material in his current set that it spawned (withheld here as not to burn it before it’s released) is hysterical. \nBut when it came time to put together “A Simple Man” (available for pre-order via iTunes, Amazon and at jimflorentine.com), there were no special edits to cut mentions of marriage. \n“It was a couple months before I went through the divorce, but I kept that in there,” Florentine said. “It was what I was talking about at that time. I didn’t want to go back and re-edit stuff. Other than that, everything else was pretty topical other than brief moments where I talk about being married. But it’s not the whole special, so I didn’t feel it needed to be touched.” \nFlorentine — also known for stints/cameos on “That Metal Show,”“Crank Yankers,” and Amy Schumer’s movie“Trainwreck, among other things) — recently talked about “A Simple Man,” turning tragedy into comedy, his new website (AwfulFacebookposts.com) and his weekly podcast. \n\n\nQ. When and why did you decide to put out “A Simple Man” yourself? \nA. “At this point, every week the industry is changing. It’s at the point where a lot of people watch this stuff on their phone. Especially comedy specials. It’s not like an action film. So they’re watching it on a plane or a bus or when they’re traveling. Obviously Netflix is where you want to be, but they’re tossing around crazy money to guys like (Dave) Chappelle and Chris Rock. It’s tough to get your stuff on there if you’re not an A-list comic. The theory is if you have a product, release it and you can always license it out to someone down the road. That looks like the new model going forward.” \n\nQ. How does the material compare to some of your previous specials? \nA. “It’s in the same vein. It’s still my voice on stage. It’s the same delivery. The same rage. It’s not too much different, but it is different topics and better material. You always want to try to top yourself, but it’s probably up to other people to decide. I worked and honed this material for probably a good solid two years working until I got it where I wanted, so I’m happy with it.” \n\nQ. Does tragedy inspire good comedy? \nA. “It definitely can. When you’re going through that kind of thing, you’re experiencing the emotions associated with it. I’m not thinking about how I can make it funny at that time. But eventually you can think of jokes that capture the humor in something that’s pretty universal. You work through it and you see the sense of humor in it. Because it comes from such a personal place, the crowd can tell. They can tell it’s genuine, and that’s the best kind of comedy. The important thing is to approach the material without coming across bitter or angry. That can alienate the crowd. You can’t work tragedy into your set right away. You’ve got to wait until you’ve had enough time to approach it from a different or more humorous place.” \n\nQ. You rip apart people’s Facebook posts both on your podcast and on your AwfulFacebookposts.com site. Which ones to you are the most brutal to read? \nA. “The ones about the weather usually really get under my skin. ‘Dear Mother Nature, go home. I don’t like this cold, I better not run into you.’ First of all, I don’t think Mother Nature is one of your friends on Facebook. That’s the only way Mother Nature would see this. Unless someone else was friends with Mother Nature and saw that post and said, ‘Hey. I don’t know if you know this, but there’s this guy in Ohio that’s mad at you because of the weather. He’s been living there his whole life and it always gets cold, but for some reason he’s mad.’ I don’t think it’s happening. And by the way, there’s no Mother Nature.” \n\nQ. Most of Facebook and social media just seems to be for attention grabbing and fishing for sympathy. \nA. “Yeah, the ‘I can’t wait for this day to end,’ or ‘Worst day ever’ posts. Then the replies, ‘What’s wrong? Everything OK?’ They’re trying to top each other and get attention and get likes. They want to see how many comments they get on it. Facebook was originally supposed to be for people who had families that moved out of state. You want to send pictures of your kids to your mom and dad because they don’t see you that often. ‘Look, Julie went on a swing.’ That kind of (stuff). Now it’s just gotten into taking pictures of yourself. ‘I’m on my way to the gym.’ OK. So what? Good for you. What do you want me to do? Even a few weeks ago, you had everyone taking pictures of themselves with the ‘I Voted’ stickers. Wow, that’s your (expletive) American duty. What do you want me to do because you voted? Was it an inconvenience that you waited in line for 15 minutes and stared at your phone? When you would have done that somewhere else for the same amount of time? It’s just, ‘Look at me. Look how awesome I am because I voted.’ It’s all nonsense.” \n\nQ. Your “Awful '80s songs” podcasts (via Florentine’s “Comedy Metal Midgets” podcast) seem to have been a big hit, too. \nA. “I’ve been noticing that over the years. You’re in the store, and there’s gotta be music on. And it’s this goofy 80s pop music. Why do I need a soundtrack when I’m in a store? It’s not gonna make me buy more stuff. It can’t just be silence? You know how many people are just trying to figure out what they want? Instead I got ‘The Safety Dance’ cranking in my ear while I try to figure out, ‘What the (expletive) do I need?’ I don’t understand why there’s a constant soundtrack, and it’s so dated, too. I guarantee you there are no studies anywhere that say ‘If there’s no music on in the store, people aren’t gonna stop there.’ No one is going, ‘I thought you were gonna go to Kohls, what happened?’‘Well, I didn’t go there. They don’t play music in the store, so I went somewhere else instead.’” \n\nReach B.J. at 330-580-8314 or bj.lisko@cantonrep.com \nOn Twitter: @BLiskoREP",

Post to Facebook Rasheed Wallace impersonates Doc Rivers, These two are fantastic on TV together.  //usat.ly/2gSAuK2   Rasheed Wallace impersonates Doc Rivers, Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 12:03 a.m. EST December 2, 2016 \nRasheed Wallace was a guest on Kevin Garnett's show again. (Photo: Area 21) \nRasheed Wallace was a guest on Kevin Garnett's show Area 21 again on Thursday night. The two spent a portion of the show talking about Doc River's wild outburst that got him ejected from the Clippers' game on Tuesday night. \"I can't repeat what he said...we ain't got the cuss button.” -Sheed & KG break down Doc Rivers' sideline outburst 🤐 https://t.co/svjLdxUr2K — KG's Area 21 (@KGArea21) December 2, 2016 \nFirst, they marvel at how angry Rivers was. Then, Garnett tells Wallace to demonstrate how he'd restrain an angry coach. Wallace proceeds to step aside and jokingly shouts, \"You want him coach? You want him? Get him!\" \nFollowing that, Wallace says, in a serious moment, that what he saw from Rivers on Tuesday was \"out of character\" for the coach. Then, he breaks out into a Rivers impersonation that's almost as good as Jamie Foxx's . \nIt ends with Wallace stepping in front of the punching dummy that KG calls Willie Long, and they both talk to the dummy as if it's an angry coach. \nJust another night in Area 21 .

      "text": "Many people don’t realize that you can report fake news when you see it on Facebook. This helps stop it from spreading. The problem is that the option is kind of hidden. So here’s how to use it. ID: 10013917 1. When you see false information like this hoax, click on the “v” menu in the upper-right corner of the post. View this image › \nFacebook ID: 10013921 2. That pops up a menu. Choose “Report post.” View this image › \nFacebook ID: 10013924 3. Then choose “I think it shouldn’t be on Facebook.” View this image › \nFacebook ID: 10013925 4. Now select “It’s a false news story.” View this image › \nFacebook ID: 10013926 5. Great job, you just told Facebook that they need to help stop that story from spreading. You then have the option to hide all future posts from that person or page, or to permanently block them. View this image › \nFacebook ID: 10013928 Now you know how to fight fake news on Facebook. It’s also important to closely read links and posts before you share or like them. Ask yourself: Have I seen this source/website before? Are they pointing to credible sources to back up their claims? Are other sites I trust also reporting this? ID: 10013930 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! \nCraig Silverman is Media Editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Toronto.

Trump Taps Mattis for Secretary of Defense Published December 1, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nFoxNews.com UPDATE \nPresident-elect Donald Trump kicked off his post-election \"Thank You\" tour Thursday by announcing that he would nominate retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense. \nAt a rally in Cincinnati, Trump described Mattis as \"one of our great, great generals\" and added that a formal announcement would be made Monday, \"so don't tell anybody.\" \n\"They say he's the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have,\" Trump told the crowd,\"and it's about time. It's about time.\" \nBy Christian Datoc | The Daily Caller \nDonald Trump has selected retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to serve as secretary of defense. \nA source intimately familiar with Trump’s transition told The Daily Caller last week that “Mad Dog” Mattis was the favorite for the position, and The Washington Post confirmed the report through a separate source on Thursday. \n",

      "title": "Re: Charges recommended against ‘bipolar’ yellow Kia driver",
      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 07:36   “Adventures of the Crazy Yellow Kia.” That’s how a Facebook post called the Nov. 11 incident at Rockwell in Makati City. —VIDEOGRAB \nThe Makati City police have recommended filing civil charges against the driver of the yellow Kia that hurt security personnel and damaged property at the Rockwell business complex in early November. \nPolice have also recommended that 28-year-old Jamie Camille Brojan, the driver of the yellow Kia Picanto (EG 5100) take “further medical examination to determine her fitness to drive and to possess a driver’s license,” citing danger to public’s lives, according to a two-page report signed by Makati police officer in charge, Senior Supt. Elmedio Tagara. \nThe report, which is now at the city legal department, said “[Brojan] reacted dangerously while being apprehended for a traffic violation that resulted in multiple injuries and damage to properties.” ADVERTISEMENT \nMayor Abby Binay had ordered the Makati police to conduct a full investigation and the city engineering and public works department to check if Brojan also caused damage to public property. \nBinay said the case should not be treated lightly as it involved a serious offense that not only damaged public property, but also endangered the lives of pedestrians and motorists. \nAccording to the report of Makati Police Community Precinct 6, Brojan attempted to escape the motorcycle-riding security of Rockwell after illegally parking her car on Amorsolo Drive. \nA video that went viral on Facebook caught the chase which lasted for more than an hour and resulted in the injury of four security personnel and damage to Rockwell property and parked vehicles in Barangay Poblacion. READ: She’s fast, they’re furious \nThe camp of Brojan alleged her bipolar illness—a brain disorder that causes unusual shift in mood, energy levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks—was the cause of the incident, triggered by apprehension. \nThe report said what the responding police officers thought were drug paraphernalia turned out to be “foils from used candy wrappers, cigarette packs and medications for the said health disorder of the suspect.” \nThe Makati police, however, maintained ‘the suspect’s health condition cannot be a ground for her to be exempted from any liability.” \nWhile Brojan and the security personnel entered into an amicable settlement, the police said “Brojan is still responsible for the damaged properties and should suffer the consequences.” READ: ‘Crazy yellow Kia’ driver may face raps \n“The incident could happen again and will endanger other people around her if her brain disorder will (manifest) again by an unpleasant situation while on the road and driving a vehicle,” it added. \nPCP 6 commander Senior Insp. Oliver Benaldo said the four Rockwell security personnel—Marlon de Paz, Joel Bustamante, Jigo Baldelamar and Bryan Taping of Southbend Security and Investigative Services Inc.—did not press for charges after Brojan agreed to shoulder their medical expenses.",

      "text": "Driving the Day Listen to Playbook in 90 Seconds http://bit.ly/2gPpDll ... Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2eX6Eay \nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- NEWT UPS HIS PRICE -- Newt Gingrich is cashing in on Donald Trump’s popularity. Gingrich’s speaking agency, Worldwide Speakers Group, sent out a notice Thursday afternoon with the subject line “Newt Gingrich Fee Increase.” “Few people in the world have as much insight into President-elect Trump’s philosophies, principles and objectives as Newt Gingrich. As the senior voice in the Republican Party and advisor to the new Administration, Gingrich has been at the forefront of the Republican strategy for the last two years,” the email read. \nStory Continued Below\nIF YOU WANT TO BOOK the former House speaker for a D.C. speech, it will now cost you $25,000 plus ground transportation. For speeches east of Chicago, he’s charging $60,000 plus first class travel for two, and for speeches west of Chicago, he’s asking $75,000 plus first class travel for two.” It’s an increase of about $15,000, our source tells us. No wonder he wanted to stay out of the administration! Gingrich had “no comment,” he said in an email.\nTHE TRUMP AGENCY -- Lobbyists have been scrambling to pump up their connections to the incoming Trump administration, but few have been as brazen as Gotham Government Relations & Communications and Gerstman Schwartz & Malito. David Schwartz sent an email Thursday detailing his firm’s “storied relationship” with Trump, whom he has represented since 2010. “It has been the thrill of a lifetime to work for this man whom I have grown to respect and admire over the years, and I believe he deserves a chance to succeed as our President,” Schwartz wrote, noting that he and his partners started the website “Should Trump Run” ahead of the 2012 election, setting the stage for his 2016 presidential bid. \nSCHWARTZ WRITES that, in addition to assisting Trump on several lobbying issues, he was also involved in Trump’s campaign launch at Trump Tower. “Our firm set up that entire event.” He adds: “We have an insight into the thinking of the new President. We look forward to meeting with you and analyzing all of the problems of your business, industry, not-for-profit and trade associations.” The firm expects to expand into Washington, linking up with a yet unnamed firm. \nDEPT OF RAW NERVES -- “Clinton and Trump strategists still throwing punches,” by Shane Goldmacher and Gabe Debenedetti at the Harvard Institute of Politics’ post-election conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts: “The scene on Thursday was fraught, from the moment the top campaigns’ top officials sat down across the room from each other. There were interruptions, accusations and plenty of crosstalk for more than two, tense hours. ‘We’re not at a Trump rally, Corey,’ Clinton’s chief strategist Joel Benenson snapped at one point at Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Later, Trump’s last campaign manager Kellyanne Conway cautioned her side of the table, ‘Hey guys, we won, we don’t have to respond.’ … Clinton’s advisers looked pained from the start. They gulped water. They gripped their pens. They crossed their arms. They glared. Then they boiled over.\n“After 90 minutes , when Trump deputy campaign manager Dave Bossie called Trump’s campaign CEO Steve Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, ‘an unbelievably brilliant strategist,’ an impassioned Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s communications director, jumped in. ‘If providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician I am glad to have lost,’ Palmieri said. ‘I would rather lose than win the way the guys you did.’ Palmieri called Clinton’s speech in Reno denouncing the ‘alt-right’ in August one of her ‘proudest’ moments as shouting ensued across the room. ‘Do you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?’ Conway snapped back. ‘You’re going to look me in the face and tell me that?’ ‘I did, Kellyanne,’ Palmieri said. ‘I did.’ ‘Do you think you could have just had a decent message for the white working class voters?’ Conway said, adding to no one in particular as the conversation moved on, ‘You guys are bitter.’ ...\n“On Wednesday evening , Republican campaign managers shouted down and heckled CNN president Jeff Zucker when he said that all candidates had been invited onto his airwaves. ‘Wrong!’ shouted Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had worked as campaign manager for her father. Later, Sanders rattled off one statistic from August 2015 that in a 10-day period Trump had been on CNN during prime time for 256 minutes, and Mike Huckabee had been on for 17 seconds.” http://politi.co/2h1ysLC … Audio of all of this year’s sessions, which have been taking place every 4 years since 1972 http://bit.ly/2gtQJ2Y \nBUZZ -- Sen. Claire McCaskill is expected to join the Senate Finance Committee, according to multiple sources. The Missouri Democrat would take the slot left open after incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opted to leave the panel to serve in leadership. McCaskill and Schumer’s offices were mum on the move.\nPLAYBOOK EXCLUSIVE: NEW NRCC EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- Newly elected National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) has tapped John Rogers to run the NRCC this cycle. Rogers was the political director of the NRCC last cycle, and the deputy during the 2014 cycle. “We are building a world-class team, which will be laser-focused on maintaining the House Majority, and gaining seats where we can. John is the first part of that team,\" Stivers said.\nWHY THIS MATTERS : The NRCC has helped keep a House Republican majority since 2010. Stivers and Rogers will have to do that again -- two years into Donald Trump’s administration. Stivers has been a top official at the NRCC, and Rogers has run the political department, which should help the organization in 2018.\nBECERRA OUT, NEAL IN -- Rep. Xavier Becerra’s unexpected appointment to become California’s attorney general has made way for Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal to ascend to the plum spot of ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee. Neal has the job all but locked up, according to several sources. PLAYBOOK’S TAKE: Neal is popular with his colleagues, will easily be able to go toe to toe with his Republican counterpart, Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas, and is a favorite among the K Street crowd.\n\nA message from The Nuclear Energy Institute: The electoral college will soon confirm a surprise election result, Donald Trump. However, in the electricity world, there are fewer surprises – physics and economics will continue to apply, and Republicans and Democrats are going to find a lot to like about nuclear energy over the next four years. http://bit.ly/2gm1FO7 \nTHE 45TH PRESIDENT -- “Trump Kicks Off ‘Thank You’ Tour, Reveling in Crowd and Campaign Themes,” by Nick Corasaniti in Cincinnati and Mike Shear in D.C. on A1 of the NYT: “He boasted about himself in the third person. He sneered at the opponents he had vanquished. He disparaged journalists and invited angry chants from the crowd, grinning broadly at calls of ‘lock her up’ and ‘build the wall.’ He ridiculed the government’s leaders as stupid and dishonest failures. In his first major address since winning the presidency three weeks ago, Donald J. Trump soaked up the adulation of tens of thousands of his supporters at a campaign-style rally here, unabashedly gloating about the ‘great’ victory he had secured. If there were any question about whether his evolution to president-in-waiting would temper his presentation or moderate his tone, the rally offered a forceful answer: Not a chance. ...\n“‘How about North Carolina — how well did we do in North Carolina? Remember when they said he cannot win North Carolina?’ Mr. Trump said, adding a moment later: ‘Donald Trump can’t break the blue wall, right? We didn’t break it, we shattered that sucker. We shattered it, man. That poor wall is busted up.’” http://nyti.ms/2fNtPEP \n-- POLITICO , by Eli Stokols: http://politi.co/2fShREY … WaPo, by Jenna Johnson and John Wagner: http://wapo.st/2fSsBmL .\n-- @RVAwonk : “#Trump tells Cincinnati rally that violent crime is at a 45-year high. It's actually at a 51-year low, according to latest FBI data.” http://bit.ly/2gfKlcU … @glennkesslerWP: “[What] will he say in a year when violent crime is his problem?”\nTWO TIDBITS for your radar from Fox News’ Ainsley Earhardt’s interview with TRUMP that’s airing this morning on “Fox and Friends.”\n-- EARHARDT : “Mitt Romney -- I was out there in the crowd. You can hear them out there; they’re so excited for you to come out on stage tonight. They don’t love Mitt Romney as your pick. If you do pick him, what can you say to the American public?” TRUMP : “Well, he’s been very gracious and don’t forget I hit Mitt pretty hard also … so I understand how it all works. He’s been very, very nice. We had dinner the other night, it was great there was actually a good chemistry.” … \nEARHARDT : “Day One, what are you going to do? The wall? Obamacare repeal?” TRUMP : “We could do the wall. We are going to do some repealing. We are going to [reverse] some executive orders that we think are inappropriate. We are going to be working. We are going to be working very hard. If you would have seen the people of Indiana today, 1,100 people are going to have a great Christmas, that I can tell you.”\nMIKE PENCE INTERVIEW -- “Vice President-elect Mike Pence Says Trump Administration Plans Ambitious Agenda,” by WSJ’s Peter Nicholas in Cincinnati: “Mr. Pence is positioned to be an active vice president wielding substantial influence in the Trump administration. Asked if he saw himself in the mold of such previous running mates as Dick Cheney or George H.W. Bush, he said he ‘can learn a great deal from vice presidents over the last 30 and 40 years. But ultimately I have a firm conviction that the president [Mr. Trump] will define that role. Not me.’” http://on.wsj.com/2fSrL9K \nFUTURE OF MEDIA -- SUSAN GLASSER for Brookings: “Covering politics in a ‘post-truth’ America: Journalism has never been better, thanks to these last few decades of disruption. So why does it seem to matter so little? Reflections on the media in the age of Trump”: “I have a different and more existential fear today about the future of independent journalism and its role in our democracy. And you should too. Because the media scandal of 2016 isn’t so much about what reporters failed to tell the American public; it’s about what they did report on, and the fact that it didn’t seem to matter.” http://brook.gs/2h1Q36g \nPENTAGON WATCH -- “Trump picks General ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as defense secretary: Mattis would be only the second retired general to become the civilian leader of the military,” by Bryan Bender and Andrew Hanna: “Mattis, 66, so nicknamed for his salty language and obsessive dedication to the military, was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013. He had earlier co-authored a counterinsurgency strategy manual credited with helping to halt some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011. But as head of the U.S. Central Command he also clashed with President Barack Obama's National Security Council, particularly over Iran, which Mattis has called ‘the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.’ ...\n“Yet not all of Mattis’ views are so in sync with Trump and Flynn, who have made friendly gestures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mattis has expressed deep wariness of Russia's intentions, saying it wants ‘to break NATO apart.’” http://politi.co/2fSpsmQ \n-- “Trump’s pick for defense secretary went to the mat for the troubled blood-testing company Theranos , ” by WaPo’s Carolyn Johnson: http://wapo.st/2gu0GgT \n-- CLICKER: “9 unforgettable quotes by James Mattis,” by Madeline Conway: http://politi.co/2h1GTGI \n-- ICYMI, TOM RICKS on ForeignPolicy.com, Nov. 21: “Mattis as defense secretary: What it means for us, for the military, and for Trump”: “[C]areer Pentagon officials who otherwise might decline to serve in a Trump administration instead might be encouraged to stay on by the presence of Mattis, who is extremely popular among the rank and file. His Chuck Norris-like reputation is likely be worn down by the realities of the job. But Mattis admires the way Robert Gates operated as defense secretary, and that is a good model to have.” http://atfp.co/2fZmH6N \nPAUL RYAN ON “60 MINUTES” -- From CBS: “Scott Pelley interviews House Speaker Paul Ryan about his relationship with President-elect Donald Trump and the first issues he will address after the inauguration.” PELLEY : “You called Donald Trump a racist.” RYAN : “No, I didn’t. I said his comment was.” PELLEY : “Well -- I’m not sure there’s a great deal of daylight between those two definitions. But he definitely called you ineffective and disloyal. Have you patched it up?” RYAN : “Yeah, we have. We’re fine. We’re not looking back. We’re looking forward. We -- we actually -- we’ve had -- we -- like I said, we speak about every day. And it's not about looking for -- back in the past. That’s behind us. We’re way beyond that.” … \nPELLEY : “Have you told him being president is not being CEO of the United States, that the Congress is going to have a say?” RYAN : “Oh, we’ve talked about that extensively. We’ve talked about-- the Constitution, Article I [of] the Constitution, the separation of powers. He feels very strongly, actually, that-- that, under President Obama’s watch, he stripped a lot of power away from the Constitution, away from the Legislative Branch of government. And we want to reset the balance of power, so that people and the Constitution are rightfully restored.”\n\nPlaybook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Sasha react during the National Christmas Tree Lighting on the Ellipse of the National Mall on Thursday. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\nIF YOU READ ONE THING -- NYT A17, “Trump’s Breezy Calls to World Leaders Leave Diplomats Aghast,” by Mark Landler: “President-elect Donald J. Trump inherited a complicated world when he won the election last month. And that was before a series of freewheeling phone calls with foreign leaders that has unnerved diplomats at home and abroad. In the calls, he voiced admiration for one of the world’s most durable despots, the president of Kazakhstan, and said he hoped to visit a country, Pakistan, that President Obama has steered clear of during nearly eight years in office. Mr. Trump told the British prime minister, Theresa May, ‘If you travel to the U.S., you should let me know,’ an offhand invitation that came only after he spoke to nine other leaders. He later compounded it by saying on Twitter that Britain should name the anti-immigrant leader Nigel Farage its ambassador to Washington, a startling break with diplomatic protocol. ...\n“Mr. Trump’s conversation with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan has generated the most angst, because, as Mr. Earnest put it, the relationship between Mr. Sharif’s country and the United States is ‘quite complicated,’ with disputes over issues ranging from counterterrorism to nuclear proliferation. … The breezy tone of the [Pakistani government’s] readout left diplomats in Washington slack-jawed, with some initially assuming it was a parody. In particular, they zeroed in on Mr. Trump’s offer to Mr. Sharif “to play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country’s problems.” http://nyti.ms/2fZlA6S \nFOR YOUR RADAR -- “Russia accuses Ukraine of sabotaging Trump: A Foreign Ministry official says Ukrainian officials hampered Trump by targeting Manafort,” by Ken Vogel and Julia Ioffe: “A spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday contended that the Ukrainian government over the summer damaged Trump’s campaign by implicating his then-campaign chief Paul Manafort in a corruption scandal involving a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party funded by oligarchs.” http://politi.co/2gPbTqz \nSCOOP -- “Christie throws his hat in the ring for RNC chair,” by Alex Isenstadt: “New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is expressing serious interest in the job of [RNC] chairman -- and he’s getting an audience to make his case. Christie told senior members of Donald Trump’s presidential transition team on Thursday morning that he is interested in the post ... One person said the governor had embarked on an aggressive, ‘full-court press’ in hopes of getting the chairmanship.” http://politi.co/2fZjeVz \nVIDEO DU JOUR -- @MattNegrin : “so here are a bunch of news anchors who don’t know how to pronounce Steven Mnuchin’s name” http://bit.ly/2gfQfLd \nHOT DOC -- “Trump team urges GOP to play up Sessions’ ‘strong civil rights record,’” by Seung Min Kim: “President-elect Donald Trump’s team is advising Senate Republicans to promote Jeff Sessions’ deep familiarity with the Justice Department, his ‘strong civil rights record’ and that he is ‘known for his deep respect and adherence to the rule of law’ as senators talk about the his nomination as attorney general. For Steven Mnuchin, the Trump team wants senators to emphasize that the former Goldman Sachs executive is a ‘world-class financier’ whose history in the financial sector ‘make him the ideal candidate’ to be Trump’s pick to lead the Treasury Department. And Tom Price, whom Trump intends to nominate for Health and Human Services secretary, is ‘a renowned physician” who ‘has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver.’ Those are just a sample of talking points sent by Trump’s transition team -- and obtained by POLITICO -- to the Senate GOP Conference this week to promote the incoming president’s choices for his administration.” http://politi.co/2fZi7VX \n-- K-FILE: “Jeff Sessions fought as Alabama attorney general to keep an LGBT conference from meeting on a public campus,” by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski: http://cnn.it/2gNrglL \nHILLWATCH -- “ Rep. Himes Elected Head Of Moderate Democrats Group , ” by the Hartford Courant’s Russell Blair: “U.S. Rep. Jim Himes has been elected chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of about 50 Congressional Democrats that calls itself moderate and fiscally responsible.” http://cour.at/2fZzQws \n\nA message from The Nuclear Energy Institute: The electoral college will soon confirm a surprise election result, Donald Trump. However, in the electricity world, there are fewer surprises – physics and economics will continue to apply, and Republicans and Democrats are going to find a lot to like about nuclear energy over the next four years. http://bit.ly/2gktgj4 \nWEST COAST WATCH -- “Mayor Eric Garcetti is trying to strike a balance with Donald Trump. Will it pay off?,” by L.A. Times’ Dakota Smith: “Before election day, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti didn’t hold back when it came to Donald Trump. ‘He’s a racist. He’s a bigot. He’s sexist,’ Garcetti told reporters in May, criticizing the Republican presidential hopeful for his views on the economy, immigration and women, among other things. ‘What we cannot do with Donald Trump is normalize him as a candidate.’ ... But since Trump’s victory, Garcetti has adopted a more civil tone. They spoke by phone last week, and Garcetti has expressed his willingness to work with the president-elect on infrastructure and the economy. At the same time, Garcetti has offered assurances that the city won’t aid Trump on any widespread crackdown against immigrants who are in the country without authorization.” http://lat.ms/2h1ObKI \nPOLITICO “PULSE CHECK” podcast — DOES TRUMP NEED A HEALTH REFORM CZAR? Tom Daschle, who was President Obama’s original choice for that role in 2008, tells POLITICO’s Dan Diamond that it’s a necessary job — even if he fiercely disagrees with Trump's priority to repeal Obamacare. “You really want someone who can be … a czar-like individual. Somebody who can really coordinate the entire effort. It can’t be bifurcated, it can’t be divided up with a number of people involved, or you lose a lot of the ability to move the process forward.” Listen to the podcast: http://bit.ly/2gGYal2 … Read the story: http://politi.co/2gt3L0R \nANDREW ROSS SORKIN in Seattle on the NYT Business Day front, “Starbucks Chief Howard Schultz to Step Down Next Year”: “Mr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member. ‘This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. ‘I love the company as much as I love my family.” But he said it was the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being ‘better equipped’ to ‘run the company than I am,’ ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson’s operational talents, and saying that he wanted to ‘relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.’ … \n“The move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr. Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. An outspoken Democrat, Mr. Schultz has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the ‘dysfunction in Washington.’ He has a close relationship with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton.” http://nyti.ms/2gNGp6E \nMEDIAWATCH -- from TJ Ducklo at Bloomberg: “Today is the 526th and final regular episode of Bloomberg TV’s ‘With All Due Respect’ hosted by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann.

      "text": "  Facebook used to be a place where “friends” got together to exchange ideas, opinion and engage in discussion. \nMy personal Facebook page is my social media “home.” I behave in the same way there as I would in my actual home (or yours). \nI invite you in to converse, give your opinion, exchange views and information, agree or disagree—always in a kind, respectful manner. \nBut today, our online “neighborhood” seems to be a place where we vent our anger at each other. We vomiting venomous words and even threats as we pass by in the street. We shout insults out of the window and humiliate each other as sport from our front porches. Even the most basic level of civility seems to be a thing of the past. \nAnd its gotten worse over the last 18 months of this presidential election. \nWhat has happened to all of us? \nWe used to have one source of news we could all listen to and trust, whether it was Eric Sevareid, Huntley-Brinkley, Walter Cronkite or John Chancellor. These people came from dedicated news rooms where the news wasn’t a profit center at a network. \nWe trusted these moderators and journalists to objectively tell us the truth. They took pride in reporting the news with professionalism and integrity. They won Pulitzers and Peabody awards for their talents and efforts. \nThen, with the advent of FOX News, MSNBC and their ilk, news became info-tainment , which was entertaining and often biased opinions mixed with some news. It was interesting and sure sounded like the truth because it was what some of the angriest of us wanted to believe was so. But the devil is in the details. \nThis type of news-ertainment show was highly profitable. Network executives realized that there was big money in pandering to a group of angry and disaffected people for ratings. And with the advent of social media, we graduated to entirely fake news, brought to you by your favorite special-interest group, lobbyist or corporate promoter. \nWe now have two sources of news. \nOne the one hand is factual news, sometimes with a liberal or conservative slant. On the other is extremist, “blame-everyone else” news that thrives on scapegoating and telling us our problems are all someone else’s fault. \nWe have become polarized. \nThese pandering, media profiteers have created a large group of Americans who live in a bubble—an alternate reality where everyone else is to blame. Sadly, many of those people voted for Donald J. Trump as their next President. Trump was masterful at pandering to them and becoming one of them—he is their champion. \nIn recent elections, (Bush vs. Gore, Obama vs. McCain or Obama vs. Romney), the candidates had different views but they and we still were able to be civil to each other. But over the past eight years, the disgruntled seem to have made their way into our Congress with the support of those living in the media-supported blame bubble. On top of this we’ve had eight years of an obstructionist Congress blocking the actions of a President who was elected with the majority of the vote. \nThis past presidential election has brought out the worst in many of us. We’re all desperate for change, in our different ways. For many people, Trump represented that change. \nSocial media, especially Facebook, provided us all with a platform to vent our frustrations and get ourselves, and everyone else, stirred up. \nIf the rhetoric online is anything to go by, Trump’s advocates do not care about really helping people by making sure that those who live in poverty have enough to eat; or that everyone has the health care they need; or ensuring education is more affordable for the young to improve themselves and be competitive in the 21st century. \nInstead, it’s all about assigning blame for where we are personally and as a nation. It’s about character assassination and vilifying others (whether it’s Hillary or Obama). It ignores truth and reality, which brings us back to that obstructionist Congress refusing to negotiate and compromise in the interest of the people. \nIn the midst of all this upset, our country grows more ignorant and less informed, culminating nearly a month ago now in our first “fact-free” election. Feelings trumped truth, and our feelings are so extreme and violent we’ve become estranged from each other, and from any middle ground we share. \nHow can we become friends again, and not just by Facebook category? \nI’m delighted to exchange conversation with those who have different views than mine, just as sharing the same beliefs and background as me is not a prerequisite to a warm welcome in my home. But, from this day forward, I will only engage further if you as civil and respectful as I promise to be with you. \nFacebook is an amazing tool for communication and community. It should be fun, diverse, interesting and stimulating—even if we disagree with others, we can still feel like they are a good friend (with a strong opinion) who we’ve had a visit with. \nAnd one more thing: let’s find and support trustworthy news sources with integrity who we can believe in. It’s our best chance at finding our shared truth again and coming together as fellow Americans and human beings. \n~ \nWhether you’re living in reality or inside a bubble, you can learn more about your Sun sign, if you go to the Free Horoscope Calculator and enter your birth date.

      "text": "Published December 02, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook     \nAt the end of 2015, about 36.7 million people had been living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, according to UNAIDS. But new initiatives, including a clinical trial for an HIV vaccine in South Africa, as well as a campaign to help children stay free of AIDS, are giving advocates hope that more lives can be saved from the devastating illness in the coming years.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), one of the primary hurdles societies face in preventing transmission of HIV is individuals’ lack of a diagnosis. \nDr. Rowena Johnston, vice president and director of research at the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), said ensuring people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV are taking protective medication is another major obstacle. Through research, amfAR’s goal is to develop the scientific basis for a cure to AIDS by 2020. \nJohnston called the clinical trial in South Africa “exciting.”\n“They have a really good lead, and they understand what might work,” she told FoxNews.com, “and here they are out in the field testing to see if we can prevent HIV through a vaccine.” \nMore on this...

Post to Facebook 7 times Draymond Green kicked someone on a basketball court Watch out, NBA.  //usat.ly/2gUeuOJ   7 times Draymond Green kicked someone on a basketball court Nate Scott , USA TODAY Sports 7:59   \n(Photo: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports) \nDraymond Green is back at it again. \nThe Warriors forward was given a costly flagrant foul in the second overtime of the team's loss to the Rockets on Thursday night after he raised his leg up and then kicked down on the face of James Harden . \nThis isn't a new thing. Let's look back on seven times Draymond has kicked people on the basketball court. 1. Steven Adams I \nWhere it all began. What's funny about this play is that it went largely unnoticed in real-time. It was only when the second kick happened that we remembered it and looked back upon it in horror. Speaking of which … 2. Steven Adams II \nThe shot heard round the world. This kick led directly to a suspension for Green, and for diehard NBA fans to pore over his game film and come to the conclusion that he flails his leg out, like, a ton. 3. Kevin Durant \nNot a ton of contact here, just a light glancing of the arm, but if the leg comes up and makes contact, it goes on the list. 4. Allen Crabbe — Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) October 22, 2016 \nAgain, not a ton of contact, but Crabbe was plenty perturbed all the same. The two had to be separated after the incident. 5. The Air",

      "text": "  \"Laurén working with former Wallberg coach Munteanu\" Facebook \nMikaela Laurén (27-4, 12 KOs) is working with Frida Wallberg’s former coach Wally Munteanu ahead of her ring return against Szilvia Szabados (14-7, 5 KOs) on Friday, December 9 at the Rosvalla Arena in Nyköping. \nThe Stockholm fighter has added Muntenau to her training team as she looks to bounce back from her defeat to Klara Svensson. He will be working alongside Laurén’s long-time collaborators Stefan Fernström and Leif Carlsson. \nMuntenau is perhaps best known for his work with former World Champion Frida Wallberg. He began coaching the ‘Golden Girl’ in 2010 having persuaded her to come back to boxing following a five-year hiatus from the ring. \nTogether they captured the WBC World Super Featherweight Championship, dethroning and then defending the title with successive victories over Olivia Gerula, before a second successful defence against Amanda Serrano. The pair then parted company prior to Wallberg’s final fight with Diana Prazak. \n‘’Wally is a great guy and a really good coach,’’ said Laurén. ‘’I’ve known him for a long time since he was training Frida, and I would say he made her what she was. He knows a lot about the business, and he really helped Frida to develop and improve her boxing. If there is one person I look up to in boxing it’s Frida so it will be awesome to work with her old coach.’’ \nMunteanu has been impressed with what he has seen from Laurén and is confident he can help ‘The Nordic Queen’ regain her throne. \n‘’I’m sure Mikaela has the ability to get back to the top where she belongs,’’ he says. ‘’It will take a little work but I believe the loss to Klara will have made her stronger. I’ve not seen the fight, but I knew that if she didn’t have the right game plan, it would be difficult for her to win, and that’s what I think happened. \n‘’It’s been different from fight to fight but I think Mikaela has developed a lot during the past year, and together we will continue to work on her strengths, and of course, executing the right the game plan. If there is a rematch with Klara, I’m know it will not end the same way.’’ \nLaurén faces Szabados in a six-round super welterweight contest on the undercard of Erik Skoglund’s WBA Intercontinental Light Heavyweight title fight with Timy Shala, which also features the Swedish Light Heavyweight title clash between Naim Terbunja and Sven Fornling. \nTickets are available online via www.biljettforum.se or by calling 0771-130 150. All the action will be shown live and exclusive in Scandinavia on Viaplay Fighting. For more information please visit www.viaplay.se.

Fear not, because with the help of a quality real estate professional homeowners can have a great sales experience even in the winter. (Photo: Shutterstock) \nAs autumn leaves fall and days grow darker and colder, homeowners selling their property might question whether to stay on the market through the winter or wait to relist in the spring. While there are some drawbacks, sellers will discover a number of positive reasons to sell in the winter. A quality real estate broker can help weigh the pros and cons and arrive at the wisest decision. \n“Sellers should always consider their motivation and then strategically position themselves for success in whatever seasons they choose to sell,” said Amy Englert, a real estate agent with Carpenter Realtors. \nThe central Indiana real estate market is enjoying a robust sales cycle, with homes selling at an unprecedented rate across the region. No one can predict when a cool-off might occur, so keeping a home for sale this winter means remaining part of a heady market — and not missing out on potential opportunities. \n“I always caution sellers to strike while the iron is hot,” Englert said. “I don’t have a crystal ball, but I advise everyone to take advantage of these terrific conditions while they’re still here. No one knows if they will be here next spring or not.” \nWinter’s unique opportunities \nIn unpredictable but typically inclement weather, homeowners may be tempted to go off the market, assuming no one is out house hunting in these conditions. This decision reduces the overall inventory but opens up greater opportunities for sellers who are willing to brave the winter, remain on the market — and take advantage of less competition for buyers’ interest. The decreased competition is a boon for homeowners with nicely staged homes and for brokers with sharp marketing skills. \n“Relocations for major companies usually happen in December and January, and homes listed in the winter will stand out,” said Deborah Minth of Carpenter Realtors. \nMinth notes that certain buyers don’t like the competitive sales process so typical in the spring, when the market heats up. Buyers who prefer an easier pace should shop in winter, when they can take their time. Story from Carpenter Realtors: Top features in a hot market \nStaging takings center stage \nReal estate agents generally recommend that homeowners stage their homes to sell faster for a higher price – and this is true especially in winter. A toasty fire, tasteful holiday décor and a warm blanket slung over an armchair can combine to create a cozy, welcoming environment for buyers. Sellers also can use simple aromatherapy to make their home memorable for buyers. Fresh-baked cookies, vanilla candles and a Thermos of hot cocoa are great touches. \n“A warm crackling fire in the fireplace and music on low will fill the home with the warmth of family and friends to make the home most appealing,” said Patrick Wilkins of Carpenter Realtors. “Use the holiday cheer and décor to make the interior of your home more inviting to buyers, because the outside is dormant and drab in the winter months.” \nCurb appeal can be more challenging in winter. Sellers should ensure the driveway and walkways are cleared of snow and ice at all times. Gutters should be cleaned to keep ice and snow from damming up, which can create hazards or simply look unsightly to buyers. Strategic lighting can help highlight the home’s exterior features. \nSellers may want to take or find pictures of their home and property at every season and place them in frames or an album for buyers to see. Showcasing the curb appeal at its best in spring, summer, fall and winter helps buyers visualize the home’s exterior. An experienced Realtor can help the homeowner develop an attractive portfolio to showcase the property in every season. \nA high-quality real estate professional will know how to help sellers achieve positive results in winter. Using solid marketing techniques and staging the home will help buyers see the best in every room and every part of the property. Wilkins recalls a recent time when a winter listing paid big dividends for the client. \n“The seller wanted to take their home off the market for the holidays a couple of years ago, and their agent convinced them to stay the course,” Wilkins said. “That seller’s home sold for an excellent price to a very motivated buyer transferring to the Indianapolis area on Christmas Eve. The seller would have missed that buyer by removing the home from the market. Talk about a happy seller!” \nHave a question for a real estate professional?

      "text": "YouTube Like us on Facebook \nA charming spoof, Mel Brooks's Robin Hood: Men in Tights introduced the world to Dave Chappelle and extolled the virtues of form-fitting legwear. Here’s everything you need to know about the arrow-slinging 1993 comedy. 1. MEL BROOKS HAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON A COMEDIC ROBIN HOOD TV SERIES. \nIn 1974, Mel Brooks’ smash-hit genre parodies Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein became two of the highest grossing movies of the year—with Blazing Saddles beating out The Towering Inferno and The Godfather: Part II for the top spot. Having secured a lasting career for himself in Hollywood, Brooks took a break from cinema so he could pursue a new TV project. The comic joined forces with Norman Stiles and John Boni to co-create ABC’s When Things Were Rotten , a fast-paced, gag-driven sitcom that put a satirical spin on Robin Hood . Starring Get Smart alum Dick Gautier in the lead role, the show relied heavily on anachronistic pop culture references; in one episode, for example, a character named Lord McDonald of the Golden Archers dons a T-shirt reading “Over 1,000,000 Dispatched.” \nWhen Things Were Rotten premiered on September 10, 1975. After three months of lackluster ratings and mixed reviews, the show was canceled just 13 episodes into its run. Brooks would, of course, take another stab at the legendary hero of Sherwood Forest when Robin Hood: Men in Tights was released 18 years later. Incidentally, that 1993 comedy starred a familiar face: Dick Van Patten, who plays an abbot in the film, had portrayed Friar Tuck in When Things Were Rotten . 2. A DENTIST’S KID INSPIRED THE MOVIE. \nDespite its impressive showing at the box office, Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) didn’t win universal praise. Many took issue with the movie’s inconsistent tone and Costner’s half-baked attempt at an English accent. When 11-year-old Jordi Chandler saw it, he told his father, Evan, that the flick deserved to be parodied. As it happened, Evan Chandler was a Beverly Hills dentist whose clientele included Hollywood screenwriter J. David Shapiro. During an appointment, the DDS pitched the idea of a Robin Hood spoof movie to Shapiro, who loved the concept. Together, they put together a screenplay that was later sold to—and heavily revised by—Brooks. 3. MADELINE KAHN MIGHT’VE PLAYED LATRINE. \nMadeline Kahn made a name for herself by starring in several of Brooks's comedies, including Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , High Anxiety, and H istory of the World, Part 1 . Kahn’s family has stated that she was offered the part of Latrine—Prince John’s manic soothsayer—in Robin Hood: Men in Tights , but turned the role down over salary concerns. On the other hand, Brooks himself says he didn’t cast Kahn because the character wouldn’t receive much screen time. Regardless, Tracey Ullman ended up landing the part. 4. SEAN CONNERY WANTED TO PORTRAY KING RICHARD—IN WOMEN’S CLOTHING. \nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves had an all-star cast that boasted Costner, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Rickman. Sean Connery also made a brief appearance as King Richard, a part he reportedly wanted to reprise in Men in Tights. According to James Robert Parish's It's Good to Be the King: The Seriously Funny Life of Mel Brooks , Connery told the director “that he would repeat his role of the monarch—but this time in drag. However, intriguing as this comic prospect was, he wanted a $1 million salary, which he planned to donate to Scottish charities.” Unable to afford this king’s ransom, Brooks cast Patrick Stewart instead. For better or for worse, the cross-dressing angle was scrapped entirely. 5. BROOKS WROTE THE LYRICS TO ALL OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS. \nFrom The Producers 's “Springtime for Hitler” to a Sinatra-esque lounge number in High Anxiety , Brooks’s comedies are loaded with songs that the filmmaker either wrote or co-wrote himself. Robin Hood: Men in Tights continued this musical tradition. The legendary director penned the lyrics for Maid Marian’s song, the titular “Men in Tights” number, and both versions of the \"Sherwood Forest Rap.\" Meanwhile, their melodies were provided by composer Hummie Mann. However, neither man can take any credit for “The Night is Young and You’re So Beautiful,” which Robin (Cary Elwes) belts out during a romantic scene with Marian (Amy Yasbeck). Famously covered by Dean Martin, that amorous ballad was written way back in 1937 by Dana Suesse, Billy Rose, and Irving Kahal. 6. WHEN BROOKS FIRST REACHED OUT TO CARY ELWES ABOUT PLAYING ROBIN HOOD, THE ACTOR ASSUMED HE WAS BEING PRANKED. \nEarly on in the Men in Tights casting process, Brooks called Elwes at his home to discuss the project. \"He actually called me at home and I thought someone was pulling my leg so I hung up on him,\" Elwes told Den of Geek in 2014. \"He called back and he said 'don’t hang up, it’s really me!' I apologized, but I couldn’t believe he was calling me.\" In short order, Elwes was cast as the film’s hero. Once he came aboard, Elwes helped Brooks choose an actor to play Ahchoo, Robin’s sidekick. In the end, the part went to an unknown 19-year-old comedian named Dave Chappelle. “We actually cast [him] together,” Elwes recalled . “We saw a lot of actors and when Dave came in, he was just so amazing and we knew right then and there [that] this guy was a star.” 7. IT SHARED A FILMING LOCATION WITH TWO OTHER WELL-KNOWN ROBIN HOOD MOVIES. \nA body of water in Southern California’s Santa Monica mountains that was formerly known as Lake Canterbury was renamed Lake Sherwood in 1921, when a Robin Hood movie starring Douglas Fairbanks shot a few scenes on its shores. Subsequently, this same lake was utilized as a backdrop for certain outdoor sequences in 1938’s The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights did some filming there as well . 8. THE ACTORS ATTENDED A SWORDPLAY BOOT CAMP. \n“If you put the name Robin Hood on a marquee, then it’s incumbent upon you—nay, it behooves you—to have horses and sword fighting,” Brooks declared in the HBO making-of documentary Robin Hood: Men in Tights: The Legend Had it Coming . “The actors came in every weekend and they worked Saturdays and Sundays just on their sword fights,” Brooks said. These sessions were overseen by fencing coordinator Victor Paul , who also did stunt work on big-budget action films like Die Hard and Armageddon . The bladed weapon specialist found that Elwes was particularly easy to train because The Princess Bride star already had plenty of fencing experience under his belt. “All I had to do was teach him the routines, he knew how to fence,” Paul said in the documentary. \nHowever, Elwes wasn’t quite as adept at archery. Right before the training montage, we see Robin hit a bull's-eye from a few yards away while his merry men look on. At the 2013 Motor City Comic Con , Elwes shed some light on the scene—which turned out to be a rather triumphant moment for him. “I was quite proud of the fact that I got a bull's-eye shooting the bow and arrow because there was a lot of pressure from Mel to get that in a few takes. He said ‘Okay, you’ve got three takes. Get a bull's-eye, let’s go!,'\" Elwes shared during a Q&A session. “And I’m like ‘Really, Mel? I’ve only got three? Really?’ And I got it on the third one, thank god.” 9. LATE IN THE SHOOT, RICHARD LEWIS CAME DOWN WITH A 106-DEGREE FEVER. \nRichard Lewis, who played the neurotic Prince John, opened up about his experiences on the set in a 2013 PBS documentary titled Mel Brooks: Make a Noise . Apparently, as production came to a close, Lewis’s health took a sharp turn for the worse. “I was almost done with the film, I had one scene left, [and then] I got Hepatitis A,” the actor recalled. Stricken with a 106-degree fever , Lewis was hospitalized. Amazingly though, this development didn’t stop Brooks from trying to complete his villain’s final scene on schedule. \nCompletely undeterred, the director called Lewis’s hospital room and announced an elaborate plan to lay Lewis in a stretcher, drive him to the set, and prop the immobilized performer up against some wood so that he could deliver a pair of lines. “You’ll do your two lines, we’ll carry you right back into the stretch, you’ll be back [at the hospital] in 20 minutes,” Brooks told him. “Mel,” a weary Lewis responded, “I’m dying. I think I’m dying. I have a 106 fever. I’m jaundiced.” He then hung up on Brooks, who proceeded to call him back “about 15 times with the same riff” in Lewis’s estimation. 10. THE MOVIE MADE GENE SISKEL’S “WORST OF '93” LIST. \nWhen it came to the film critics, \"most of them reamed it,” according to Lewis. “It was disappointing.” Leading the chorus of derision was Gene Siskel, who counted Robin Hood: Men in Tights among his worst films of 1993 . “Movie comedy, I think, is threatening to pass Mel Brooks by,” the late critic opined. “When comedies don’t work and everybody in the audience knows it, that is about as low as it gets ... [Brooks] has clearly lost his way.” \nStill, like many of Brooks’s later pictures, Robin Hood: Men in Tights has slowly developed a cult following over the years. It has even received some faint praise from a more contemporary Robin Hood: In 2016, Russell Crowe called Men in Tights “ the most entertaining version ” of the heroic character’s timeless story. 11. JACK BLACK ONCE SERENADED BROOKS WITH A RENDITION OF THE FILM'S THEME SONG. \nAlong with Bruce Springsteen, Dave Brubeck, Robert De Niro, and opera singer Grace Bumby, Brooks was named one of the 2009 Kennedy Center honorees. When asked to comment on this development, Brooks told The Washington Post , “I hope you never find my award on eBay, because you never know ... You run out of cash and wherewithal.” Seated near President Barack Obama and the First Lady, Brooks was presented with a medley of his unforgettable songs. Among other acts, this star-studded revue featured Martin Short’s take on the Blazing Saddles theme while Richard Kind led a jazzy rendition of the Spanish Inquisition number from History of The World, Part 1 . Jack Black also took the stage in full Robin Hood regalia to lead a chorus in singing “Men in Tights.” All the while, a gleeful Brooks could be seen mouthing the lyrics to every song from the audience.

      "text": "By Alessandra Malito, MarketWatch\nMarketWatch will interview two experts live on Facebook at 2 p.m. on Thurs. Dec. 8\nThe fiduciary rule is set to greatly affect the way retirement accounts are managed, and in turn, perhaps how much investors see in returns.\nPlayers throughout the financial services industry have been busy preparing themselves for the April deadline of the Department of Labor's rule, which came out earlier this year and requires that advisers act in their clients' best interests when overseeing retirement accounts (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-rule-retirement-account-advisers-must-be-fiduciaries-act-in-clients-best-interest-2016-04-08). In the eyes of proponents, it's a victory for retirement savers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-is-a-great-victory-for-retirement-savers-2016-04-20) as its goal is to banish unnecessarily high fees and commissions, and provide more quality advice for those investing for their futures.\nCritics, on the other hand, argue it will orphan small accounts too costly to manage and shut out a variety of investment options, instead focusing on passive choices like exchange-traded funds (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-the-fiduciary-rule-mean-that-active-and-smart-beta-etfs-get-left-behind-2016-10-14), which come at a much lower price point.\nAs part of the rule, clients might need to sign a best interests contract, which states they understand their broker-dealers (http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/02/25/fiduciary-or-broker-many-financial-advisers-wear-both-hats/), who are advisers that sell securities, might receive commissions on the products they recommend. It will also impact (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-retirement-savers-need-to-know-about-the-fiduciary-rule-2015-05-09) individual retirement account rollovers as accounts with too few assets might arguably pay more for less advice. Though there were concerns the rule would not go through under President-elect Donald Trump, it's unlikely the future president will repeal it (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fiduciary-rule-wont-change-under-a-president-trump-2016-11-09), experts said.\nCompanies such as Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) have already announced (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dear-president-elect-trump-please-do-right-by-investors-2016-11-15) they will stop charging commissions on retirement accounts. The former also said clients will only have the option of opening fee-based individual retirement accounts, as opposed to a percentage-based fee on total assets of a client's account.\nMarketWatch is going to interview Department of Labor assistant secretary Timothy Hauser and Marcia Wagner, an attorney and expert in labor law and fiduciary issues live on Facebook at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, Dec. 8. Certified Financial Planner professionals will earn a one-hour credit of continuing education after watching the session.\nHave a question you'd like to ask them? Let us know your questions in the comments or email them to Alessandra Malito (mailto:amalito@marketwatch.com), and we'll ask them during the live broadcast.\n-Alessandra Malito;\nRELATED: The fiduciary standard isn't going away, no matter what Trump decides (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-matter-what-trump-decides-on-the-fiduciary-rule-the-standard-will-only-gain-strength-2016-11-22)\nRELATED: 7 dirty words I can't say because I'm a fiduciary (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/7-dirty-words-i-cant-say-because-im-a-fiduciary-2016-06-13)\nRELATED: A repeal of the fiduciary rule may slow -- but not halt -- the trend towards ETFs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-repeal-of-the-fiduciary-rule-may-slow-but-not-halt-the-trend-towards-etfs-2016-11-10)\n 1025ET\n ",

      "text": "Comment A pop-up that appears when permanently deleting a Facebook account. Digital Media Globe. \nEver since Facebook entered the market back in 2004 and made its way into the stock market in 2012, the social networking company now boasts of more than 1.65 billion monthly active users. It has lived up to the promise of connecting friends and acquaintances, and in sharing bits and pieces of one's life. But what if a user wants to permanently opt out of it? It may appear hard but it is definitely possible to delete one's Facebook account. \nSome people have chosen to delete their accounts even after years of using it. Kim Shandrow of Entrepreneur Magazine decided to delete her account because Facebook makes her feel unhappy, looking at \"people in their news feed (who) are happier, more successful and better.\" It has also made her slack off work, spending more time on Facebook than focusing on tasks at hand. \nOne study in Denmark confirms what Shandrow has been feeling. Based on a survey conducted by the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, going off Facebook appears to reduce stress levels by as much as 55%, and \"people on Facebook are 39% more likely to feel less happy than their friends.\" \nSo how does one delete their Facebook account? Here is a step-by-step guide : \n1. Back up all data: It is important to back up all data before deleting an account. Click the downward arrow at the top right of the Facebook page > Settings > Go to link at the bottom of the page with \"Download a copy of your Facebook data.\" > Click on \"Download a copy of your Facebook data.\" \n2. Request for account deletion: Once back up is complete, go to: https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account > Click \"Delete my account\" > Follow steps as guided by the page wizard. \n3. Wait: Once request for deleting account is complete, wait for up to 90 days as this is the allowance given by Facebook for account deletions. All data including photos, friends, and timeline updates will be deleted. \nIt is important to note that deleting an account is a once-off activity and there is no turning back. Should a user decide to put back the same account once deletion is complete after 90 days, it is not possible to retrieve and the user would have to put up a new account. If the user is not yet sure and would want to be out of Facebook only temporarily, he/she may opt to disable the account instead of deleting it. ",

      "text": "Comment It is possible to be 'free' from Facebook, even temporarily. Social Media Impact. \nWhile some Facebook users would want to permanently delete their accounts, others would want to opt out of it temporarily for varied reasons. Some may find Facebook interfering with their professional lives and would want to disable it for a time, then go back to it once busy days are over. For those who want to disable their Facebook account, it is possible and the process is pretty straightforward. \nNot sure how to temporarily deactivate a Facebook account? Here is a step-by-step guide : \n1. Click the downward arrow on the top right corner of any Facebook page \n2. Choose \"Settings\" \n3. Click \"Security\" on the left-hand column \n4. Choose \"Deactivate your account\" \n5. Follow instructions of the page wizard \nTemporarily disabling one's account opts the user out of Facebook for a time until he/she reactivates it. This means, the user's photos, timeline updates and pages will not be visible to other Facebook users. \nShould one decide to reactivate his/her Facebook account, it is as simple as logging in to Facebook with one's login email and password. The account will get back to how it was on the day of temporary deactivation, and one can use the account with ease moving forward. \nWhile these steps account for personal reasons, there are also cases when Facebook disables accounts. Facebook gives reasons as to why it disables some accounts: \n- A user does not use his/her real name. While this may be difficult to set out, it can be quite obvious when using business names for personal accounts. \n- Joining too many groups, as a user can only join up to 200 groups. \n- Adding too many friends. A user can only have at most 5,000 friends per account. \n- Spamming other peoples' or groups' walls. This includes posting on others' walls too often. \n- Poking too many people. Limit isn't set, but there is an option for users to report pokers to Facebook. \n- Under 18-year old users and not part of a high school group. \n- Posting offensive, racist, discriminatory or sexual content. \n- Copy, pasting and sending the same message too many times. \n- Sending messages to group members too often. \n- Sending messages to event members too often. \n- Impersonating someone. \nIt is important to know that Facebook gives users choices on who to be friends with, who not to be friends with, and whenever a user chooses to temporarily deactivate or permanently deactivate one's account.

      "text": "Getty \n\nFacebook is working on a new feature that will showcase lists of curated content from publishers directly in the News Feed, according to two people familiar with the project and internal documentation seen by Business Insider.\nThe feature is called Collections and functions similarly to Snapchat's Discover section, which showcases  news stories, listicles, videos and other content submitted by handpicked media partners.  \nFacebook has approached media and entertainment companies in recent weeks to create content for Collections but has not given a timeframe for when the feature will be made available. \nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment for this story. \nFacebook's effort to create Collections comes as it struggles to distinguish between high-quality content from established media outlets and the glut of low-quality, fake news stories that go viral across the social network. The company has faced sharp criticism for its role spreading fake news stories during the US presidential election.  \nThe move could also help Facebook forge stronger ties with publishers as it competes with fast-growing Snapchat . The app's Discover section of youthful, tabloid-esque news stories is seen every day by its more than 150 million users. \nGetty Early Collections partners have been told that content they create will be inserted into the News Feed by Facebook, effectively giving them direct and potentially much broader access to the social network's vast audience of 1.8 billion users. Currently, publishers must either garner likes from users for their content to be seen in the News Feed or pay to boost their exposure through Facebook's sponsored post program .\nIt could not be learned if Collections will feature advertising, and if so, whether Facebook will share the ad revenue with publishers or offer publishers an option to monetize the content themselves, as it currently does with its Instant Articles service .\nAnother sticking point could be the extent to which Facebook shares data about readers of the articles with publishers, and how easy it will be for publishers to bring readers to their websites.\nFacebook has had a difficult history getting directly involved with news curation. \nThe company's last experiment around curated content from publishers was a breaking news app called Notify that the company shuttered earlier this year after only seven months . The social network's Trending news section came under fire earlier this year after it was reported that Facebook's editors were purposely suppressing conservative-leaning news items from appearing on the list.\nKnow anything more about Facebook Collections?

      "text": "Facebook is coming for Snapchat—specifically, Snapchat Discover, according to a Business Insider report published Friday, and a source who spoke to Mashable earlier today.\nMashable independently confirmed the existence of the the feature, called Collections, via a source familiar with the program's existence. The social network is reportedly asking publishers to create more content for them within a new feature called Collections. Sound familiar? \nSEE ALSO: Facebook to roomful of journalists: 'We hear you' \nThe feature would include curated stories from individual publishers that would appear in Facebook's News Feed, according to potential Collections partners Business Insider spoke with, as well as documentation of the program reviewed by the reporter. \nAt face-value, Collections sounds a lot like Twitter's Moments and, of course, Snapchat's Discover . In October 2015, Twitter released Moments to a handful of media outlets to curate collections of tweets. Now, anyone can create one. Discover is Snap's nearly two-year-old exclusive network of media and entertainment companies (of which Mashable is a partner). \nWhile Snapchat's offering is selective and thus limited in its choice of participants, it's been heralded by partners for its attentive audience of millions of daily users who provide another revenue source for publishers that wasn't there before. \nFacebook's roadmap 2016-2017: COPY.\n— Wahid Razali (@WahidRazali) October 11, 2016 \nFacebook has held talks with media outlets and entertainment companies over recent weeks about Collections, according to Business Insider, though no other timeframe for the new offering was reported.\nFacebook did not immediately respond to Mashable 's request for comment. \nIf the Business Insider report turns out to be completely accurate, it comes in an interesting moment. For one thing, Facebook finds itself continuously fending off criticism for both the way it won't call itself media company (despite so many publishers' fates now being inextricably linked to Facebook's users) as well as its role in spreading fake news . The company fired its own curation team for a section of the site called Trending Topics, following Gizmodo's report on the potential suppression of conservative news. \nMashable will continue to update this story as it develops.",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nNEW YORK (AP) — Damien Chazelle’s Los Angeles musical “La La Land” was named best film of the year by the New York Film Critics Circle.\nThe group announced their picks Thursday on Twitter, spreading around their awards to a variety of Oscar contenders. The top award came as something of a twist after the critics’ early choices leaned toward Barry Jenkins’ coming-of-age portrait “Moonlight” and Kenneth Lonergan’s grief-filled drama “Manchester by the Sea.”\n“Moonlight” won awards for best director (Jenkins), best cinematography (James Laxton) and best supporting actor (Mahershala Ali). “Manchester by the Sea” took best actor for Casey Affleck, best screenplay for Lonergan and best supporting actress for Michelle Williams. Williams was honored jointly for her performances in “Manchester by the Sea” and Kelly Reichardt’s “Certain Women.”\nBest film was the sole award for “La La Land,” which opens next week. Chazelle’s film, starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, also led the Critics’ Choice Awards nominations on Thursday with 12 nods.\nThose three films — “La La Land,” ”Moonlight” and “Manchester by the Sea”— have been the favored critics’ choices in the early going of Hollywood’s awards season. “Moonlight” led the Gotham Film Independent Awards on Monday. “Manchester by the Sea” topped the National Board of Review Awards on Tuesday.\nEach group, however, has its own quirks and other favorites — Denzel Washington’s “Fences” and Martin Scorsese’s late-arriving “Silence,” among others — are also in the mix. On Sunday, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association will make their picks.\nThe NYFCC, a body of several dozen New York-area critics, named Isabelle Huppert best actress for her lead performances in Paul Verhoeven’s “Elle” and Mia Hansen-Love’s “The Things to Come.” Best first-film was a tie between Kelly Fremon Craig’s teen comedy “The Edge of Seventeen” and Trey Edward Shults’ micro-budget family drama “Krisha.”\nSpecial awards were also singled out for Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese’s longtime editor, and the 25th anniversary restoration of Julie Dash’s “Daughters of the Dust.”\nClick here to find out what movies are playing in your area. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Post to Facebook Von Miller sent wine to every AFC West player Almost 300 bottles!  //usat.ly/2gVWl3l   Join the Nation's Conversation   Von Miller sent wine to every AFC West player Jessie Karangu , USA TODAY 3:06   \nOct 24, 2016; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller (58) celebrates the win over the Houston Texans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Broncos defeated the Texans 27-9. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports) \nVon Miller seems to be in the holiday spirit of giving. \nMiller sent every single player in the AFC West, including practice squad players and those on injured reserve, a personalized bottle of wine. The wine was blended by the same person who blended wine for Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel. \nEach bottle of wine also came with a thank-you note written by Miller himself, via Denver Post : \nIt is an honor and a privilege to take the field and compete with you twice a year. We are so fortunate to have this opportunity to fulfill our childhood dreams of playing in the NFL. The blood, sweat, aches and pains, and endless hours spent watching film are a testament to the love and dedication we have for this game. So take a moment, reflect on all your successes, and enjoy your accomplishment. Appreciate those who have helped you get this far, and start working towards your next childhood dream. \nThank you for helping to make our game great! \nMiller has been full of surprises all week. The Broncos linebacker participated in another random act of kindness when he sent an encouraging video message to the Colorado Buffaloes before their Pac-12 championship game against Washington. Von Miller sent a video to the Buffs telling them to bring another championship back to CO. He knows a bit about dominating at Levi's. — Ryan Koenigsberg (@RyanKoenigsberg) December 2, 2016 Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gVWl3l Most Popular",

      "text": "12/02/16 AT 3:09 PM Close \nDays after a Swedish comedian sent Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg an open letter disparaging the social network’s allowances of hate speech and false news, the country’s culture minister told the local Expressen newspaper Thursday that she planned to invite the tech billionaire overseas to discuss the issues. \n“I am convinced that they do not want to be an arena for threats, hate and false news,” Alice Bah Kuhnke told the paper’s culture section. She added that the spread of hateful messaging and baseless stories on Facebook “has gone over the limit” and that if the Menlo Park, California-based company doesn’t make any changes, Sweden and its Nordic neighbors “are prepared to take the next step.” \nJonas Gardell, a famed Swedish comedian and author who is openly gay, urged Zuckerberg to consider hiring an editor or publisher who “takes responsibility” for verifying false information propagated on the social network, and pointed to the presidential election victory of Donald Trump as a consequence of Facebook’s present lack of an editorial filter. Gardell called Trump “godless” and told Zuckerberg he should be “ashamed of the lies” the social network allowed to spread in the months leading up to the election. Related Stories China Urges Stricter Internet Restrictions To Curb Fake News Surge \nAccording to Facebook’s Help Center , the social network defines hate speech as “content that attacks people based on their actual or perceived race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability or disease,” and makes exceptions for jokes considered to be “a possible threat or attack” or simply “in bad taste.” Facebook pledges to remove content and accounts that pose physical safety risks, according to its Community Standards page , and offers directions for reporting abuse . \nAs for the issue of false information, Facebook followed Google Inc.’s lead in mid-November when the social network updated its Audience Network policy to specifically ban the display or integration of “fake news” in its apps or websites. \nThe debate over social networks’ role in the spread of hate speech and misinformation paraded as facts has gained steam in the wake of the Nov. 8 election, as many— even Facebook executives themselves — pointed to the social network as a generous platform for false stories that may have influenced the way Americans voted. \nFacebook did not respond to inquiries from International Business Times by press time.

      "text": "A majority eight of ten Gulf News poll respondents think social media networks like Facebook should take responsibility for moderating fake news.\nSince the US elections, Mark Zuckerberg has been under attack, based on conjecture that false information - mostly pro-Donald Trump - presented as news and circulated on Facebook may have tipped the election’s outcome.\nNow, Facebook will likely make several changes, enabling users to report false information more easily. There is also speculation they might invite third parties to add warnings to stories that appear suspect, or hire editors to monitor content.\nHowever, the perception that Facebook might become responsible for policing the “truth” gives the network a lot of editorial power - something many social media users are not comfortable with.\nWhat do you think is the best solution?",

For better or worse, it could be useful to see who is visiting your profile. Does Facebook offer a way to see who's viewed your profile or posts? Despite the rumors you may have heard over the years, the answer is a resounding no. The concept of Facebook profile views is a pure myth. The Facebook Help Center states : No. Facebook doesn't let you track who views your profile or your posts (ex: your photos.) Third-party apps are also unable to do this. If you come across an app that says it can show you who's viewing your profile or posts, please report the app. Note Facebook's emphasis on third-party apps: Chances are you've encountered a website or mobile app boldly claiming its service allows you to \"See who views your profile!\" Not only are those third-party clients lying, but they could be collecting your personal information or infecting your device with malware . Whatever their intention, all of these apps are scams. For more info, check out Facebook's data policy . Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "How to Stop Facebook Videos from Auto-Playing \nRemember the days when Facebook videos only played when you clicked on them? If you want to return to that far finer age, all you need to do is toggle a few tucked-away settings to stop the auto-play madness. \nAuto-playing videos are annoying at best (maybe you didn’t want that video to start playing in front of everyone in sight of your screen) and data-wasting at worst (maybe you didn’t want to burn up that data on a video you didn’t even really want to watch)—so we totally understand if you want to put an end to it. Let’s start with Facebook’s mobile apps and then move onto the desktop for total coverage. How to Disable Auto-Play on Mobile Devices \nTo disable auto-playing video on Facebook’s mobile applications, we need to head over to the settings menu. We’re using iOS for this tutorial, but the option is the same on both iOS and Android. Select the menu icon to access your settings. \nSelect “Settings” in the resulting menu. \nSelect “Account Settings” in the pop up menu. \nSelect “Videos and Photos” from the Account Settings menu. \nWithin the “Videos and Photos” menu select “Autoplay”. \nThere you can toggle the settings between always playing regardless of the network, only auto-playing on Wi-Fi, and never. Select “Never Autoplay Videos”. How to Disable Auto-Play on the Desktop \nNo need to stop our war there—let’s spend an extra few seconds to do away with it on the desktop too. Log into your Facebook account and click on the menu arrow in the upper right corner. Select “Settings”. \nWithin the settings menu, select “Videos” from the bottom of the left hand navigation pane. \nWithin the “Video Settings” menu, select the drop down box beside “Auto-Play Videos” and toggle it to “Off”. \nWith that quick change, auto-playing videos are now a thing of the past.",

That initial test was shelved later that month .\nFacebook once again tested Collections in December of that year with a mix of some of the retailers from the first test and some new partners, but the social network announced that it was shelving the feature in February 2014.\nReaders: What are your thoughts on the Collections feature Facebook is reportedly working on?\nImage courtesy of Shutterstock .",

      "text": "MEMPHIS It took 46 years to get to this point. Live on Facebook, passed out from a drug overdose.\nRonald Hiers was trying to kill himself.\nHe has been battling addiction for almost 50 years. His poison of choice has evolved throughout the years.\nIt was alcohol in high school, cocaine in his 20s and 30s, and ended with heroin.\n>> Read more trending stories\nOne of his wake up calls came when a disturbing video showing Hiers and his wife passed out on the sidewalk was posted online.\nPeople walked by him as if he weren't a human being. They poked at him, laughed and didn't call 911.\n“That video was the best thing that happened to me. It got me here, and here is where I’ve been trying to get to 46 years,” Hiers said.\nAfter he watched the video again, he said it doesn't get any less painful. But, he has no resentment for the man who posted it.\n“He didn't owe me a phone call. He didn't owe me anything. He didn't get me there. He didn't get my wife there. She and I got ourselves there,” Hiers said.\nNow, the Frayser High School graduate faces his demons at Turning Point , an addiction-recovery center in Southaven, Miss.\nIt’s a battle he is doing alone, not with his wife..\nTurning Point said that if a family or couple has a history of using together, it is best they are treated separately.\nWhen couples go through intentional separation in treatment, a critical turning point has to happen. It is an internal change that grounds them to further the work needed to maintain long-term sustainable recovery.\nThe road has not been easy, but Hiers has not lost his faith.\n“That's what God does. He puts you in the path of things he wants you to see and guess he got tired of me not calling him, he had to call me,” Hiers said.\nGod wasn’t the only one he said called. On the top of his list to thank is his daughter.\n“She made it possible. She bothered me on my telephone for hours that day,” Hiers said. “I didn't want to talk to her. I'm busy trying to kill myself, but she kept calling.”\nIf he meets the man who posted the video, he wants to ask one question: \"Would you have called 911 if it had been one of (your) loved ones?”",

      "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/Xuntes \nIs it getting cold in your neighborhood? You’re not the only one feeling winter’s chill. Many varieties of birds are losing their natural habitats and need a dry, safe place to shelter during the colder months. You can help the birds by making a gourd birdhouse; it’s a fun DIY project that kids will enjoy helping with as well. Materials: \ndrill with a 2″ diameter doorknob hole cutter 1/4″ drill bit sand paper or wire brush bleach exterior latex paint or oil based primer and enamel paint leather shoe lace How to make a gourd birdhouse: \nStep 1: It’s easiest to buy a dried gourd. But, if you can’t find one, then dry a fresh gourd by storing it in a cool, dry place for 3-6 months. You’ll know it’s dry when you shake it and hear the seeds rattle inside. \nStep 2: Drill a 2″ hole in the front of the gourd. This will be the door to the birdhouse. \nStep 3: Use the knife and/or spoon to scoop out the insides of the gourd. \nStep 4: Use the sand paper or wire brush to sand the exterior of the gourd smooth. This will help the paint to stick. Pay special attention to the edges of the hole so that the birds can enter and exit safely. \nStep 5: Mix a 1:10 solution of bleach and water and soak the gourd for 15 minutes to sanitize it. Then rinse in clean water and allow it to air dry. Be sure to protect yourself by wearing rubber gloves and eye protection while working with the bleach solution. \nStep 6: Paint the exterior of the gourd to protect it. Have fun with this step and get creative with your painting. \nStep 7: Drill three small drainage holes in the bottom of the birdhouse with the 1/4″ drill bit. Drill another two holes in the top to thread the leather lace through to hang. Who’ll be stopping by? \nPurple martins will definitely be attracted to your gourd birdhouse. This is good news because they’re great at controlling insect populations. Don’t be surprised if you also see bluebirds, swallows, chickadees, wrens, woodpeckers, titmice, great crested flycatchers, screech owls, kestrels, and nuthatches. Why it’s (really) important \nMany birds are environmental refugees. They lose more and more of their habitat to development, agriculture, and forestry each year. By providing them a safe, dry home you’re encouraging them to mate and stay nearby to raise their young. \nAccording to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service , “Loss, degradation and fragmentation of important migratory bird habitat have been identified as potentially the largest individual threat to migratory birds. Much of this is human caused by development. Birds need essential resources for breeding, feeding, shelter, and survival, including access to food, water, and nesting sites.” \nRare, endangered species aren’t the only birds threatened. Many birds that are much more commonplace are under threat as well. According to National Geographic , “A National Audubon Society report…shows that some widespread species generally thought to be secure have decreased in number as much as 80 percent since 1967, and the 19 others in the report have lost half their populations.” \nRelated on Organic Authority",

      "text": "Photo via Gardner Police Department The authorities clearly enjoyed the prank. The Facebook post continued : We would like to sincerely thank the persons responsible as it made our day when we pulled up what we expected to be hundreds of pictures of coyotes, foxes and raccoons. Thank you to the citizens who noticed the cameras. Your effort and sense of humor are greatly appreciated. \nFor what it’s worth, the police did not find any evidence of a mountain lion in the area, though they did see a skunk, a raccoon, and a coyote. And whatever the hell this is: ",

      "text": "08:18 am \nAsking both here and on Facebook. Flaming Crab is currently working on a follow-up to our original \"Letters from the Flaming Crab: Culinary Magic\" entitled \"The Culinary Magic Cookbook\". The original introduced culinary magic as a form of hedge magic (one anyone can do if they have a specific feat but that requires a successful skill check to perform). It included roughly fifteen recipes as well as a set of feats and traits to go with it. There were also two archetypes: the performing chef (bard) and the kitchen witch (witch). \nSo, as we expand the book to include at least 70 recipes and a few new archetypes, my question to the Pathfinder public: \nWhat do you want in your cooking magic? Besides cupcakes, BJ Hensley. :) What would you like to see which would help convince you to buy this book? This is your chance to help shape a product before it hits production. Please comment and let us know.",
