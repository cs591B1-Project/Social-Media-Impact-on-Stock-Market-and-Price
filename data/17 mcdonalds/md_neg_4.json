      "text": "We McDonald ‘Take Me To Church’“The Voice” Video: Watch Top 12 Performance! Truth rating: 10 By Shari Weiss | 9:08   (NBC) \nWe McDonald took viewers to church with her Top 12 performance on “The Voice” on Monday. Check out the video below! \nAs Gossip Cop has reported, McDonald has established herself as one of the artists to beat on season 11 of the NBC competition. Though she’s still a teen, the aspiring star possesses a strong, deep voice and an assured performance style that’s made her stand out. During last week’s Live Playoffs, McDonald won voters over with “Home” from The Wiz . \nIt might seem strange to go from that to Hozier’s “Take Me To Church,” but she explained that she wanted to “rock out.” No one was more surprised than key adviser Garth Brooks, who was shocked by McDonald’s deep voice. “I don’t know if I’ve ever got my head yanked around like We,” he admitted. \nOn the broadcast, McDonald started relatively softly at the piano before going full-on hardcore. Carson Daly asked her afterward, “What happens to you when you perform?! You become another human being!” Miley Cyrus agreed, and pointed out how much the crowd loves her on stage. \nCoach Alicia Keys went on to tell her artist, “You are the real deal. You are somebody that no one can ever forget. You are unforgettable.” Watch below! \n ",

      "text": "Follow Us ® 2016 Bustle Wé McDonald Sings \"Take Me To Church\" In 'The Voice' Top 12 & Proves That She's Going To Be Around For A While By Jessica Molinari 3 hours ago \nAmen, indeed! Never has a The Voice contestant slayed as hard as W é McDonald in the Top 12 Live Shows. McDonald channeled her inner rock-goddess and blew the audience away with a powerful rendition of \"Take Me To Church.\" Seriously, where did that performance come from?! McDonald left everything she had on The Voice stage and it absolutely paid off. The Team Alicia singer showed the world a new side of her talent and quickly solidified herself a spot in the hearts of fans everywhere. After tonight, there's no doubt McDonald will be in the game for many more weeks to come. \nMcDonald is truly a one-of-a-kind artist. At age 17, she already possesses more talent than professionals twice her age. Everything about her sound and her stage presence is polished and mature. McDonald exudes confidence in a way you would never expect from someone so young, which is why she shines so bright. \nAnother reason McDonald shines so bright? Her voice. And I'm not just talking about her singing voice. The difference between her speaking voice and her singing voice is just so insane that it makes her even more impressive. One would never expect a squeaky, Minnie Mouse-voiced 17-year-old to even think of tackling \"Take Me To Church,\" but that's exactly what McDonald did. And she did it well. That's because her singing voice is nothing like her speaking voice. There may actually be two people living inside McDonald's body because that's how different her sounds are. As soon as she opens her mouth to sing, McDonald's voice goes from high-pitched to low and deep while she herself transforms from a typical 17-year-old high school student into a full-on powerhouse rock diva. \nTo sum it up, McDonald is special. And that specialness is exactly why she is on The Voice . After all, the 17-year-old exudes everything that the show is about. And with Alicia as her coach, there's no doubt McDonald's voice is going to get even better . And guess what—we're going to witness that improvement because, after tonight, there's no way McDonald will be going home any time soon. \nImage: Trae Patton/NBC ",

      "text": "McDonald’s is announcing today that it has begun testing a Sriracha Big Mac burger in the Columbus, Ohio, market, the same location for the earlier test of the Mac Jr. And Grand Mac that it will introduce nationally in early 2017.\nIn addition to having exclusive access to a Sriracha Big Mac, Columbus diners can order Sriracha Mac Sauce on any item on McDonald’s menu and/or get the spicy sauce in a mini tub for dipping fries or Chicken McNuggets. The Sriracha Big Mac and Sriracha Mac Sauce will be available in Columbus through Dec. 31, 2016.\n“We’re always trying new creations and we wanted to innovate with an on-trend flavor like Sriracha to give our customers in Columbus a new and exciting taste,” McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz said in a statement announcing the test.\nThis is the first time McDonald’s has tried Sriracha Mac Sauce on the Big Mac itself, but it continues a love-affair with sriracha that began in early summer, as BurgerBusiness.com has documented:\nRecommended: Who was Betty Crocker? A 'famous food names' quiz. → June 2016: McDonald’s offers a “ Signature Sriracha ” toppings combination (Sriracha Big Mac sauce, white Cheddar cheese, crispy onions, a new spinach/kale blend and tomato) in San Diego as part of its test of the Signature Crafted Recipes platform in San Diego.\nTest your knowledge Who was Betty Crocker?

The Spicy Sriracha Mighty Angus burger was a100% Canadian Angus beef patty topped with hickory-smoked bacon pieces, lettuce, processed Cheddar cheese, sliced jalapeňos, sriracha sauce and an applewood-smoke seasoned sauce on a sesame-and-poppy-seed bun. The Spicy Sriracha Country Chicken sandwich had a seasoned Canadian chicken breast topped with lettuce and white processed Cheddar cheese, sliced jalapenos, sriracha sauce and applewood-smoke-seasoned sauce served on the same sesame-and-poppy-seed-glazed bun.\n→ October 2016: BurgerBusiness.com reported exclusively that on Sept. 23, 2016, McDonald’s Corp. filed a federal trademark registration for “Mac Sauce.” Not Big Mac Sauce, just Mac Sauce. And Mac Sauce is the term being used now for the Columbus Sriracha Big Mac test.\nI speculated then that McDonald’s might be eying taking bottled Mac Sauce to supermarket shelves —as it did with McCafé coffee—and I still think that’s a reasonable possibility.\nThis article first appeared in BurgerBusiness .",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nEvery year, McDonald’s releases the McRib sandwich. A limited-time offer, the menu item is only available for a few weeks, leading legions of McDonald’s fans to try and figure out which restaurants are carrying it and how many they have left. For the last few years, fan-created McRib locators have popped up on the internet. \nNow, for the first time, McDonald’s is leading the charge, with a new iOS 10 McRib Finder iMessage app. It doesn’t ask for a zip code, using the device’s location to help customers find the closest McRib, then share that with friends. There’s also a McRib keyboard attached with stickers. Only half of the country’s McDonald’s will carry the McRib this year, down from 75 percent in 2014. \nPaul Matson, director of social engagement for the U.S. at the fast-food company, said that with mobile ordering coming into stores next year, the brand is on a mission to “innovate every step in the consumer-buying process,” through what he calls “quick wins” — quick digital projects that build to a bigger outcome. Advertisement \nThe brand wants to use what it learns from the McRib app to inform other product launches as well. They include limited-time ones like the Shamrock Shake. “The impetus is not just to understand who is buying McDonald, but it’s to make the experience more convenient,” said Matson. \nAbout 80 percent of U.S. McDonald’s customers eat at a McDonald’s a week, according to the brand’s internal figures. Those transactions are heavily cash-driven, making it tough to glean data about a customer. \nThe app launch is part of the brand’s move to digital that began with a new CEO, Steve Easterbrook, who came on board in March last year. Since then, the brand hasn’t been shy about needing a turnaround as younger customers opt out of Big Macs in favor of healthier fast-casual food. Last year, the brand sent teams to SXSW in Austin, to work with startups via pitch competition aimed at digitizing the company. That includes ideas like drone delivery — or more prosaic ones like mobile ordering or voice-recognition in drive-thru speakers. \nMcDonald’s said it is going to accelerate spending on technology — it declined to share how big its digital team is, but Matson said that it’s big, and there has been a “digital investment” in all parts of the company. It’s another way to compete against, for example, Taco Bell or Starbucks, which have mobile ordering and rewards programs. \nIn a second-quarter earnings call, Easterbrook said, “We know customers respond well, and certainly it breathes new life into our restaurants and into the brand.” In October, the brand posted that same-store sales have increased 1.3 percent and reported profit of $1.3 billion, down slightly from a year ago. \n“A restaurant locator is table stakes, but customers don’t always rely on the resources we provide them,” Matson said. “But here’s a piece of information only we would know: Who’s serving the McRib?”",

      "text": "Your Big Mac is getting an upgrade. (Picture: Getty) The humble Big Mac you knew and loved is dead.\nWell, not entirely. But it’s no longer the simple joy you once thought it was. It’s getting all kinds of upgrades.\nNot only is McDonald’s trying to jazz up the Mac by creating bigger and smaller versions (called the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr, respectively), it’s also now trying to taint the burger’s simple joy by adding your favourite condiment.\nThat’s right. McDonald’s next big thing is the Sriracha Burger.\nYes, it will probably taste delicious. Yes, we love both McDonald’s and Sriracha and will likely enjoy the two together. But must things change? Must we keep taking the Big Mac to new heights?\n(Picture: Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images) McDonald’s is currently testing the Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio area.\nMcDonald’s Italy has introduced a Nutella burger Essentially it’s just a Big Mac with added Sriracha hot sauce, but still. It feels like a big deal.\nThe Sriracha Big Mac is joined in the trial stages by a Sriracha Mac dipping sauce for fries.\nNow, in case you’re not tuned in to all the goings-on of the McDonald’s business, let us give you a very brief explainer of what this trial period will likely mean.\n(Picture: McDonald’s/metro.co.uk) Ohio is the place that McDonald’s most frequently trials items that then go on to join the menu. It’s where they tested breakfasts, the different size Big Macs we mentioned earlier, mac ‘n’ cheese.\nIf a product is well-received in Ohio, it then usually gets trialed around the US, and if that goes well, it gets added to the menu.\nSo while it’ll take some time, the Sriracha Burger will probably make its way over here.\nGet excited, hot sauce fans.\nMORE: McDonald’s is introducing smartphone ordering in the UK \nMORE: In defence of McDonald’s: 17 reasons why Maccy’s should never, ever change \nMORE: KFC have released their first ever Christmas burger ",

Then came the sushi \"burger ,\" a creation that begs for scare quotes. And now, because nothing is sacred, there's a Nutella burger . \nMcDonald's around the world have their own specialized items: Think croque-monsieur in France and a paneer wrap in India . \nAnd if you head to Italy, you can get the Sweety con Nutella, a soft, sweet bread filled with a layer of chocolate-hazelnut spread . A photo posted by Stephanie (@local.organic) on Nov 13, 2016 at 11:26am PST \nAustralia seems to have a leg up on the game though. If you're in Melbourne, you can score a Nutella doughnut burger at Nuts-About-Tella or a mile-high version that features an actually crunchy Nutella patty at Chuck Wagon 175 in Adelaide. \nThanks, McDonald's, for giving our arteries what they didn't know they wanted —we'll see you in Italy.

      "text": "Ellen Scott for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 7:42 am Your Big Mac is getting an upgrade. (Picture: Getty) \nThe humble Big Mac you knew and loved is dead. \nWell, not entirely. But it’s no longer the simple joy you once thought it was. It’s getting all kinds of upgrades. \nNot only is McDonald’s trying to jazz up the Mac by creating bigger and smaller versions (called the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr, respectively), it’s also now trying to taint the burger’s simple joy by adding your favourite condiment. \nThat’s right. McDonald’s next big thing is the Sriracha Burger. \nYes, it will probably taste delicious. Yes, we love both McDonald’s and Sriracha and will likely enjoy the two together. But must things change? Must we keep taking the Big Mac to new heights? (Picture: Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images) \nMcDonald’s is currently testing the Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio area. McDonald’s Italy has introduced a Nutella burger \nEssentially it’s just a Big Mac with added Sriracha hot sauce, but still. It feels like a big deal. \nThe Sriracha Big Mac is joined in the trial stages by a Sriracha Mac dipping sauce for fries. \nNow, in case you’re not tuned in to all the goings-on of the McDonald’s business, let us give you a very brief explainer of what this trial period will likely mean. (Picture: McDonald’s/metro.co.uk) \nOhio is the place that McDonald’s most frequently trials items that then go on to join the menu. It’s where they tested breakfasts, the different size Big Macs we mentioned earlier, mac ‘n’ cheese. \nIf a product is well-received in Ohio, it then usually gets trialed around the US, and if that goes well, it gets added to the menu. \nSo while it’ll take some time, the Sriracha Burger will probably make its way over here. \nGet excited, hot sauce fans.

      "text": "TV 3 mins ago \nWe` McDonald has been considered one of the most likely to win “ The Voice ” for Season 11 way back in the blind auditions. She stumbled a little bit last week on the Top 20 episode but rebounded in a big way on Monday’s Top 12 show. Watch as she belts out a powerful version of “Take Me to Church” by Hozier on the live NBC reality program. She is being coached this season by first-timer Alicia Keys , who is trying to triumph over Blake Shelton , Adam Levine , and Miley Cyrus this season. Related: Ali Caldwell tops our Top 12 power rankings \nIn evaluating Monday’s performance, our writer John Benutty says: “We` worked the stage like it was in her own house and as if everyone in the audience was a personal guest. The command she displayed this is a huge turn-around from what I thought was a weak moment for her last week and she’s reclaimed her position as one of the season’s major threats to win.” \nAccording to her official NBC bio, “The name We` is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that she has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although she has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better.” \nPrior to this week’s live show, performances for the year by the New York native have been “Feeling Good” (blind audition song) by Anthony Newley , “Maybe” (battle song) by The Chantels , “No More Drama” (knockout song) by Mary J. Blige , and “Home” (top 20) from “The Wiz.” Photo Gallery: ‘The Voice’ all past winners from Seasons 1-10 \nGold Derby readers just like YOU often turn out to be our smartest prognosticators, so it’s important that you give us your predictions for the next episode of “The Voice.” You can continue to update and change your forecasts throughout the week, just click “Save” when you’ve settled on your choices.

      "title": "Oscars: Michael Keaton Back in the Hunt for Under-the-Radar McDonald's Movie 'The Founder'",
      "text": "One could be forgiven for assuming that something must be wrong with John Lee Hancock's The Founder. On paper, the Weinstein Co. film about the late McDonald's mastermind Ray Kroc sounded like Oscar bait, but its release date has bounced all over the calendar. The movie originally was set for Nov. 25. But then back in March, it was moved up to Aug. 4.\nSeveral months later, in July, it was pushed back to Dec. 16, for a limited awards-qualifying run, and Jan. 20 for a wide release. In the meantime, TWC was hit with box-office setbacks and staff departures, leading some to wonder if the Kroc film - in which Michael Keaton stars as the struggling salesman who became \"an overnight success\" at 52 - would ever see the light of day.\nWhile one could be forgiven for that assumption, one also would be sorely mistaken. I finally was shown The Founder this week - as were a number of other awards pundits and two audiences of SAG Awards nominating-committee members. That suggests TWC has confidence in the film's prospects, and I can report that it's not only not bad, but is so good that it may be a serious contender, after all.\nThat's largely because of Keaton. Coming off of his performances in 2014's Birdman and 2015's Spotlight, he gives a performance in the same league as the ones he gave in those films (he personally was nominated for the former pic but snubbed for the latter). He has plenty of screen time, too, appearing in every scene, and convincingly captures the sheer force-of-will that propelled Kroc, so TWC should be able to make a strong case for him in what's looking like a weak year for the best actor Oscar. Indeed, if Keaton were to get nominated alongside the category's two presumptive frontrunners - Fences' Denzel Washington, who already has two Oscar statuettes on his shelf, and Manchester by the Sea's Casey Affleck, a young buck still early in his career - I would say all bets are off.\nThe Founder's script, written by Robert D. Siegel, clearly was inspired by Kroc's 1977 best-selling McMemoir Grinding It Out, which I recently read. And the resulting film, like Hancock's 2009 film version of Michael Lewis' The Blind Side, impeccably captures the tone and tenor of the source material. The RottenTomatoes.com rating of The Blind Side was an abysmal 66 percent, but the movie, which told an inspirational story about a plain-spoken underdog finding success, spoke to middle-America (like a recent presidential candidate you might recall), grossed more than $250 million domestically, was nominated for the best picture Oscar and garnered a lead acting Oscar for Sandra Bullock.\nThat same description also applies to The Founder, so TWC would be wise not to place all of its chips on Lion this season.\nRead more: Feinberg Forecast: Trick or Treat, the Oscar Race Heads Into November",

      "text": "McDonald's is testing a Sriracha Big Mac now Venessa Wong SHARES Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images \nIn the latest sign that America's favorite southeast Asian condiment has gone totally mainstream, McDonald's is now testing a Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio area. \nThe burger chain is also offering a Sriracha Mac dipping sauce there, which it had tested earlier this year in custom burgers in San Diego, Seattle, and Los Angeles. \nMcDonald's, which recently has been tinkering with its iconic menu items to keep customers interested, announced that the Big Mac would be also available in a mini and a grand size for a few weeks in early 2017. \nA spokesperson said the use of Sriracha sauce now marks the first time the chain has switched out the ingredients in the sandwich for a new flavor profile. \n\"This is a milestone for McDonald's,\" she wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. Tweet 1 Getty Images \nThe chain has been updating some of its most popular items as it tries to sustain a sales turnaround in the US. It took out artificial preservatives in the ingredients used in McNuggets; it uses butter instead of margarine now in McMuffins; and the buns used for sandwiches, like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, are now sweetened with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. \nMore from Buzzfeed:",

      "text": "Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images In the latest sign that America's favorite southeast Asian condiment has gone totally mainstream, McDonald's is now testing a Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in the Columbus, Ohio area. \nThe burger chain is also offering a Sriracha Mac dipping sauce there, which it had tested earlier this year in custom burgers in San Diego, Seattle, and Los Angeles. \nMcDonald's, which recently has been tinkering with its iconic menu items to keep customers interested, announced that the Big Mac would be also available in a mini and a grand size for a few weeks in early 2017. \nA spokesperson said the use of Sriracha sauce now marks the first time the chain has switched out the ingredients in the sandwich for a new flavor profile. \n\"This is a milestone for McDonald's,\" she wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. \nTweet 1 \nGetty Images The chain has been updating some of its most popular items as it tries to sustain a sales turnaround in the US. It took out artificial preservatives in the ingredients used in McNuggets; it uses butter instead of margarine now in McMuffins; and the buns used for sandwiches, like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, are now sweetened with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. \nMore from Buzzfeed: \nTheBig Mac Is Resized As McDonald's Tweaks Its Biggest Brands \nMcDonald'sHas A Bunch Of Experiments Going On \nDeporting undocumented immigrants, the Supreme Court, and fear: President-elect Donald Trump on how he plans to lead the US. \nThe Sriracha Big Mac is just the latest item McDonald's is testing in Columbus, which a spokesperson described as \"a hotbed of innovation\" for the company.\n\n\"We have tested different sized Big Macs, Chicken McGriddles, Mac & Cheese, and All Day Breakfast Happy Meals there,\" she said.",

      "text": "Adam, welcome back to the show. \nAdam: \nThanks for having me, Brian. \nBrian: \nA pleasure to have you as always. We've had some great conversations before about Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ), we've talked about AT&T (NYSE: T ) and the Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) deal. I would love to hear about a company that I really don't look into very much but I know is a big one for a lot of our listeners, and that's McDonald's. Can you give us a brief down low on what you see and like about McDonald's right now? \nAdam: \nSure. McDonald's, it's a standard, blue chip dividend aristocrat, solid yield, solid, consistent, moderate growth and dividends. The biggest concern, of course, people have is it's a burger chain. It's considered typically low quality and right now we've got the obesity epidemic going on worldwide and we've got more and more emphasis on healthy eating. Then you've got increased competition from fast casual and higher quality places like Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) and now Panera Bread (NASDAQ: PNRA ). I look at those kind of concerns for good buying opportunities any time the stock takes a dip. \nBrian: \nWhy is that, because those concerns, those are some concerns I wanted to bring up and you just mentioned them all so obviously those don't worry you. \nAdam: \nThe thing is, you always have to, like with any company you own, you have to basically trust in management that they know what they can do and they can adapt and overcome any kind of changes in the markets like that. That's the thing I've seen over the years. McDonald's really has done a good job with their McCafe, premium coffee, that's helped a lot. Recently, they've managed to have 6 quarters in a row of same store comp sales growth in the US after a couple of years where sales basically... Were basically flat or even falling, and that's thanks to the all-day breakfast and new offerings like the McPick 2, which they've also been rolling out in Germany and that's been very successful for them. That's the thing. \nNow we're starting to see comps are once again growing in the US, maybe not as fast as some overseas markets, but the point is we do have growth here in the US and even though our market is saturated. Then overseas you've got huge potential for expansion. The thing is, like I would point out, in a place like China for example, here in the US you can look at McDonald's and people say, \"Ah you know, it's trash food.\" But in other countries, not necessarily. For example, KFC in China is considered premiere and very high quality. So that's the thing, like with McDonald's now trying to go more high end as they roll out, especially with their all franchise business model, I really like that because at the end of the day, I'm interested in the dividends.

      "text": "McDonald's Launching New Big Macs In Bay Area Just now share \nTAMPA, Fla. (970 WFLA) - Tampa Bay fast food eaters are being used as guinea pigs for McDonald's. \nThe restaurant chain is testing out two new sandwiches in the Bay area ahead of a national rollout next year. \nThe new items are the Grand Mac and the Mac Junior. They're a larger and smaller version of the standard Big Mac, respectively. \nThe Mac Junior eliminates the middle bun, while the Grand Mac has 60 percent more beef. \nTampa Bay is one of the first regions to offer the new sandwiches to consumers. \nIn Florida, all Grand Mac, Mac Jr. and Big Mac buns are baked at the Turano Bakery in Orlando. \n“We carefully created the Grand Mac and Mac Jr. to innovate on the classic Big Mac,” said McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz. \n“There’s an emotional connection to the Big Mac sandwich. The Big Mac is a famous and iconic American food. For many, it’s a treat that brings happiness and conjures up a nostalgic connection, especially for those people for whom Big Mac was their first ‘grown up’ burger.”",

But it's the second time this year that the company has tinkered with the sandwich. \nThe chain is launching a smaller \"Mac Jr\" and a larger \"Grand Mac\" nationwide for a limited time in early 2017 after testing the sandwiches earlier this year.\nThe Mac Jr. is a miniature version of the Big Mac with a single 1/6-pound burger patty.\nThe Grand Mac features 66% more beef than the regular Big Mac, an extra slice of cheese, and a larger bun.\nNOW WATCH: Watch millennials try a McDonald's Big Mac for the first time \n",

      "text": "The McRib is back, and McDonald’s wants to help you find one.\nThe pork sandwich isn’t available at all McDonald’s locations. To make sure you can hunt one down, the company has released a mobile app that shows you where it’s being served up--the McDonald’s McRib Finder . It’s an iMessage app that uses your location to show you where the nearest McRib is and lets you easily invite a friend to go get one with you.\nBasically how it works is you open up the app in iMessage, and it shows you a map with your location, pinpointing each McDonald’s outpost where you can find a McRib. Clicking on the location marker will prompt you with an address and the option to send it to someone. The app also contains a handful of McRib-themed stickers.\nConsidering it’s an iMessage app , the McRib Finder only works on iPhones and iPads. Android users will just have to rely on the McRib Locator website.\nAccording to Consumerist , the McRib will be available at participating locations through the rest of the year.",

      "text": "McDonald's Testing a Big Change for the Big Mac newsfeedback@fool.com (Daniel B. Kline) Updated 13 min ago \nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has not changed the recipe of the Big Mac since the sandwich first hit menus in 1967. \nIn recent months, the chain has added a larger version (the Grand Mac) and a smaller one (the Mac Jr.), but aside from the size change, the sandwich has remained the same for nearly 50 years. It's a recipe so iconic that it has its own song popularized in a 1974 ad campaign -- \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.\" \nNow, for the first time in its history, McDonald's is testing a new version of the Big Mac, though it's not dropping the classic version. . McDonald's tested Sriracha this summer, and now it's bringing it to the Big Mac (not pictured). Image source: McDonald's. What is McDonald's doing? \nThe fast-food chain has begun testing Sriracha Big Mac at locations in Columbus, Ohio, according to Nation's Restaurant News (NRN). The new sandwich features the traditional \"special sauce\" spiked with spicy Sriracha, a sauce the company has offered as an option on its burgers in select markets since June. The new Big Mac will be tested at 128 locations in Central Ohio through the end of the year, according to NRN, which noted that these are the same locations that tested the different size Big Macs earlier in 2016. \n\"Offering the addition of Sriracha to our Big Mac Special Sauce was a fun way for our culinary innovations team to think outside the box and continue to answer the call of our customers who are always looking for the next great innovation in food experience and taste,\" Scott Nickell, Central Ohio Co-op president, said in a statement reported by NRN. \nThe chain will decide after the test whether to roll out the sandwich nationwide. It is not uncommon for McDonald's to test a product that never makes it to the national menu. \nIn addition to the new Big Mac, the Ohio McDonald's involved in the test will also offer the Sriracha Big Mac sauce as a dipping sauce for Chicken McNuggets and french fries. That option was tried earlier this year in some West Coast locations. Why is McDonald's doing this? \nEveryone knows what a Big Mac is and most people know what Sriracha tastes like. Adding a variant of the classic sandwich featuring the popular sauce creates a new product that consumers immediately understand, which could entice lapsed customers to visit a McDonald's to try the new sandwich. It's important to not dilute a key brand like Big Mac, but the fast-food company has been very protective of its signature sandwich, making any change (or in this case new variety) count as an event. If people like the Sriracha Big Mac, then McDonald's will have a new menu item it can roll out nationwide that should create some excitement. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than McDonald's \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and McDonald's wasn't one of them!

      "text": "Hollis Johnson \nAs Joni Mitchell once said, you don't know what you've got till it's gone.\nThat's exactly how I felt upon discovering that McDonald's had killed its Create Your Taste experiment.\nA thorn in the side of many franchisees offering over 30 fancy ingredients and toppings, the Create Your Taste customizable menu was recently replaced with a different and more limited menu platform called Signature Crafted Recipes. \nInstead of allowing you to build your own burger, this new menu offers three burgers to choose from: pico guacamole, sweet barbecue bacon, and maple bacon dijon.\nYou can then choose a protein — quarter-pound burger, crispy chicken, or grilled chicken — and pick from two options of buns. \nAs a Create Your Taste fan myself, I decided to test all three replacement burgers. Which, if any, are worth a bite?\nUnsurprisingly, the sandwiches come in the same strange double-wide container that the Create Your Taste burgers arrived in. Hollis Johnson \n\nFirst up, we have the pico guacamole burger. It's a vaguely Southwestern themed flavor — very vaguely. Underneath the \"artisan roll\" (you can choose between that or the classic sesame seed bun) lies a quarter-pound beef patty, white cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, lettuce, and buttermilk ranch, all for $6.69. Hollis Johnson \n\nSee what I mean by \"vaguely Southwestern\"? I'm not sure what flavor demographic this is aiming for… Southwestern, without spice? But with ranch? And I can't even discern the white cheddar cheese, so why bother including it? Why not spicy pepper jack, which was on the Create Your Taste menu?

      "text": "When McDonald's discontinues menu items —like crispy Chicken Selects and the extremely well loved McWrap —fans can get pretty outraged. I mean, what is a fast food spot without your tried-and-true order? And now the Golden Arches is finally bringing back one of its most popular menu items of all time: the McRib.\nYep, that means you can get your hands on the cut favorite pork patty served on a homestyle roll with the iconic McRib barbecue sauce, pickles, and onions. There is a catch, though.\nReturning for a limited time, the sandwich will only be available at specific locations for about $4. But before you start calling every McD's in a 20-mile radius, you can download the brand's McRib Finder from Apple's App Store.\nIt works like an iMessage texting service, and it allows you to find participating restaurants and invite friends to a particular location that serves the McRib. Unfortunately Android users are out of luck—at least until McDonald's creates a non-iPhone version of its McRib-locating service.\nFrom: Delish\n ",

So he went over and he asked her what was going on and she was going through some tough times,” Davila told KTVT. \nDavila says her boss is also going through a rough time after he was diagnosed with cancer.\nAt that point, Davila’s boss decided to spread a little bit of kindness to the workers who wait on him at the restaurant.\nAccording to KTVT, he gave each employee $100, even employees who weren’t working when he stopped by the restaurant.\n“You could tell it blessed their day,” Davila said. “They didn’t come in there thinking that was going to happen that day.. and that was the best part about it.”\nThe staff created a thank you card for him should he decide to return.",

      "text": "McDonald’s serves Nutella burger in Italy McDonald’s serves Nutella burger in Italy  22 PM \nThey’re hazel-nuts! \nLeave it to the Italians to dream up a Nutella burger and serve it at McDonald’s. \nThe Sweety con Nutella may look like a burger, but don’t be fooled — it’s a sugary sandwich stuffed with the chocolate-hazelnut spread sans savory meat. It’s made with two of the fast food chain’s burger buns. \n“A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist,” the company announced on its Facebook page last week. \nIt’s far from unique compared to other Italian McDonald’s menu items like the tiramisu or an actual burger served with pecorino cheese. Sweety con Nutella burger is available at McDonald’s in Italy. (McDonald’s) \nThe sweet treat, that’s reportedly 256 calories per serving , became a sensation on social media with nearly 100,000 Facebook shares since it launched Thursday. \nBut some people weren’t exactly loving it. \n“You’re selling chocolate spread rolls? That’s original. I could buy a loaf of bread and a jar of Nutella for the price of one of these,” Tommy Webb wrote on Facebook. Tags:",

      "text": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ iTunes results: We McDonald, Billy Gilman, Ali Caldwell strong   \nWe hate to say we told you so … well, actually, we’re glad to say that we told you so. We McDonald delivered a really-strong performance of “Take Me to Church” on Monday night’s new episode of “ The Voice ,” and early returns on iTunes suggest that we’re looking at someone who could be in the top pole position and go really this season. \nWe’s cover, as of 10:45 a.m. Pacific time, is sitting pretty at #16. This is out of that coveted top 10 position, but with the popularity of the show fading over time, it may be a little more few-and-far-between this season that we see a decline in some of the performances that we end up seeing make it that high on the list. \nAs for some other strong performers, you can go ahead and consider Billy Gilman safe thanks to his “The Show Must Go On” at #24, while Ali Caldwell delivered a “Did I Ever Love You” performance that hit #25. Given that this was our favorite of the entire night, we’re incredibly-psyched to see that she did this well. Josh Gallagher is at #36 with “Why,” whereas Sundance Head is one spot behind him with “My Church.” While neither one of these performances are necessarily iTunes knockout-punches, at the same exact time we feel fairly confident that the two of them are going to be strong enough to make it into the next round. Remember, country artists tend to rank a little bit higher in the internet / phone voting than most other artists, and that will probably boost them as well. \nFrom here, there’s a pretty big drop-off, but we’d say that Brendan Fletcher’s “Whipping Post” at #57 could be enough to save him, given that he also performed at the end of the show and that tends to be a great spot for artists to feel secure. \nDid you buy anyone’s song off of iTunes this week on “The Voice”? Let us know in the comments! Also, we’ll have another look at the other side of the potential results a little bit later in the day at the link here . (Photo: NBC.)

BuzzFeed News reports that the fast food chain is rolling out a Sriracha Big Mac and dipping sauce in 126 of its Columbus, Ohio area locations after successful stints on the West Coast earlier this year. \nThe Big Mac has gone through many makeovers lately in an attempt to revive customers’ tired taste buds and also to woo millennials that have ditched the drive-thru in droves. Two weeks ago, the company announced that it will offer two new Big Mac sizes early next year—the smaller Mac Jr. and the larger Grand Mac—in a Goldilocks-like approach to appeal to a more widespread consumer base and hopefully improve its sluggish sales. Last week, McDonald's Italy rolled out a different novelty item, a Nutella burger called the Sweet y con Nutella . This, however, marks the first time that a Big Mac ingredient has been altered. (See also: Investopedia Millennials Try a Big Mac for the First Time ) \nAlthough McDonald’s has benefited from its all-day breakfast menu and overarching efforts to adopt more natural ingredients, its third quarter same-store sales only increased 1.3% year over year. If all goes well in Columbus, incorporating Sriracha into its menu nationwide could translate into even spicier sales figures for McDonald’s. For now, it looks like Columbus may now be the nation’s hottest city thanks to McDonald’s latest iteration of its iconic Big Mac.

Users can also share the location with friends and send McRib-themed stickers, all within the Messages app. \nEarlier last week, McDonald's had announced its plans to launch a mobile order-and-pay service for customers.

      "text": "McDonald's Is Testing A Spicy New Sriracha Big Mac Food News 5 hours ago \nThe Sriracha trend has died down quite a bit over the last couple years, but apparently McDonald's is still going to hold on to it, albeit kind of late, with their testing of a Sriracha Big Mac. \nThe new burger still has the essence of the standard Big Mac, with a sriracha-infused modification to their Mac Sauce, according to Nation's Restaurant News . \nWhile the testing is only being done in central Ohio, it will reach 128 McDonald's locations, through the end of 2016. \"Offering the addition of Sriracha to our Big Mac Special Sauce was a fun way for our culinary innovations team to think outside the box and continue to answer the call of our customers who are always looking for the next great innovation in food experience and taste,” Scott Nickell, Central Ohio Co-op president, said in a statement. \nThe new spicy Big Mac announcement comes a week after the fast food joint got people hyped over their two new Big Mac sizes, so if the testing goes well, we might soon see a Sriracha Mac Jr. and Sriracha Grand Mac as well. \nMcDonald's also flirted with signature Sriracha burgers in Southern California and Seattle back in July, calling the spicy Big Mac-based sauce \"Awesome Sauce.\" \nYou can't really fault McDonald's for jumping onto the Sriracha bandwagon. Although the popular hot sauce was at its peak a few years ago, the overall sales of hot sauce have grown by 150 percent since 2000 . \nHopefully this leads to wide release and we can all give it a shot, and dunk our fries into their Sriracha Mac Sauce.

      "text": "The McRib is back, and McDonald’s wants to help you find one.\nThe pork sandwich isn’t available at all McDonald’s locations. To make sure you can hunt one down, the company has released a mobile app that shows you where it’s being served up—the McDonald’s McRib Finder . It’s an iMessage app that uses your location to show you where the nearest McRib is and lets you easily invite a friend to go get one with you.\nBasically how it works is you open up the app in iMessage, and it shows you a map with your location, pinpointing each McDonald’s outpost where you can find a McRib. Clicking on the location marker will prompt you with an address and the option to send it to someone. The app also contains a handful of McRib-themed stickers.\nConsidering it’s an iMessage app , the McRib Finder only works on iPhones and iPads. Android users will just have to rely on the McRib Locator website.\nAccording to Consumerist , the McRib will be available at participating locations through the rest of the year.",

Thankfully, Golden Arches is finally bringing back one of its most popular menu items of all time: the McRib.\n© McDonald's McDonald's Is FINALLY Bringing Back The McRib You can get your hands on the cult favorite pork patty served on a homestyle roll with the iconic McRib barbecue sauce, pickles, and onions. There is a catch, though.\nThe sandwich, which is returning for a limited time, will only be available at specific locations for about $4. But before you start calling every McD's in a 20-mile radius, you can download the brand's McRib Finder from Apple's App Store.\n© Provided by Delish It works like an iMessage texting service, and it allows you to find participating restaurants and invite friends to a particular location that serves the McRib. Unfortunately Android users are out of luck-at least until McDonald's creates a non-iPhone version of its McRib-locating service.\nFollow Delish on Instagram .\nGo to MSN Home",

So he went over and he asked her what was going on and she was going through some tough times,” Davila told KTVT. \nDavila says her boss is also going through a rough time after he was diagnosed with cancer. \nAt that point, Davila’s boss decided to spread a little bit of kindness to the workers who wait on him at the restaurant. \nAccording to KTVT, he gave each employee $100, even employees who weren’t working when he stopped by the restaurant. \n“You could tell it blessed their day,” Davila said. “They didn’t come in there thinking that was going to happen that day.. and that was the best part about it.” \nThe staff created a thank you card for him should he decide to return.

To add flavor to conversations, the app also offers a variety of stickers that can be used when chatting with fellow McDonald's McRib fans. Rather than making this a feature of its official app, this standalone application specifically appeals to diehard McRib lovers who will make full use of the sandwich-finding tool.",

      "text": "Morgan McDonald have earned Great Lakes Region Coach and Athlete of the Year honors, the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association announced Tuesday. Byrne, in his ninth year at Wisconsin, led the men to their 30th Great Lakes Regional crown in 45 years. Byrne has now collected six Great Lakes Regional Coach of the Year titles and 12 total regional honors throughout his career. In addition to his regional honor, Byrne was awarded Big Ten Men's Cross Country Coach of the Year honors earlier this month after leading UW to the 2016 Big Ten Championship, edging out Michigan State by a mere three points. McDonald finished runner-up at this year's regional meet, crossing the line with senior teammate Malachy Schrobilgen by his side in 30 minutes, 22.2 seconds. The duo paced the men's race all 10 kilometers, providing a one-two punch to help the Badgers secure the team title by 30 points. The junior from Sydney, Australia also led the Badgers to the Big Ten team crown by earning the individual title as well. For his efforts, he was named the 2016 Big Ten Athlete of the Year. He was also named Big Ten Athlete of the Week twice after winning the Oz Memorial Invitational and crossing the line in third at the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational. No. 12 Wisconsin wraps up its season at the 2016 NCAA Cross Country Championship on Saturday at the LaVern Gibson Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Indiana. The women's championship begins at 10 a.m. (CT), with the men toeing the line at 11 a.m.",

      "text": "McDonald’s is test-marketing a new Big Mac with sriracha sauce — and making the sriracha-spiked condiment available separately as a dipping sauce so diners can spice up their french fries and chicken McNuggets — in central-Ohio locations through the end of the year.\nThe 128 Columbus-area stores are the same locations that tested different-sized Big Macs, one larger and one smaller than the regular Big Mac, earlier this year. And that test led directly to the fast-food chain’s decision to roll out the concept nationwide. That development pleased Dayton-area McDonald’s franchisees .\nThe spicier Big Mac represents the chain’s first attempt at a changed recipe of its iconic, signature sandwich, according to Nation’s Restaurant News (nrn.com) .\nThis isn’t McDonald’s first flirtation with the pepper-spiked condiment. The chain introduced a Sriracha-spiked version of its signature Special Sauce for a limited time in July at locations in Seattle and southern California.\nIn the Columbus test, customers will be able to customize any item on the menu with the sriracha sauce, NRN.com said.\nRELATED: 2 new Big Macs coming soon to local McDonald’s",

(Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images) 52 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCOLUMBUS - McDonald's is testing a new version of its infamous Big Mac and hoping fans of Sriracha will be lovin' it. \nThe fast-food chain announced Monday that it's testing the Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in Ohio, WCMH-TV reports . \nSriracha, a spicy sauce made with red chilis, will be added to the signature Big Mac sauce. Customers will also be able to get the Sriracha Big Mac sauce on the side in case they want to dip fries or chicken nuggets in it. \nFor the past few years, Sriracha has been touted as a go-to condiment for millenials and the spicy burger may be an attempt to get young people in the door, according to MarketWatch . Only one in five millenials have tried a Big Mac, according to a McDonald's memo, which was passed among operators earlier this year, MarketWatch reported.",

      "text": "Few companies had higher stakes in the presidential election than McDonald's ( MCD ), and Donald Trump's victory has served up the equivalent of a quadruple cheeseburger on a Golden Arches platter.\nMost consequentially, a Trump administration is expected to stick a fork in the National Labor Relations Board's push to up-end McDonald's franchising model by labeling the fast-food giant a joint-employer of franchisee workers.\nStill, McDonald's was largely an afterthought on investors' post-election buy lists — until Monday. McDonald's rose 0.4% to 118.32 on the stock market today , the best since mid-August, after jumping 3.2% on Monday. Meanwhile, shares of Wendy's ( WEN ), which broke above a buy point at 11.00 on Nov. 7, added about 2% to 11.94.\nThat legal battle threatened not only to make McDonald's and other major fast-food chains liable for workplace violations by independent operators, but also may have forced the parent company to the collective bargaining table with franchisee workers seeking to unionize.\nOn top of that, a Trump victory promises relief for employers in modest-wage industries like fast food on multiple fronts. The ObamaCare employer mandate, which fines employers with at least 50 full-time-equivalent workers if they fail to offer acceptable health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week, will likely be repealed by the unified Republican government. The Obama administration's overtime rule, which doubles the pay threshold for salaried workers who can be denied time-and-a-half overtime pay to $47,476 effective Dec. 1, is likely to be watered down.\nThat menu looks a whole lot more appetizing to McDonald's, its franchisees and investors than Hillary Clinton's plan to raise the minimum wage to at least $12 an hour and require companies to provide paid leave to workers, while continuing to have the NLRB carry forward its attack on the Golden Arches business model.\nStill, the results of Tuesday's vote weren't a clean sweep for McDonald's. Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wage to $12 an hour, with Washington state voters approved a $13.50 minimum wage, all by 2020.\nRising wage pressures, both due to a tightening job market and government-imposed minimums, and increasing benefit mandates are among the reasons that fast-food inflation has been rising at a record pace relative to the cost of eating at home. Higher fast-food costs have slowed down customer traffic for the restaurant industry, which is experiencing its worst year since 2009.\nWhile McDonald's has raised its own base wage for U.S. workers to $10 an hour, the move doesn't apply to the roughly 750,000 workers employed by its franchisees.",

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, visited his favorite McDonald’s location, where he is a regular. He noticed a gal who also frequents the restaurant, sitting alone crying. That’s when he approached her and asked about what was going on. It turns out that she’d been going through a tough time—something the mystery man could relate to having just been diagnosed with cancer. They talked a while before he stood up and went straight to the counter. He approached the register, as though he was planning to order food. But as he began speaking with the cashier, he didn’t order anything at all. Instead, he handed each of the employees a $100 bill. One employee is heard screaming, “Oh my God!” as she realizes what’s happening. Their reaction was priceless! Each one smiling from ear-to-ear and squeezing him tight with a big hug. His insanely generous act was caught on camera, and quickly went viral. The man blessed every single one of the 33 employees at that McDonald’s with a $100 bill that day—even those who weren’t working! Later that week, he went and did something similar at a local waffle house, proving that an unexpected and simple act of kindness can transform someone’s day. \nMan Hands Out Cash At Fort Worth McDonalds RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS: A mystery man made a lot of people’s day by giving them $100 out of the blue at a Fort Worth McDonalds. \nPosted by CBS DFW on Friday, November 11, 2016",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nA police report about an encounter between an employee at a McDonald’s restaurant and a Macon man begins ordinarily enough. In the often no-frills language of law enforcement-ese, the report says that shortly after 11 a.m. on Nov. 6, the man “came to this location and ordered food.” It goes on to mention that when the man was handed his order at the eatery on Zebulon Road, not far from Interstate 475, the food was cold. “So he asked for a new order,” a Bibb County sheriff’s deputy noted in the report. “He stated that the second order was messy, with ketchup outside of the burger, and that there was a hole in the center as if someone had placed their finger in the bun.” The man, 55, told the deputy that he then asked for his money back. The man called the cops soon afterward, after he said the manager who gave him his refund and a receipt had “punched” the receipt into his hand. He wanted to press charges for battery. The deputy spoke to the manager who said she gave the man a receipt but that she didn’t assault him. “She stated that she placed the receipt in his hand,” the deputy wrote in the report. The deputy asked to review surveillance footage of the episode, but the manager said the restaurant’s general manager, who wasn’t there, would have to help with that. The deputy said he would return in a couple of days to, as the report put it, “review the video in order to determine the extent of the altercation.” Related content",

      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:35   Audra McDonald \nThere’s always an opportunity to get to know one’s cast mates better, whenever someone works on a show. Sometimes, the relationship doesn’t extend further than merely sharing space onstage. No pleasantries are exchanged. Not even a hello or goodbye. \nHowever, there are times when, despite or because of those long hours together, you transcend being just coworkers—you become family. It’s not always the case that a company of actors chooses to spend time together outside the workplace for lunch, a dance class, a movie, a walk in the park. Whenever this happens, consider yourself incredibly blessed. \nIn conversation with these said coworkers, a lot of stories are exchanged. You get to know one another on not just a superficial level. You discover recipes, crafting patterns, political alliances, deep thoughts and opinions about everything. And it’s in their storytelling that I learn a thing or two about life. Allow me to share some of them with you. ADVERTISEMENT \nNo names will be revealed, as the sources are less important than the lessons themselves, which I won’t elaborate on. Plus, I don’t want to get any of my friends in trouble for revealing what they know. Doesn’t matter how talented you are, you can get demoted. Or fired. Or never hired again. It takes years to build a reputation, and only seconds to destroy it. Your character is displayed not when things are rosy, but when things are going bad. Especially during tech, when it seems it takes forever to get things right. Not everyone is built for theater. If you are unable to handle criticism or can’t remember your cues or lines, a different line of work might be the way to go. Please don’t walk into rehearsals with a sense of entitlement. It reeks, and the director can smell it from a mile away. Be a team player. It doesn’t matter if you’re a principal, in the ensemble, or pushing around furniture. You’re on the same team with no one more or less important than the other. Always exercise kindness and empathy. You don’t always know what another person is going through, or what their story is. We all live in glass houses. All of us. A person’s departure from your life isn’t always an occasion to mourn. Sometimes it’s a blessing in disguise. Have a sense of humor. And don’t sweat the small stuff. It’s a big deal when you show up prepared and ready to get to work. Rehearsals are not primarily an opportunity to socialize, so don’t treat it as such. And to our kids, don’t try to be the next Audra or Idina; you don’t need that kind of pressure. Instead, endeavor to be the first you. Blaze your own trail. Carve your own path. But of course, your faves can inspire you, and that’s always OK. Idina Menzel",

      "title": "Generous mystery man doles out $100 bills at Fort Worth McDonald’s",
      "text": "  \nHe didn’t want recognition, but he recently brightened the day of every employee at a McDonald’s restaurant in Fort Worth. \nA mystery man went to the McDonald’s at 3601 Camp Bowie Blvd. on Nov. 3 and instead of ordering food, he started handing out $100 bills to each employee, and an employee of his took video. A line of excited and grateful hugs quickly formed at the counter. \nLisa Davila recorded her boss distributing the cash and leaving one $100 bill for every employee that wasn’t at work: 33 employees in total, according to CBSDFW.. \nDavila told CBSDFW that the mystery man was recently diagnosed with cancer and wanted to spread some joy. She said she hopes his random act of kindness will inspire others to “pay it forward.” \nMark David Smith: 817-390-7808 , @MarkSmith_FWST Related content",

Customers will now be able to customize any item on the menu with spicy sriracha until the end of 2016 at participating locations, according to the burger chain.\nCentral Ohio is the only market that will be featuring the new burger. The region will gather valuable feedback from consumers to determine whether the sandwich will expand to restaurants nationwide.",

      "text": "McDonald's McRib is back, and now there's an app to find exactly where 41 minutes ago by Crystal Lewis Brown Causes & Culture \nCrystal Lewis Brown is a parent of two boys, a wife and lifelong writer. She is also SheKnows' director of editorial operations. You can also follow her on twitter at @c_lewisbrown Grab your napkins, friends, and let's go find us a McRib sandwich Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media \nI love the McRib. There, I said it. For the past several years, I have carried my love for the McRib as a sort of secret shame. It's the type of thing I buy on my lunch break and eat at home, alone, before burying the wrapper deep into the trash can. I'm the type of person who receives random texts from my brother, letting me know that \"The McRib is back,\" complete with photos. Craving a McRib? Find one (while supplies last) & join a friend using our new McRib Finder app for iMessage! https://t.co/y1N4okCsLR pic.twitter.com/Iq9m5S0qPi — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 10, 2016 \nBut if you're a McRib lover (and if you're not, you should be), you know that the not all stores carry its saucy goodness during the limited times it's available. McDonald's has fixed that inconvenience with its just-launched app , and I am so here for it. It works like this - you download the free app, which is a companion to the locator website (if you don't have the McRib locator bookmarked, you're not living your best life. Just saying). Although most reports say it's only available for iOS, I actually found and downloaded it for Android from the Google Play store. It's not as pretty as the Apple version, but works just as well. One you have the app, you can submit a sighting, find a McRib or submit a receipt photo. I haven't quite figured out the usefulness of that feature yet, though, I suspect it's to confirm that the user actually did purchase a McRib from that actual store location. Image: Giphy \nWith a few clicks of the button, I discovered that according to my fellow McRib-lovers, the closest sighting to me was 24 miles away. The next closest? Nearly 300 miles away in California. You can click straight from the app to your cell phone's GPS and get directions, though the app recommends you call ahead to make sure that location is actually serving the sandwich. \nAnd if you find one? I suggest you pick up two. Just be sure to ask for extra napkins. Tagged in",

Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center!” \nThe product hasn’t been released in North America, but who’s to say it won’t make its way here. \nThe post has received more than 53,000 shares, 53,000 likes and 47,000 comments.

      "text": "By 2050, drug-resistant infections are expected to cause 10 million deaths annually – becoming a bigger killer than cancer is today. By 2050, antimicrobial resistance is also expected to cost the world $100tn and could push more than 28 million people into extreme poverty.\nMisuse of antibiotics in food animals is a major driver of resistance. Farm animals consume about two-thirds of the world’s antibiotics, with much of this added to feed or water to make animals grow faster or to counter unsanitary conditions in factory farming facilities. Between 2010 and 2030, it is predicted that antibiotic use in food animal production will increase by two-thirds.\nIn World Antibiotics Awareness Week , we are calling on KFC, Subway and McDonald’s to end the routine use of all antibiotics included on the World Health Organisation’s list of medically important antimicrobials , in all of their livestock supply chains. This means prohibiting suppliers from using these antibiotics for growth promotion or disease prevention and only using them when there has been a diagnosis of illness.\nSore throats to be tested by pharmacists instead of GPs under NHS move Read more \nWe welcome the progress that has been made by Subway and McDonald’s in North America and urge KFC to follow suit. But action in one region will not be enough. Consumers worldwide are becoming increasingly aware of the negative health impact of misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming. Drug-resistant infections do not respect national boundaries. We urge KFC, Subway and McDonald’s to make global commitments and develop timetables for action with targets.\nAmanda Long Director general, Consumers International, Jean Halloran Director of food policy initiatives, Consumer Reports, Catherine Howarth Chief executive, ShareAction, Angus Wong Lead digital campaign strategist, SumOfUs, Steve Roach Food safety programme director, Food Animal Concerns Trust, Emma Rose Campaigns, lobbying and communications specialist, The Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, Rosie Wardle Programme director, Jeremy Coller Foundation, Alan Briefel Executive director, FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return), Josh Zinner Chief executive officer, Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, Laura Rogers Deputy director, Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at the Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Anna Zorzet Head of ReAct Europe, Leslie Samuelrich President, Green Century Capital Management, Steve Blackledge Public health programme director, US Public Interest Research Group \n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters",

It’s a good thing I’m not in Italy, because I would legit eat these things all the time. Especially with coffee like in the promotion for it? Breakfast every day. \nUSA TODAY reached out to McDonalds and there’s still no word of whether these delicious beauties will land in the U.S. Alas, one can only hope. \nAnyway, I digress.

      "text": "For the first time in the history of the Big Mac, McDonald’s mcd is testing out a new recipe.\nThe Big Mac was first introduced in 1967 and, for the first time in those 50 years since, McDonald’s is changing up the recipe by adding Sriracha. Don’t worry--the old Big Mac isn’t going anywhere. But now McDonald’s-goers in Central Ohio will be able to order a Big Mac that’s made with Sriracha Mac sauce.\nThe new recipe is being tested at 126 McDonald’s locations in Columbus, Ohio. It’s currently only being offered for a limited time, and will be removed from menus after December 31. However, if Ohioans decide that they like the new Big Mac, it could eventually be offered nationwide.\n“There's no doubt that the Big Mac is a legend and a great-tasting burger,” McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz said in a press release . “We're always trying new creations and we wanted to innovate with an on-trend flavor like Sriracha to give our customers in Columbus a new and exciting taste.” Sriracha began gaining steam within the past five years or so, despite the fact that Huy Fong Foods, the company that makes it, spends no money on advertising. With this move into the fast food world, what was once a fringe culinary trend seems to have now hit peak mainstream.\nIn addition to the Sriracha Big Mac, McDonald’s will also be serving up individual packets of the Sriracha Mac sauce.\nThough this is the first time McDonald’s is changing up the flavor of the Big Mac, it did introduce a couple different variations of it this year. The company announced that, for a limited time in early 2017, it will be offering the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. nationwide, which are essentially larger and smaller versions of the sandwich.",

Viral Clips Daily 0:34 UP NEXT\nMcDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD ) is switching up the menu with a new Sriracha Big Mac option.\nMcDonald’s Corporation is testing the new Sriracha Big Mac out at 126 of its locations in Ohio. The major change here is that the fast food company is using a sriracha-based sauce in place of its normal Big mac sauce. The rest of the sandwich will remain the same.\nMcDonald’s Corporation won’t just be including the new sauce on its Sriracha Big Mac. The chain will also allow customers to order sriracha sauce for dipping their french fries and chicken nuggets in, reports Business Insider .\n© Provided by InvestorPlace Siracha Big Mac, McDonald's Corporation, MCD McDonald’s Corporation said that if testing of the new Sriracha Big Mac goes well, it may introduce it to the test of the United States. MCD also tested out sriracha sauce earlier this year in Southern California and Seattle. It called this variant of the sauce “Awesome Sauce.”\n“Offering the addition of Sriracha to our Big Mac Special Sauce was a fun way for our culinary innovations team to think outside the box and continue to answer the call of our customers who are always looking for the next great innovation in food experience and taste,” Scott Nickell, McDonald’s Corporation’s Central Ohio Co-op president, told FoodBeast .\nThis also isn’t the first time that McDonald’s Corporation has tested out a change to the Big Mac in 2016. It tested out two new sizes –Grand Mac and Mac Jr.– earlier this year . This test took place in Ohio and Forth Worth, Texas. Now the chain is planning to introduce the new Big Mac sizes to the rest of the United States in early 2017.\nMCD stock was up slightly as of Noon Wednesday.\nGo to MSN Home",

Patricia Brown Holmes on Wednesday told Chief Criminal Court Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. the special grand jury will begin issuing subpoenas over the next 30 to 45 days. She did not say if the jurors have already heard any evidence. Martin named Holmes to look into whether officers lied to justify the October 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old McDonald. Video released last year showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty to murder. No other officers have been charged in the incident that prompted numerous protests after video of the shooting was made public. Today's Deals",

Patricia Brown Holmes on Wednesday told Chief Criminal Court Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. the special grand jury will begin issuing subpoenas over the next 30 to 45 days. She did not say if the jurors have already heard any evidence. Martin named Holmes to look into whether officers lied to justify the October 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old McDonald. Video released last year showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty to murder. No other officers have been charged in the incident that prompted numerous protests after video of the shooting was made public. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "2 hours ago Trae Patton/NBC Rookie coach Alicia Keys is now down to just two artists remaining on her team for Season 11 of “ The Voice .” Powerhouse singer Sa’Rayah was eliminated on Tuesday night during the Top 12 results show. Will she be able to hold on against rival coaches Adam Levine , Blake Shelton , and Miley Cyrus the rest of this season? To help you make your predictions as we launch our Top 11 categories, we’ve broken down the field of artists into three groups based on their past performance. Our “frontrunners” are the artists that have made an early mark on the competition with stand-out songs in the first week of live playoffs. The “major threats” are those artists on the cusp of becoming frontrunners but still have something to prove. The “challengers” are the artists we feel are the most in need of improvement if they want to avoid singing for the instant save next week. Top 12 recap: Sa’Rayah eliminated from Team Alicia Keys FRONTRUNNERS: While no artist managed to crack the iTunes top 10 this week, earning the 5x multiplier bonus, there are four artists that came close on the strength of stand out performances. Both Billy Gilman and Josh Gallagher of Team Adam remained consistent, blowing away the judges again and maintaining their place as leaders of the pack for weeks. We` McDonald of Team Alicia bounced back with one of the week’s best performances after a less than perfect showing the week before. Team Miley’s Ali Caldwell was the breakthrough of the week, propelling herself into a frontrunner position for the first time and giving Miley her best chance at a win. ‘The Voice’: Ali Caldwell tops power rankings for Monday’s show MAJOR THREATS: In the middle of the pack after this week are two safe artist on Team Blake — both Austin Allsup and Courtney Harrell are solid bets because they play so typically within their own styles. Austin is traditional country through and through while Courtney is as good as pop R&B gets. On Team Alicia, Christian Cuevas is the season’s sweetheart, his genuine personality that shines through his performances that may otherwise fall flat without it. Brendan Fletcher on Team Adam is a more unique artist than the other three, but still plays steadily within his genre and gets a boost based on a sex appeal that comes naturally to him. In order for any of these artists to jump into frontrunner status, I think they’ll need to take a bigger risk to inspire votes and iTunes purchases in the coming weeks. ‘The Voice’: Courtney Harrell, Darby Walker in danger of elimination CHALLENGERS: The artist with the most work to do heading into next week is Team Miley’s Aaron Gibson who had to earn the instant save this week in order to continue on. I think his downfall on Monday’s live show was the obscure song choice, an easily corrected error. Song choice was also a low point for both Darby Walker (Team Miley) and Sundance Head (Team Blake), who despite good vocal performances, I think struggled connecting with the audience. The goal for these artists should be finding a song with built-in resonance with audiences to help create an instant connection with the viewers.

(Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images)\nCOLUMBUS - McDonald's is testing a new version of its infamous Big Mac and hoping fans of Sriracha will be lovin' it.\nThe fast-food chain announced Monday that it's testing the Sriracha Big Mac in 126 restaurants in Ohio, WCMH-TV reports .\nSriracha, a spicy sauce made with red chilis, will be added to the signature Big Mac sauce. Customers will also be able to get the Sriracha Big Mac sauce on the side in case they want to dip fries or chicken nuggets in it.\nFor the past few years, Sriracha has been touted as a go-to condiment for millenials and the spicy burger may be an attempt to get young people in the door, according to MarketWatch . Only one in five millenials have tried a Big Mac, according to a McDonald's memo, which was passed among operators earlier this year, MarketWatch reported.\nUSA TODAY\nWhy do we love Sriracha? Science!\nThe burger was previously tested in locations in Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle earlier this summer. The company may roll the burger out nationwide depending on how the test goes, according to McDonald's.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to McDonald's.",

Martin Jr. the special grand jury will begin issuing subpoenas over the next 30 to 45 days. She did not say if the jurors have already heard any evidence. \nMartin named Holmes to look into whether officers lied to justify the October 2014 shooting of the 17-year-old McDonald. \nVideo released last year showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty to murder. \nNo other officers have been charged in the incident that prompted numerous protests after video of the shooting was made public. \n ",

      "text": "For the first time in the history of the Big Mac, McDonald’s mcd is testing out a new recipe.\nThe Big Mac was first introduced in 1967 and, for the first time in those 50 years since, McDonald’s is changing up the recipe by adding Sriracha. Don’t worry—the old Big Mac isn’t going anywhere. But now McDonald’s-goers in Central Ohio will be able to order a Big Mac that’s made with Sriracha Mac sauce.\nThe new recipe is being tested at 126 McDonald’s locations in Columbus, Ohio. It’s currently only being offered for a limited time, and will be removed from menus after December 31. However, if Ohioans decide that they like the new Big Mac, it could eventually be offered nationwide.\n“There’s no doubt that the Big Mac is a legend and a great-tasting burger,” McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz said in a press release . “We’re always trying new creations and we wanted to innovate with an on-trend flavor like Sriracha to give our customers in Columbus a new and exciting taste.” Sriracha began gaining steam within the past five years or so, despite the fact that Huy Fong Foods, the company that makes it, spends no money on advertising. With this move into the fast food world, what was once a fringe culinary trend seems to have now hit peak mainstream.\nIn addition to the Sriracha Big Mac, McDonald’s will also be serving up individual packets of the Sriracha Mac sauce.\nThough this is the first time McDonald’s is changing up the flavor of the Big Mac, it did introduce a couple different variations of it this year. The company announced that, for a limited time in early 2017, it will be offering the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. nationwide, which are essentially larger and smaller versions of the sandwich.",
