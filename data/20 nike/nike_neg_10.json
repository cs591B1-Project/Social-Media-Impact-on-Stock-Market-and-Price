      "text": "Official Look at “Ohio State” Nike LeBron Soldier 10 Cleat Nov 26, 2016 1 minute read \nVery rarely do we see divisions within a brand collaborate, let alone have two different sports colliding. Nike Basketball and Nike Football did just that for Ohio State University today as they face off in a huge rivalry game against the University of Michigan. \nMeet the Nike LeBron 10 Soldier cleat . For the first time ever King James has one of his signature sneakers rebuilt for performance on the gridiron. Not only does this collaboration look good, but it makes sense. LeBron James is a huge supporter of OSU football and it’s also important to mention he was a top recruit as a Football player in high school who earned a scholarship from Urban Meyer as a Sophomore. This is a true collaboration in every sense of the word. \nToday, select members of the Buckeye squad will don special versions of the LeBron Solider X “Black Toe” in a pivotal game against Michigan. The shoe has been fitted with a Nike speed plate turning the Soldier into a cleat fit for a champion. ",

      "text": "In News by James Grebey / November 26, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jgrebes \nOne of the most important communists of all time, Fidel Castro, died on Friday , but capitalism was alive and well. A pack of ruthless Black Friday shoppers descended upon a Nike store in Tulalip, Washington, and just fuckin’ destroyed the place. \nAs BuzzFeed notes, the Nike Factory store, which is located in the Seattle Premium Outlets complex, doesn’t always look like a bomb just went off. An Instagram taken a few days before shows every orange shoe box neatly in place. It wouldn’t last. A photo posted by Northwest Kicks (@northwest.kicks) on Nov 20, 2016 at 9:59am PST \nAn anonymous Nike employee told BuzzFeed that they estimated that around 20,000 people passed through the store between 8 p.m. Thursday and 10 p.m. Friday, and none of them were putting things back on the shelves in their mad hunt for sweet deals on fresh kicks. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \nSeattle resident Larry Downer filmed the carnage and posted it to Facebook . “The wake of consumerism at the #Nike Factory Store is savage,” he wrote. “Found Davis some basketball shoes, saved a lady from drowning in a sea of orange boxes, and sprained my neck from shaking my head so much. Yikes.” Lord have mercy on the poor, poor retail employees who had to clean this up, restock everything, and check inventory in this superfund site of a store.

      "text": "Fans of the Nike Air Force 1 weren’t left out in the cold this Black Friday as Nike has and will release two camo colorways of the classic silhouette this weekend.\nThe pair that you see above has already arrived at retailers and comes covered in a desert camo print all throughout the leather upper. Sand, green, and brown combine on the desert camo print while sand also lands on the inner liner, tongue, laces, Swoosh, midsole, and outsole. In case you wanted more “pop”, the entire upper of this Air Force 1 has reflective qualities that can be seen when the shoe is hit by the light.\nIf you’re interested, you can pick up this Air Force 1 at select Nike retailers now for $100.\nAlso, don’t forget that the black camo pair releases on Cyber Monday.\nimages: Fuel \nAuthor’s Take Desert camo is always a winner in my book. I could have done without the reflective detailing though.\n\nThe post This Camo Colorway Of The Nike Air Force 1 Is Up For Grabs Now appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "\nWhile this year's Black Friday reached a record-breaking $3 billion USD in sales, with $1 billion USD coming from mobile devices alone, it appears the success of the post-Thanksgiving holiday was not met without a few sacrifices. Nike participated in the retail event with releases of the KD 9 \"Dark Obsidian\" and Air Foamposite Pro \"Dr. Doom\" but one of its outlet locations was unfortunately overturned by a mass of frenzied shoppers. The Nike outlet at Seattle Premium Outlets was utterly destroyed when people came and simply left the merchandise on the floor. As a result, obstacle courses of orange sneaker boxes filled the aisles leaving employees and other shoppers completely overwhelmed.

      "text": "Too Soon? Nike Puts Limited-Edition Hypervenom Rooney Boots On Sale Sunday, November 27, 2016 Sunday, November 27, 2016 As we've been made aware of by a few people, the limited-edition Nike Hypervenom Phinish boots designed to celebrate Wayne Rooney becoming Manchester United all-time top goal scorer are available to buy only at Nike. The whole thing looks like an error from Nike's side, both because Rooney is not yet the club's topscorer - he has 248 to Bobby Charlton's 249 - and because they simply where to not officially unveiled yet. It looks like this won't be the case until Rooney has hit 250 as that's the number mentioned on gold logo present both on the cleats and the bag that comes with it. Either way, if you want to get your hands on a possibly rare item early, you can head to Nike.com now to grab yours. Please note that the boots are not available on all country sites (examples include Canada, Norway and South Africa), but Nike offers worldwide shipping anyway.

      "text": "The Nike Air Cruz, also known as the Nike signature shoe of NFL star Victor Cruz made its debut close to a year and a half ago. Were finishing of the year 2016 and Nike is still dishing out new colorways of the inaugural model. No word yet on when or if the Air Cruz 2 is in the works, but in the mean time we’re all getting ready for the Nike Air Cruz Black Suede to drop.\nReleasing next Friday for $150, the Nike Air Cruz Black Suede keeps thing simple and easy. It starts off with a Black suede upper with woven textile detailing around the ankle and heel. The all-black upper is broken up by the White midsole/outsole as well as the White speckling on the laces. The strap on the midfoot and the branding on the tongue also come in Black. Are you a fan of the model? Will you be picking these up?\nvia: Renarts \nAuthor’s Take In my opinion, the Air Cruz was lakcing the wow factor. It’s too similar to trainers we’ve seen from Nike in the past. Not sure if it sold well this past year and a half, but I’d be surprised if an Air Cruz 2 is in the works.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post We’re Less Than A Week Away From The Release Of The Nike Air Cruz Black Suede appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "La Salle cross country star DJ Principe captures Nike regional gold Saturday Nov 26, 2016 at 7:04 PM Bill Koch Journal Sports Writer BillKoch25 \nDJ Principe collected yet another regional gold medal and several of his fellow Rhode Island runners enjoyed strong showings of their own at a pair of cross country meets in New York on Saturday. \nThe La Salle senior set a new course record while dusting the field at the 2016 Nike Cross Regional Championships, blazing to a winning time of 15 minutes, 18 seconds on the Bowdoin Park course in Wappingers Falls. Principe became the first high school runner to event crack the 15:20 mark on the 3.1-mile layout, with New Jersey’s Jordan Brannan closing a distant second in 15:51.8. \nIt was the latest honor for the Stanford signee, who became the first boy to win three Interscholastic League state titles and followed with a second New England Championships gold earlier this fall. Principe closed third at the Nike meet last year, moving up two spots and living up to his top-5 national ranking. \nRams teammate Max Dimuccio finished 20th in 16:28.5, the top freshman in the elite field. Barrington’s Mars Bishop (38th) also cracked the top 50, crossing the line in 16:45.8. \nWesterly’s Randi Burr made a mark of her own on the girls side in the Nike meet, hitting the line 17th in 19:15.3. Burr is wrapping up a strong fall season of her own, as she added All-Region honors to state meet silver and a fifth-place finish in the New England Championships. The Portsmouth sophomore duo of Elizabeth Sullivan (30th) and Nikki Merrill each placed in the top 50 for the Patriots. \nNorth Kingstown’s girls claimed the team title in the second-tier Nike Northeast Open ranks. Wyndom Chace (seventh) was the top finisher for the Skippers, who also counted Lily Nunnery, Jamie Hazel, Julia Martone and Katy Brayman among their scorers. \nThe Foot Locker Cross Country Northeast Regional brought more recognition for the state thanks to South Kingstown’s Ellie Lawler, the returning All-American and Rebels’ junior star. Lawler closed 12th in 18:29.5 at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, one of just 13 runners to crack the 18:30 mark on the 3.1-mile course. New Jersey’s Alyssa Aldridge was one of just three girls to dip under 18:00, hitting the line in a winning 17:40.3. \nbkoch@providencejournal.com",

Shoppers leave Nike store trashed 7:11 PM, Nov 26, 2016 41 mins ago Share Article A Nike outlet store in Washington offered eye-popping images from Black Friday 2016. (nicoololz/Instagram)   \nA Nike outlet store near Seattle, Washington offered some of the most astonishing images from Black Friday 2016 as shoppers left hundreds of opened shoe boxes strewn across the floor. \nAccording to BuzzFeed , more than 20,000 people visited the Nike factory store at the Seattle Premium outlets in Tulalip, Washington on Friday. But while hundreds presumably walked away with a new pair of kicks, many changed their minds after trying a pair on. \nBy the end of the day, the shoe aisles in the store had been transformed into rivers of orange shoe boxes, forcing customers to wade through the piles of cardboard to get through the store. \nAccording to BuzzFeed, one store employee called the situation “Jurassic Park crazy,” and added that it “bothered” him to see kids and adults alike pull items out without putting them back, and kicking things aside with little to no regard. \nSee the astounding images from the store via social media posts below. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST",

Buy Photo \nPittsford Mendon's Nathan Lawler (Photo: KATE MELTON) \nIn the misty rain along the Hudson River, Vestri (eighth in her race, in 18 minutes, 24 seconds), junior Nathan Lawler of Pittsford Mendon (second, 15:44.4) and senior Paul Dellinger of Brighton (fifth, 15:49.7) all tamed the famed Bowdoin Park course for top-five individual finishes at the 10th annual Nike regional race. Vestri made it because three girls ahead of her were from team champion Fayetteville-Manlius, the top-ranked team in the country. Buy Photo \nPaul Dellinger, Brighton (Photo: KATE MELTON) \n“I warmed up with her,” said Vestri’s brother, Justin, a sophomore at Canisius College. “She’s worked her heart out for this, and I just told her ‘this one is yours. You’ve got it.’ ” \nLawler led all but the last 600 meters, relinquishing his lead in the lower loop of the course. “I can’t be unhappy,” he said. “If I had the race to run all over again, I’d probably run it the same way. I took it out early because the pace felt slow. But 4:56 first mile? That surprises me.” \nDellinger, who has run a close second to Lawler all season, said he enjoyed matching up against the state’s best. \n“There are so many incredibly good runners ... this has to be my best race of the season, easily.” \nTheir finishes extend the streak to nine straight years of at least one Rochester-area runner qualifying for Nike nationals. Lawler and Dellinger are the ninth and 10th boys to go individually, Vestri the ninth girl. \nAnna Kostarellis of Churchville-Chili was 12th in 18:48.3 while Rush-Henrietta senior Sammy Watson, who had an exceptional 18:27.3 third-place finish here a week ago at Federations, struggled to finish 20th, more than 38 seconds slower than last week. \nAt the Foot Locker regionals in The Bronx, Penfield teammates Tyler Senall (36th) and Brad Farnham (43rd) led a large contingent of Section V entrants, most of whom competed in the class races. Penfield’s Jacob Fredericks won the freshman race in 17:26 on the VanCortlandt Park course. \nJim Castor, retired assistant sports editor of the Democrat and Chronicle , has covered cross country and road racing in the Rochester area for more than five decades.

The brand's biggest active endorser, LeBron James, was also in attendance. Image via Joe Maiorana USA Today Sports",

      "text": "Liverpool's Ty Brownlow won the Nike NXN New York Northeast regional cross country race on Saturday. By Pat Spadafore | pspadafore@syracuse.com comments \nLiverpool's Ty Brownlow won the Nike NXN boys New York/Northeast regional cross country race on Saturday at Bowdoin Park, Wappingers Falls on Saturday. \nThe Manlius XC team won the team championship. As a result, both Manlius XC and Liverpool are returning to the Nike National competition on December 3rd in Portland, Oregon. This will be the 11th appearance for the Manlius XC and the fourth straight trip for Liverpool. \n\"Our goal was to stick to our plan of getting our fourth and fifth runners to step up and finish strong for this big race,\" said Brownlow. \"There were a few people that felt we weren't going to go on to the nationals this year and that was certainly motivation enough for us.\" \nBrownlow, who said the Liverpool team has trained especially hard this year, blazed the trail in 5K trail in 15:42.2, followed by fellow senior teammates Stevie Schulz in third place overall, with a time of 15:55.4, and Josh Hickmott in ninth at 16:14.7. The fourth and fifth place runners Brownlow eluded to were for Liverpool were junior Emil Videman and sophomore Dawson Newbern . Videman placed 35 and Newbern 99th. Liverpool finished with a second place score of 145. \nManlius XC, who lost to Liverpool in last year's regional qualifier, turned in a winning team total of 114 points. Seniors Patrick Perry (16:06.3) and Joseph Walters (16:17.3) finished seventh and ninth respectively while junior Ben Otis (16:41.1) and senior Jack Boltman (16:59.6) place in the twenty's at 21st and 29. Manlius XC's important fifth place finisher was sophomore Matt Tripp (17:19.1), who finished in 48th place. \nSection III finishers:",

      "text": "Mike Julianelle Nov 27, 2016 Black Friday was not kind to a Nike outlet that got demolished by overzealous shoppers \nEvery year on Black Friday it seems there are a handful of stories that make capitalism seem like a bad idea. Usually the issue is shopper-on-shopper violence, but at a Nike store in Washington state, the issue was violence against the store itself. \nA story on BuzzFeed News details the carnage that resulted when shoppers stormed the Nike store within the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington. \nAs evidenced by this picture that was taken before the Black Friday sale kicked off, it’s typically a pretty well-organized store. A photo posted by Northwest Kicks (@northwest.kicks) on Nov 20, 2016 at 9:59am PST \nIt didn’t take long for excited consumers to lay waste to the wide variety of Nike goods and apparel. To the dismay of employees and customers alike. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \nWell, holy shit. \nOne local resident thought he’d swing by for a quick purchase of basketball shoes for his kids, but when Larry Downder entered the shop, he was shocked. \n“I thought there was an earthquake that happened,” he told BuzzFeed \nApparently bargain-hungry customers were tearing boxes off the shelves, hunting for deals with seemingly no regard for anything else. I hate people. pic.twitter.com/bPfFwqFbn4 \n— Iram (@IramFlorCamacho) November 25, 2016 \nBuzzFeed spoke to another customer who’d aired his grievances on Twitter, and elaborated for the site. “Seeing little kids kicking things to the side with disregard — that kinda bothered me,” said SimpBoyJ (@CJibbs). “As parents were swimming through it, the kids had the same reaction.” \nA photo posted by Guillaume Le (@le_lamer) on Nov 25, 2016 at 8:54pm PST \n“We start walking through from aisle to aisle, and you’re walking over orange boxes everywhere,” Downer said. “People were just kicking stuff out of the way.” \nOne store worker told BuzzFeed that an estimated 20,000 people made their way into the store during the Black Friday hours, which ran from 8pm Thanksgiving night to 10pm Friday. That makes sense. It was either an insane amount of people or the trio of monsters in the old Rampage arcade game. Although they’d probably have to custom-order their sneakers, like Shaq. A video posted by Tristan (Tran) (@iamtvoo) on Nov 25, 2016 at 10:34pm PST \nThat sounds like a joke, except one employee actually compared the scene to a famous blockbuster movie. “People were not putting anything back in the right place at all the whole time we were open,” the employee said, calling the whole scene “Jurassic Park crazy.” \nOne thing is for sure, Black Friday really brings out the monster in far too many of us.",

      "text": "The Dow enjoyed another week of substantial gains following optimism about Donald Trump’s policy proposals. Meanwhile, economic data released over most of the week was encouraging. Oil prices moved higher following speculation that OPEC’s member countries and Russia were close to reaching an agreement on curtailing crude output. Additionally, prospects of the Fed hiking rates in December continued to improve.\nLast Week’s Performance\nThe Dow decreased 0.2% last Friday after rising rate hike possibilities boosted the dollar to its best settlement in 13 years. Rate hike chances gained momentum following expectations that the Trump Presidency will adopt new policies including expansionary infrastructure spending and tax cuts.\nSooner than expected rate hike chances boosted the dollar. According to Fact Set, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) settled at its best level since April 2003. Rising dollar weighed on export-based large-cap companies and eventually on broader markets. Moreover, oil prices fell after Baker Hughes Incorporated BHI reported that U.S. oil rig counts experienced its biggest increase in 16 months.\nThe index increased 0.1% over last week. Most of last week’s gains came on the back of encouraging domestic economic data and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s testimony. Yellen indicated that a rate hike after next month’s policy meeting was definitely on the table.\nThe Dow This Week\nThe index increased 0.5% on Monday following strong surge in oil prices and sell-off in the dollar. Oil prices jumped following speculations that major OPEC members and Russia were likely to reach a deal to curtail crude production by the end of this month. Moreover, countries like Iraq and Iran, who were previously unwilling to limit crude production, also backed the deal.\nSeparately, the dollar fell yesterday primarily because the greenback became vulnerable to a sell-off after registering a rapid increase over the last ten sessions. Thin trading ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday also weighed on the greenback.\nThe index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following rising expectations from Donald Trump’s policy proposals and encouraging housing data. The Dow moved past the psychological levels of 2,200. Markets moved up following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies, including expansionary infrastructure spending, environmental and financial deregulation and tax cuts.\nMoreover, Trump said that bilateral trade deals will be negotiated in order to “bring jobs and industry back onto American shores. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.60 million, to reach the highest annualized rate in more than nine years.\nThe index increased 0.3% on Wednesday after strong durable orders and Donald Trump’s economic agenda boosted the industrial sector. The Dow reached a record high level for the third straight session following continued expectations that Trump will adopt new policies to improve the economy. Moreover, orders for durable goods in the U.S. registered its best increase in a year.\nFurther, minutes from the Fed’s November meeting showed that following labor market improvements and higher inflation, policy makers were in agreement that interest rates should be raised \"relatively soon\". Markets were closed on Thursday following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.\nComponents Moving the Index\nNIKE, Inc. NKE announced a 13% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 18 cents per share. The new dividend, applicable for Nike’s Class A and B shares, will be paid on Jan 3, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Dec 5, 2016. Notably, this represents the company’s fifteenth consecutive year of dividend hike, further underscoring its healthy cash flows and robust potential.\nAdditionally, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Nike repurchased 19 million shares for $1.1 billion in the last reported quarter, under its $12 billion share repurchase program approved in Nov 2015. With this, the company had repurchased about 39 million shares for roughly $2.2 billion under the program. (Read: NIKE (NKE) Hikes Dividend, Bolsters Shareholders' Confidence )\nThe Boeing Company BA and Textron Inc.’s TXT strategic joint venture (JV) Bell-Boeing’s – wholly owned subsidiary Bell Helicopter – recently secured a modification contract worth $267.3 million. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 2018. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3.\nPer the terms of the deal, the JV will offer additional joint performance-based logistic support to the Marine Corps MV-22 and the Air Force and Special Operations Command CV-22 jets.

      "text": "Mike Julianelle Nov 27, 2016 Black Friday was not kind to a Nike outlet that got demolished by overzealous shoppers \nEvery year on Black Friday it seems there are a handful of stories that make capitalism seem like a bad idea. Usually the issue is shopper-on-shopper violence, but at a Nike store in Washington state, the issue was violence against the store itself. \nA story on BuzzFeed News details the carnage that resulted when shoppers stormed the Nike store within the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington. \nAs evidenced by this picture that was taken before the Black Friday sale kicked off, it’s typically a pretty well-organized store. A photo posted by Northwest Kicks (@northwest.kicks) on Nov 20, 2016 at 9:59am PST \nIt didn’t take long for excited consumers to lay waste to the wide variety of Nike goods and apparel. To the dismay of employees and customers alike. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \nWell, holy shit. \nOne local resident thought he’d swing by for a quick purchase of basketball shoes for his kids, but when Larry Downder entered the shop, he was shocked. \n“I thought there was an earthquake that happened,” he told BuzzFeed \nApparently bargain-hungry customers were tearing boxes off the shelves, hunting for deals with seemingly no regard for anything else. I hate people. pic.twitter.com/bPfFwqFbn4 \n— Iram (@IramFlorCamacho) November 25, 2016 \nBuzzFeed spoke to another customer who’d aired his grievances on Twitter, and elaborated for the site. “Seeing little kids kicking things to the side with disregard — that kinda bothered me,” said SimpBoyJ (@CJibbs). “As parents were swimming through it, the kids had the same reaction.” \nA photo posted by Guillaume Le (@le_lamer) on Nov 25, 2016 at 8:54pm PST \n“We start walking through from aisle to aisle, and you’re walking over orange boxes everywhere,” Downer said. “People were just kicking stuff out of the way.” \nOne store worker told BuzzFeed that an estimated 20,000 people made their way into the store during the Black Friday hours, which ran from 8pm Thanksgiving night to 10pm Friday. That makes sense. It was either an insane amount of people or the trio of monsters in the old Rampage arcade game. Although they’d probably have to custom-order their sneakers, like Shaq. A video posted by Tristan (Tran) (@iamtvoo) on Nov 25, 2016 at 10:34pm PST \nThat sounds like a joke, except one employee actually compared the scene to a famous blockbuster movie. “People were not putting anything back in the right place at all the whole time we were open,” the employee said, calling the whole scene “Jurassic Park crazy.” \nOne thing is for sure, Black Friday really brings out the monster in far too many of us.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE) have been slaughtered in 2016, down the most of any Dow (DJIA) stock. Shares have fallen 17.8% to $51.52 this year. The Dow is higher by 9.9% for the same period to 19,152\nNike is no longer the growth stock it once was, although revenue growth is healthy. Recently, it has faced a resurgent Adidas, the second largest company in the category, white-hot Under Armour (NYSE: UA), and China’s Anta Sports Products\nAnother drag on Nike shares are the extent to which athlete endorsers are critical to sales. Nike has the grandfather of these in Michael Jordan, but he is years past his basketball career. Nike competitors have tried to flank it in every sport from soccer to basketball. Large endorsement deals can be work in the tens of millions of dollars.\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter, Nike’s results:\n• Revenues up 8 percent to $9.1 billion; 10 percent growth excluding currency changes*\n• Diluted earnings per share up 9% to $0.73 compared to prior year\n• Worldwide futures orders up 5 percent; 7 percent growth excluding currency changes\n• Inventories as of August 31, 2016 up 11 percent\nWall St. may not consider 10% real growth",

Shoppers leave Nike store trashed 7:11 PM, Nov 26, 2016 2 hours ago Share Article A Nike outlet store in Washington offered eye-popping images from Black Friday 2016. (nicoololz/Instagram) Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Previous Next \nA Nike outlet store near Seattle, Washington offered some of the most astonishing images from Black Friday 2016 as shoppers left hundreds of opened shoe boxes strewn across the floor. \nAccording to BuzzFeed , more than 20,000 people visited the Nike factory store at the Seattle Premium outlets in Tulalip, Washington on Friday. But while hundreds presumably walked away with a new pair of kicks, many changed their minds after trying a pair on. \nBy the end of the day, the shoe aisles in the store had been transformed into rivers of orange shoe boxes, forcing customers to wade through the piles of cardboard to get through the store. \nAccording to BuzzFeed, one store employee called the situation “Jurassic Park crazy,” and added that it “bothered” him to see kids and adults alike pull items out without putting them back, and kicking things aside with little to no regard. \nSee the astounding images from the store via social media posts below. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \n",

      "text": "Nike's self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0 will be released on Dec. 1 and is expected to cost about $720 at retailers, according to Jacques Slade.\n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” a Nike senior innovator said when the shoe was unveiled in March. “Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”\nThe shoes also feature LED lights in the heels that will light up when the shoes are tightening and when they require a battery charge. A full charge can take three hours and lasts about two weeks.\n• NFL producing virtual reality postgame experiences\nThe shoe has been highly anticipated since the idea was featured in Back to the Future II. Nike has previously sold replicas of the film's shoe without the self-lacing technology. Designer Tinker Hatfield sent a prototype of the shoe to Back to the Future star Michael J. Fox.",

      "text": "SOHO, Manhattan — A new Nike store that was expected to be a big hit has instead angered SoHo residents and created a crowding issue in the popular shopping area.\nThe New York Post reported that the 55,000 square-foot store, which opened on Nov. 18, has been drawing large and unruly crowds that clog sidewalks and block store entrances.\nA number of SoHo residents are fed up with the new neighborhood nuisance at Broadway and Spring Street.\nThe Post quoted longtime SoHo resident Pete Davies, who said he heard “crazy screaming” and described the scene as “a nightclub” around 11:30 a.m. on the store’s opening day.\n“I was sitting in my [home] office with the windows closed when all of a sudden I heard all this crazy screaming,” Davies told the Post . “It looked like a nightclub, not a store. There were big guys like bouncers out front yelling and pushing people.”\n“It was a ridiculous mess. One of the most disruptive events of this type I’ve ever seen,” Davies said.\nA doorman at a nearby Broadway building told the Post crowds blocked sidewalks in the area and even building entrances across the street from their sportswear destination.\nNike has reportedly assured neighbors that they have a “crowd control” plan in place, according to the Post . Locals said they have not seen any measures put into place.\nThe store is an outlet which sells exclusive shoe designs and features a digital interactive basketball court. Another feature is Nike’s “Swoosh Saturdays” which are another concern for SoHo residents. These “Swoosh” events reportedly attract large crowds since they typically feature a celebrity guest or an athletic event, and neighbors said they dread these events because of the potential for an even bigger disturbance.\nConstruction began on the store two years ago, and SoHo residents have resisted it every step of the way. Despite a zoning law that limits retailers to 10,000 square feet, the Nike store was able to build a 55,000 square-foot store due to a loophole in which city officials considered the project a building “alteration,” the Post reported.\nDepartment of Buildings spokesperson Joseph Soldevere told the Post the project was reviewed “numerous times” and was determined to have “complied with the NYC Construction Codes.”\nAccording to CurbedNY , the controversial store was supposed to open on Veteran’s Day, but was delayed due to a rescinded DOB permit and protest from the neighborhood.\nCity leaders joined the protest , calling the new store a burden to an already over-saturated shopping area and a threat to the historic character of the neighborhood.\nThe DOB reportedly wanted to review the building’s electrical and plumbing systems before allowing the store to open.\n40.723041 -73.998786 ",

      "text": "Ibrahimovic Makes Yet Another SURPRISE Boot Switch   Having worn Nike Mercurial Vapor X boots in the midweek clash against Feyenoord, Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was back in Adidas cleats in Sunday's Premier League game against West Ham United. But whereas he earlier opted for the X 16.1 and 16+ PureChaos editions, he laced up in yet another three-stripe boot now. Embed from Getty Images Making the switch from the synthetic to the leather edition of the Adidas X 16.1 boots, Ibrahimovic found the net early on to tie the game. The Adidas X 16.1 Leather cleats worn by Ibrahimovic fade from black at the front to red at the back, reverting the style of the synthetic edition. They combine kangaroo leather in the forefoot with synthetic leather at the back to create a modern boot. Read more about them and get a closer look here . Share your thoughts below.",

Yikes.\" \n\nThe wake of consumerism at the #Nike Factory Store is savage. Found Davis some basketball shoes, saved a lady from... \n\nDowner told BuzzFeed News that he went to the store to buy basketball sneakers for his son. \n\"I thought there was an earthquake that happened,\" he said. \"It was unreal ...

      "text": "Yesterday was rivalry weekend in college football and one would assume that Nike founder Phil Knight would attend the game between his alma mater Oregon Ducks and their in-state rivals Oregon State. But that wasn’t the case.\nInstead, Knight was in attendance at the nail-biting Ohio State vs. Michigan game that saw the Buckeyes win a thriller 30-27 in overtime. He even made a special pit stop into the winner’s locker room after the game to give some words to the team, and you know he had to mention Nike in one way or another.\nThe Legend RT @OhioStateFB : Proof that @Nike + #Buckeyes = \nThank you Phil Knight for stopping by and saying hi! pic.twitter.com/mheXQLGClk \n— Joel Hall (@JHall886) November 26, 2016 \n\nAnother pretty cool note from this game is that Oho State is a Nike school, and has been for quite some time now, and were laced up with a special cleat version of the LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 . And they faced Michigan, who was formerly an adidas school and switched over to Jordan Brand this year. So in essence it was also a Nike vs. Jordan Brand game.\nh/t: SB Nation \n\nThe post Phil Knight Attends Ohio State vs. Michigan Instead Of Oregon Game Yesterday appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Converse (6% of sales) Global Brand Divisions (1% of sales) Within the Nike brand (excluding Converse), the company is diversified geographically. The brand has a significant international presence: North America (48% of sales) Europe (26% of sales) Greater China (12% of sales) Japan (3% of sales) Emerging Markets (11% of sales) The company's operational strategies have yielded tremendous results. It has added nearly $10 billion of new revenue in just the past five fiscal years. Click to enlarge (Source: Fiscal 2016 Annual Report , page 7) Reaching double-digit annualized revenue growth in a slow-growth global economy is a major accomplishment that few companies can boast. In fiscal 2016, Nike's revenue growth slowed somewhat to 6% for the year. Investors seem disappointed by this, which would explain the declining share price. But going forward, there is a very good chance the company can return to double-digit revenue growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations weighed down revenue last year. The strong U.S. dollar may ease going forward. And Nike is making great progress in new business areas to drive future growth. Growth Prospects Going forward, Nike's growth prospects remain strong. The company has a proven ability to generate very high returns on capital. Click to enlarge (Source: Fiscal 2016 Annual Report, page 7) This means not only does Nike succeed at growing sales, but it also translates a high portion of its sales into profits for shareholders. And the company has expanded return on invested capital by more than seven percentage points in the past five years. Two huge growth catalysts for Nike are women's apparel and e-commerce. First, while the company has traditionally catered to the men's apparel segment, women's apparel is a booming area. In fiscal 2016, Nike saw double-digit growth across its men's, women's, and young athletes' businesses. But the women's business was the best performer, with a 17% sales growth rate last year. Second, e-commerce is also an emerging growth area. Consumers are increasingly gravitating to online retail for the convenience of at-home shopping and delivery. Nike is responding to this changing consumer landscape by investing aggressively in its digital platforms. In fiscal 2016, Nike.com grew 51% year over year. The company expanded its reach to an additional 20 countries during the year, and is now present in more than 40 countries across the world. Competitive Advantages and Recession Performance The company's first competitive advantage is its brand strength. According to Forbes , Nike has the 18th most valuable brand in the world. Nike's brand, including the classic \"swoosh\" logo, are worth $27.5 billion. When consumers think of shoes, they think of Nike. The company's brand strength is a huge competitive advantage, as it has allowed Nike to successfully take market share across a number of other apparel product categories. It maximizes its competitive advantages through advertising. Nike spends more than $3 billion each year in advertising. Very few competitors can match this level of advertising, which gives the company high rates of consumer retention and brand awareness. These competitive advantages provide Nike with consistent profitability. At first glance, one might think it is highly vulnerable to recessions. High-end, premium apparel is a natural choice for consumers to cut back on when times are tight. However, that is not actually the case. Nike's earnings per share through the Great Recession are shown below: 2007 Earnings per share of $0.72 2008 Earnings per share of $0.86 (19.4% increase) 2009 Earnings per share of $0.88 (2.3% increase) 2010 Earnings per share of $0.97 (10.2% increase) It is very impressive for an apparel company to grow earnings per share each year throughout the Great Recession. Valuation and Expected Total Return One positive about Nike's share price decline this year is that it has brought the stock back down to a reasonable valuation. NKE now trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 . This is cheaper than the S&P 500 Index, which has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 25. It seems Nike stock is undervalued. The company deserves a premium valuation, given its high growth rates. Aside from expansion of the price-to-earnings ratio, future shareholder returns will be comprised of the following factors: 8-10% revenue growth",

Today we get a look at what happens when the Swoosh revamps the Talaria imprint for winter, with a functional take on Flyknit, bolstered boot-inspired lace eyelets, and a revamped weather resistant upper in three upcoming colorways. \nKnown as the Nike Talaria Mid Flyknit , speckled midsoles retain the original look of the ’97 Talaria while the extended mid-top helps protect your feet from the winter elements. Three colorways range from a ‘Triple White’ with additional metallic gold lace eyelets, a ‘Triple Black’, and a more boot-inspired look featuring Brown/Black and a vibrant pop of light blue as the lace option. \nCheck out more of NSW’s latest winter offering below and we’ll keep you updated on a release date in the coming days right here on Sneaker News.

Show Caption Previous Next \nA Nike outlet store near Seattle, Washington offered some of the most astonishing images from Black Friday 2016 as shoppers left hundreds of opened shoe boxes strewn across the floor. \nAccording to BuzzFeed , more than 20,000 people visited the Nike factory store at the Seattle Premium outlets in Tulalip, Washington on Friday. But while hundreds presumably walked away with a new pair of kicks, many changed their minds after trying a pair on. \nBy the end of the day, the shoe aisles in the store had been transformed into rivers of orange shoe boxes, forcing customers to wade through the piles of cardboard to get through the store. \nAccording to BuzzFeed, one store employee called the situation “Jurassic Park crazy,” and added that it “bothered” him to see kids and adults alike pull items out without putting them back, and kicking things aside with little to no regard. \nSee the astounding images from the store via social media posts below. \nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \n",

      "text": "· Equipment (4.6% of revenue) \nShare price underperformance \nThe share price has been underperforming quite a bit since late 2015 after years of generating great returns for shareholders. While it seems that the number of investors that are pessimistic about Nike is growing, I believe that this brief period of weakness has created a good buying opportunity. \nAlthough Nike's share price keeps on trading in a downtrend, the company's results are following another trend. People seem to forget that despite Nike's enormous size, it still keeps growing. The most recent quarter even showed a revenue growth of 7.7% YoY to a total of $9.06 bln. At the same time, gross margin declined after years of expansion. It looks like a lot of people seem to think this is a good reason to stay away from this stock or even opening a short position despite the fact that management has already explained that this is the result of shifting costs from operating overhead to cost of goods sold. Besides, management even guided for gross margin expansion over the course of the current fiscal year. This would be partly as a result of higher average selling prices and ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives. \nGenerating revenue growth \nDespite certain lacking results, we have seen over the past few quarters, management is still focused on generating long-term growth. One current source of strong revenue growth that will continue to perform well in the future is Greater China, where Nike saw its revenue grow to over $1 bln in the most recent quarter vs. less than $0.9 bln a year ago. Besides Greater China, Europe and Japan have also been performing well. Nike still has much room to grow in these regions with Greater China being the region that is seen as having the most growth potential. If the company plays this right, it could be driving revenue growth for years to come. \nOther than focusing on certain regions to grow its revenue, Nike is also focusing on the increasing popularity of technology among consumers. An example of this is the partnership it has with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Earlier this year, the Apple Watch Nike+ was announced. Sports and tech seem to be a great match and in the past few years we have seen more and more tech products to help people lead healthier lives. The increasing importance of apps and wearable tech combined with sports is something that a big name like Nike could most certainly benefit from. Therefore, it is good to see management looking to capitalize on this upcoming industry. \nWhen it comes to Nike, we definitely cannot forget marketing. This is one of the areas of expertise and plays a huge part in maintaining and expanding its market share. A lot of money is spent on advertising and sponsoring, which generates a lot of return on investment and will continue to do so. \nTherefore, I believe that Nike itself is definitely not falling behind in any way despite what many investors seem to think. The management has proved to be more than capable of spotting opportunities for growth and adjusting its business when necessary. Besides the fact that Nike is a brand that is known around the world and has a leading market position, it still has more than enough space to grow its market share. For example, its leading segment, Footwear, only has a global market share of about 10%. Nike has a lot of great ideas and a lot of market share to capture. My expectations are therefore that Nike will continue its strong financial performance in the upcoming years. \nShare repurchase program \nManagement itself too seems to have a lot of confidence in Nike's prospects. In November 2015, a share buyback program worth $12 bln was announced. Since this announcement, a total of $2.2 bln worth of shares have been repurchased. This leaves almost $10 bln in the program. The market cap of Nike's stock is currently about $86 bln. That means that, according to the plan, Nike intends to buy up well over 10% of its shares. This is a great way to show investors that management has confidence in Nike's success. \nValuation \nI have made a simple DCF model to quickly check for an indication of where Nike's share price should be trading at. Of course, this is not perfect, but it does help to check if there is a reasonable upside potential or if the stock is perhaps already reasonably priced. \nFor expected revenue growth, I have chosen 8% for the next three years to reflect the growth opportunities in the near future and the companies' own guidance of fiscal-year 2017. After that, I have two years of just 6% and two years of 5% growth to reflect the uncertainty of further strong revenue growth. After that, I brought it down to 2.50%. The FCF yield of revenue is 7.50% - the average of the past few years. WACC is 5.24%. \nClick to enlarge \nThis would give us a price target of about $66 per share compared to the current price of $51 per share, which happens to be around the all-time high of the stock. Additionally, this would mean upside potential of about 30%. \nRisks \nEven though I believe that Nike's share price is currently undervalued and the future seems to look bright, an investment in this stock of course is not risk-free. Nike enjoys a strong market position, but the competition is definitely something that we have to keep an eye on in the coming years. Earlier in the article, I mentioned the gross margin decline over the past year. The company guided for gross margin expansion this year. If it fails to do so, this could put additional downward pressure on the share price. \nConclusion \nNike's share price currently presents buying opportunity, thanks to the recent weakness. I believe that the current downtrend is partly thanks to an earlier upward price movement that was simply too strong. Although I do believe that the stock looks undervalued at the moment, chances are that we might see additional pressure on the stock in the short term before an upward movement towards the previous high. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NKE over the next 72 hours.    ",

Larry Downer went to the store around 8:15 p.m. to get a pair of shoes for his son. \nBy that time, the store had been open for about 15 hours. He told KCPQ that it looked like an “earthquake leveled the place.” \nDowner’s video showed customers wading through a sea of orange boxes on the ground after merchandise had been picked through and thrown aside. \n\"It's a huge store and it seems like every inch of the floor was covered in merchandise,\" Downer told KCPQ . \"I saw people just tossing stuff around and showing disregard for the store merchandise.\" \nDowner eventually found a pair of shoes for his son. He told the TV station that he found one of the shoes in one aisle and the matching shoe over in the next aisle. \nHe described the staff as looking “overwhelmed and tired.” \nThe store closed a few hours later at midnight and reopened at 5 a.m. Saturday. 48.068429 -122.291809 ",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 at 09:56 AM EST Nike Becomes #13 Most Shorted Dow Stock, Replacing General Electric The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average by \"days to cover.\" There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "text": "Loading... \nNike Sportswear is dabbling in all kinds of archival models from 1997 to prep the 20th anniversary of a number of silhouettes from the Foamposite line to the likes of the Spiridon, and even the cult-classic Talaria. The latest updated ’97 model will be an oft-forgotten trail creation known as the Nike ACG Terra Albis . The short-lived Terra Albis featured Zoom Air and a number of interesting panels that alternated between a synthetic suede and sports mesh for an aggressive style perfect for casual and trail use, and today three new colorways showcase NSW’s ability to add new technology while retaining some of the old features that made the ACG Terra Albis stand out. \nAn updated slip-on construction adds a new comfortable fit while a ventilated fuse is accented by premium leather panels on the toe and heel to increase durability while shedding some weight for a modernized fit. So far, three colorways have been previewed ranging from an OG inspired purple and orange, a simple black and grey, and a standout sandy tan and gum. Check out more detailed photos of the coming Nike ACG Terra Albis rework below and let us know which colorway is your favorite by taking your thoughts to the comments section. Release info coming soon. Nike ACG Terra Albis ",

A photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST \nThe sale kicked off (pun intended) 8 p.m. Thanksgiving and ran through 10 p.m. Friday. An anonymous employee told Buzzfeed that an estimated 20,000 customers came through the shop. \n\"I thought there was an earthquake that happened,\" Seattle resident Larry Downer told BuzzFeed News. \"It was unreal.\" \nWe hope those retail workers were adequately compensated for cleaning up after the opening of the gates of hell.

      "text": "By Dylan Kickham 26 minutes ago \nBlack Friday has reared its ugly head yet again this weekend, reminding all of us that deep down, people are all really just rage-filled greed monsters who will trample you to get a discounted TV. But the biggest casualty of this year's Black Friday --- aside from just hope for humanity in general --- was one shoe store in Washington. \nTake a look at the poor, unassuming, organized shelves of the Nike outlet store in Tulalip, Washington a few days before Black Friday. Take a moment to soak in the rows of beautifully organized orange boxes, all neatly stacked on top of one another, with no idea of the carnage and chaos about to befall them. A photo posted by Northwest Kicks (@northwest.kicks) on Nov 20, 2016 at 9:59am PST \nAnd now, feast your eyes on what those once-pristine aisles looked like after the Black Friday hurricane this weekend. The store uploaded a photo of shoeboxes strewn across their floors as customers trampled over them and added to the mess. A photo posted by Northwest Kicks (@northwest.kicks) on Nov 26, 2016 at 1:44pm PST \nYep, that's the aisle of a shoe store, not some trash-filled back alley. An employee at the store told Buzzfeed News that an estimated 20,000 people stampeded through the store to make the most of its Black Friday deals . One customer named Larry Downer came into the Nike store to buy a pair of basketball shoes for his son, but instead of a normal, functioning shoe store, he found himself in the middle of an apparent natural disaster. \nI thought there was an earthquake that happened. It was unreal. We start walking through from aisle to aisle, and you're walking over orange boxes everywhere. People were just kicking stuff out of the way. \nDowner recorded a video of the post-apocalyptic scene, which shows customers picking through the sea of boxes as one woman attempts to wade through the towering pile cardboard. \nThe wake of consumerism at the #Nike Factory Store is savage. Found Davis some basketball shoes, saved a lady from drowning in a sea of orange boxes, and sprained my neck from shaking my head so much. Yikes. #welldoneamerica #savages #cleanuponaisleeverywhere For licensing/usage, please contact licensing@rumble.com. Posted by Larry Downer on Friday, November 25, 2016 \nYikes, it looks like a city in an Avengers movie after the big fight. Well, hopefully the Nike outlet is in much better shape by now, although it looks like it might take more than a couple days to even be able to see the floor again.

I feel bad for the people who need to clean this up. #BlackFriday #NikeOutletStore\nA photo posted by Wannie Rodriguez (@wanniemation) on Nov 25, 2016 at 11:57pm PST\n黑色星期五來outlet 買個東西nike可以狂成這樣\nA video posted by Chuang Louis (@chuanglouis) on Nov 26, 2016 at 2:17pm PST\nThe #carnage when people #blackfriday too hard for #nike #shoes....Stay safe and sane everyone.\nA photo posted by Nicole 🦄😈🐯 (@nicoololz) on Nov 25, 2016 at 5:10pm PST\nBuzzfeed reported that around 20,000 people visited the store between 8:00 p.m. Thursday and 10:00 p.m. on Friday.\nPhotos show sneakers removed from their orange boxes and piled high on the floor, clothes thrown about and shoppers having to kick boxes just to walk down aisles.\n#afterthanksgiving#nike#messed#war #crazy\nA video posted by Try (@waiicindy) on Nov 26, 2016 at 10:28pm PST\nNovember Madness in Nike Store :( :( #BlackFriday\nA photo posted by Ju Par (@jjd4giftlife) on Nov 27, 2016 at 9:46pm PST\nShopper Larry Downer, who was just hoping to buy his son some basketball shoes, shared his experience in the store on Facebook.\nHe described the scene as \"savage,\" explaining he \"saved a lady from drowning in a sea of orange boxes\" and even sprained his neck from shaking his head so frequently.\nA representative from Nike told Mashable that after despite the large number of shoppers on Black Friday, \"the store was back in order on Saturday morning.\"\nThat impressive feat must have taken some serious hustle.\nBONUS: Nike’s self-lacing sneakers are on their way, but they ain’t cheap",

This year, he’s dressing up his ninth Nike in a colorway that is as sweet as cranberry sauce. The Nike KD 9 is easy on the eyes as is, but for their release this Christmas they are dripping in deep burgundy. The Flyknit upper goes uninterrupted over the course of the entire build and KD 35 flies high on the tongue to let you know whose shoe it is. Bronze accents along with infrared elements on the lining and Zoom outsole help give the pair the appropriate amount of pop in the end. You can look for the KD 9 ‘Christmas’ to hit Nike retailers on December 15. Nike \n20 Best Sneakers For Summer 2016",

      "text": "Tiger Woods debuts latest Nike shoe in return to golf By Twitter Nike has dropped out of the golf equipment business, but the Swoosh plans on staying relevant in the sport. Rory McIlroy continues to wear Nike apparel, and World No. 1 Jason Day reportedly will sign a deal with the Beaverton-based company in the upcoming months. However, despite his absence from the game, Tiger Woods remains Nike's flagship endorser in golf. So it's no surprise that, on the eve of his return, Nike has announced Woods will wear a prototype of his latest signature golf shoe, the Nike TW '17. “This shoe is an absolutely integral part of my return to the sport I love and have missed so much,” Woods said in a statement. “Nike really got in the zone with me. I knew Tobie (Hatfield, Nike senior director of athlete innovation) and I were on to something special back when I tried on the first prototype. I feel supreme support from this shoe which leads to the utmost confidence when I step onto the course.\" The sneaker is more than an aesthetic update. According to Woods, the shoe was designed to fit his new swing, which puts dominance on the right leg rather than the left. Nike said this is accomplished by straps, which are featured over the shoelaces. The strapping system, as well as the rest of the shoe's construction, will keep his feet more secure and locked down. The Nike TW '17 will be available in Spring 2017.",

As one could imagine, upon entry you're surrounded by Nike's version of footwear artifacts from the first Cortez silhouette to the waffle-maker that made the Swoosh's first soles. In addition guests are also introduced to the evolution of Nike's Air Max technology as well as its newest innovations such as the Nike Mag and upcoming Nike Hyperadapt 1.0.\nTake a look at the gallery above to make your way through Nike's DNA and find out more here .\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",
