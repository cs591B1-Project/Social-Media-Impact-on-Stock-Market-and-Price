      "text": "December 07, 2016 at 08:37 AM EST Starbucks Unveils Big Growth Plans For Investor Day \nStarbucks Corporation ( NASDAQ:SBUX ) is hosting its bienniel Investor Day today in New York City, and it will reveal some details about its major plans it hopes will drive growth. \nThe Seattle-based coffee chain hopes to grow revenue by 10%, EPS by 15-20%, and drive mid-single digit comparable store growth each year over the next five years. It plans to achieve those ambitious goals by opening approximately 12,000 new stores around the world by 2021. That massive expansion would bring Starbucks’ total number of locations to 37,000 by 2021. \nIn addition to adding new stores, the company hopes its new upscale Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve concepts can help elevate the Starbucks brand and improve the overall customer experience. \nTechnology is also a big part of Starbucks’ plans for driving growth. The company is promising more innovations within its mobile ecosystem, which has seen widespread adoption through its namesake app that millions of customers use each day. \nSBUX is looking to restore investor confidence after a surprise announcement last week that its long-time CEO, Howard Schultz, will step down in April of next year. While Schultz will remain with the company in a reduced capacity, it remains to be seen if incoming chief executive Kevin Johnson will be able to drive the sort of growth that Schultz became famous for. \nStarbucks shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday at $57.44. Year-to-date, SBUX has fallen 4.31%. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content. You can find full ETF Daily News articles on (www.etfdailynews.com) Related Stocks:",

New stores are slated to open in Seattle, New York and Chicago in 2017 and 2018.\nPrinci's baked goods will also be served in the company's growing group of flagship locations, which Starbucks calls Roasteries. There's currently one in Seattle and the company plans to open Roasteries in Shanghai in 2017 and New York in 2018.\nIn addition to those flagship locations, Starbucks has plans to open around 1,000 Starbucks Reserve stores, which the company bills as \"a new retail format that will integrate the theatre and romance of the Roastery with the unique culinary experience of the company’s new Italian food partner, Princi.\"\nThe announcement comes about a week after news broke of the impending resignation of CEO Howard Schultz , who had emerged during his time at Starbucks as one of the most influential and socially conscious high-profile executives. Schutlz helped build Starbucks from a small, local shop in Seattle to an international giant.\nThe new efforts are part of Starbucks' larger five-year plan, which includes ambitions to open 12,000 new locations around the world.",

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nThe Seattle-based coffee chain hopes to grow revenue by 10%, EPS by 15-20%, and drive mid-single digit comparable store growth each year over the next five years. It plans to achieve those ambitious goals by opening approximately 12,000 new stores around the world by 2021. That massive expansion would bring Starbucks' total number of locations to 37,000 by 2021.\nIn addition to adding new stores, the company hopes its new upscale Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve concepts can help elevate the Starbucks brand and improve the overall customer experience.\nTechnology is also a big part of Starbucks' plans for driving growth. The company is promising more innovations within its mobile ecosystem, which has seen widespread adoption through its namesake app that millions of customers use each day.\nSBUX is looking to restore investor confidence after a surprise announcement last week that its long-time CEO, Howard Schultz, will step down in April of next year. While Schultz will remain with the company in a reduced capacity, it remains to be seen if incoming chief executive Kevin Johnson will be able to drive the sort of growth that Schultz became famous for.\nStarbucks shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday at $57.44. Year-to-date, SBUX has fallen 4.31%.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

      "text": "The creation of the global Starbucks brand we know today has been famously linked to a trip then-marketing director Howard Schultz took to Milan in 1983, when he found inspiration in the local coffee culture. Starbucks later successfully replicated it in the U.S.--and took the brand global.\nNow CEO, Schultz is turning to Milan for new inspiration: Italian bakeries. Starbucks sbux on Wednesday confirmed that it will open standalone Italian bakeries under the Princi name beginning in late 2017. The first Princi Italian bakeries will appear in Seattle, New York City, and Chicago.\n“I’ve traveled the world and I’ve been exposed to great food and great culinary experiences,” Schultz said in a video presentation during the company’s biennial investor presentation. “Of all the great culinary experiences I have had, there are none that come close to what Rocco Princi has done.”\nRocco Princi founded the boutique bakery and caf? back in 1986, though today it only operates just five locations. Starbucks made an unspecified investment in Princi earlier this year, with plans to bring Princi items like focaccia and pizza to Starbucks Roastery locations and the new high-end Reserve store format.\n \nAt those Roastery and Reserve locations, there will be ovens that will be used to bake the breads on-sight--as well as dedicated bakers that will work specifically on the food side while baristas remain focused on coffee. Starbucks is also planning to develop and unveil a special coffee that is intended to pair with Princi foods.\nMany restaurant chains tinker with opening new brand formats--often to mixed results. Starbucks itself has faced challenges on this front. After the company paid $620 million for the Teavana brand in late 2012, it backed off plans to open tea bar locations just a few years later.\nBut the move to open Princi stores is important for Starbucks as it aims to boost revenue that is generated from food, a persistent opportunity that the company hasn’t yet fully capitalized on yet. Today, 74% of revenue is still generated from in-store beverages--while only 19% comes from food. Building out Princi bakeries that will presumably sell more food than drinks can help Starbucks achieve a better balance.",

Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.",

      "text": "Reddit \nPokémon Go is teaming up with Sprint to turn businesses into PokéStops and Gyms as part of Niantic’s latest move to keep players in the game. The news comes just one day before Starbucks is expected to do the same while introducing a Pokémon Go-themed drink for trainers. Niantic has also teased out when we might start seeing new monsters appear in the game. \nAs for the Sprint connection, Niantic says more than 10,500 retail locations including “Sprint, Boost Mobile and Sprint at Radioshack stores will become PokéStops and Gyms, giving you even more places to stock up on Poké Balls and Razz Berries and battle your friends.” \nSprint stores will also promote in-store charging stations for Pokémon Go players, then Sprint will pitch you on their unlimited data plans. That’s the idea at least. \nIf hanging around Sprint stores isn’t your cup of tea, Starbucks is also expected to kick off a similar promotion with Pokémon Go starting tomorrow. \nAccording to leaked training documents shared to Reddit and reported on by The Next Web earlier this week, most Starbucks locations will also become PokéStops and Gyms to encourage trainers to stop in for a drink. \nWhich drink? Starbucks is planning a special Pokémon Go-themed beverage which is basically a vanilla bean frap with raspberry syrup and blackberries mixed in. (Sounds like a mix of delicious and bizarre but I have to admit that I’m curious.) \nFinally, Niantic is teasing out the introduction of more Pokémon (the next 100 are expected) starting next week: \nWhile we cannot share all the details yet, keep an eye out on our social media channels on December 12th for details about the first addition of more Pokémon into Pokémon GO. \nOf course we’re still awaiting Pokémon Go on the Apple Watch. Niantic demoed it at Apple’s iPhone 7/Apple Watch Series 2 event back in September while promising the update will be available by the end of the year. Three and a half weeks to go if they’re making that deadline. \nPokémon Go is available for free on the App Store . Guides",

The Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz , who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. Schultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson . Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. Schultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.",

      "text": "SHARES Mark Ralston | AFP | Getty Images An exterior view of the Starbucks Center, headquarters for the international coffee and coffeehouse chain in Seattle, WA. \nStarbucks said Wednesday it plans to open 12,000 additional stores globally in the next five years, taking the chain to a total of about 37,000 outlets and with half of the new units in the U.S. and China. \n\"Demand is there and our ability to deploy capital and get the return on invested capital is very strong,\" Kevin Johnson, president and COO of Starbucks said at the coffee chain's investor day event in New York. Johnson will become CEO of Starbucks effective April 3, 2017, replacing Howard Schultz in the post. \nThe Seattle-based company also is focusing on both its flagship Starbucks stores and the higher-end Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room outlets, for the future growth. The company also has targeted the Reserve Roastery stores, which will sell premium coffee at around $10 a cup, to represent about one-fifth of total outlets by 2021. \nAlso, Starbucks plans to open new stand-alone outlets under Princi, a high-end Italian bakery the company invested in over the summer. The bakery will serve pizza and have locations in major markets such as New York, Seattle and Chicago by 2018. Also, Princi food is expected to be offered at all of the company's new Roastery locations. \nAt the meeting, Starbucks presented a five-year strategic plan to grow revenue by 10 percent and earnings per share between 15 percent and 20 percent. At the same time, the company targeted \"mid-single digit\" comparable-store sales each year. \n\"We feel we have ample opportunity for growth across the U.S.,\" said John Culver, group president-global retail for Starbucks. He said the company's ongoing expansion domestically has been without any significant cannibalization from new stores. \nCulver also said the company plans to continue expanding the number of drive-thru locations in the U.S.",

      "text": "At Starbucks, CEO Transition Plan Includes Vow Not to Hover -- Update December 07, 2016, 09:48:00   By Joann S. Lublin and Julie Jargon \nIt's good to be the boss -- unless the former boss is looking over your shoulder. \nHoward Schultz, who is relinquishing his role as Starbucks Corp.'s chief executive, says he will truly step back from daily decision-making, unlike the last time he gave up the top job 16 years ago. \nInstead of managing the day-to-day business, Mr. Schultz will stay on as chairman and take on a new project to build luxury coffee shops within Starbucks. \nDuring an investor conference in New York on Wednesday, Starbucks said it plans to grow revenue by 10%, earnings per share by 15% to 20% and same-store sales by a percentage in the mid-single digits in each of the next five years while opening 12,000 new stores globally. \nThe transition plan is fairly unusual in corporate America. More typically, a successful exiting CEO remains board chairman for a transition period that lasts no longer than a year. \nThe handover comes at a pivotal moment for the coffee chain. After many years of posting strong same-store sales growth in its key U.S. market, sales have begun to slow. Starbucks has missed sales targets in the U.S. for four straight quarters, which it says is due to economic uncertainty. It may be years before the new high-end stores have an impact on results. \nKeeping the former CEO hanging around in another operational role is more common at tech start-ups than at large, established companies, experts say. It can succeed if the current and former CEO have distinct areas of expertise, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at Yale School of Management who has written leadership books. \nBut such an arrangement won't work if the company is \"trying to appease\" its former chief, according to George L. Davis Jr., leader of the global CEO practice at executive recruiter Egon Zehnder. Then, \"it usually is a recipe for friction.\" \nPeople who have worked with the 63-year-old Mr. Schultz say he has created a culture in which staffers feel free to disagree with him. \nBut Mr. Schultz, who helped build Starbucks into a global brand, has had a hand in the direction of the business as far back as 1982, when he joined the company as its director of marketing and retail operations. \nOrin Smith, who served as CEO after Mr. Schultz stepped down from running the company in 2000 to focus on opening more stores overseas, said \"we had our share of conflicts\" over issues such as whom to promote and which new countries to enter. But the two executives knew how to collaborate and settled disagreements privately, Mr. Smith said. \nYet, Mr. Schultz also remained highly involved in other major strategic decisions and \"had the last call on all matters,\" Mr. Smith said. \nMr. Smith retired in 2005 and was succeeded by Jim Donald, whom directors fired three years later after the company's sales faltered and traffic at its U.S. stores declined for the first time. Under Mr. Donald, the chain had ventured into selling books, music and movies, which distracted Starbucks from the business of selling coffee. \nIn a 2011 book, Mr. Schultz said his relationship with Mr. Donald became complicated. \"I tried to give him space to do his job by forcing myself to stay out of meetings and keeping some opinions, but not all, to myself,\" Mr. Schultz wrote. He wrote that he had continuing disagreements with Mr. Donald about which people to promote into key roles. Mr. Schultz retook the helm in 2008. \nMr. Donald couldn't be reached for comment. \nMr. Schultz said leaving the CEO post this time will be different. Through a spokesman, he said Mr. Johnson, once he becomes CEO, will have the final call on all company decisions. \nBut pairing a company's visionary with an operations executive doesn't always work out in a CEO handover. \nAt Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., for example, founder and chairman Martha Stewart was appointed chief creative officer when the company elevated operating chief Lisa Gersh to CEO in July 2012. Less than six months later, Ms. Gersh announced plans to resign. Her tenure had been marked by a difficult relationship with Ms. Stewart, people familiar with the company said at that time. \nMessrs. Schultz and Johnson have a close working relationship and a unique friendship, according to people familiar with the matter. The two men, who are known to finish each other's sentences, work in adjacent offices at Starbucks'sSeattle headquarters and plan to continue doing so. \nAnalysts say Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft Corp. executive and CEO of Juniper Networks Inc., has the know-how to oversee the chain's 25,000 stores. \nIn an interview last week, Mr. Schultz credited Mr. Johnson as a co-architect of the strategy of moving upscale. Mr. Schultz, who began talking with Mr. Johnson about becoming CEO this spring, said: \"Our skill base couldn't be more complementary.\" \nWrite to Joann S.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) \nNEW YORK - Starbucks (SBUX) plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50%. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks are up 0.7% in morning trading. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn’t leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz presents during the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day meeting, in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo A woman displays a red Starbucks cup at a Starbucks cafe in Beirut, Lebanon November 20, 2016. REUTERS/Jamal …\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unveiled a five-year growth plan, under which it would open more stores around the world, including several high-end coffee shops, while targeting annual revenue growth of 10 percent.\nThe company said it would add 12,000 stores globally by 2021 and target comparable sales growth in mid-single digits and profit growth of 15-20 percent a year.\nThe world's largest coffee chain also unveiled a new feature within its mobile app that uses voice command or messaging to place orders.\nThe feature will be tested first on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS operating system in early 2017, Starbucks said at its investor conference on Wednesday. \nThe company also plans to open an outlet of its high-end coffee chain, Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, in Europe, bringing the number to five globally.\nDetails of that launch will be announced early next year, the company said.\nStarbucks said last week that Chief Executive Howard Schultz would step down to focus on the company's high-end coffee shops. \nStarbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014, which roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package. \nThe company plans to open a roastery and tasting room in Shanghai next year, followed by launches in Tokyo and New York City in 2018.\nStarbucks also said it would accelerate the opening of Reserve coffee \"bars\" selling premium coffee within Starbucks cafes to 7,400 stores by 2021. The company had set a target of opening these bars in up to 1,000 cafes by the end of 2017.\nStarbucks's revenue has been growing at an average rate of 12.76 percent over the past five years.\nThe company's shares were up marginally at $57.62 in early trading on Wednesday.\n\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent.\nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April.\nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement.\nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn’t leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

Starbucks unveils plans for 12,000 new stores over next 5 years By Jeff Daniels | CNBC – 1 hour 2 minutes ago 57.84 +0.40 Starbucks said Wednesday it plans to open 12,000 additional stores globally in the next five years, taking the chain to a total of about 37,000 outlets and with half of the new units in the U.S. and China. \n\"Demand is there and our ability to deploy capital and get the return on invested capital is very strong,\" Kevin Johnson, president and COO of Starbucks said at the coffee chain's investor day event in New York. Johnson will become CEO of Starbucks effective April 3, 2017, replacing Howard Schultz in the post. \nThe Seattle-based company also is focusing on both its flagship Starbucks stores and the higher-end Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room outlets, for the future growth. The company also has targeted the Reserve Roastery stores, which will sell premium coffee at around $10 a cup, to represent about one-fifth of total outlets by 2021. \nAlso, Starbucks plans to open new stand-alone outlets under Princi, a high-end Italian bakery the company invested in over the summer. The bakery will serve pizza and have locations in major markets such as New York, Seattle and Chicago by 2018. Also, Princi food is expected to be offered at all of the company's new Roastery locations. \nAt the meeting, Starbucks presented a five-year strategic plan to grow revenue by 10 percent and earnings per share between 15 percent and 20 percent. At the same time, the company targeted \"mid-single digit\" comparable-store sales each year. \n\"We feel we have ample opportunity for growth across the U.S.,\" said John Culver, group president-global retail for Starbucks. He said the company's ongoing expansion domestically has been without any significant cannibalization from new stores. \nCulver also said the company plans to continue expanding the number of drive-thru locations in the U.S. An eye full of sky: a spectacular £4 million Georgian house conversion, complete with retractable roof 44 minutes ago \nBehind the elegant facade of a row of fine Georgian houses lies a truly jaw-dropping renovation.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

      "text": "Expending the energy to swipe through the Starbucks' app menu to order coffee first thing in the morning is hard , right? It would be much easier to just groggily command Siri to queue up the order — with extra sugar. \nAt Starbucks Investor Day 2016 , the coffee giant teased a new feature that will soon make its immensely popular mobile app even more intuitive: an AI-based voice command ordering system called My Starbucks Barista. \nSEE ALSO: Your Starbucks cake could have more sugar than 5 Krispy Kremes \nAn expansion of Starbucks' new high-end Italian bakeries, Princi, was also announced at the event. \nThere aren't many details on the feature available as of now, but you can expect the system will work just like the app does in its current form — you'll just say your order to your phone rather than selecting your choice through the touchscreen menu.\nWhat are the chances your name will still be spelled wrong on the cup?\nPer the press release made available before the event, \"Customers will be able to place their orders via voice command or messaging interface, delivering unparalleled speed and convenience, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement and further extending the accessibility of the Starbucks app.\" \nThe My Starbucks Barista feature will reportedly begin an iOS limited beta in early 2017, with plans to expand to a wider release on iOS and Android shortly thereafter. \nIt's great that getting coffee will take that much less effort in the future, but there's just one question: If you say your name to your phone the next time you order a venti latte, what are the chances it will still be spelled wrong on the cup?\nBONUS: Kill the drones, Amazon Go is an actual game changer",

Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz presents during the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day meeting, in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

The Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz , who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. Schultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson . Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. Schultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.",

REUTERS/Arnd …\n\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp unveiled a five-year growth plan, under which it would open more stores around the world, including several high-end coffee shops, while targeting annual revenue growth of 10 percent.\nThe company said it would add 12,000 stores globally by 2021 and target comparable sales growth in mid-single digits and profit growth of 15-20 percent a year.\nThe world's largest coffee chain also unveiled a new feature within its mobile app that uses voice command or messaging to place orders.\nThe feature will be tested first on Apple Inc's iOS operating system in early 2017, Starbucks said at its investor conference on Wednesday. \nThe company also plans to open an outlet of its high-end coffee chain, Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, in Europe, bringing the number to five globally.\nDetails of that launch will be announced early next year, the company said.\nStarbucks said last week that Chief Executive Howard Schultz would step down to focus on the company's high-end coffee shops. \nStarbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014, which roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package. \nThe company plans to open a roastery and tasting room in Shanghai next year, followed by launches in Tokyo and New York City in 2018.\nStarbucks also said it would accelerate the opening of Reserve coffee \"bars\" selling premium coffee within Starbucks cafes to 7,400 stores by 2021. The company had set a target of opening these bars in up to 1,000 cafes by the end of 2017.\nStarbucks's revenue has been growing at an average rate of 12.76 percent over the past five years.\nThe company's shares were up marginally at $57.62 in early trading on Wednesday.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

      "text": "View Comments \nStarbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz delivers remarks at the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day in Manhattan, New York, U.S. December 7, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) unveiled a five-year growth plan, under which it would open more stores around the world, including several high-end coffee shops, while targeting annual revenue growth of 10 percent. The company said it would add 12,000 stores globally by 2021 and target comparable sales growth in mid-single digits and profit growth of 15-20 percent a year. The world's largest coffee chain also unveiled a new feature within its mobile app that uses voice command or messaging to place orders. The feature will be tested first on Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS operating system in early 2017, Starbucks said at its investor conference on Wednesday. The company also plans to open an outlet of its high-end coffee chain, Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, in Europe, bringing the number to five globally. Details of that launch will be announced early next year, the company said. Starbucks said last week that Chief Executive Howard Schultz would step down to focus on the company's high-end coffee shops. Starbucks opened its first Reserve coffee roastery and tasting room in Seattle in late 2014, which roasts limited-supply Reserve coffees that sell for up to $50 per 8-ounce package. The company plans to open a roastery and tasting room in Shanghai next year, followed by launches in Tokyo and New York City in 2018. Starbucks also said it would accelerate the opening of Reserve coffee \"bars\" selling premium coffee within Starbucks cafes to 7,400 stores by 2021. The company had set a target of opening these bars in up to 1,000 cafes by the end of 2017. Starbucks's revenue has been growing at an average rate of 12.76 percent over the past five years. The company's shares were up marginally at $57.62 in early trading on Wednesday. - Reuters",

Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.

Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz presents during the Starbucks 2016 Investor Day meeting, in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016. By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks plans to open 12,000 new locations within five years, boosting the total number of its coffee shops worldwide by almost 50 percent. \nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday, about a week after it announced that Howard Schultz, who has built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago, would step down as CEO in April. \nSchultz, who becomes executive chairman, will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

      "text": "SEATTLE & SHENZHEN, China--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China’s leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. \n\nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n“Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.” \n“The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,” said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. “We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.” \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company’s growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone’s day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience . \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday’s announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. Through our unwavering commitment to excellence and our guiding principles, we bring the unique Starbucks Experience to life for every customer through every cup. To share in the experience please visit us in our stores, online at Starbucks.com and through the Starbucks Newsroom . \nAbout WeChat \nWeChat envisions and innovates new ways for people to connect, communicate and share. A mobile social communication app designed for smartphone users, WeChat is one of the world's fastest growing social apps with hundreds of millions of users internationally. WeChat empowers users in fun and dynamic ways, by bringing together messaging, social communication and games in one seamless, interactive experience, with comprehensive privacy and security settings that can be tailored as needed.

Through Official Accounts, WeChat allows brands to deliver rich and high-touch appealing content experiences to engage with and grow their communities. WeChat is available free to download on Android, iOS, Windows operating system, web version and Mac for desktop version. \nContacts Starbucks Coffee Company\n206-318-7100\npress@starbucks.com",

Shares of Starbucks Corp. have declined about 2 percent since the announcement. \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn't leaving Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries.

      "text": "Pokémon GO Getting Starbucks and Sprint Promotions, New Pocket Monsters Arriving Soon Posted by Evan Selleck   tweet \nNiantic is trying to keep the content flowing, along with events and promotions, to keep the player base entertained in Pokémon GO . \nAnd if leaks and teases are any indicator, the trainers that are still playing the augmented reality-based title have quite a bit to look forward to in the days and weeks ahead. First, it’s about the promotions with businesses like Sprint and Starbucks. \nThe tie-in with the Now Network will see Sprint, Boost Mobile, and Sprint at RadioShack locations become PokéStops and Gyms: \n“Sprint, Boost Mobile and Sprint at Radioshack stores will become PokéStops and Gyms, giving you even more places to stock up on Poké Balls and Razz Berries and battle your friends.” \nThere will also be in-store charging stations at the Sprint locations, which will allow trainers to top off while they’re out on the hunt for the digital pocket monsters. Of course, Sprint reps will also take the time to promote the Now Network’s unlimited data plans while you’re there, too. \nFans of Starbucks and Pokémon GO have something to look forward to as well. That includes a new themed drink: a vanilla bean frappé topped with raspberry syrup and mixed with blackberries. Starbucks hopes to sell the drink when trainers stop in to a gym or PokéStop. \nAnd, lastly, Niantic is teasing that more Pokémon are on the way, saying that trainers should keep their eyes open next week to hear more about what’s coming down the pipe: \n“While we cannot share all the details yet, keep an eye out on our social media channels on December 12th for details about the first addition of more Pokémon into Pokémon GO.” \nAre you still playing this game?",

      "text": "December 07, 2016 12:00pm Comments Share: SEATTLE & SHENZHEN, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nStarbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX ) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China's leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161207005936/en/ Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China announces strategic partnership with Tencent to create a new social gifting experience and an additional mobile payment option in China. (Photo: Business Wire) \nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n\"Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,\" said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. \"This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.\" \n\"The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,\" said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. \"We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.\" \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company's growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone's day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience . \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday's announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.

But to the coffee-obsessed, November and December are really all about seasonal lattes. Somehow without fail, the coffee masterminds at Starbucks are able to nail exactly what hot, sweet, and festive flavors we crave during these cold, cold times.

      "text": "SEATTLE & SHENZHEN, China--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China’s leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. \n\nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n“Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.” \n“The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,” said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. “We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.” \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company’s growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone’s day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience . \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday’s announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. Through our unwavering commitment to excellence and our guiding principles, we bring the unique Starbucks Experience to life for every customer through every cup. To share in the experience please visit us in our stores, online at Starbucks.com and through the Starbucks Newsroom . \nAbout WeChat \nWeChat envisions and innovates new ways for people to connect, communicate and share. A mobile social communication app designed for smartphone users, WeChat is one of the world's fastest growing social apps with hundreds of millions of users internationally. WeChat empowers users in fun and dynamic ways, by bringing together messaging, social communication and games in one seamless, interactive experience, with comprehensive privacy and security settings that can be tailored as needed. WeChat provides a central point of control for users to share voice, photos, videos, and text messages across their entire social eco-system. Through Official Accounts, WeChat allows brands to deliver rich and high-touch appealing content experiences to engage with and grow their communities. WeChat is available free to download on Android, iOS, Windows operating system, web version and Mac for desktop version. \nContacts Starbucks Coffee Company\n206-318-7100\npress@starbucks.com",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads Companies to co-create a social gifting feature early next year aimed at fostering human connections through the instant delivery of gratitude and love with Starbucks gifts Partnership extends WeChat Pay across Starbucks stores in Mainland China beginning December 8 \nSEATTLE, SHANGHAI & SHENZHEN; 8 December 2016 – Starbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China’s leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. \nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n“Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.” \n“The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,” said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. “We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.” \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company’s growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone’s day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience. \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday’s announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. About WeChat \nWeChat envisions and innovates new ways for people to connect, communicate and share. A mobile social communication app designed for smartphone users, WeChat is one of the world's fastest growing social apps with hundreds of millions of users internationally. WeChat empowers users in fun and dynamic ways, by bringing together messaging, social communication and games in one seamless, interactive experience, with comprehensive privacy and security settings that can be tailored as needed. WeChat provides a central point of control for users to share voice, photos, videos, and text messages across their entire social eco-system. Through Official Accounts, WeChat allows brands to deliver rich and high-touch appealing content experiences to engage with and grow their communities. WeChat is available free to download on Android, iOS, Windows operating system, web version and Mac for desktop version. \n  Related News",

The event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m. ET and will continue until approximately 12 noon ET. Following a break for lunch, the webcast of the live event will resume at approximately 1:30 p.m. ET and is expected to conclude at approximately 3:00 p.m. ET. \nDownloadable event photos will be added to this page (green download button above) throughout the day. \nNEW YORK (December 7, 2016) – Capping another record quarter, and year of growth and profitability, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) today will host its biennial Investor Conference to present the company’s five-year strategic plan to grow revenue by 10 percent, EPS by 15-20 percent, and drive mid-single digit comp growth each year, as it plans to open approximately 12,000 new stores globally by 2021 while continuing to elevate the Starbucks Experience around the world.* \n“Industry-leading innovation is driving our core business and creating further separation from competitors all around the world,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve stores will further transform – and elevate – the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers, and are laying the foundation for our next wave of profitable, global growth. I have never been more energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead as Kevin transitions to the ceo role and leads the most talented and experienced leadership team in Starbucks history.” \n“Starbucks continues to deliver record financial performance. The customer experience created in our stores by partners who proudly wear the green apron is what makes Starbucks a destination for 80 to 90 million customers a week,” said Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer. “We are today executing against an ambitious, carefully-curated, multi-year strategy to further elevate the entire Starbucks brand and customer experience around the world, and further extending Starbucks leadership around all things coffee, retail and mobile. The power of our brand, the strength and momentum in our business, and the world-class management talent we have assembled give me great confidence in our ability to capture the enormous global growth opportunities ahead.” \nLast week, it was announced that Johnson will assume the role of president and ceo at Starbucks, and Schultz will become executive chairman, effective April 3, 2017. Transforming the Premium Coffee Experience \nSince opening two years ago, the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Seattle has become recognized as the most dynamic and immersive coffee forward retail experience in the world, delivering an unprecedented level of premiumization to the coffee category and fueling the next wave of transformation that is elevating the Starbucks Experience globally. Building on this, the company plans to accelerate the presentation of the Roastery experience around the world, opening its next Roastery in Shanghai in 2017, Tokyo and New York City in 2018, and a fifth location in Europe to be announced early next year. \nEach Roastery will serve as the foundation for Starbucks Reserve® stores – a new retail format that will integrate the theatre and romance of the Roastery with the unique culinary experience of the company’s new Italian food partner, Princi. These Starbucks Reserve® stores, under the leadership of the company’s new Siren Retail organization, represent a significant growth opportunity for the company in the U.S. and around the world. The first of these new stores will open in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of FY17, with plans to open 1,000 or more globally over time. In addition, the company plans to open standalone Princi stores in Seattle, New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early 2018. The company is also extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to its core Starbucks® stores, adding Starbucks Reserve® experience bars in up to 20 percent of its total portfolio (including new and renovated locations) by 2021. Premiumization Strategy to Drive Innovative New Customer Experiences \nStarbucks Reserve® Roasteries will serve as an innovation pipeline that will elevate the brand and contribute a \"halo\" to the entire Starbucks Experience. This includes new product breakthroughs that will contribute to the growth of the company’s ecosystem, segmented strategically across all Starbucks® stores. Earlier this year, Starbucks introduced its first limited-time beverage offering inspired by the Roastery, the Smoked Butterscotch Latte. This was followed by Nitro Cold Brew, which is now available in more than 500 U.S. company-owned locations and select stores in Canada and China, as Starbucks pursues a $600 million global Cold Brew opportunity. Both products continue to reinforce the company’s focus on Roastery-inspired craft at scale, as well as ongoing investment in the cold coffee category. In core stores, Starbucks innovative, coffee-forward beverages such as Flat White, Cold Brew, Latte Macchiato and Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato all support the company's premiumization strategy. In January, customers nationwide will be introduced to another Roastery offering with the introduction of the Cascara Latte. Made with the fruit of the coffee cherry, Cascara lends subtle notes of dark brown sugar and maple to classic Starbucks® espresso. With its strong retail foundation and operational excellence, Starbucks is bringing Roastery-inspired innovations like this to market more rapidly than ever before, creating further distinction from competitors. \nStarbucks is simultaneously innovating and expanding its food menu with products customers have been looking for, starting with the launch of Sous Vide Egg Bites in January 2017 – a wheat-free, low calorie, high protein, convenient breakfast; the spring launch of a Certified Gluten-Free Breakfast Sandwich; the expansion of the successful Bistro Box platform; as well as a regional rollout of delicious organic soups. Relevant innovation has become fundamental to unlocking the lunch daypart and building on existing breakfast daypart momentum, giving the company the ability to realize additional profitability and incremental sales. Starbucks® Breakfast Sandwich sales have more than doubled over the past four years and innovation will continue to drive meaningful growth, creating and meeting customer demand for innovation across all dayparts. Building on this strong momentum, Starbucks once again aims to double food growth over the next five years. Extending the Digital Flywheel \nStarbucks offers the largest and most robust mobile ecosystem of any retailer in the world, with more than 12 million Starbucks Rewards™ members (up 18 percent year on year), eight million mobile paying customers with one out of three now using Mobile Order & Pay, and more than $6 billion loaded onto prepaid Starbucks Cards in North America during the past year alone. Today, Starbucks will unveil an innovative conversational ordering system, My Starbucks® Barista, powered by groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the Starbucks® Mobile App. Starbucks® Mobile App customers will be able to place their orders via voice command or messaging interface, delivering unparalleled speed and convenience, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement and further extending the accessibility of the Starbucks® app. The My Starbucks® Barista feature will roll out first on iOS in limited beta in early 2017 and be made available to more iOS and Android users in subsequent releases. \nStarbucks digital flywheel has also continued to gain momentum with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still early in the evolution of this service, Starbucks hyper-personalized e-mail reward offerings – with more than 400,000 variations – have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns, translating into increased customer engagement and, importantly, accelerated spend. Starbucks has delivered personalized offers to customers directly on the front screen of the mobile app. By early 2017, the company expects to complete the rollout of suggested selling and recommendations (suggesting items for pairing or additions to a customer’s order) during Mobile Order and Pay checkout, which the company believes will further fuel engagement and growth. With Starbucks Rewards™, the company’s new spend-based loyalty program, customers are finding increased value when being rewarded for bigger purchases. This enables the company to boost ticket, create greater marketing flexibility and pursue “Stars Everywhere” partnerships to create further Star earning opportunities, while reducing “order splitting.” With a 94 percent program retention rate, and new international markets on the horizon, the program is stronger than ever before. Unlocking High-Value Opportunities in China \nCustomers in China have continued to embrace the Starbucks brand, with some of the company’s most innovative, efficient and profitable stores producing record revenue and strong same-store sales growth in FY16. Starbucks newest class of stores in China are delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in the company’s 17-year history in the market. Starbucks now operates approximately 2,500 stores in 118 cities in China and employs more than 30,000 partners (employees), opening over a store a day – a growth rate that will continue to accelerate well into the future. Starbucks remains on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China by 2021 and expects the market will eclipse that in the U.S. over time. While Starbucks business in China is in its very early stages of development, the company will announce today a series of strategic moves it is making in the digital and mobile space to further extend customer engagement and loyalty. Expanding Global Leadership Position in At-Home Coffee and Ready-to-Drink \nOver the next five years, Starbucks expects its Channel Development segment, which includes its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) portfolio, Branded Solutions (licensed stores and foodservice), and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) segments, will generate an incremental $1 billion in revenue, grow operating income by 75 percent, and double its RTD business outside of the U.S. The company is the industry leader in premium single serve, premium packaged roast and ground coffee, and Ready-to-Drink products, and is well positioned to grow its share of these markets both in the U.S. and globally. The company's more than 20-year partnership with PepsiCo to create the North America Coffee Partnership (NACP) is a more than $2 billion business and has approximately 97 percent share of the RTD coffee category. The NACP continues to bring to the market highly relevant, new and innovative coffee and energy products to meet the needs of customers looking for premium, on-the-go coffee offerings. In spring 2017, the company will launch new bottled Starbucks® Cold Brew Cocoa and Honey with Cream in select markets across the U.S. In Latin America, Starbucks has expanded its partnership with PepsiCo to begin distribution of the iconic bottled Frappuccino® chilled coffee beverage across ten markets. In China, where the RTD coffee and energy category represents a $6 billion opportunity that is projected to grow by 20 percent over the next three years, Starbucks and its partner, Tingyi Holding Corp., have rapidly achieved distribution in over 37 major Chinese cities and over 7,100 points of distribution, experiencing strong consumer demand. \nStarbucks is extending this same disciplined growth and innovation to the RTD tea category, which is a fast growing $4 billion category, starting with the upcoming launch of bottled Teavana® Craft Iced Teas in partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The first line of teas will begin shipping to select Northeast U.S. retailers in February and customers will soon enjoy four new, vibrant varieties brewed from the finest Teavana® teas and botanicals with no artificial flavors. The new RTD teas include Pineapple Berry Blue Herbal Tea, Peach Green Tea, Mango Black Tea and Passion Tango® Herbal Tea. Later in 2017, select flavors will roll out to Starbucks® stores with plans for national channel availability by 2018. Creating Long-Term Opportunities for Partners \nFrom being among the first to offer comprehensive health benefits and equity in the form of stock for partners who work 20 hours or more a week, to providing them with the opportunity for full tuition reimbursement for a bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University through the innovative Starbucks College Achievement Plan, Starbucks has continued to invest in and innovate around the partner experience while balancing the needs of its customers, shareholders and the marketplace. Starbucks has now matched $78 million in 401K savings in the U.S. with a total fund balance of $1.3 billion as of FY16. Its Global Bean Stock program, which grants partners equity in the form of company stock, generated $221.6 million in pre-taxed gains in FY16. The company also recently announced it will add an enhancement to the program in 2017, doubling the annual Bean Stock award for U.S. hourly store partners with at least two years of continuous service with the company. Further, with the recent move to a new healthcare platform, U.S. partners are now saving an average of 15 percent per pay check on healthcare premiums compared to last year. \nStarbucks is finding that these incremental investments in both wages and benefits have helped support and elevate its partners, attract and retain the best talent, provide measured improvement in service to customers and deliver outsized returns to shareholders. In fact, since announcing the Starbucks College Achievement Plan two years ago, the company has enrolled more than 6,300 U.S. partners in the program and is on track to celebrate 1,000 graduates in 2017, with a commitment to graduating 25,000 partners from the program by 2025. Early results from the program are showing that participants have twice the retention rate and are more than four times more likely to achieve a promotion in responsibility. \nIn the spirit of the company’s Mission and Values, Starbucks CUP (Caring Unites Partners) Fund, an emergency financial assistance program for partners impacted by natural disasters and family emergencies, generated over $2.1 million in contributions from partners in FY16 through a combination of “round up” in stores and payroll contributions. Since it launched in 1998, partners have raised more than $18 million toward the CUP Fund. The company also matched $784,000 in individual partner charitable donations and volunteer hours, and donated more than 300,000 meals since launching its FoodShare initiative in select U.S. markets in March 2016. Looking ahead, Starbucks plans to roll out FoodShare to all 8,000+ U.S. company-operated stores over the next three years. \n*Revenue and EPS growth are based on non-GAAP FY16 results.

      "text": "Howard Schultz has announced he will will step down as Starbucks' CEO next year. Current president and COO Kevin Johnson will replace him. CBSN's... \nSchultz stressed again Wednesday that he wasn’t departing Starbucks, and that he plans to oversee the growth of its high-end stores, called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries. \n“I’m not leaving,” Schultz said at the investor conference. There has been “a lot of speculation about what I’m going to do and when I’m going to do it ... I’m here to do everything I can to lend my help and support in the areas I’m going to be focused on.” \nJohnson, who was a technology executive at Juniper Networks and Microsoft before joining Starbucks, has overseen the coffee giant’s global supply chain, its human resources department, and its marketing and technology efforts, including launches of digital and mobile sales platforms. He’s also been a member of the Starbucks board for seven years. \nA significant portion of Starbucks growth appears to be tied to China, where the ranks of the middle class are rapidly expanding. Schultz said he predicted Starbucks’ Chinese operations will eventually be larger than its U.S. business. Schultz: 3 \"Our business in China will be larger than our business in the U.S.\" https://t.co/TRzZAyw12x #SBUXinvestorday — Starbucks News (@Starbucksnews) December 7, 2016 \nBelinda Wong, the CEO of Starbucks China, said the company’s 5,000 new Chinese locations will be spread across 200 cities, which she said would help triple its revenue and operating income. \n“Over the next six years, another 300 million will also reach the middle class, reaching a total of 600 million people” in China, she said. “That’s almost twice the population of the U.S.” \nIn the meantime, its high-end Starbucks Reserve Roastery concept will expand into additional cities such as Seattle and Chicago next year, with plans to reach 1,000 globally. Starbucks said it’s also planning to open stand-alone Italian cafes through its partnership with Princi, a restaurant with locations in Milan and London that’s known for wood-fired breads and pizzas. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Andrew Myrick Dec 7th, 2016 \nYesterday, we saw evidence that Starbucks would be teaming up with Niantic Labs to provide more PokéStops and Gyms for Pokémon GO but Sprint beat Starbucks to the punch. Niantic has pushed another update to the Pokémon GO application which will turn Sprint locations into the place to be for Pokémon GO players. \nSprint has announced the partnership with Niantic Labs and beginning on December 12th, Pokémon GO players will be able to experience the following: Sprint, Boost Mobile and Sprint at RadioShack stores become a destination to collect in-game items, including Poké Balls and Eggs, to help them advance in the game. Players will have a go-to location where they can take Pokémon into battle against other Pokémon at Sprint-sponsored Gyms. Players can go to Sprint, Boost and Sprint at RadioShack locations to recharge their phones. \nEarlier rumors suggested that the Starbucks partnership would be announced as early as tomorrow , so we’ll have to wait and see what’s in the works. Unfortunately, the update today does not include the 100 new Pokémon that have been rumored to be added to the game in the near future.",

      "text": "Blog This \nStarbucks Coffee Company (NASDAQ: SBUX) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China’s leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161207005936/en/ Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China announces strategic partnership with Tencent to create a new social gifting experience and an additional mobile payment option in China. (Photo: Business Wire) \nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n“Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.” \n“The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,” said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. “We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.” \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company’s growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone’s day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience . \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday’s announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. Through our unwavering commitment to excellence and our guiding principles, we bring the unique Starbucks Experience to life for every customer through every cup. To share in the experience please visit us in our stores, online at Starbucks.com and through the Starbucks Newsroom . \nAbout WeChat \nWeChat envisions and innovates new ways for people to connect, communicate and share.

One of them is Debbie Crowe, whose recipe was part of our Austin360 Holiday Cookie Contest. Addie Broyles / American-Statesman \nAmong the many submissions to our holiday cookie contest were cookie bars, which in my mind are cookies because you can eat them without a fork and they’re small enough that you can eat a few at a time. \nAlthough we didn’t end up with any bars in our top five, we decided to publish three bar recipes that very nearly cracked into the finalist round. \nReader Amy Robertson’s holiday squares use raspberry jam, raisins, walnuts and oats, a lovely combination of sweet with just a hint of the bitter from the walnuts and the slight chew of the oats. Laurie Nelson wasn’t afraid of rocking the pecan pie boat by adding both spices and chocolate to her pie-inspired bars, and with this blondie recipe, Debbie Crowe convinced me that I do like white chocolate, as long as it’s paired with cranberries and cream cheese frosting. \nCranberry Ginger Blondies \nCrowe, who lives in Lakeway, has been working on her copycat recipe for the popular Starbucks’ cranberry bliss bar. Line the pan with parchment paper for the easiest removal. \n3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened 1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar 1/2 tsp. salt ",

      "text": "Want a new Pokemon to go with that cup of coffee? That sounds weird but looks like Starbucks has teamed up with Niantic to come up with a new promo that will help market the game further. Some people are already losing interest but perhaps making them go to a nearby Starbucks to catch a new Pokemon will help. Information of a Pokemon-Starbucks event was leaked over on Reddit recently. The thread mentioned the promo will be on December 8. That’s tomorrow so you’d better plan to go the nearest Starbucks.\nThe leaked information was from a Starbucks employee who further said that some Starbucks will become Pokestops. The idea is nothing new because we’ve seen a number of restaurants and establishments turn into such. According to the leakster, a Starbucks branch will receive a “Frappachino” icon within the game. A trainer needs to engage it. We don’t know yet if a player still needs to buy from the store but we won’t be surprised if it will be a requirement.\nWe’re interested to know if a new unreleased Pokemon will be introduced but that would be exciting. A Starbucks-themed Pokemon that can only be found in the coffee shop? Now that will be one interesting character. We’re guessing it will be so alive and alert from having too many cups of coffee.\nVIA: Reddit\nStory Timeline Secret Pokemon GO feature hiding in plain sight, confirmed by Niantic’s CEO Niantic doubles XP and Stardust, rebalances CP levels on Pokemon GO Pokemon GO expands Nearby, Sightings; Ditto now shows up randomly Pokemon GO's next update to unleash 100 new characters Shiny Pokemon might be making an appearance in Pokemon GO soon",

      "text": "December 07, 2016 at 12:00 PM EST Starbucks and Tencent Announce Strategic Partnership to Launch Social Gifting on WeChat in China Starbucks and Tencent Announce Strategic Partnership to Launch Social Gifting on WeChat in China \nStarbucks Coffee Company ( NASDAQ: SBUX ) and Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK: 00700), a leading provider of internet value-added services in China, today pioneered a strategic partnership to co-create a new social gifting feature on WeChat, China’s leading mobile social communications service, in early 2017. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161207005936/en/ \nBelinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China announces strategic partnership with Tencent to create a new social gifting experience and an additional mobile payment option in China. (Photo: Business Wire) \nThis partnership positions Starbucks as the first retail brand to combine and bring a locally-relevant social gifting and digital payment experience to life on WeChat in China. Tapping into the 846 million global monthly active user accounts (as of the third quarter of 2016), the new integrated feature will seamlessly allow customers in China to instantly and conveniently gift Starbucks to a friend or loved one. Beginning today, Starbucks customers will also be able to use WeChat Pay to make purchases at close to 2,500 Starbucks stores across Mainland China. \n“Starbucks and Tencent share similar values to enable greater human connections through our respective products and services, and I am pleased to partner with an established and respected social and mobile industry leader in China,” said Belinda Wong, ceo, Starbucks China. “This new strategic partnership will leverage the strengths of both Starbucks and WeChat to create a true online-to-offline social gifting platform that will deepen our engagement with our customers in a unique and powerful way. Just as Starbucks cards are among the most gifted around the globe, we aspire to also become the most gifted brand digitally in China.” \n“The strategic cooperation between WeChat and Starbucks enables us to bring the unique Starbucks retail experience seamlessly to hundreds of millions of WeChat users in China,” said Allen Zhang, Senior Executive Vice President of Tencent. “We are happy to be the partner of choice of Starbucks and look forward to deepening our connection to our users through the highest-quality services.” \nStarbucks is committed to innovative digital experiences that surprise, delight and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience for its customers across China. The online social gifting platform is part of the company’s growing digital presence focused on connecting with customers through digital channels, including the Starbucks® Mobile App, the My Starbucks Rewards® program and social media. \nJointly created by Starbucks and WeChat, the social gifting feature encourages everyday acts of kindness and appreciation among family and friends. Customers will be able to select from Starbucks-branded gifts and products and add a personalized message of love, of gratitude or to simply uplift someone’s day. Recipients of these personal and simple acts of kindness can save their gifts and memories on their WeChat accounts and redeem their gift at Starbucks stores across China to enjoy the unparalleled Starbucks Experience . \nAs part of this partnership, Starbucks will introduce the use of WeChat Pay for purchases in its retail stores in a continued effort to elevate the in-store experience for customers. This cash-free digital payment experience, which allows users to pay for their goods and services from their mobile devices, is one of the most popular payment methods in China, with more than 300 million users linking their bank cards with WeChat or QQ, another flagship service of Tencent, as of March 2016. \nToday’s announcement builds on Starbucks rapidly expanding portfolio of digital innovations in China, which integrates the exceptional in-store experience with the digital Fourth Place experience. Earlier this year, Starbucks launched a mobile payment system in China aimed at providing My Starbucks Rewards® (MSR) members access to a fast, seamless and convenient way to pay for purchases, using their pre-loaded Starbucks Gift Card on their mobile devices. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. Through our unwavering commitment to excellence and our guiding principles, we bring the unique Starbucks Experience to life for every customer through every cup.

      "text": "US coffee behemoth Starbucks Inc (NASDAQ:SBUX) has unveiled a five-year strategic plan at a biennial Investor Conference, with the focus on opening new stores and driving food sales growth. Starbucks told investors that it aims to add 12,000 new stores globally by 2021, and said it was on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China over the next five years. It added that it expects the market in China to exceed that of the US over time. The firm’s chairman and chief executive officer Howard Schultz said: “I have never been more energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead.” Starbucks said recently that Schultz will become its executive chairman in early April of 2017, with Kevin Johnson, the group’s president and chief operating officer, taking over as president and CEO. Looking at financial targets, the Seattle-based firm said its goals included 10% revenue growth, 15-20% growth in earnings per share, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth each year. From next year, the group plans to open a new retail format, the Reserve Roastery stores formed in partnership with Italian foodmaker Princi. The first Reserve Roastery stores will open in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of 2017, and stores are planned for Shanghai, Tokyo and New York City . The group also said it plans to double food growth over the next five years. It added that its food offerings next year will include new breakfast menus, more bistro box offerings and organic soups rolled out regionally. Starbucks is also launching a new beverage, the Cascara Latte -- made with the fruit of the coffee cherry – which it will introduce in January. And the firm plans to roll out a new Artificial Intelligence ordering system for its app, starting in early 2017 with limited beta testing.",

      "text": "One week after Starbucks ( SBUX ) founder and CEO Howard Schultz surprised investors with an after-the-bell announcement that he will step down from his post, he took the stage Wednesday at the company's investor day in New York to outline an ambitious vision for his company's future.\nContinue Reading Below\nOver the next five years, the coffee giant looks to achieve revenue growth of 10% alongside profit-per-share growth of between 15% and 20%. While growth among stores open 12 months or longer remained steady in the final quarter of 2016, the rate slowed by four percentage points to 4% from the same period in 2015. The company still expects to see mid- to single-digit comp growth each year as it plans to open 12,000 new global stores by 2021. The dip in same-store sales growth has spooked investors, but Schultz repeatedly said Wednesday he’s not worried, citing innovation in the Starbucks pipeline, saying the core business has “never been stronger.”\n“If Starbucks was a 20-chapter book, I still think we’re in chapter four or five,” he said to a packed room of Starbucks shareholders before quelling lingering concerns that his transition from CEO to executive chairman meant he was departing the company. “I’m not leaving.”\nSchultz reiterated his “full confidence” in Kevin Johnson who currently serves as the company’s president and chief operating officer, and who will take over as chief executive in April.\n“I want you to know he is going to be CEO. He’s got the last word, he’s running the company,” Schultz said of Johnson.\nThe soon-to-be-CEO outlined the pillars of the company’s next-phase growth strategy, which puts significant focus on building out premium offerings through an expansion of its Reserve coffees and the first-of-its kind Roastery experience.
