X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nRemembrance Day may be over, but the effort to help Canada’s military veterans continues in Calgary – and some aviation students hope their campaign will really “take off.” \nThey’re now busy weighing donations of food like cereal, instant noodles and canned soup, before delivering them to the Veterans Food Bank . Cancelled corporate Calgary Christmas parties could benefit local charities \nThe scale is set up alongside a Boeing 737 at SAIT’s Aero Centre at the Calgary International Airport in a food drive the students call “Fill the Boeing.” \n“We’re planning on filling the Boeing to its maximum takeoff capacity,” student Leana Buessecker explained, “which is about 55,000 pounds of food.” \n“It’s mind-blowing,” student Matthew Holland said. \nStudent Mattew Granley got some perspective on the size of the challenge when he first brought it up with his family. \n“My dad flies (Boeing 737s) for Westjet,” Granley said. “He was, like, ‘what? That’s crazy. I doubt you’d be able to do that.’” \nBut Granley feels it’s a challenge well worth taking on. \n“I do have a lot of friends, I do have a lot of family who have served in the military, so it hits home for me.” \nThe students are collecting donations of food and money until Dec. 7, with collection points at the Aero Centre and on SAIT’s main campus. \nVolunteers can also pick up large donations – anyone who wants to contribute that way can call 403-284-7018 to make arrangements. \n“If there’s a will, there’s a way,” Holland said. \nAnd as for Granley’s doubting dad, the 737 pilot: \n“I told him, ‘you know what?” Granley said. \n“We’ll show you. We’ll do it.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc. ",

      "text": "Sales at Apple ( AAPL ) , Boeing ( BA ) and top U.S. automakers could take a hit if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his promise to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, China's state-backed newspaper Global Times warned in an editorial published on Sunday.\nTrump repeatedly criticized China throughout his presidential campaign, saying he would label the government as a \"currency manipulator\" immediately upon entering the White House. The Global Times threatened that actions like that could trigger \"countermeasures\" by the Chinese government, causing a \"number of U.S. industries\" to be impaired.\n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the Global Times said in its editorial. \"China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nCounter-measures could spell further trouble for Apple in the region. In its latest earnings report, sales in Greater China fell 30% year-over-year. The region made up about 19% of the Cupertino, CA-based company's revenue during the quarter.\nThe slump is believed to be tied to increased demand for smartphones from local manufactures like Huawei and Xiaomi, according to Barron's . Additionally, China in April shut down Apple's online book and movie services in the country.\nApple shares were trading down 2.7% to $105.48 on Monday afternoon.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "Eighteen passengers have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and American Airlines after the airplane they were on caught fire last month on the tarmac of O’Hare International Airport when part of an engine failed.\nAbout 20 people were taken to hospitals after the right engine of Miami-bound American Airlines Flight 383 broke into four pieces about 2:30 p.m. Oct. 28 , according to fire officials and the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe suit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court also names as a defendant General Electric Aviation, claiming it sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe 767 aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane, and that they failed to provide “assistance, supervision and instruction” during evacuation.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released this photo of the pieces it recovered from a high pressure turbine disk that fractured inside the engine of an American Airlines jet that was about to take off from O’Hare International Airport on Oct. 28. | NTSB photo\nSpokesmen for Boeing and American declined to comment on the pending litigation. A representative for GE could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening.\nAn NTSB report issued a week after the fire said one of the fractures on the turbine disk of the engine was “consistent with fatigue cracking.” Takeoff was aborted due to the “uncontained engine failure” that led to fuel pooling under the plane’s right wing, which then burst into flames, authorities said.\nOne piece of the turbine disk went through the inboard section of the right wing, over the fuselage and into a UPS warehouse facility more than a half-mile away. Another piece was found about 1,600 feet away, but it was still on O’Hare property, authorities said.\nNo fire breached the cabin, and the 20 hospitalized passengers had been released a night after the fire.\nThe five-count negligence suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages.\n# Lawsuits O'Hare International Airport",

      "text": "(CBS) — Eighteen passengers have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and American Airlines after the airplane they were on caught fire last month on the tarmac of O’Hare International Airport when part of an engine failed.\nAbout 20 people were taken to hospitals after the right engine of Miami-bound American Airlines Flight 383 broke into four pieces about 2:30 p.m. Oct. 28, according to fire officials and the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board released this photo of the pieces it recovered from a high pressure turbine disk that fractured inside the engine of an American Airlines jet. (National Transportation Safety Board photo)\nThe suit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court also names as a defendant General Electric Aviation, claiming it sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe 767 aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane, and that they failed to provide “assistance, supervision and instruction” during evacuation.\nSpokesmen for Boeing and American declined to comment on the pending litigation. A representative for GE could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening.\nAn NTSB report issued a week after the fire said one of the fractures on the turbine disk of the engine was “consistent with fatigue cracking.” Takeoff was aborted due to the “uncontained engine failure” that led to fuel pooling under the plane’s right wing, which then burst into flames, authorities said.\nOne piece of the turbine disk went through the inboard section of the right wing, over the fuselage and into a UPS warehouse facility more than a half-mile away. Another piece was found about 1,600 feet away, but it was still on O’Hare property, authorities said.\nNo fire breached the cabin, and the 20 hospitalized passengers had been released a night after the fire.\nThe five-count negligence suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages.\n(Source: Sun-Times Media Wire copy; Chicago Sun-Times 2016.

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nUnited Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that it would postpone receiving dozens of new Boeing Co. jets to trim spending.\nThe third-largest U.S. airline will defer 61 planes from a 65-jet order for 737-700s and convert them into the new Max model with yet-to-be-determined arrival dates. Boeing will switch the remaining four to the larger 737-800 model for delivery next year.\nThe airline, among four U.S. carriers that have recently attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , also announced a push to boost its share of budget-conscious travelers with a new no-frills fare class. The basic economy class entitles fliers only to an under-seat bag and is also intended to avoid the delays caused by passengers stowing overhead baggage.\nThe move are among a parade of planned changes unveiled by United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and his new management team that include cost cuts and revenue-boosting initiatives designed to increase profits by $4.8 billion by 2020.\nThe fleet changes are among the industry's largest since Southwest Airlines Co. in June reached a deal with Boeing to defer 67 of its 737 Max deliveries scheduled for the 2019-2022 period until 2023 and beyond.\nBoeing and Airbus Group SE have order books for their best-selling jets stretching out for several years of production, and typically overbook knowing that some planes will be canceled or deferred.\nBoth jet makers have said that cancellations and requests to push back deliveries remain below their historical average. Boeing had no immediate comment on United's move.\nChicago-based United is also buying 24 175 Embraer jets from the Brazilian manufacturer rather than leasing them from an unidentified regional airline, with the Boeing fleet changes expected to cut capital spending over the next two years by $1.6 billion.\nUnited also plans changes to flights at its three big hubs in Chicago, Newark and Houston that it hopes will add $900 million in incremental revenue by 2019.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 15, 2016 07:44 ET (12:44 ",

      "text": "TransDigm's ( TDG ) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street expectations but the Boeing ( BA ) and Airbus ( EADSY ) supplier gave weak 2017 guidance and said it is cautious on the aircraft market.\nThe maker of ignition systems, gear pumps and other aerospace components reported a 16.3% jump in Q4 adjusted earnings to $3.29 a share, beating the $3.20 analysts expected. Revenue rose 8.1% to $809.8 million, but fell short of analyst views for $875.2 million.\nTransDigm sees fiscal year EPS of $11.84-$12.12, below consensus for $12.80, on sales of $3.515 billion-$3.565 billion, short of Wall Street views for $3.586 billion.\n\"Our fiscal 2017 guidance assumes that our commercial aftermarket revenues will be up in the mid to high single-digit percentage range, commercial OEM (original equipment manufacturer) revenues up in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range and defense revenues flat to slightly up,\" CEO W. Nicholas Howley said in a release. \"We remain cautious on the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle.\"\nTransDigm shares sank 7.1% to 252.93 on the stock market today , diving below their 50-day line and falling out of buy range.\nBoeing shares edged up 1%, continuing to extend above buy range. Airbus' U.S.-listed shares rallied 1.6%.",

      "text": "A Chinese state-run newspaper has warned that companies such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Boeing ( BA ) would be the first to be punished if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand China a currency manipulator.\nDuring his election campaign, Trump also spoke of a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.\nThe communist-party controlled newspaper, Global Times, is not as well known as China's People's Daily or Xinhua News.\n\"If Trump wrecks Sino-U.S. trade, a number of U.S. industries will be impaired,\" the newspaper said in an unsigned editorial. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple and the so-called FANG internet giants — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — have not joined in the postelection stock rally, while bank, drug, defense and basic material stocks have gained. See how some are doing at IBD Stock Checkup .\nBoeing recently received a $3.2 billion order for twelve 787 Dreamliners from China Southern Airlines. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% in fiscal Q4 to $8.8 billion.\nThe Global Times editorial was published shortly after Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by telephone on Monday.\nXi told Trump that cooperation was the only correct choice for ties between the world's two largest economies, said a Bloomberg report.\nXi and Trump agreed to meet soon, according to state broadcaster China Central TV.\n\"China and the U.S. -- as the world's biggest developing country and the biggest developed country, and the top two global economies — need to and can cooperate on many issues,\" Xi said, according to CCTV. \"At this moment, there is an important opportunity and massive potential for China-U.S. cooperation so that both sides need to strengthen coordination.\"\nAlibaba ( BABA ) Vice Chairman Joe Tsai last week said Trump would run a risk by harming China relations, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\"China is going to be and already is the source of consumer demand and the source of capital for America,\" Tsai reportedly said at an event to kick off the company's big Singles Day event on Friday. \"So if you're the American president, you have to pay a lot of attention to that because your job is to create a lot of jobs in American society.\n\"And if you don't have Chinese consumers being engaged and buying American products, and Chinese investors can't invest in the United States, and create more American jobs, then you'd be in trouble.\"\nApple shares closed down 2.5% in the stock market today , though they did find support at their 200-day line intraday. Boeing stock, though, climbed 1% to 149.99.",

      "text": "United Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that it would postpone receiving dozens of new Boeing Co. jets to trim spending.\nThe third-largest U.S. airline will defer 61 planes from a 65-jet order for 737-700s and convert them into the new Max model with yet-to-be-determined arrival dates. Boeing will switch the remaining four to the larger 737-800 model for delivery next year.\nThe airline, among four U.S. carriers that have recently attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway Inc., also announced a push to boost its share of budget-conscious travelers with a new no-frills fare class. The basic economy class entitles fliers only to an under-seat bag and is also intended to avoid the delays caused by passengers stowing overhead baggage.\nThe move are among a parade of planned changes unveiled by United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and his new management team that include cost cuts and revenue-boosting initiatives designed to increase profits by $4.8 billion by 2020.\nThe fleet changes are among the industry's largest since Southwest Airlines Co. in June reached a deal with Boeing to defer 67 of its 737 Max deliveries scheduled for the 2019-2022 period until 2023 and beyond.\nBoeing and Airbus Group SE have order books for their best-selling jets stretching out for several years of production, and typically overbook knowing that some planes will be canceled or deferred.\nBoth jet makers have said that cancellations and requests to push back deliveries remain below their historical average. Boeing had no immediate comment on United's move.\nChicago-based United is also buying 24 175 Embraer jets from the Brazilian manufacturer rather than leasing them from an unidentified regional airline, with the Boeing fleet changes expected to cut capital spending over the next two years by $1.6 billion.\nUnited also plans changes to flights at its three big hubs in Chicago, Newark and Houston that it hopes will add $900 million in incremental revenue by 2019.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 15, 2016 08:05 ET (13:05 ",

Share story The Associated Press \nCHICAGO — A lawsuit has been filed by 18 passengers who were aboard an American Airlines aircraft that caught fire last month on the tarmac of Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after an engine failed. \nThe lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court targets American, aircraft manufacturer Boeing and engine manufacturer General Electric Aviation. \nThe Chicago Sun-Times reports the lawsuit claims GE sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane. They contend employees failed to provide “assistance, supervision and instruction” during evacuation. \nPilots on Oct. 28 aborted the takeoff of American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami. All 161 passengers and nine crew safely evacuated, with officials saying 20 people suffered minor injuries. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "Global Times says if Trump tries to start trade war, China will stop buying Boeing, Apple and autos   9:45 pm \nYesterday, the nationalistic Party tabloid the Global Times published an editorial previewing what China would do if Donald Trump tried to start a trade war. Spoiler alert: it wouldn't be pretty. \nThe editorial was in response to comments made by Trump economic adviser Judy Shelton when she was asked if the president-elect would follow through on his vows to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office . Since being elected, Trump has pulled back on a number of controversial stances he once loudly supported ; however, Shelton signaled that this would not be one of them (even if it should be ). \nTo show what was in store for the United States if Trump did try to declare China a currency manipulator or slap steep tariffs on China-made goods, the Global Times listed a few \"countermeasures\" at Beijing's disposal. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. The editorial concludes that Trump (a \"shrewd businessman\") would in fact never dare to try to start a trade war with China, writing that rumors of such were merely made up by the ill-intentioned media (who viciously continue to report things that Trump has said).\nSo far, Trump has done nothing but help the Chinese economy. Certain companies have capitalized on his campaign by churning out made-in-China Trump masks , toilet paper and other goods for supporters. According to another article from the Global Times , experts predict that thanks to Trump's stunning win at the polls earlier this month, the gravy train will continue rolling in until at least the presidential inauguration in January. \n\"My workers are busy printing, folding and shipping the flags all day, but even so we have difficulties meeting the soaring demand,\" one factory manager surnamed Yao told the Global Times, adding that he had already sold over 20,000 flags to clients at 4.5-5.5 yuan a piece, reaping big profits. \nYao said that during the campaign season, he had been manufacturing twice as many Trump flags as Clinton flags. Since election day, he had stopped producing Clinton flags all together because of lack of demand. \n\"Of course I support Trump more than Clinton, because I am making a fortune on his winning,\" Yao said, adding that he's considering \"enlarging production lines\" before inauguration day. \nBe careful, Yao. You might just win so much that you get tired of winning . Eat with Shanghaiist",

      "text": "United Continental Holdings will defer delivery of 61 Boeing 7373s as the airline seeks to close its profit gap with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group. \nUnited will delay accepting the 737s until an undetermined date in an effort to save $1.6 billion in capital expenses, according to a statement Tuesday by the Chicago-based carrier.\nThe company had ordered 65 of the 737-700 jets in two separate batches earlier this year and was expected to receive them starting next year. United will take delivery of the other four 737s as planned, but convert them to the 737-800 model.\nThe fleet changes are part of $4.8 billion in initiatives intended to improve the airline’s profitability through 2020. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. United’s operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta’s 19 percent margin and American’s 15.1 percent.\nMost Read Stories ‘Deadliest Catch’ cast member Jake Harris hospitalized; police investigating attack What the national media are saying about Seahawks' 'magnificent' win over Patriots 5,000 Seattle-area students walk out of class to protest election of Trump  WATCH Patriots' Rob Gronkowski has punctured lung according to one report The medicinal properties of turmeric | The People's Pharmacy Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. United stock climbed 5 percent to $66.10 at 9:45 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an “anchor tenant” investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United’s gain was the biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which climbed 1.6 percent. \nThe airline is conducting a long-term review of its fleet plan, according to a slide presentation accompanying its investor day event in Chicago. It is considering adding more used aircraft, while also planning to “refine” the long-haul international fleet, United said. It eventually plans to convert the 61 deferred aircraft from 737-700 models into Boeing’s 737 MAX line.\nUnited announced a series of efforts to generate more revenue and savings from its worldwide route network. Improvements in the way the airline forecasts demand and manages seats is expected to create an extra $900 million to the bottom line. Cost-cutting moves will save another $700 million by 2020, compared with last year’s level.\nCosts for each seat flown a mile, or unit costs, are expected to grow by 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in 2017, excluding fuel costs, the airline said. However, unit costs are expected to grow by less than 1 percent from 2018 to 2020, after the effect of new labor deals tapers off, the company said.\nAmong the other initiatives: a new Basic Economy fare, which will go on sale in January with discounted tickets that have fewer benefits than traditional Economy tickets. Customers buying United’s new offering will not be entitled to store a bag in the overhead bin — a departure from the practice of Delta, which already has a low-price fare.\nBasic Economy will anchor United’s efforts to “segment” its cabins, or create additional fare classes with different amenities and privileges. The company also is evaluating adding a Premium Economy cabin, which would have wider seats than traditional coach and come with more amenities. United hopes to generate another $1 billion with these new cabin offerings.\nUnited also hopes to generate another $600 million through new network initiatives.\nOffsetting some of the financial improvements, United will acquire 24 of Embraer’s E-175 regional jets that earlier were going to be purchased by Republic Airways Holdings. Republic is expected to operate the jets on behalf of United.\nMichael Sasso Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.\nEmail address By signing up you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service . \nThanks for signing up!",

      "text": "United Continental Postpones Boeing 737 Jets -- Update  57:  By Doug Cameron \nUnited Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that it would postpone receiving dozens of new Boeing Co. jets to trim spending. \nThe third-largest U.S. airline will defer 61 planes from a 65-jet order for 737-700s and convert them into the new Max model with yet-to-be-determined arrival dates. Boeing will switch the remaining four to the larger 737-800 model for delivery next year. United is expected to acquire the Max 9 version of the plane. \nThe basic economy class entitles fliers only to an under-seat bag, a move also intended to avoid the delays caused by passengers stowing overhead baggage, and continues the segmentation of fares that is being pursued by other carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. \nThe moves are among a parade of planned changes unveiled by United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and his new management team that includes cost cuts and revenue-boosting initiatives designed to increase profits by $4.8 billion by 2020. \nThe fleet changes are among the industry's largest since Southwest Airlines Co. in June reached a deal with Boeing to defer 67 of its 737 Max deliveries scheduled for the 2019-2022 period until 2023 and beyond. \nUnited expects the fleet changes to cut capital spending over the next two years by $1.6 billion. \nBoeing and Airbus Group SE have order books for their best-selling jets stretching out for several years of production, and typically overbook knowing that some planes will be canceled or deferred. United canceled an order for 12 Airbus single-aisle planes in late 2013. \n\"We constantly work with our airline customers to meet their evolving needs, and our healthy 737 backlog of 4,321 airplanes gives us the flexibility to meet those needs,\" Boeing said in a statement. \nUnited also plans changes to flights at its three big hubs in Chicago, Newark and Houston that it hopes will add $ 900 million in incremental revenue by 2019. Changes include using larger aircraft on some routes and changing flight times to improve connections, as well as revamping its demand forecasting systems. \nThe Chicago-based carrier is also buying 24 Embraer 175 jets from the Brazilian manufacturer rather than leasing them from Republic Airways Holdings Inc., which is under bankruptcy protection. \nUnited said it would continue reviewing its widebody aircraft needs and consider adding more used jets in addition to the Airbus A320 family planes it is already leasing from AerCap Holdings NV. \nThe company's shares were recently up 1.2% at $63.72, trailing gains at Southwest and American Airlines Group Inc. \nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com (END)  161057ET  ",

      "text": "Boeing targets Latin America for widebody sales Boeing targets Latin America for widebody sales 15 November, 2016 BY: Jon Hemmerdinger Mexico City \nBoeing sees big sales potential in the evolving Latin American market, with the company particularly targeting carriers in Argentina and Mexico for sales of new widebodies. \nVan Rex Gallard, Boeing Commercial Airplane's vice-president of sales for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, \ncalls Mexico the \"darling of Latin America\". \nThe country has a relatively-strong economy, he says, and Mexican carriers are increasingly forming closer ties with foreign airlines, which could shake up the market. \nMeanwhile, Mexico's low-cost carriers have largely already stretched the range of their narrowbodies are may soon consider acquiring widebodies to carry the next phase of their growth, Gallard says. \nVolaris or Interjet, he adds, could potentially use widebodies to cross the Atlantic. \n\"We are waiting for the widebody face of the LCC,\" Gallard says, adding that the 787-8 or 787-9 would be ideal for transatlantic routes. \"That's what I see as the next more for growing Boeing in Latin America.\" \nPotential sales to Cuban airlines remain in limbo, but Gallard sees opportunities for orders from Panama's Copa Airlines, which some people have speculated could become a strategic partner of Avianca. \n\"The question is, what's next for Copa?\" says Gallard. \"If Copa goes into Avianca, it would be a huge win for the Boeing company.\" \nGallard says he is \"bullish\" about sales opportunities in Argentina, particularly sales to Aerolineas Argentinas. \nThough that carrier has notable labour problems, Aerolineas Argentinas will need to replace several Airbus A340s coming off leases in 2018, Gallard says. \n\"We believe that the 787-9 has a great opportunity\" at Aerolineas Argentinas, Gallard says. \"They are the most attractive airline for new business right now.\" \nGallard sees opportunities elsewhere, such as in the Caribbean. \nHe says that in the first quarter of 2017 there could be an announcement of a 737 Max order from Trinidad-based Caribbean Airlines, which currently operates 12 737-800s, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer. \n\"The natural move is to go into the Max,\" says Gallard of Caribbean.",

REUTERS/Jim Young By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE \nSEATTLE Boeing Co ( BA.N ) shares dropped on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings ( UAL.N ) said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners worth nearly $5 billion at list prices, and buy newer 737 models for delivery in later years. \nThe decision called into question Boeing's plans to increase production of one of its biggest money makers over the next two years, and its ability to generate more cash for investors. \n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \n\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" he said. \nBoeing shares were down 1.4 percent at $147.86 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \nBoeing had planned to increase 737 production to 57 a month in 2019, up from 42 a month currently, with interim step-ups to 47 and 52 a month along the way. \nOn Oct. 26, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company was on track to raise 737 output as planned and signaled demand remained strong for the jet even at higher production rates. \"Importantly,\" he said, \"even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be over sold.\" \nUnited said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737-700 planes originally due in the next two years and will replace them with newer 737 MAX planes at undetermined dates. Orders for four other 737-700s will be converted to larger 737-800s due for delivery in 2017, United said. \nThe moves reduce United's capital spending by $1.6 billion through 2018. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) Next In Deals GE signs Exelon in its largest power-plant software deal \nSEATTLE General Electric Co has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday.",

      "text": "Market News   11:33am EST Boeing shares fall as United Airlines cancels 737 order By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE \nSEATTLE Nov 15 Boeing Co shares dropped on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners worth nearly $5 billion at list prices, and buy newer 737 models for delivery in later years. \nThe decision called into question Boeing's plans to increase production of one of its biggest money makers over the next two years, and its ability to generate more cash for investors. \n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \n\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" he said. \nBoeing shares were down 1.4 percent at $147.86 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \nBoeing had planned to increase 737 production to 57 a month in 2019, up from 42 a month currently, with interim step-ups to 47 and 52 a month along the way. \nOn Oct. 26, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company was on track to raise 737 output as planned and signaled demand remained strong for the jet even at higher production rates. \"Importantly,\" he said, \"even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be over sold.\" \nUnited said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737-700 planes originally due in the next two years and will replace them with newer 737 MAX planes at undetermined dates. Orders for four other 737-700s will be converted to larger 737-800s due for delivery in 2017, United said. \nThe moves reduce United's capital spending by $1.6 billion through 2018.

      "text": "Aircraft: Boeing 787-8 Seat: 3G (Business Class) \nWe boarded through door L2, where we were greeted by two flight attendants and pointed left. Azerbaijan’s business class cabin consists of just 18 seats, spread across three rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class cabin \nThese are the same standard fully flat forward facing business class seats you’ll find on several other airlines operating the 787, including Hainan , LOT , Xiamen , etc. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class cabin \nThe seat finishes themselves were rather bland, though the blankets and headrest covers added a touch of color to the cabin. \nWe had assigned ourselves the aisle and window seat on the right side in row three. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class seats \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class seats \nMy preference is always to sit in the back corner of the cabin , though in the case of Azerbaijan’s 787s, unfortunately there’s a misaligned window in row three, so you’ll have to lean way forward in order to look out. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class legroom \nEach seat had an ottoman in front of it, which became part of the bed when the seat was fully reclined. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class seats \nThe seat controls were located on the center armrest, and were easy to use. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class seat controls \nUnderneath the center armrest was a cupholder as well as the entertainment control, USB outlet, and power outlet. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class entertainment controls \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class power outlet \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class USB outlet and headphone jack \nThe center armrest had a button you could push to raise it, which is intended to be a privacy partition if you recline the seat into bed mode. While it doesn’t add all that much privacy, it’s better than nothing, especially if you happen to be seated next to a stranger. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class privacy partition \nThose who tend to overheat on planes will be happy to know that Azerbaijan has individual air nozzles on their 787, which far too many airlines don’t have . \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 air vents \nAlready waiting at our seats on boarding were beautiful packages with bows around them. The package at my seat had a pillow, a light blanket, a mattress sheet, and pajamas. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class blanket, pajamas, and pillow \nThe blanket was made of a fleece-like material, and had the Azerbaijan Airlines logo prominently displayed on it. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class blanket \nThen there was a mattress sheet for when you’re ready to sleep. I also loved how big the pillow was. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class blanket & pillow \nIt’s always a nice treat to get pajamas in business class, and I quite liked the style of Azerbaijan’s pajamas. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class pajamas \nWithin a few minutes of settling in, one of the flight attendants came by our seats to offer us pre-departure beverages. The choice was between lemonade, apple juice, cherry juice, and water. I chose the cherry juice, while Tiffany chose the lemonade. I mainly ordered the cherry juice because I was intrigued, though it ended up being too sweet for me, which I should have seen coming. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class pre-departure drinks \nMoments later we were offered the drink list for the flight. We asked about the menu, and the flight attendant apologized that they didn’t have menus loaded for this flight. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class drink list \nAbout 10 minutes later the crew came through the cabin with a cart containing newspapers, magazines, and amenity kits. The amenity kit was a nice leather pouch, and was well stocked. It had things like socks, eyeshades, a shoehorn, a razor and shaving cream, a comb, lip palm, earplugs, a toothbrush and toothpaste, etc. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class amenity kit \nThe coolest part of the amenity kit was the hand cream and face mist from Azerbaijan. I was also impressed by how big the bottles were — the hand cream was a three ounce tube. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class amenity kit contents \nObserving the boarding process was interesting. While economy seemed to be pretty full, there were only five other people in business class (for a total of seven passengers). \nSeated in front of us was a couple that I believe was from Azerbaijan. The lady had a Park Hyatt New York garment bag, and was so rude to the crew. She barked commands at them, forcefully handed the flight attendant the garment bag when she had a drink tray in the other hand, etc. \nThen there were three other middle aged men all traveling separately spread out in rows one and two. \nThe boarding process was pretty efficient, and by 12:15PM it was announced that boarding was complete. \nThe crew made so many announcements throughout the boarding process, the most common of which was that passengers should take the seats assigned on their boarding passes. That specifically was announced six times. I’m not sure if that’s something they have a lot of issues with, or what, but I found that a bit odd. \nWhile it was announced that boarding was complete at 12:15PM, the door didn’t actually close. We waited and waited and waited, with no announcements from the pilots or flight attendants. \nFinally at 12:55PM the door closed, and five minutes later we began our pushback. \nAt that point the purser made her welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 10hr35min. Moments later the safety video was screened. The audio and video weren’t synced, so it was strange to watch, since the audio track was a few seconds off from what was being shown on the screen. \nAfter the safety video the crew came through the cabin to distribute candy. Funny enough I experienced the same thing on Air Astana recently , but it’s not something you otherwise often see. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class candy \nAt 1:10PM we began our taxi to the runway. \nTaxiing at JFK \nFortunately the taxi was pretty quick, and about 10 minutes later we were holding short of runway 31L waiting for a few other planes to take off, including an EL AL 747. \nEL AL 747 taking off JFK \nFinally at 1:25PM we were cleared to taxi into position on the runway, with a Korean Air A380 immediately behind us. \nWaiting for takeoff JFK Airport \nWithin moments of taxiing into position we were cleared for takeoff. \nTaxiing onto departure runway JFK Airport \nOur climb out was smooth, and I especially enjoyed the view of all the terminals shortly after takeoff. \nView after takeoff from JFK \nView after takeoff from JFK \nFurther into our climb I could even see Manhattan in the distance. \nView after takeoff from JFK \nThe seatbelt sign was turned off about five minutes after takeoff. \nView after takeoff from JFK \nAfter takeoff I quickly checked out the business class lavatory, located behind the cabin. The lavatory was pretty standard for a 787. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class lavatory \nThe one cool feature was that it was a bidet toilet, which I’ve otherwise only ever seen on Japanese airlines . \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class lavatory bidet \nI also briefly checked out the premium economy cabin, located behind the business class cabin. \nAzerbaijan Airlines premium economy cabin 787 \nAzerbaijan’s 787 premium economy cabin consists of a total of 35 seats, spread across five rows in a 2-3-2 configuration. \nAzerbaijan Airlines premium economy cabin 787 \nThe product looked fantastic, with tons of legroom. This is easily the most spacious premium economy product I’ve seen. Back in the day Azerbaijan used to sell business class as first class and premium economy as business class, though fortunately they’ve come to their senses on that. Still, this must be one of the most impressive premium economy products out there. The craziest part? There were only two people in the entire premium economy cabin. \nAzerbaijan Airlines premium economy cabin 787 \nBack at our seats, the two business class flight attendants, Aysel and Leyla, came through the cabin to take meal orders. There were no printed menus, and on top of that there was a communication barrier, which is a rough combination. Aysel explained that we could choose between chicken, beef, lamb, lobster, and pasta. That’s a lot of main course choices! They also asked whether we wanted to eat now or later, so it’s nice that they give you the option. \nAZAL 787 business class cabin after takeoff \nAfter that they distributed headphones, and then also warm towels. \nAZAL business class headphones \nAZAL business class hot towels \nAt that point the lunch service began. While I don’t have the food menu, the drink list read as follows: \nJust 25 minutes after takeoff the crew came through the cabin with a drink trolley. I was impressed that they got the service started so quickly, given that on many other airlines it’s often an hour into the flight before you get your first drink. \nAfter all the amazing Serbian wines we tried on Air Serbia , we figured we would try an Azerbaijani wine on Azerbaijan Airlines. That ended up being a mistake, as it wasn’t good at all, and on top of that, was served at room temperature. The drink was served with mixed nuts. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — champagne and mixed nuts \nAfter that the crew came through the cabin with a trolley containing all the tableware. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch service \nThe table setup was impressive, including a breadbasket, olives, and flower-looking butter. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch table setting \nI loved the fact that the crew displayed all the food choices on the trolley, so you could just point at whatever you wanted. Throughout the meal they also encouraged overindulging, always asking if anyone wanted anything else. \nFor the starter I had the shrimp appetizer, as well as a potato salad with pineapple. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — appetizer & salad \nThe shrimp appetizer was great, and it had a nice kick to it thanks to the cocktail sauce and the salsa, which even made the asparagus tasty. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — shrimp appetizer \nI ordered the potato salad with pineapple because it sounded interesting, and it didn’t disappoint. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — potato salad with pineapple \nTiffany had the chicken and roast beef starter and a garden salad. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — roast beef and chicken appetizer \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — garden salad \nThe crew separately brought out garlic bread after the starter, which wasn’t otherwise in the breadbasket. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — garlic bread \nAfter that we were offered a soup course. It’s funny how the crew offered this. \n“We have a soup, do you want?” \n“Sure!” \n“Good.” \nThe soup was a cream of mushroom soup, though it was very watery. I don’t necessarily mind that, though without a proper soup spoon it can be tough to eat (and as you can see, good presentation is tough, especially with a shallow bowl). \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — cream of mushroom soup \nNext we were served the main course. I took a risk and ordered the lobster, and it was very good, surprisingly. I just wish they hadn’t doused it in a cream sauce, which seemed unnecessary. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — lobster \nTiffany had the lamb, which she said wasn’t as good as the one she had on the Aeroflot a few days prior. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — lamb \nNext the dessert trolley was rolled through the cabin. They did a great job with the display, given that they plated the cheesecake and fruit on the trolley in front of you. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — dessert trolley \nThe portions were ridiculous, as the crew basically insisted on us trying everything. In the end I ordered a cheese plate, the cheesecake, and the mixed berries (meaning I skipped the petit fours). \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class lunch — dessert selection \nAfter the meal we were offered coffee. I asked about a cappuccino, though the flight attendant warned me that the cappuccino would be powdered. I appreciated the warning, so stuck with coffee. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class coffee \nOverall the meal was good. The quantities were huge, while the quality was decent, though not amazing. \nI’m still a little bit conflicted about the service. The crew was well intentioned and mostly friendly, though also distant (which is likely just due to a cultural barrier). They were efficient in the sense that drinks were out quickly after takeoff, and the entire meal was done less than two hours into the flight. \nHowever, at the same time the entire production felt amateur, as they seemed especially disorganized. There were only seven passengers, but despite that they were constantly running from one galley to the other, passing stuff between aisles, etc. It’s tough to explain, but it all just felt a bit off. Perhaps that’s not the crew’s fault, but rather the overall organization of the galleys and carts, as dictated by the company. \nAfter lunch I tried to use the entertainment system, though unfortunately my system was broken. As it turned out, three of the six systems in row three were broken. Not only that, but the power ports were broken at four of the seats as well. I don’t get how you can maintain a brand new 787 so poorly. What a shame. \nSo I decided to go to seat 3A in hopes of sleeping. I would have moved seats anyway, since we had the entire row to ourselves. \nAzerbaijan Airlines 787 business class bed \nOnce the flight attendants saw that I was going to sleep they brought me a bottle of water. \nAzerbaijan Airlines business class bottled water \nBy the time I was settled in we were just over St John’s, leaving the east coast of Canada, with about eight hours to go to Baku. \nAirshow enroute to Baku \nAirshow enroute to Baku \nI briefly browsed the entertainment selection given that I finally had a working system. Even when it worked, the system was frustrating. I couldn’t figure out how to preview the selection on my TV, but rather could only do so on the handset, which I found annoying. I far prefer browsing the selection on a larger screen. The entertainment selection itself seemed fine, though. \nAzerbaijan Airlines entertainment selection \nAzerbaijan Airlines entertainment selection \nAzerbaijan Airlines entertainment selection \nI knew Azerbaijan Airlines didn’t have wifi, though for whatever reason decided to check, as sometimes airlines surprise us. Well, after turning on my phone I discovered there was an “AZAL_OnAir” network. Unfortunately my phone couldn’t connect. When I asked the crew about this I got a blank stare. \nAnyone who is better at tech have an idea how that could be? Are they in the process of installing it and just haven’t activated it yet, or…? \nAzerbaijan’s mystery wifi? \nAfter lunch I tried to sleep, and ended up staying reclined for about three hours. I didn’t sleep especially well, not because of the seat, but I think rather because it was still early in the day, and I just wasn’t naturally tired. \nEveryone else in the cabin seemed to be sound asleep, though. So I was a bit surprised when at the halfway point of the flight the crew turned the lights all the way up. I figured a crewmember accidentally pushed the wrong button, but nope, the lights stayed on. \nAirshow enroute to Baku \nI was confused at first, though about 30 minutes later the crew came through the cabin with a snack service. That makes no sense since most passengers didn’t seem hungry or awake. I can understand offering people a snack on demand, but specifically waking people halfway through a 10 hour redeye for a snack is beyond bizarre, especially when you turn the lights all the way on 30 minutes before it’s served. \nBelow is a picture of the selection that was available on the cart. \nAzerbaijan business class mid-flight snack \nI’m not sure what exactly everything was, but I ended up just pointing at a few things, including an empanada and a spring roll. \nAzerbaijan business class mid-flight snack \nAfter that snack service the lights were turned off again, and most passengers went back to sleep. \nAt this point I was awake and couldn’t sleep, so I worked for a few hours. I managed to fall asleep about 2.5 hours before landing, but go figure 30 minutes later the cabin lights were turned all the way up again for the breakfast service. \nService began with hot towels being distributed. \nAzerbaijan business class warm towel \nAt that point tables were set, and then a trolley was rolled through the cabin with starters, including fruit, yogurt, cereal, etc. I selected some plain yogurt, which tasted great with honey. I also selected a fruit plate, which had kiwi, pineapple, berries, and melon. \nAzerbaijan business class breakfast service \nAfter that another trolley was rolled down the aisle with all kinds of things. The choices were described as cheese rolls, cold cuts, or foie gras. Hmmm… \nAzerbaijan business class breakfast selection \nI went with the cheese rolls, since I figured they’d be sweet and maybe taste like blintzes. Well, I was a bit disappointed to find that they were sour. I guess I should have known that based on the accompaniments. \nAzerbaijan business class breakfast starter \nI figured that was the entire meal, but then yet another trolley was rolled down the aisle with main courses. Goodness, the food never ends on this airline. The choice this time was between an omelet and chicken. I ordered the omelet, which was reasonably good though way too cheesy, as I find to often be the case on airplanes. \nAzerbaijan business class breakfast omelet \nAfter breakfast the lights were once again dimmed all the way, and we had about an hour to go till our arrival. \nAbout 30 minutes out we began our descent, at which point I tuned into the airshow. \nAirshow approaching Baku \nAirshow approaching Baku \nThere were no announcements from the pilots the entire flight, though they turned on the seatbelt sign about 20 minutes before landing. The views on the initial descent above the clouds were quite nice, though below the clouds it was a rainy day with limited visibility. \nView approaching Baku \nAs is the norm when visiting a new city, my eyes were glued out the window on the descent, tough as it was with the misaligned window. \nView approaching Baku \nView approaching Baku \nView approaching Baku \nWe had a smooth landing in Baku at 7:50AM, and from there about a 10 minute taxi to the gate. \nView after landing in Baku \nWe arrived at 8AM, about 30 minutes behind schedule. The windows were fogged up once we touched down, so unfortunately I couldn’t get any good pictures on our taxi in. \nUpon deplaning we found ourselves in the gorgeous Baku Airport terminal, which greatly exceeded my expectations. \nWe headed to the visa on arrival counter, where we figured we’d have to argue, given that there’s a special visa exception for people on the New York flight , and I figured they didn’t know about it. Well, that wasn’t an issue at all, and they didn’t even mention it. We each had to pay $20, and our visa on arrival was processed within a few minutes. As the guy handed us back our passports he said “welcome to Baku” with a big smile. \nWe took the escalator down towards baggage claim. \nBaku Airport baggage claim \nThen we found ourselves in the arrivals hall, where we were followed by a creepy taxi driver . \nBaku Airport arrivals hall Azerbaijan Airlines business class bottom line \nI’m rather conflicted about Azerbaijan Airlines, as there are things they do really well, and things they fail miserably at. \nAzerbaijan’s hard product is pretty standard for a 787, and perfectly acceptable. My major complaint about the hard product is how poorly it’s maintained, given the number of entertainment screens and power ports that weren’t working. I’m not sure if we were just really unlucky, or if that’s normal for AZAL. \nIn terms of the food, the quantity of food and the presentation on trolleys was impressive. I loved the way they displayed it. At the same time, the food quality varied quite a bit, and there was an unnecessary amount of food. Waking everyone who was sleeping halfway through what’s ultimately a redeye flight is silly. \nAlong similar lines, the crew was generally friendly, though the whole service process seemed a bit amateur. \nTo sum it up, I’d fly Azerbaijan again in a heartbeat if I was going to Baku or if they had a great business class fare. At the same time, they’re not an airline I’d go out of my way to fly, at least based on this experience. More from One Mile At A Time",

      "text": "Monday, November 14, 2016 08:03PM CHICAGO -- Eighteen passengers have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and American Airlines after the airplane they were on caught fire last month on the tarmac of O'Hare International Airport when part of an engine failed.About 20 people were taken to hospitals after the right engine of Miami-bound American Airlines Flight 383 broke into four pieces about 2:30 p.m. Oct. 28, according to fire officials and the National Transportation Safety Board.The suit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court also names as a defendant General Electric Aviation, claiming it sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe 767 aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane, and that they failed to provide \"assistance, supervision and instruction\" during evacuation.Spokesmen for Boeing and American declined to comment on the pending litigation. A representative for GE could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening.An NTSB report issued a week after the fire said one of the fractures on the turbine disk of the engine was \"consistent with fatigue cracking.\" Takeoff was aborted due to the \"uncontained engine failure\" that led to fuel pooling under the plane's right wing, which then burst into flames, authorities said.One piece of the turbine disk went through the inboard section of the right wing, over the fuselage and into a UPS warehouse facility more than a half-mile away. Another piece was found about 1,600 feet away, but it was still on O'Hare property, authorities said.No fire breached the cabin, and the 20 hospitalized passengers had been released a night after the fire.The five-count negligence suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages.

      "text": "Boeing to Consolidate Defense and Space Sites to Improve Operating Efficiency El Segundo, Long Beach, Seal Beach, St. Louis, Huntsville gaining jobs International units aligned in new global operations group \nST. LOUIS, Nov. 15, 2016 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] is taking steps to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through facilities consolidations and work movements that will increase employment in Los Angeles County, St. Louis, and Huntsville, Ala. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nBy the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. \nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. \nWith the moves, Los Angeles County gains about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400. \n“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” \nTo bolster that effort, Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom will be aligned and managed in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth. He will also continue as managing director of Boeing Defence UK. While Pitchforth will report directly to Caret, those three organizations will continue operating independently. \nFor more information on Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com .

El Segundo, Long Beach, Seal Beach and St. Louis will also benefit.\nIn a company announcement, Boeing said it is taking steps to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through facilities consolidations and work movements that will increase employment in Los Angeles County, St. Louis, and Huntsville, Ala.\nHuntsville’s positions will be in the areas of missile defense engineering, advanced manufacturing and administrative support.\n“This Boeing announcement today of 400 additional jobs in Madison County, Alabama once again highlights Boeing’s 100 year history to our Nation’s defense and intelligence sectors,” said Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong. “These 400 jobs will take Boeing’s footprint to just over 3100 jobs in Alabama. This only furthers their commitment to our region and once again shows that Madison County is perfectly positioned in every aspect related to missile defense, space and national security.”\n“Boeing’s announcement reinforces our strategic pivot back to research and development after achieving much success in advanced manufacturing,” said Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle. “Huntsville is a knowledge based economy and Boeing continues to invest here because our talent pool matches the needs of their workforce requirements. Boeing has been a tremendous corporate partner, and we are thrilled to play an important role in the company’s ability to create greater efficiencies. It is Huntsville’s talent that will help Boeing meet the needs of the warfighter and, in turn, help secure our nation and that of our allies.”\nBy the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala.\nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila.

      "text": "Safran Delivers the First Jet Engine Exhaust System Component for Boeing's 777X Airplane  14   LE HAVRE , France , November   The initial jet engine exhaust system component for Boeing's new 777X airplane has been delivered by Safran Nacelles, achieving another on-time milestone in this Safran group company's first major role as a supplier to the U.S. aircraft manufacturer. Provided to Boeing was the exhaust system's center body - a complex-shaped unit that contributes to the proper aerodynamic flow of exhaust from the 777X's General Electric GE9X turbofan engines. \"On-time deliveries and meeting Boeing's high expectations are Safran Nacelles' priorities for this program, and we are fully committed to meeting our commitments on the 777X exhaust system,\" said Jean-Paul Alary, the President of Safran Nacelles. \"We're building a strong and valued relationship with Boeing based on our experience in nacelle integration, and we look forward to additional opportunities to grow our association in the future.\" The two-piece exhaust system center body was delivered from Safran Nacelles' Le Havre , France , production facility. It is composed primarily of titanium and incorporates an acoustically treated area for reduced engine noise levels. A second development unit is in production at Safran Nacelles for delivery to Boeing before year-end, involving the center body, the nozzle and the center vent tube - representing a complete exhaust system. The 777X's exhaust systems are among the largest of their type ever manufactured for civil aircraft, and fully benefit from titanium's lower mass and increased resistance to heat in jet engine applications. Safran i s a leading international high-technology group with three core businesses: Aerospace (propulsion and equipment), Defence and Security. Operating worldwide, the Group has 70,000 employees and generated sales of 17.4 billion euros in 2015. Safran is listed on Euronext Paris and is part of the CAC40 index, as well as the Euro Stoxx 50 European index. Safran Nacelles is the world's second leading supplier of aircraft engine nacelles, with more than 17,000 in service, logging over 100,000 flight-hours per day. It supplies nacelles and components for all segments of the aviation market, from business and regional jets to mainline commercial jets.

      "text": "Boeing shares fall as United Airlines cancels 737 order Reuters Photo: \nBy Alwyn Scott \nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> shares dropped on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings <UAL.N> said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners worth nearly $5 billion at list prices, and buy newer 737 models for delivery in later years. \nThe decision called into question Boeing's plans to increase production of one of its biggest money makers over the next two years, and its ability to generate more cash for investors. \n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \n\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" he said. \nBoeing shares were down 1.4 percent at $147.86 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \nBoeing had planned to increase 737 production to 57 a month in 2019, up from 42 a month currently, with interim step-ups to 47 and 52 a month along the way. \nOn Oct. 26, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company was on track to raise 737 output as planned and signaled demand remained strong for the jet even at higher production rates. \"Importantly,\" he said, \"even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be over sold.\" \nUnited said it will cancel orders for 61 Boeing 737-700 planes originally due in the next two years and will replace them with newer 737 MAX planes at undetermined dates. Orders for four other 737-700s will be converted to larger 737-800s due for delivery in 2017, United said. \nThe moves reduce United's capital spending by $1.6 billion through 2018. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",

      "text": "Boeing said Tuesday it will close some defense and space facilities around the country over the next four years, reducing its overall footprint by approximately 4.5 million square feet and moving the work of more than 3,500 employees to new sites.\nAbout 1,000 defense-side workers in Kent will move to Tukwila. The Kent site has been shrinking for some years.\nBoeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. And many positions in Huntington Beach, Calif., will move to other Southern California sites in El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala.\nWith the moves, which will begin in 2017, Los Angeles County will gain about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400, Boeing said.\n    5,000   Sawant's   The consolidation comes as Boeing’s defense business contracts. \nCongress has in recent years been limiting defense budget growth, while Boeing has failed to win the biggest new military contracts, including the loss to Northrop Grumman of the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber program. \nAnd sharp new competition from private companies such as SpaceX has cut profits in the space sector .\nIn the first nine months of this year, profit in the company’s defense and space unit was down 5 percent from a year earlier.\nLeanne Caret, president and chief executive of Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security division, said the moves “will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration”\nDominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

      "text": "November 15, 2016 12:57 PM Boeing adding 500 jobs in St. Louis Brad Nettles Order Reprint of this Story \nBoeing plans to add 500 jobs to its St. Louis operations, the company announced Tuesday. \nBoeing, in a news release, said the company is looking to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through consolidation of facilities and work movements that is expected to increase employment in Los Angeles County, St. Louis, and Huntsville, Ala. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security, in a news release. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nBy the end of 2020, Boeing hopes to reduce facilities space by about 4.5 million square feet, according to the reduce. In addition, positions in Huntington Beach will be relocated to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. \nLikewise, positions in Kent, Wash., will relocate to nearby Tukwila, the news release states. Boeing said it will close its sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. \nWith the moves, Los Angeles County gains the most positions at 1,600, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400. \n“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said in the news release. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” Related content",

      "text": "ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- Boeing is working to streamline its Defense, Space & Security business through facilities consolidations. By the end of 2020, the Chicago based company plans to reduce facilities space by around 4.5 million square feet. Positions in Huntington Beach, CA will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach also in California. Other positions will move to St. Louis and Huntsville, AL. St. Louis should gain about 500 jobs through the consolidation.\nSome workers in Kent, WA, will move to Tukwila, WA. Boeing will close its El Paso, TX, and Newington, VA sites.\nBoeing’s Defense, Space & Security business is headquartered in St. Louis. The company currently employs around 14,000 workers in the St. Louis area.\nU.S. Senator Claire McCaskill released the following statement on Boeing’s announcement :\nBoeing’s decision to move more than 500 jobs to Missouri makes perfect sense—because the St. Louis region, and frankly our entire state, offer one of the most dedicated, innovative workforces in the country, and play a critical role on our nation’s defense. These jobs will be a big win, for the company, for our economy, and for hundreds of Missourians, and I look forward to continuing to work with Boeing as it begins this exciting transition.\n. @BoeingDefense is investing in customer focus areas: commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space & unmanned. pic.twitter.com/rhRMv5PcLi \n— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) October 26, 2016 \n\n",

      "text": "United Continental Holdings will defer delivery of 61 of Boeing's smallest passenger jets as the airline seeks to close its profit gap with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines .\nUnited plans to convert the order to the larger, newer Boeing 737 Max to be delivered at an undetermined date, slowing near-term capacity growth as recent hires President Scott Kirby and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy start to reshape the fleet strategy. The shift will trim spending by $1.6 billion over the next two years, according to a statement Tuesday by the Chicago-based carrier.\nThe fleet changes are part of $4.8 billion in initiatives intended to bolster the airline's profitability through 2020. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. United's operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta's 19 percent margin and American's 15.1 percent.\nUnited climbed 2.8 percent to $64.71 at 11:51 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an \"anchor tenant\" investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United's gain was the second biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which rose 1.6 percent.\nBoeing's retiring boomers underscore U.S. manufacturing plight Julie Johnsson John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing.

He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today's sleek 787 Dreamliner.\nThe date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery's calendar...\n(Julie Johnsson) United unveiled other efforts to reap greater revenue and savings from its worldwide route network. Improvements in the way the airline forecasts demand and manages seats is expected to generate an extra $900 million annually. Cost-cutting moves will save another $700 million by 2020, compared with last year's level.\nCosts for each seat flown a mile, or unit costs, are expected to grow by 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in 2017, excluding fuel costs, the airline said. However, unit costs are expected to grow by less than 1 percent from 2018 to 2020, after the effect of new labor deals tapers off, the company said.\nThe airline also joined Delta in rolling out a new Basic Economy fare, which will go on sale in January with discounted tickets that have fewer benefits than traditional Economy tickets.\nCustomers buying United's new offering will not be entitled to store a bag in the overhead bin -- a departure from the practice of Delta, which already has a low-price fare. Passengers in Basic Economy will be able to bring a small personal item on-board and store it under the seat. United's approach will resemble the policy of discount carrier Spirit Airlines Inc., which charges extra for carry-on bags.\nUnited pares down perks - like carry-on bags - with 'Basic Economy' fares Lauren Zumbach United Airlines is trying to woo budget airlines' passengers with new \"Basic Economy\" fares that will go on sale early next year.\nThe fare strategy, which United has worked on for months and detailed Tuesday, offers the cheapest seats on a plane in exchange for giving up the few perks that come...\nUnited Airlines is trying to woo budget airlines' passengers with new \"Basic Economy\" fares that will go on sale early next year.\nThe fare strategy, which United has worked on for months and detailed Tuesday, offers the cheapest seats on a plane in exchange for giving up the few perks that come...\n(Lauren Zumbach) Basic Economy will anchor United's efforts to \"segment\" its cabins, or create additional fare classes with different amenities and privileges. The company also is evaluating adding a Premium Economy cabin, which would have wider seats than traditional coach and come with more amenities. United hopes to generate another $1 billion with these new cabin offerings.\nThe airline is conducting a long-term review of its fleet plan, executives said. Potential moves range from adding more used aircraft to refining its long-haul aircraft amid an uncertain economic climate.\nThe company is also reshaping its domestic strategy. United had ordered 65 of Boeing's 737-700 jets in two batches over the past year, taking advantage of attractive prices for aircraft near the end of their production run after reviewing Bombardier's C Series to replace flying handled by regional affiliates.\nUnited Airlines shows its priority: The wealthy How wonderful to hear that United is spending $200 million to upgrade its O'Hare International Airport lounges for its elite, wealthy customers so they can have 63 minutes away from the crowds! Oh, and “inspired” food options! I did not realize United was now a restaurateur as well as an airline....\nHow wonderful to hear that United is spending $200 million to upgrade its O'Hare International Airport lounges for its elite, wealthy customers so they can have 63 minutes away from the crowds! Oh, and “inspired” food options! I did not realize United was now a restaurateur as well as an airline....\nRead the story In a switch, the carrier is bolstering its United Express regional fleet. United will now acquire 24 of Embraer's E-175 regional jets that earlier were going to be purchased by Republic Airways Holdings Inc. Republic is expected to operate the jets on behalf of United.\nMeanwhile, United is switching four of the current generation 737s on order to the -800 variant to be delivered over the next two years as planned. The new strategy will leave United with a fleet of 150 Max, including 99 of Boeing's largest narrowbody model. The U.S. planemaker plans to start delivering the upgraded 737 family next year with the Max 8, followed by the Max 9 in 2018.\nUnited joins a spate of carriers deferring aircraft deliveries, stoking concerns of a cool-down in the global aerospace market. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines , International Consolidated Airlines Group and Turkish Airlines have also tapped the brakes on some deliveries in recent months. Boeing shares fell 1.7 percent to $147.45 in New York.\n\"We're excited that United will be adding even more MAXs to its future fleet, and we appreciate their confidence in the airplane,\" Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. \"We constantly work with our airline customers to meet their evolving needs, and our healthy 737 backlog of 4,321 airplanes gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.\"",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, …\nBy Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera\nSEATTLE/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) shares fell on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) said it will defer jetliner orders worth nearly $5 billion as part of a cost-saving drive.\nThe airline's decision affects Boeing's 737 jet, one of its biggest moneymakers, and raised some fears that Boeing may not lift 737 production as planned and could miss financial targets. The world's biggest plane maker said United's move would have no impact on production.\nUnited, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passengers, said it will convert orders for 61 Boeing 737-700 planes due to be delivered in the next two years into the newer 737 MAX model, but that it was still deciding on which size MAX planes to order and when they would be delivered, creating uncertainty for Boeing investors.\nUnited also will convert orders for four 737-700s to larger 737-800s due for delivery in 2017.\nBoeing shares fell 1.8 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange and were last down 1.6 percent at $147.56. United shares rose 3.4 percent to $65.08.\n\"We don't know when are they (the MAXs) going to come but they are going to come as 737 MAX, most likely MAX 8 or 9s,\" United Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said on a conference call with analysts. \n\"The reason we are doing this primarily is because we just don't need these airplanes right now.\"\n\nBOEING STICKS TO PLAN\nBoeing said United's move would not alter its planned increases in 737 production rates and stressed it continues to have orders for more 737s than it can produce. Boeing will keep the 737-700s on its books until United finalizes the MAX order. \nUnited's orders \"will switch over to MAXs on the order book when (the order is) finalized,\" Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said. Boeing's 737 order backlog of 4,321 airplanes \"gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.\"\nBoeing affirmed recent comments by Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg that 737 output will rise to 57 a month in 2019 from 42 a month currently with interim steps to 47 and 52 a month.\n\"Importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold,\" Muilenburg had said on Oct. 26.\nSome analysts said United's decision would only reduce the number of oversold jets, with no impact on output.\nBut others worried that converting 61 current-generation orders to MAX orders implied a production delay. Boeing's factory is phasing out current generation 737s as it switches to the MAX, which is due to enter service next year. \n\"It looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \nHitting 52 a month \"seems to be a slam dunk,\" Russ Solomon, analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said of Boeing's rate increases. But reaching 57 a month \"remains more of a question mark.\"\nHe said Boeing is supposed to begin generating more cash from 787 production starting next year. Moody's was not altering its rating on Boeing. \n\"They actually have a bit of a 'rich' problem\" on 737s, Solomon said. \"They probably cannot deliver all of the planes they have committed to near term.\"\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Tom Brown)",

(April 6, 2016) Jerry Siebenmark File photo i Order Reprint of this Story \nUnited Airlines will convert the bulk of two orders for Boeing’s best-selling narrowbody jetliner to the planemaker’s newest variant. \nThe Chicago-based airline is changing its orders for 65 Boeing jets from all 737-700s to four 737-800s and 61 737 Maxes. \nUnited said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday that it expects to receive the 737-800s next year while delivery dates for the 737 Max jets are “to be determined.” \n“These changes will allow United to take advantage of the superior fuel efficiency of the MAX aircraft while also reducing capital expenditures by approximately $1.6 billion through 2018,” the airline said in its filing. \nThe order change comes before Boeing planned to increase its monthly production rate on the 737 from 42 aircraft a month to 47. \nSpirit AeroSystems in Wichita manufactures 70 percent of the current 737 Next Generation aircraft, and will do the same for the new Max variant.",

      "title": "Boeing to Consolidate Defense Sites, Cutting 500 Jobs",
      "text": "Boeing to Consolidate Defense Sites, Cutting 500 Jobs By: Valerie Insinna, November 15, 2016 (Photo Credit: USAF/Staff Sgt. Larry E. Reid Jr.) WASHINGTON — Boeing plans to consolidate its defense and space business by 2020, a move that entails closing several sites and eliminating 500 jobs over the four-year period, the company said Tuesday. The aerospace firm put a positive spin on the announcement, citing job growth for facilities in St. Louis, Los Angeles County and Huntsville, Alabama. However, Boeing will shutter its plants in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Virginia. “In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing’s defense, space and security business, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” Boeing plans to shed about 4.5 million square feet of excess infrastructure during the four-year consolidation process, it said in a news release. About 1,600 jobs — many from Huntington Beach, California — will move to Boeing facilities in El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach in Southern California. The company’s St. Louis sites will pick up 500 workers and Huntsville with grow by 400 positions, with many of those jobs coming from Huntington Beach. Some positions currently in Kent, Washington, will also transfer to the Tukwila facility located 20 minutes down the road in the same state. The company estimates a potential job loss of about 500 employees as a result of the consolidation, said spokesman Kenneth Smith, but some of those workers may be able to transfer to other positions within Boeing. The company has not yet determined which programs will be relocated to Huntsville, St. Louis or the Southern California facilities. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Boeing’s consolidation effort was unexpected, but not a big surprise considering the firm’s emphasis on lowering its operating expenses. “They’ve been taking steps to rationalize their far-flung BDS presence for years, most notably when they pulled out of Wichita,” he said in an email. “Of all the defense primes, Boeing is the one most focused on cost reductions.” ",

LOUIS \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations - El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Related content",

      "text": "November 15, 2016 12:44 PM Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By JIM SALTER Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story ST. LOUIS \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations - El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Related content",

      "text": "United to postpone Boeing jets in $4.8 billion savings push Tue Nov 15th, 2016 1:04pm   \nBy Michael Sasso and Julie Johnsson \nBloomberg \nUnited Continental Holdings will defer delivery of 61 of Boeing’s smallest passenger jets as the airline seeks to close its profit gap with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. \nUnited plans to convert the order to the larger, newer Boeing 737 Max to be delivered at an undetermined date, slowing near-term capacity growth as recent hires President Scott Kirby and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy start to reshape the fleet strategy. The shift will trim spending by $1.6 billion over the next two years, according to a statement Tuesday by the Chicago-based carrier. \nThe fleet changes are part of $4.8 billion in initiatives intended to bolster the airline’s profitability through 2020. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. United’s operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta’s 19 percent margin and American’s 15.1 percent. \nUnited climbed 2.8 percent to $64.71 at 11:51 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an “anchor tenant” investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United’s gain was the second biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which rose 1.6 percent. \nUnited unveiled other efforts to reap greater revenue and savings from its worldwide route network. Improvements in the way the airline forecasts demand and manages seats is expected to generate an extra $900 million annually. Cost-cutting moves will save another $700 million by 2020, compared with last year’s level. \nCosts for each seat flown a mile, or unit costs, are expected to grow by 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in 2017, excluding fuel costs, the airline said. However, unit costs are expected to grow by less than 1 percent from 2018 to 2020, after the effect of new labor deals tapers off, the company said. \nThe airline also joined Delta in rolling out a new Basic Economy fare, which will go on sale in January with discounted tickets that have fewer benefits than traditional Economy tickets. \nCustomers buying United’s new offering will not be entitled to store a bag in the overhead bin — a departure from the practice of Delta, which already has a low-price fare. Passengers in Basic Economy will be able to bring a small personal item on-board and store it under the seat. United’s approach will resemble the policy of discount carrier Spirit Airlines Inc., which charges extra for carry-on bags. \nBasic Economy will anchor United’s efforts to “segment” its cabins, or create additional fare classes with different amenities and privileges. The company also is evaluating adding a Premium Economy cabin, which would have wider seats than traditional coach and come with more amenities. United hopes to generate another $1 billion with these new cabin offerings. \nThe airline is conducting a long-term review of its fleet plan, executives said. Potential moves range from adding more used aircraft to refining its long-haul aircraft amid an uncertain economic climate. \nThe company is also reshaping its domestic strategy. United had ordered 65 of Boeing’s 737-700 jets in two batches over the past year, taking advantage of attractive prices for aircraft near the end of their production run after reviewing Bombardier’s C Series to replace flying handled by regional affiliates. \nIn a switch, the carrier is bolstering its United Express regional fleet. United will now acquire 24 of Embraer’s E-175 regional jets that earlier were going to be purchased by Republic Airways Holdings Inc. Republic is expected to operate the jets on behalf of United. \nMeanwhile, United is switching four of the current generation 737s on order to the -800 variant to be delivered over the next two years as planned. The new strategy will leave United with a fleet of 150 Max, including 99 of Boeing’s largest narrowbody model. The U.S. planemaker plans to start delivering the upgraded 737 family next year with the Max 8, followed by the Max 9 in 2018. \nUnited joins a spate of carriers deferring aircraft deliveries, stoking concerns of a cool-down in the global aerospace market. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, International Consolidated Airlines Group and Turkish Airlines have also tapped the brakes on some deliveries in recent months. Boeing shares fell 1.7 percent to $147.45 in New York. \n“We’re excited that United will be adding even more MAXs to its future fleet, and we appreciate their confidence in the airplane,” Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. “We constantly work with our airline customers to meet their evolving needs, and our healthy 737 backlog of 4,321 airplanes gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.” Most Read",

LOUIS \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations - El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Related content",

      "text": "Sign up for our Security newsletter WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (UPI) -- Boeing has awarded BAE Systems with a $140 million contract to support its F-15 modernization effort for the U.S. Air Force.\nThe contract is part of the Air Force's Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System program, or EPAWSS. The program aims to provide F-15 Eagles with an updated electronic warfare system, which BAE System officials say is essential for ensuring the aircraft are equipped to meet emerging threats.\n\"Recognizing the importance of providing this enhanced EW technology to our warfighters, our team responded during the first phase of the program by not only meeting all set program milestones, but in some cases exceeding expectations by several weeks,\" BAE Systems Electronic Combat Solutions general manager Brian Walters said in a press release.\nThe F-15 Eagle was originally designed and developed by McDonnell Douglas to support air supremacy missions in 1967, taking first flight in 1972. After merging with Boeing, the company's aircraft has been sold to six countries. In addition to the U.S. Air Force, primary users include the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, the Royal Saudi Air Force, and the Israeli Air Force. None have announced plans to retire the aircraft from service.\nIndustry partners began the F-15 modernization program in 2008 when developers began installing the U.S.-made electronic warfare system. The equipment supports both offensive and defensive capabilities, and can help pilots detect incoming threats with a fully integrated radar warning feature.\nLike Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com    Related UPI Stories U.S. Air Force develops solution for F-22 weapon issue Australia's Super Hornets complete first major upgrade RUAG Australia selected for F-35 sustainment work",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nBoeing said Tuesday it will close some defense and space facilities around the country over the next four years, reducing its overall footprint by approximately 4.5 million square feet and moving the work of thousands of employees to new sites. \nSpokesman Ken Smith said Boeing expects “few if any job losses from today’s announcement in Washington State.” \nHowever, about 1,000 defense-side workers will be moved from the company’s Kent site, which has been shrinking for some years, to Tukwila. \nAbout 1,600 positions in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. \nThe Associated Press and The Seattle Times contributed to this report Related content",

      "text": "Nov 15, 3:42 PM EST Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By JIM SALTER Associated Press ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. Chicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. The Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. The company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" The company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

      "title": "Boeing Shutters Two Plants After United Continental Delays $5BN Worth Of 737 Orders",
      "text": "Nov 15, 2016 5:20 PM 0 SHARES \nEarlier this morning, Boeing's shares dropped after United Continental Airlines said it would delay orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners, worth roughly $5 billion , and instead order the newer 737 MAX models for delivery in later years . Boeing, of course, downplayed the impact of the decision saying it would not affect its plan to increase production rates of 737s, and stressed that it continues to have orders for more 737s than it can produce. \nGiven that, it does seem to be curious timing that Boeing has just announced an operational restructuring that will result two site closures in El Paso, Texas and Newington, Virginia. While we're sure there are \"efficiency gains\" to be generated from the consolidation of sites, cutting 4.5 million square feet of facility space in just 4 years seems like there may be a bit more behind the cuts. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \n\nBy the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. \n\nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. \n\nWith the moves, Los Angeles County gains about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400. \n\n“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,” Caret said. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” \n\nTo bolster that effort, Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom will be aligned and managed in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth. He will also continue as managing director of Boeing Defence UK. While Pitchforth will report directly to Caret, those three organizations will continue operating independently. \n\nWhile Boeing attempted to downplay the financial impact of the delayed United Continental order, analysts are somewhat more skeptical of it's impact on free cash flow generation over the coming years. \nBut some worried that canceling 61 current-generation planes and ordering MAXs for an uncertain date could delay Boeing's planned production increases and its cash generation. \n\n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \n\n\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, shareholders were somewhat disappointed as well: \nThough we're sure it's nothing.",

LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) Boeing moving 500 jobs to St. Louis ( … ) Reed Saxon \nFILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo is the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nUpdated at 4:14 p.m. \nBoeing Co. is moving 500 jobs to its north St. Louis County campus from California. \nThe jobs moving to St. Louis County from Huntington Beach, Calif., are part of a consolidation of the company's Defense, Space & Security business headquartered in St. Louis, spokeswoman Sarah Reed told the Post-Dispatch. \n\"We will be bringing 500 positions to St. Louis,\" Reed said, adding the jobs are support positions, not production jobs. Chicago-based Boeing currently employs 14,500 in the St. Louis area. \nAdditionally, Boeing announced Tuesday that it's closing its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe consolidation is part of an effort to enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration, the company said, adding that new facilities will not be added in the St. Louis area for the added jobs. \"We won't be adding any infrastructure at this point,\" Reed said. \nThe jobs are professional-level positions ranging from engineering to finance, said Reed. \nAbout 1,600 jobs will be moved from Huntington Beach, mainly to other California locations. Huntinton Beach hosts a design and research center working with small satellite technology, advanced space access, networked systems, cybersecurity, unmanned underwater vehicles, and advanced manufacturing. \nBoeing has moved several hundred jobs to St. Louis over the past three years, in field such as information technology, research and development and support for the F-22 Raptor fighter. But overall Boeing employment in the metro area has hovered in the 14,500 to 15,000 range. \nBoeing plans to hire 700 people by 2023 to make wing and tail parts for its 777X airline at a newly-built plant at its sprawling complex in north St. Louis County. \nThousands of other St. Louis production jobs face an uncertain future over the long term as Boeing seeks enough orders to keep its F/A-18 and F-15 fighter lines far into the next decade. The company has enough F/A-18 orders to operate until 2020 and enough F-15 orders last until early in the next decade. \nBoeing is bidding to build the next Air Force trainer, and a win would likely extend employment in St. Louis. The first prototype of the trainer was built in North County. \nThe state of Missouri is offering incentives worth $229 million over 18 years if the Boeing adds 2,000 jobs here. Under the complex deal, Boeing could reap $146 million if it simply keeps the current job count, and lesser amounts if it limits job cuts.",

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nBoeing Co. shares dropped on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings said it will convert orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners, worth nearly $5 billion at list prices, into newer 737 MAX models for delivery in later years. \nThe decision called into question Boeing's plans to increase production of one of its biggest moneymakers over the next two years, and its ability to generate more cash for investors. \nBoeing said United's decision would not affect its plan to increase production rates of 737s, and stressed that it continues to have orders for more 737s than it can produce. \nUnited's orders \"will switch over to MAXs on the order book when (the order is) finalized,\" Boeing spokesman Doug Alder told Reuters in an email. Boeing's 737 order backlog of 4,321 airplanes \"gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.\" \nUnited is converting its 737s to newer models, \"so it will not impact backlog at all,\" he added. \nSome analysts said United's decision would only reduce the amount of oversold jets, with no impact on output. \nBut some worried that canceling 61 current-generation planes and ordering MAXs for an uncertain date could delay Boeing's planned production increases and its cash generation. \n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady.",

      "text": "Earlier this morning, Boeing's shares dropped after United Continental Airlines said it would delay orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners, *worth roughly $5 billion*, and* instead order the newer 737 MAX models for delivery in later years*. Boeing, of course, downplayed the impact of the decision saying it would not affect its plan to increase production rates of 737s, and stressed that it continues to have orders for more 737s than it can produce.\n\nGiven that, it does seem to be curious timing that Boeing has just announced an operational restructuring that will result two site closures in El Paso, Texas and Newington, Virginia. While we're sure there are \"efficiency gains\" to be generated from the consolidation of sites, *cutting 4.5 million square feet of facility space in just 4 years seems like there may be a bit more behind the cuts. *\n\n\n\n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business , we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security . “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.”\n\n\n*By the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet.* Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California , with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala.\n\n\nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites.\n\n\n*With the moves, Los Angeles County gains about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400.*\n\n\n*“Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,”* Caret said. “This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.”\n\n\nTo bolster that effort, Boeing Defence Australia , Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom will be aligned and managed in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth. He will also continue as managing director of Boeing Defence UK. While Pitchforth will report directly to Caret, those three organizations will continue operating independently.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Boeing attempted to downplay the financial impact of the delayed United Continental order, analysts are somewhat more skeptical of it's impact on free cash flow generation over the coming years.\n\n\n\nBut some worried that canceling 61 current-generation planes and ordering MAXs for an uncertain date could *delay Boeing's planned production increases and its cash generation.*\n\n\n*\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" *said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady.\n\n\n*\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\"* he said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, shareholders were somewhat disappointed as well:\n\nThough we're sure it's nothing.",

      "text": "  Steve Hanley 0   Steve Hanley \nOn November 14, Alaska Airlines flew a Boeing 737-800 airliner from Seattle to Washington, DC using jet fuel that contained 20% biofuel made from forest residuals — the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests. The conversion process is the result of research conducted at Washington State University as part of the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance. \nChemically, the biofuel is indistinguishable from conventional Jet A fuel derived from petroleum. The forest residual feedstock used to power Alaska Airlines Flight 4 was sourced from tribal lands and private forestry operations in the Pacific Northwest. \n“This latest milestone in Alaska’s efforts to promote sustainable biofuels is especially exciting since it is uniquely sourced from the forest residuals in the Pacific Northwest,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska Airlines’ senior vice president of communications and external relations. “NARA’s accomplishments and the investment of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provide another key in helping Alaska Airlines and the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on fossil fuels.” \nThe 1,080 gallons of biofuel used on the cross country flight had a minimal impact on Alaska Airlines’ overall greenhouse gas emissions. But if the airline were able to replace 20% of its entire fuel supply at Sea-Tac Airport, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 142,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s equivalent to removing about 30,000 passenger vehicles from the roadways for one year. \nNARA is a five-year project that launched in 2011 and is comprised of 32 member organizations from industry, academia and government laboratories. Today’s flight represents its efforts to develop alternative jet fuel derived from post-harvest forestry material that is often burned after timber harvest. \nThe NARA initiative was made possible by a $39.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support research on biofuels and biochemicals, foster regional supply chain coalitions, empower rural economic development and educate the public on the benefits of bioenergy. That is precisely the kind of research that will likely be eliminated by our new climate denier in chief, Donald Trump. Thank you, American voters. \n“Today’s flight comes after years of investments to help the aviation biofuels industry take off,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. “By creating these sustainable biofuels, we will revitalize our rural agricultural communities, foster economic growth, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cut our dependence on foreign oil while growing our competitiveness in global markets.” After January 20, you can kiss any further efforts in that direction goodbye, Senator.",

      "title": "Boeing to shift 1,600 jobs from Huntington Beach to Long Beach, El Segundo",
      "text": "The former 717 Boeing plant in Long Beach. (File photo). \nBoeing will shift nearly 2,500 jobs out of its Huntington Beach facility by 2020, sending 1,600 of them to Long Beach and El Segundo and another 300 to Seal Beach, the company announced Tuesday.\nThe move will carve in half the number of employees at Boeing’s Huntington Beach aerospace campus. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported the company would trim its workforce through “natural attrition.” Boeing said it would cut 500 net jobs in Southern California in its defense and space industries.\nThe company said a consolidation will reduce its overall facility space by 4.5 million square feet. \n\n\nSome positions in Kent, Wash., will move to Tukwila, also in Washington, as the company also closes sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Virginia.\n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO of defense, space and security for Boeing. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.”\nIn addition to the Los Angeles job gains, St. Louis will add 500 jobs and Huntsville, Alabama, another 400.\n\n\nHuntington Beach’s history is woven into Boeing, which celebrated its centennial this summer. Donald Douglas Jr., the son of the Douglas Aircraft Co.’s founder, opened the massive space center on a former Huntington Beach bean field in 1963 to help build the rockets that would send Apollo astronauts to the moon.\nBoeing has continued downsizing in California in recent years. In July, the company posted notices with the state that it would let go of 73 employees in Huntington Beach and 38 in El Segundo. \n\n\nIn August, the company posted WARN notices for 20 in El Segundo and 37 in Huntington Beach. In September, there were 59 WARN notices in El Segundo and 23 in Huntington Beach. \nIn October, there were WARN notices for 33 in El Segundo and 13 in Huntington Beach, followed by 15 in El Segundo and nine in Huntington Beach later in the month.\nThe company previously had announced it would close in 2015 its C-17 production line in Long Beach , a move that affected roughly 2,200 workers, many of whom retired or transferred to other jobs within Boeing. The C-17 is the cargo plane created for the Air Force.\nAdvertisement \n\nThe C-17 plant’s closure came nine years after Boeing stopped manufacturing the 717 passenger jet in the city.\nThe Seal Beach facility has also seen reductions in recent years.\nTwice in the past decade, cutbacks prompted Boeing to sell off portions of its Seal Beach campus at Westminster Avenue and Seal Beach Boulevard. It put two buildings on the market in 2012, including an eight-story office tower, leaving the site with 45 acres and 11 buildings. The company sold 50 acres to a developer in 2006, which built the 10-building Pacific Gateway Business Park.\n\n\n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Caret said. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.”\nIn 2013, Boeing also offered a voluntary layoff plan to employees at the El Segundo facility. \nThe company also announced in April that it would be adding 1,000 jobs to its engineering workforce in Seal Beach and Long Beach over the next two years.\nStaff writer Jonathan Winslow contributed to this report. \n\nClick here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off",

Huntington Beach employs around 5,000 staff, a number that will also drop through natural attrition. Boeing also is closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. \nBoeing has cut almost 17,000 staff this year – around 4% of its total workforce – mainly through a mix of voluntary layoffs, attrition and some compulsory cuts at its commercial aircraft arm. The group's workforce fell 2.5% in 2015. What do you think? ",

LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. Chicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. Most Popular",

      "text": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner Converted to Private Jet Fly the hedge-funded skies U 1 786 Views In addition to the Marc Newson plane , I found another opposite-of-coach flying experience, and this one's a doozy: A company called Kestrel Aviation Management was hired to transform a freaking Boeing 787 Dreamliner into a private jet. \"This 2,400 sq.ft., 40-seat corporate aircraft,\" the company writes, \"has a nearly 9,800 nautical mile range and the ability to fly over 17 hours, non-stop between almost all major cities on earth.\" The floorplan is interesting: As you can see below, the master bedroom is located in the front of the plane, just behind the cockpit. Since I'm a plebe who's thinking in bus terms, I wrongly assumed it'd be in the back. But getting it forward of the jets probably makes it a much quieter space.   The design is broken up into three parts. The central portion is taken up by this lounge area:       The tables can switch from coffee table to dining table height, and have wings that telescope out of the ends.     In the back of the plane, you've got a sort of business-class-style seating section, two bathrooms and a galley in the tail.     Up front is the aforementioned master bedroom, with an en-suite master bath. The pilots access the cockpit via a hallway that does not intrude on the master bedroom space, so you needn't learn the pilots' names.  ",

LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. \nUnited’s operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta’s 19 percent margin and American’s 15.1 percent.\nUnited climbed 2.8 percent to $64.71 at 11:51 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an “anchor tenant” investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United’s gain was the second biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which rose 1.6 percent.\n",

      "text": "ST. LOUIS — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, Calif., will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach.\nAbout 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Ala.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Va. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent to Tukwila. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.”\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\n",

      "text": "Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort By JIM SALTER Associated Press Updated 3 hrs ago \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

      "text": "Boeing to Cut Defense Jobs -- Update November 15, 2016, 08:03:  Doug Cameron \nBoeing Co. said Tuesday it would cut another 500 jobs over the next four years from its defense and space business by shrinking work at its Huntington Beach facility in California and closing two smaller plants in Texas and Virginia. \nThe aerospace company plans to transfer work on a range of military, space and commercial aircraft programs to existing facilities, cutting the amount of manufacturing and office space at its domestic plants by 4.5 million square feet from an existing total of around 80 million square feet, a trim of almost 6%. \nBoeing's defense arm has cut thousands of jobs over the past five years, a faster pace than reductions at a commercial airplane arm that have climbed in recent months as it faced tougher competition from Airbus Group SE. \nThe U.S. company said it would offer some staff affected by the latest changes alternative opportunities at other sites in southern California as well as Missouri and Alabama that would result in 2,500 job additions at those facilities. Huntington Beach employs around 5,000 staff, a number that will also drop through natural attrition. Boeing also is closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. \nBoeing has cut almost 7,000 staff this year -- around 4% of its total workforce -- mainly through a mix of voluntary layoffs, attrition and some compulsory cuts at its commercial aircraft arm. The group's workforce fell 2.5% in 2015. \nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  162003ET  ",

      "text": "Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort JIM SALTER Associated Press Privacy Policy \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs, and close two facilities by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
