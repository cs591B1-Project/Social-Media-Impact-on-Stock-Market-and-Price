      "text": "Shares of pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) are slumping in reaction to a Q3 revenue miss and negative guidance issued by the company. Q3: CVS Vs. Walgreens \nCVS reported third-quarter earnings per share of $1.64, ahead of the $1.57 consensus estimate. Revenues came in at $44.6 billion, shy of the average analysts' estimate of $4.58 billion. \nIn comparison, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA ) reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 per share on October 20, while analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings per share of $0.99. Sales of $2.68 million came in below the consensus estimate of $29.1 billion. \nWalgreens Boots Alliance has negotiated a deal to acquire Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD ) for $17.2 billion or $9 per share. Recently, the companies announced they are pushing back the date of merger to January 27, 2017, amid divestment plans to secure anti-trust approval. Guidance Downs CVS Amid Competitive Pressure \nAdding to the worries arising out of the revenue miss, CVS lowered its full-year 2016 earnings per share guidance to $5.77–$5.81 from $5.81–$5.89 previously. The 2017 earnings per share guidance of $5.77–$5.83 also trailed the consensus estimate of $6.53. \nHowever, rival Walgreens Boots Alliance expects 2017 earnings per share of $4.85 to $5.20, in line with the consensus estimate of $5.03. \nFollowing its results announcement, the company's shares rose 1.04 percent to $87.30, but have since then lost 3.5 percent from the pre-earnings session. \nAs though compensating for the financial performance and outlook, CVS announced a $15 billion stock buyback program. Is The Business Model Not Working? \nApparently, the company's strategy of an integrated business model hasn't cut much ice with customers. Apart from functioning as a pharmacy benefit manager, the company also operates a chain of retail store pharmacies. \nAmong the many reasons offered for the lackluster showing were market-wide slowdown in prescription growth, a change in the pharmacy network that led to some retail prescriptions moving out of its network and a clamp down on drug price fixing by generic companies. \nIn pre-market trading, shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance pulled back 4.24 percent to $78 and those of CVS is slumping 15.67 percent to $70.32. \nAt last check in late morning, Walgreens was down 2.21 percent at $79.65, and CVS was down 12.56 percent at $72.89. \nImage Credit: By Otisfrog (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons  ",

      "text": "View All Posts \nFollowing through on Monday’s bullishness and perhaps emboldened by more confidence in the outcome of Tuesday’s voting, the bulls charged again today. The S&P 500’s close of 2139.53 was 0.38% better than Monday’s last trade, and ended the day testing a key technical ceiling. \nNot every stock jumped on the bullish bandwagon though. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX ), ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT ) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) each ended the day in the red, as investors decidedly voted “no” for each of them. CVS Health Corp (CVS) \nThe market has known for a while the risk was out there. But here’s just something about seeing the risk become a reality that drives a point home, and drives a stock lower. \nOn Tuesday, pharmacy chain CVS Health confirmed that an increasingly strict and cost-conscious health insurance industry has limited its choice of pharmacies its customers can use to fill prescriptions. The end result for CVS is a projected reduction of 40 million prescriptions in 2017 , setting up a 11.8% plunge in the value of CVS today. \nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA ) is being pegged as the primary beneficiary of this shift, which apparently has a better relationship with pharmacy benefits managers which largely make these types of business funneling decisions … most of which are two-way concessions. \nFanning the bearish flames that burnt CVS Health on Monday was lowered 2016 profit guidance. The company had forecast a full-year profit of between $5.81 and $5.89 per share, but reeled that outlook in to a range of only $5.77 to 5.83 per share of CVS. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (MT) \nLuxembourg-based steel company ArcelorMittal failed to meet its third quarter profit estimates, and then poured salt in the wounds by warnings its fourth quarter numbers would be disappointing as well. \nYet, the company’s Q3 was also the most profitable quarter it’s seen in a long while. \nFor its third quarter of 2016, ArcelorMittal reported net income of $1.95 billion , up 40% from year-ago levels. Stronger steel prices drove the lion’s share of that improvement.",

November 9, 2016 Twitter Email \nWe posted about the unadvertised DulcoEase deal at CVS earlier this week, but now it is even better! There is a high-value $4.00/1 printable store coupon to pair with the sale, plus an Extrabucks promotion and a printable manufacturer coupon. All the savings turn this deal into a $2.00 moneymaker. Take a look: \nNote: The coupon will be adjusted down as CVS does not allow overage. And per the fine print on the store coupon, you can only use one coupon per customer. Buy 1 DulcoEase, 25 ct $6.99, sale price through 11/12 \nBuy 1, Receive $2.00 Extrabucks through 11/12, Limit 5",

      "text": "Joe Cahill on Business Walgreens is hurting rival CVS, but is it helping itself? \nGive Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina credit for knowing where the power lies in the drug industry. Rather than picking fights with pharmacy benefit managers, as his predecessor did, Pessina is cutting deals with the powerful middlemen who control order flows to retailers like Walgreens. PBMs negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers. A PBM can flood a pharmacy chain with orders, or cut it off, as former Walgreens CEO Greg Wasson learned when his faceoff with Express Scripts cost the company a substantial amount of business a few years ago. \nPessina, who elbowed Wasson aside in late 2014 after merging his European drugstore empire with the Deerfield-based chain to form Walgreens Boots Alliance, must have been paying attention. He has buddied up to PBMs, inking a series of agreements that make Walgreens a preferred drugstore for such major players as UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx, the U.S. military's Tricare program and Prime Therapeutics, which manages drug benefits for 14 Blue Cross & Blue Shield health plans. \nPessina's deals clearly are hurting Walgreens' top drugstore rival. CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo acknowledged on Nov. 8 that his drugstores could lose 40 million prescriptions as a result of the new contracts, putting a dent in profits. \nHow much the deals will help Walgreens isn't as clear. A gain of 40 million prescriptions would add 4 percent to Walgreens' fiscal 2016 total of 928 million, but there's no assurance that Walgreens will get all the prescriptions from CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I. And the additional volume won't necessarily boost Walgreens' profits by the same amount CVS stands to lose. That's because to get this business, Walgreens “had to give significant discounts on generics,” says analyst Vishnu Lekraj of Morningstar. \nSuch discounts would pressure profit margins in Walgreens' pharmacy business, unless Pessina can capitalize on the additional volumes by driving efficiencies. On a quarterly conference call with analysts last month, CFO George Fairweather predicted that pharmacy margins would continue shrinking but overall profit would increase as volumes rise under the new contracts. \nLOGICAL PLAN \nPessina had little choice but to find common ground with PBMs. Not only do they wield enormous clout over pharmacies, they're also a driving force in the broader effort by insurers and the government to reduce drug costs. A lone company resisting price cuts risks getting run over by that trend. \nPessina's strategy also makes sense as a tactic for boosting Walgreens' store traffic, which has been declining . If more customers come to Walgreens stores for prescriptions, they might also spend money on highly profitable cosmetics, candy bars and other “front-end” merchandise. “These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes through our pharmacies and driving footfall to our stores,” Fairweather says. \nThis approach has worked for Pessina's Boots pharmacies in the United Kingdom. Since taking control of Walgreens, Pessina has transplanted Boots veterans with front-end expertise. He's betting heavily on cosmetics, after importing the Boots No. 7 cosmetics line that is popular with British shoppers . \nThere's no guarantee the strategy will succeed in the U.S., where consumers are used to buying cosmetics from department stores and specialty cosmetics retailers such as Ulta Beauty and Sephora, not drugstores. “Even though Walgreens has been successful in becoming part of these networks, it doesn't mean they're going to be able to drive economic profitability,” Lekraj says. \nTrue enough. But at least Pessina is trying to turn industry trends and power dynamics to Walgreens' advantage.",

      "title": "What If CVS Stops Growing?",
      "text": "Founder: The Currency Of Time Summary \nCVS has grown by a solid rate in the past and was expected to continue to do so. \nJust recently this growth rate has been called into question. \nThis article asks a simple question: “what if CVS stops growing?”. On November 8th of 2016 CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) reported third quarter results . Of particular note was the company's guidance. Adjusted earnings for 2016 is now expected to be in the $5.77 to $5.83 range, a downtick of about four to five cents from the previous expectation. More pertinent was the expectation for next year: adjusted earnings in the $5.77 to $5.93 range, which includes the projected loss of more than 40 million retail prescriptions. The reason that this was important was because it represents a material downtick from what was previously anticipated. Analysts were expecting double-digit intermediate-term growth, and here you have a company saying that very little, if any, growth is expected in the coming year. Now two notes should be made. For one, the year-over-year earnings could truly be more or less flat on a company-wide level as CVS continues to repurchase shares. And on the other end, CVS maintains that double-digit growth (10%) for the longer-term continues to be anticipated. Still, share price bids were down about 12% on the day of the news, and 7% or so since that time. The situation is straightforward: previously a growth rate of 10%+ was expected, and now you have a hiccup with that anticipation. Time will tell whether or not this is truly a short-term concern or if there is a longer-term effect that will linger. When situations like this come about, I like to err of the side of prudence. CVS could very well get back to its growing ways. Yet for the sake of caution, let's ask and try to answer a simple question: \"what if CVS stops growing?\" At the bottom end of CVS's guidance range the company expects to generate $6.2 billion in earnings this year. Looking out into the future, I've seen estimates for earnings reaching $9 billion in the next five years. This is certainly still possible, despite the slowing growth for next year. Yet to be cautious let's stick with the $6.2 billion. And not just for next year, we'll use that number for the next decade. CVS recently paid a $0.425 quarterly dividend , which would be anticipated to increase over the years. With roughly 1.07 billion shares outstanding, this equates to a starting commitment of about $1.82 billion for dividends, call it $1.86 billion - which happens to be a payout ratio of 30% (under the company's long-term target). The share repurchase program was recently increased by $15 billion, tacking on to the $3.7 billion that was remaining from the previous program. Over the past nine years CVS has averaged ~$3.2 billion in annual share repurchases, easily topping the amount going toward dividends. Let's use $3.1 billion per year (during the last five years the average has been over $4 billion) creating a total payout ratio of 80%. Here's what that could look like, in millions, during the next decade: Note that this isn't what I expect, it merely answers the question: \"what if CVS stops growing?\" On a company-wide basis you'd see stagnation for 10 years. Zero earnings growth, the same amount going toward dividends and the same amount going toward share repurchases. Yet on the shareholder level, all may not be as bad as it appears: The second column indicates the hypothetical number of shares outstanding, followed by the earnings and dividends per share. So even though the total amount of funds going toward cash dividends and share repurchases stagnates, the per share metrics would actually be increasing. That's an important point to remember: even if the business does not grow, that does not simultaneously indicate that shareholder returns will be stagnant as well. In total you might anticipate collecting $21 or so in dividend payments to go along with a share price approaching $110. Based on a current price near $77, these components equate to the expectation of a 5.3% annualized gain. Now certainly this isn't much to text home about. Yet I would like to point out that it's still a rather solid result given the circumstances. Here you had a security that was expected to grow by 10%+ and even with no growth things could still work out all right. And should a bit of growth formulate, suddenly you move from average returns to solid ones rather quickly. The thing of it is CVS wasn't trading at 30 times earnings or something of the sort with this lofty growth expectation. Instead, shares were more or less reasonable and become even more so on the news of a short-term stumble. Regardless of whether the company eventually gets back to its fast growing ways, the bar is sufficiently low that even a \"no growth\" situation could turn out all right. In the above illustration I used an earnings multiple near what the current price represents: in-between 13 and 14. Of course many would quibble with this mark, indicating that it is much too high or too low. Interestingly, this doesn't have as large of an impact as you might imagine. If I instead used a multiple of 16 throughout, the number of shares retired would decline (and thus so too would your expected dividends and earnings per share) but the ending price would still be higher. Under this circumstance you'd be looking at 6.4% annualized gains as a starting point. If you use 12 times earnings throughout, the ending price is lower but CVS would be able to retire more shares and thus increase the dividend and EPS growth rates. In this situation you'd be looking at 4.8% gains. So something in the 4% to 7% range as a wide net of possibilities under a \"no growth\" situation appears to be a prudent starting point. Naturally this can change should the starting and ending valuations vary dramatically (or if the business performance is vastly different) but you get the idea. In short, CVS has been a fast growing company and those results were anticipated to continue well into the future. Just recently investors were told that this might not be the case, at least temporarily. CVS could very well continue growing, in which case the returns from this now subdued valuation could be quite compelling. Yet even if this does not occur, the potential returns from a \"no growth\" firm aren't exactly lackluster.

November 12, 2016 Twitter Email Check out what you can get for less than $5.00 at CVS ! Roll Extrabucks to keep your final cost low. Just follow our step-by-step transactions each week, and you’ll be rolling rewards like a pro in no time. First, here’s what you need to know about shopping at CVS: CVS allows one manufacturer coupon and one store coupon per product. You may use CVS Extrabucks (EBs) in addition to these coupons. Extrabucks are rewards that are printed at the end of your cash register receipt. These rewards can be used on your next purchase. Remember, if there is a limit in the ad for the Extrabucks items, this limit is per household. One great thing about CVS is their rain checks which include the Extrabucks offers, so you can still get the offer when they have more in stock. Get your CVS ExtraCare card so you can enjoy these extreme savings. Be sure and read the CVS coupon policy . You can also go here to review the CVS How-To Video.

November 19, 2016 Check out what you can get for less than $5.00 at CVS ! Roll Extrabucks to keep your final cost low. Just follow our step-by-step transactions each week, and you’ll be rolling rewards like a pro in no time. First, here’s what you need to know about shopping at CVS: CVS allows one manufacturer coupon and one store coupon per product. You may use CVS Extrabucks (EBs) in addition to these coupons. Extrabucks are rewards that are printed at the end of your cash register receipt. These rewards can be used on your next purchase. Remember, if there is a limit in the ad for the Extrabucks items, this limit is per household. One great thing about CVS is their rain checks which include the Extrabucks offers, so you can still get the offer when they have more in stock. Get your CVS ExtraCare card so you can enjoy these extreme savings. Be sure and read the CVS coupon policy . You can also go here to review the CVS How-To Video. TRANSACTION #1",

It’s always a good idea to have a few on hand or donate them. \nYou can get a Colgate 360 Toothbrush for 74¢ so go ahead and grab 2! \nCVS Deal Idea: $2 ECB WYB Colgate 360 Toothbrush, 1 ct., $3.49, limit 4 Buy: (1) Colgate 360 Toothbrush, $3.49 Use: -.75/1 Colgate 360 Manual Toothbrush printable Total Due: $2.74 –like getting it for 74¢ \nCheck out these personal care coupons: Add A Comment Rachel \nDo I have to have $15 worth of stuff AFTER I’ve used the manufacturer’s coupons, or can it be before? i.e. I have a $2 off $10 oral care store coupon (instead of the $3/15 coupon.) 2 toothpastes and 2 toothbrushes = $11.96 – $2/10 = $9.96 – $3 in coupons = $6.96. Plus $8 ecbs back. Shelby \nIt’s before coupons. You just give them the 2 off 10 first! MM for you! hijo \nHi Shelby. With the new system at CVS it is best to use the manufacturer coupons first and the CVS coupons last. This is what cashiers told me since I had it now several times that the system voided my manuf. coupon after I had used the CVS coupon. Cashiers said to ring up all manuf. coupons, then the CVS coupons, then your extrabucks. Never_Speechless \nBut then if you have 5- off a 20 dollar purchase CVS coupon and your manufacturer coupons bring you below 20 dollars the CVS coupon for 5- will not go through. I always use CVS coupons first! canes1999 \nnot with the new system, they always pending if you use first or last,unless you ask cashier to total after CVS coupons, but be warned the computers void any CRT’s if you use ECB’s after they hit total………..they have to hit the override key or you lose all your CRT coupons tess \nWith just the two of us these toothpaste/brush deals add up fast. So far this year we’ve been able to give six tubes and five brushes to the battered women’s shelter. Thank you Southern Savers and CVS! http://www.southernsavers.com/ Jenny \nGlad to help! karen \nHow do i get this coupon? -$1 off Colgate 360 or Slim Soft manual toothbrush, SS 6/01. Thank you Never_Speechless \nIt was in the Sunday paper back on June 1st. You could buy some on ebay I think. karen \nOk thanks Shelby \nFYI the crest toothpaste $2 ECB back is also on the crest Be and crest sensi relief. So there are $1 coupons on those. Making them free also! I did the deal last night and they both spit $2 ECB back at me. CVS LINKS",

      "text": "A Chicago man has been charged with robbing a CVS store while armed with a hypodermic needle last week in north suburban Niles.\nSanjay Malhotra, 49, faces one felony count of armed robbery, according to Niles police.\nAround 7:30 p.m. Nov. 14, a CVS employee spotted a man and woman removing over-the-counter medication from a shelf in the store at 9640 Milwaukee Avenue, police said.\nWhen the suspects attempted to leave, the employee approached and told them to put the items down, police said. The man allegedly pulled out a hypodermic needle from his pants pocket, pointed it at the employee, and said, “You don’t want what I have.”\nThe two suspects then left the CVS and got into a light-colored vehicle, police said.\nMalhotra was arrested about 10:05 p.m. Friday for the armed robbery of a Jewel store in the 2900 block of North Ashland in Chicago, police said. He matched the description of the suspect in the Niles robbery.\n# Crime Niles",

      "text": "A man who police say robbed a Niles CVS pharmacy with a hypodermic needle said to be filled with HIV-positive blood may be linked to similar robberies in Naperville and elsewhere, police said. On Friday, Chicago police took a man into custody during an armed robbery of a Jewel store in the 2900 block of Ashland Avenue in the city. Through that investigation, Chicago police discovered that the man matched the description of a similar armed robbery that happened in Niles on Tuesday, Nov. 14, at a CVS store in the 9600 block of Milwaukee Avenue. The Cook County State's Attorney's office charged Sanjay Malhotra, 49, of Chicago, with one county of armed robbery, a class X felony, for the Niles armed robbery. No charges have been filed yet against Malhotra for the armed robbery that happened last week in Naperville, police said. \"The descriptions of the male were relatively similar,\" Niles Sgt. Robert Tornabene said. In that case, two people entered a CVS pharmacy just before 6 a.m. Nov. 15 and threatened store employees with the needle while stealing several medications from the business. \"We think they are (connected),\" Naperville Sgt. Nick Liberio said. \"We are comparing videos and information with other departments. There's similarities to other cases in other jurisdictions.\" It's unknown when additional charges could be filed against Malhotra, officials said. Get articles sent to your inbox.",

      "text": "Stop Buying Aloe Vera Gel From Walmart, Target And CVS. It Contains NO Aloe Vera November 22, 2016 \nThe aloe vera gel Americans buy at Walmart, Target and CVS contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples showed no traces of the plant in various lab tests. \nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Walmart, Target and CVS products. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. \nThe FDA doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against Walmart, Target and CVS after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"",

      "text": "Is CVS Health a Buffett Stock? newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Feroldi) 0 \nWarren Buffet likes to keep Berkshire Hathaway 's balance sheet packed with cash so he can dive in and make a game-changing acquisition at any time. As of the third quarter, the conglomerate's cash balance exceeded $68 billion. So what companies could be on Buffett's radar right now? Image source: Getty Images. \nWhile that's an impossible question to answer, we do know what criteria Buffett uses to judge acquisition candidates. In fact, he clearly spells out his criteria in the company's annual letter to shareholders: Large purchases (defined as at least $75 million in pre-tax earnings). Consistent earnings power, not just future potential. Strong return on equity, with little or no debt. Management in place. A simple business. An offering price. \nWhile we can't know what kind of offering price Buffett might receive if he were looking to buy an entire company outright, we can use his first five criteria to determine if a stock could potentially be on his radar. Knowing that, let's run CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) through the first five items on Buffett's checklist to see how the company stacks up. 1. At least $75 million in pre-tax earnings \nPass \nCVS health has no problems clearing this first hurdle, which is important to Buffett because he generally only wants to invest in established, profitable companies. With more than 9,600 retail stores and one of the largest pharmacy benefits management (PBM) businesses in the country, CVS rings up more than $150 billion in annual sales. That allowed it to produce more than $8.6 billion in pre-tax earnings in 2015. 2. Consistent earnings power, not just future potential \nPass \nNo one chooses when to get sick, so demand for prescription drugs tends to remain strong regardless of what's happening in the economy. That fact has helped CVS Health's revenue and profits to consistently march higher over the years, with no sign of stopping: 3. Strong return on equity, with little or no debt \nFail \nBuffett loves to own businesses that generate strong returns on capital without the need to load up their balance sheet with debt. Here's what CVS Health's numbers have looked like over the past 10 years: CVS Return on Equity (TTM) data by YCharts \nWhile CVS Health's return on equity has steadily marched higher over time, the company's long-term debt of $26 billion would probably give him pause. While that huge figure was largely a result of last year's $12.9 billion acquisition of Omnicare , and the company can easily afford the interest payments, my hunch is that Buffett wouldn't be thrilled with the leverage. 4. Management in place \nPass \nCVS Health's current CEO, Larry Merlo, has been with the company for decades and took over the top chair in March 2011. Not only did Merlo spearhead the acquisitions of Omnicare and Target 's pharmacy business, but he also made the bold decision in 2014 to eliminate tobacco sales from its stores. Shareholders who bought when he took over have seen the company's shares more than double in value, which is a return that blows past that of the S&P 500 . CVS data by YCharts \nIn addition, there's a strong bench of executives right behind Merlo that have decades of retail and pharmacy experience. All told, shareholders appear to be good hands. 5. A simple business",
