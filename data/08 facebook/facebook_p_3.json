      "text": "Saturday Diary: She hit him 18 times A Facebook video shows the kind of violence to which our kids are being exposed   By Amy Philips-Haller \nEighteen blows! I counted one after another. \nThe teenage girl stood above her male peer and hit him 18 times. Seated, he did nothing to defend himself. Other students sat at the table laughing, until one young woman finally pushed the girl away. Good for her. \nI played the Jess Berti Facebook video again. \nOne … two … three … four … 18. \nMs. Berti, the boy’s mother, had written in her original post, “… Yesterday I received a call from the principal at [Chartiers Valley] high school. She called to inform me that there had been an ‘incident.’ That Bryan ‘hadn't done anything wrong.’ That she had watched the video ... and that this girl had ‘lightly tapped’ Bryan in the face ‘once, maybe twice …’” \nThe video told a different story. I wasn’t surprised. • \nSixteen years ago, I received a phone call from a now-defunct local daycare center. \n“Something is wrong with Katy,” said the director. “You have to come get your daughter now.” \nShe downplayed the injury. She did not call an ambulance. Kate’s cornea was lacerated and her lens destroyed. \nAs the details unraveled, I learned my 4-year-old was left alone unsupervised with a 9-year-old bully. Angry, he threw a pencil at her. It pierced her eye. She was nearly blinded. \nLife — as we had known it — was over. Once a producer of a show that aired on public radio, “Everyday Science,” I gave it all up to help Katy see again. It took two operations, a world-renowned surgeon, therapy and years of patching. • \nI hit play again. \nI wondered, how could anyone minimize this? Bullying is the gateway to emotional and physical injury. It can be life-threatening. According to the most recent statistics posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website, suicide is the second-leading cause of death in teenagers and young adults. \nAs an advisory board member for an adolescent mental-health research project called SOVA at Children’s Hospital, I knew this video was exactly the sort of thing that alarmed doctors. \nMeet brain cancer survivor Bethany Thompson. Just weeks ago, she pulled the trigger that ended her life. Why? According to her parents, she was bullied over her crooked smile. She won’t be the last. \nRemember Matthew Shepard? He was the college student who was beaten to death in Wyoming because he was gay. \nThis is everyone’s problem, every parent’s problem. Bullying has served as a motivation for school shootings. • \nIn only nine hours, the Berti Facebook video had been viewed 100,000 times. As I watched, I recalled sitting in that same library watching my daughter receive an award. I thought about the middle- and high-schoolers who shared the space. For once, I wasn’t on the outside unable to look in. Now I understood what the kids really were exposed to, and it made me sick. \nMy daughter Katy often came home from school complaining of ridicule. She suffers from a chronic illness, and it seemed that both teachers and students often were less than forgiving. I finally removed her from Chartiers Valley in her senior year. \nThe views, shares and comments on Ms. Berti’s Facebook post continued to grow. Posted on a Friday, by the next day the story had received international attention in Britain and India. The London Daily Mail uploaded it to Snapchat that Monday. The response to the video reached epidemic proportions. • \nOur children are surrounded by a volatile national climate. We live in a country plagued by slanderous political campaigns, fear mongering and violence. People rarely are held accountable for their behavior. Are we feeding our children all the wrong messages? \nThere were many wonderful and compassionate comments on Ms. Berti’s Facebook page. But there also was verbal violence: \n“As a mom, I would of probably whooped this girl’s ass myself …” \n“Your son is a [let’s use the term “sissy” ] and he got beat up by a girl …” \n“I would have socked that [female dog] for him …” \nThis is everyone’s problem, not just a problem for school districts. Words matter. Actions matter. It is a time for self-examination, because our children live what they learn. It is a time for thoughtful dialogue, inclusion and a real plan. \nAnti-bullying campaigns are not enough. Accountability is essential, and we are all stakeholders. Our children need to feel emotionally and physically safe. We must act before the next victim dies. Or kills. \nAmy Philips-Haller is a freelance journalist and multimedia producer who regularly covers South Fayette for the Post-Gazette (worddoodles@comcast.net).",

      "text": "SHARE: Facebook \nIt was in the 7 th century when Redwald, son of Tytila, grandson of Wuffa of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty, started his reign as the King of East Anglia, a kingdom known far and wide across the world as the heartland of the Anglo-Saxons. \nTen years before his death, Redwald stood as the most powerful king south of the river Humber, thus earning the name of “Bretwalda”, which meant “Britain-ruler” or “wide-ruler”. A replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet produced for the British Museum by the Royal Armouries. Photo Credit \nBut he wouldn’t be remembered as a king if not for his burial, which was the most magnificent ceremony ever held in ancient Britain. Redwald died in 624 and was buried in a 27-meter long ship. Sutton Hoo, Saxon Burial Site. Photo Credit \nIt was in these burial grounds that Sutton Hoo was discovered, a site that held both 6th and early 7th-century cemeteries. \nBesides the remains of the ship, a beautiful suite of unmatched metalwork covered in gold and fine gems, a ceremonial helmet, a shield and sword, a lyre, a total of 37 gold coins were found with the ship burial and lots of other priceless artifacts. \nIf not for the location, one might even say that this was the world described in the old English poem Beowulf, which is set in southern Sweden. Shield ornament from the Sutton Hoo burial, British Museum. Photo Credit \nFirst came the people from the Neolithic period that inhabited this area some 3,000 years ago. Next were the people from the Bronze Age, thriving communities that started the long tradition of metal working. One of the two identical shoulder-clasps. Photo Credit \nBut it was the Anglo-Saxons that brought the greatest changes. Their language evolved into Old English, a form of Germanic language, and their customs are still widely studied today. \nIn the mound that held the king, some very important and rare artifacts were found, including blue glass cups, two gilt-bronze discs with animal ornaments, a silver buckle, a stud from a buckle covered with gold, silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts, and two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques Shoulder-clasps from Sutton Hoo, British Museum. Photo Credit \nBut not all of the finds were gold and gems and dragon ornaments. Sutton Hoo was also the site of a number of terrible deaths, some by hanging and some by decapitation. \nA total of 18 mounds were found, and inside mound 17, archaeologists found the remains of a young prince buried together with his horse. The Great Buckle. Photo Credit \n“Use this in good health, Master Count, for many happy years.” was the inscription in Greek on the so-called “Bromewell bucket” found on the new grave filed in 2000. \nThe most astonishing fact is that this bowl had traveled 1,507 miles to rich the hands of its master. Purse Cover from Sutton Hoo burial. Photo Credit \nToday Sutton Hoo is the cornerstone of the study of art in Britain in the 6 th -9 th centuries, studies that respect the works of the early master goldsmiths. \nThe treasures from Sutton Hoo, once hidden but now revealed, speak volumes about the pre-Christian collection of priceless objects from diverse cultural sources.

Listen to the experts Steve Strauss, for USA TODAY 12:28 p.m. EST November 19, 2016 Barbara Corcoran and Steve Strauss. (Photo: Steve Strauss) \nQ: What makes someone a great entrepreneur? \nA : This is a question I wonder about a lot, and in fact, you could say it is the question underlying this column. \nI am happy to report that this week, we have some great answers. \nI was fortunate enough to get to meet some of the best entrepreneurs on the planet this week at the annual EY Strategic Growth Forum / Entrepreneur of the Year Awards . I attend a lot of entrepreneurship events, both as a columnist as well as as a speaker, and this one quickly has become my favorite. With top-notch presenters, great breakouts, an amazing venue in Palm Springs, and as I tweeted, “one person being more interesting than the next,” the SGF brings together some of the best entrepreneurs around. \nBetween my interviews and their sessions, I got some pretty interesting answers to my question. \nBarbara Corcoran, as you well know, is one of the sharks on Shark Tank . She is also a frank and very successful entrepreneur who, as her book title says , turned a $1,000 loan into a billion dollar business. Barbara gave a fun talk at the event, sharing, among other things, how she had 20 jobs before she was 23. Smart, funny, and savvy, Barbara knows from entrepreneurship. \nFor her, the key, especially when making her Shark Tank investments, is not the idea or the team, it’s the entrepreneur. That is what she says she invests in – the person. To Barbara, great entrepreneurs are brave, courageous, and thrive under pressure. \nThey are also bold, as is she. One of my favorite stories of hers is when she was first starting out in real estate in New York. To get noticed above the din she would put out reports, “The Corcoran Report.” These reports would often discuss celebrity real estate goings-on in the city and would be picked up by the press. She got quoted and got known. \nGuerrilla marketing at its best. \nSteve Howe is the smart, charismatic Managing Partner of Ernst & Young LLP in the US and chairs the EY Americas Operating Executive. Steve shared his and EY’s passion for entrepreneurs with me and gave me a really good answer when I asked him what makes an entrepreneur great. \n“Our Entrepreneur of the Year program is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year,” he told me, “and so we commissioned a study with the Harvard Business review that looked at just that.” The EY/HBR Impact Report entitled “The Entrepreneur’s Purpose” had five key findings for what made someone an “Entrepreneur of the Year” type of entrepreneur: \n“They empower people.” Yes, great entrepreneurs are great leaders, but they do that best by empowering the people around them \n“They are purpose driven.” Profit is great, but purpose is better \n“They thrive in resource-constrained environments.” They figure out how to make it work \n“They are obsessed with talent.” They don’t just like good talent, they are obsessed with it \n“They de-risk the risk.” They are prudent risk takers. \nA good example of this is Stephanie Lewis . She and two friends started Her Campus Media while undergrads at Harvard. Realizing that there was a market need for content specifically aimed for college-aged women, she and her partners have created a niche media empire, with some 300 college “chapters” now nationwide, undergrad writers as brand ambassadors, events and more. Her Campus now reaches some 16 million women. \nHow did they do it? By combining a market need, a great idea, and empowering a great team. \nAndy Taylor is the CEO of Enterprise Holdings, the parent company of Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Alamo Rent a Car, and National Car Rental, which, combined, I was surprised to learn, is the largest car rental company in the U.S. \nAndy and I swapped stories about our dads, the entrepreneurs. Taylor’s father started Enterprise with one employee after WWII. Taylor and his company, like the entrepreneurs in the EY study, are obsessed with finding and nurturing great talent. And also like the entrepreneurs in the study, Taylor’s company is driven far more by values than by profit. \nThis is not to say profit is not important, of course it is and must be for any entrepreneur. But in answering the question “what makes a great entrepreneur?” we see other things at play. \nFor example, Enterprise has created a company that really supports its employees and fosters intrapreneurship – the idea that motivating your staff as you would an entrepreneur is what works. For enterprise, that means sharing local profits, giving branch managers a lot of autonomy, and promoting from within for a job well done. \nSo, what makes for a an entrepreneur great? Yes, it is the usual suspects – passion, obsession, risk-taking, teamwork and creativity, but it’s also something else, something a little less expected: \nPurpose. \nSteve Strauss, @Steve Strauss on Twitter, is a lawyer specializing in small business and entrepreneurship and has been writing for USATODAY.com for 20 years.

      "text": "Share on Facebook 8 New Fries are a rarity, a pleasant surprise; when you're watching them, it can feel like other bands have just been going through the motions of what it means to perform music. Even the small details are special: the way Anni Spadafora jerks her forearm upwards on her guitar instead of down; the way the drummer decorates and punctuates, rather than guides, the songs. Spadafora's voice is more instrumental than is typically found in rock bands; her lyrics feel informed by Dadaism, the squeals and grunts emphasized by reverb-laden delay. It's organized chaos at its finest; just when it feels like maybe a song's gone off the rails, the band quickly tighten up and burst through another rhythmic spasm together, stopping and starting on a dime. Lost amidst the mayhem of their set, it's easy to miss just how good the band are together, how unified. At times during their Casa del Popolo show, Spadafora pounded her chest along to the din, a woman possessed; at others, as during \"Mary Poppins Pockets,\" she grunted into the mic as a synth wheezed in the background. She had barely finished thanking the crowd for coming and mentioning that they had records for sale when her speaking voice drawled and slurred seamlessly into the ensuing song. Intensely challenging yet utterly captivating, New Fries might never attract large club audiences, but in the underground, they're already quickly and deservedly becoming legends.",

PHOTO: RADION INTERNATIONAL Published Janice Heng \nUsing enough yarn to go around Singapore more than twice, a group of knitting fans have brought warmth to others. \nWith almost 500km of yarn, members of Singapore Facebook group Yarns Spree made more than 2,500 beanies, scarves, mittens and booties for children in northern Thailand, where temperatures can dip to as low as freezing point in mountainous villages. \nFinancial planner Amanda Seet set up the community last year to organise group buys or \"sprees\" of affordable yarn from overseas websites. \nBut in the middle of this year, the 40-year-old heard about charity group Radion International's call to help underprivileged children in northern Thailand's Phetchabun province. \"I realised that since I already have this (Yarns Spree) group, they would probably be keen to contribute,\" she said. \nShe got in touch with the charity in July and learnt that they would have to get the items ready by September. She posted about it on the group's Facebook page, and about 150 of the about 500 members chipped in. \n\"Some said that they were busy but I told them, 'Even if you can only do one, it means one more person can get warm,'\" said Ms Seet. \nIt can take from 20 minutes to three days to make one item, depending on how fast the knitter or crocheter is, and how complicated the design is. Some members also roped in their families. Mr Scott Ryktarsyk, 52, got involved thanks to his wife, who knits as a hobby. \n\"She said it was for charity so I thought, 'Sure, let's do it',\" said Mr Ryktarsyk, a regional project engineer for a flavour and fragrance company. \n\"I travel a lot for work and ended up knitting a lot on the plane - which got some strange looks!\" \nRadion International is collecting winter clothing, medical aid and other supplies for rural communities in Phetchabun. \n\"We have never (before) received so many items of winter wear for the children,\" said Radion International founder and executive director Eugene Wee. \n\"We look forward to working (more) with Yarns Spree and more like-minded groups.\" \nOne young contributor is looking forward to doing more. \nJaylen Cheong, nine, crocheted two hats - sometimes as a break from homework. \n\"It's a bit of fun, and sometimes when my hand is tired from writing, I will take a break and crochet,\" said the Primary 3 pupil. \n\"I'm trying to do a scarf next.\" \nHis mother, housewife Shirley Lim, 37, has been knitting and crocheting for years. \nShe said: \"He saw me doing it and then he got interested. It's good because it also keeps him off the TV, gadgets and so on.\" \nJaylen added: \"I like that I can use my project to give stuff to those who need it more.\" A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on November 20, 2016, with the headline 'S'pore group knits warm gifts for Thai village kids'.

      "text": "up vote 4 down vote \nThis file is part of a virus. \nIt's an SVG image file containing obfuscated JS code that redirects you to a malicious website. This website will attempt to install malware (a browser plugin) and forward the file to your Facebook friends. If you think you got infected, follow these instructions: Help! My home PC has been infected by a virus! What do I do now? \nThe attacker likely chose an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) file because it's an innocent-looking image format and less suspicious than HTML files or .exe (whose transfer is also prohibited by Facebook). Despite that, SVGs can also contain active script code, as seen here. Quick Analysis \nThe file itself contains a <script> segment consisting of two parts. The first part is the function jxnpgmlk() which acts as a decoder that unscrambles the strings that it gets as input. The second part is a very short payload. Multiple variables are defined here that can be unscrambled by using the decoding function to this: var cujnl = \"top\"; var gnqrek = \"location\"; var zvlgj = \"href\"; window[cujnl][gnqrek][zvlgj] = \"http://mourid.com/php/trust.php\"; \nSo essentially, all the code does is redirect you to http://mourid.com/php/trust.php . \nFrom here, two more 302 redirects follow to http://kerman.pw/php/trust.php and http://kerman.pw/?fb_dsa . The final page tries to install the malware on your computer. \nBonus: Funny enough, that page is also vulnerable to XSS. But I guess they don't have a Bug Bounty Program in place...

      "text": "Downloads \n23 M Facebook Lite is an official Facebook client that lets you use this popular social network through a much lighter app that's better suited for low-power Android devices or ones with limited Internet connections. The first thing that stands out about Facebook Lite is that the app takes up about 250 kilobytes on your memory once installed. This means that it occupies a hundred times less space than the normal Facebook app ... and still has all the features you need from it. Besides this drastic size reduction, Facebook Lite offers other interesting advantages for users with limited Internet connections. The app is expressly designed to work over 2G networks, so it lets you access your profile and communicate with your friends while consuming hardly any data. Facebook Lite is an excellent alternative to the usual Facebook client that lets you use this social network on less powerful devices and over very weak Internet connections.

Read more 5 alternative Android clients for Facebook \nThe official Facebook client for smartphones and tablets slows down your performance and hogs way too many resources .

Given that quitting social networks like Facebook is not on the order of the day, here is a list of five great alternatives to the official Facebook client , all of which will let you access your Facebook account from your smartphone or tablet without uselessly sacrificing battery life or data.",

Photo: Reuters Published: 6:20   Updated: 7:30   \nLONDON - Facebook <FB.O> said it would expand its UK presence by 50 percent in 2017, joining U.S. technology peer Google <GOOGL.O> in boosting investment in Britain despite the uncertainty sparked by the vote to leave the European Union. \nSocial network firm Facebook said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as it gears up to open a new headquarters in London next year. \nBefore the Brexit referendum in June, pro-Remain campaigners had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as withdrawing from the EU would make it a less attractive place to invest. \nBut Facebook said on Monday that was not the case. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" Europe, Middle East and Africa vice-president Nicola Mendelsohn will say at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, later on Monday. \nFacebook's expansion comes after Google, owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest in thousands of extra engineers as part of its move to a new London building. \nBritain is also benefiting from the growth of online retailer Amazon <AMZN.O>, which expects to create 3,500 UK jobs in 2016, including at its head office, research and development centers, customer service centers and distribution depots. \nIt plans a further 2,300 at three new distribution centers in 2017. \nFacebook said many of its new jobs would be in the high-skilled engineering sector.

Four-fifths of the people who visit the Louvre do so to visit the Mona Lisa , and its insurance value is £700m, way ahead of any other painting. Why is it the most famous painting in the world? And why are Facebook, Harry Potter novels, Shakespeare, and Katy Perry so popular? \nCommon sense says that Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world because it’s the best, but there are many paintings that to the eye of both the naive and expert viewer are equally good. Indeed, the painting which was completed in 1519, was largely unknown until 1911 when it was stolen from the Louvre. It was stolen by an Italian patriot who believed the painting should hang in Italy, and when recovered after two years the painting was shown all over Italy before being returned to Paris. The massive media coverage helped make the picture famous. \nOne part of the explanation of why particular paintings, books, or anything become famous is “circular reasoning,” explains the sociologist Duncan J Watts in Everything is Obvious (Once You Know the Answer): How Common Sense Fails : “X succeeded because X has the attributes of X.” Watts uses the example of a review of Harry Potter books: “A Cinderella plot set in a novel type of boarding school peopled by jolly pupils has a lot going for it. Add in some easy stereotypes illustrating meanness, gluttony, envy, or black-hearted evil to raise the tension, round off with a sound, unchallenging moral statement about the value of courage, friendship, and the power of love, and there already are some of the important ingredients necessary for a match-winning formula.” “In other words,” writes Watts, Harry Potter succeeded because it had exactly the attributes of Harry Potter , and not something else.” \nBut how did the Mona Lisa and Harry Potter become famous in the first place? Watts starts to explain this through Mark Granovetter’s “riot model.” Consider 100 students furious about an increase in student fees. All are likely to experience a tension between thinking it important to protest in a civilised manner and being furious enough to want to smash something or hit somebody. Some of the students, perhaps anarchists, might be keen to riot, while others will very much want to remain calm. All will have a different threshold. If we imagine that the threshold of one of the students is zero and that other students have thresholds of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc up to 99, then the zero student will riot, prompting the student with a threshold of one to riot, so prompting the student with a threshold of two to riot, so on until all the students are rioting. \nBut imagine another university where the threshold of the students is 0,1, 2, 4, 5, 6, up to 99 in unit intervals: students with the thresholds of 0,1, and 2 will riot, but that will be all—because the next threshold of 4 is never reached. Observers will search for a common sense explanation of why one group of students has rioted and not the other group: perhaps one group was more angry or desperate, the university mismanaged relations with the students, or the police were too rough. In fact the difference would be explained by only two students having different thresholds: one a 3 and the other a 4. \nThe riot model illustrates the effects of accumulation, and Watts uses it to introduce the idea “cumulative advantage,” meaning that “once, say a song or a book [or painting] becomes more popular than another, it will tend to become more popular still.” Watts and his colleagues illustrated this with an experiment. \nThey enlisted through the web 14 000 people and asked them to listen to, rate, and if they wanted to download songs. One group saw simply the songs while another group saw how many times other participants had downloaded the songs. Those who saw how often the songs were downloaded were then divided into eight groups in which the songs were presented in different random orders: all of the groups started with songs with zero downloads. As the theories of “cumulative advantage” and “social advantage” predict in the group that could see the number of downloads the more songs were downloaded the higher they were rated—that is popular songs were popular and unpopular ones unpopular. Furthermore, in the eight groups different songs were rated most popular: introducing social influence increased inequality and unpredictability. As Watts concludes, “unpredictability was inherent in the dynamics of the market itself.” \nNow we can understand why the Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world. It is a fine painting but many others are equally fine and even finer. At some point, when it was stolen and received media coverage, it became known and “cumulative advantage” meant that it became ever more popular. Luckily, there was no “missing link” as in the case of the missing 3 in the riot theory, and once it was famous “circular reasoning” explained why it was famous. \nIn other words, chance determines what becomes famous. I saw this as editor of The BMJ in that I found it almost impossible to predict before publication which papers would attract a lot of attention. I find the same now with the many blogs I write—some attract hundreds of Facebook likes (some sort of measure of popularity) while others attract only none. It brings us back to Kipling’s observation on triumph and disaster: “treat those two imposters just the same.” \nRichard Smith was the editor of The BMJ until 2004. \nYou may leave a response but pinging is currently not allowed.",

(Photo: Regina H. Boone/Detroit Free Press) Buy Photo \nThe Thanksgiving feast is built upon tradition. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room at the table for something new. \nAnd we know that as cooks carefully craft their holiday menus, complete with turkey, side dishes and the requisite pumpkin pie, they’ll also be on the hunt for that special twist to make their feast stand out. \nWhich brings us to today’s special section.",

      "text": "Instagram Instagram introduced their Live Stories feature to compete with Snapchat’s stories, and for the most part, they’ve done pretty well. It absolutely feels like a clone of one of Snapchat’s selling points, but for someone that’s a little more invested in their Instagram account, it was a worthwhile addition. \nWe’re going one step further today with the introduction of disappearing pictures and videos that you can send to your friends with Instagram Direct. If that sounds like another feature from Snapchat, well, that’s because it is. You send content to your friend that disappears after a few seconds, and you’ll get a notification if they replay it or take a screenshot of it. Good artists copy, great artists steal. \nThe other new feature in this round of updates is called Live Videos, which, uh, works exactly like going live with your video stream on Facebook. You can record yourself for up to an hour and your friends will be notified that you’re live so they can tune in and comment while you’re broadcasting. \nWe’ll give Instagram a break here, since they’re owned by Facebook. But it’s hard not to notice that Facebook is using Instagram as a side platform to appeal to younger and more privacy oriented users, as opposed to Facebook’s own platform that offers every feature under the sun. It’s not a terrible strategy, since Facebook is still ubiquitous with social media and Instagram gives them a younger base to tap for future users.

      "text": "Facebook has developed technology that could finally make its service palatable to Chinese authorities, who have blocked it since 2009.\nThe social network giant has quietly built a tool for blocking certain posts from showing up in feeds of users in some regions, according to a report from the New York Times , citing anonymous sources. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly a strong supporter of the tool, which could be used to censor politically sensitive content in China.\nFacebook would delegate control over which content to suppress to a third-party, most likely a Chinese business partner, according to the report. The partner would be able to see which stories or content users are sharing and then decide whether those posts should show up in Chinese users’ feeds.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nWhile software for tool can be seen by Facebook employees on their internal system, it’s still merely one of many experiments the company has considered as part of a push to get into China and may never be officially released, notes the report. Some employees who worked on the tool have since left Facebook after expressing concerns about the project.\nFor more on Facebook, watch this Fortune video: \nRumors of this tool come at a particularly awkward time for Facebook. The company has been heavily criticized since the recent U.S. presidential election for failing to curtail the spread of false news articles on its network about the candidates. Initially, the company defended itself by saying that it’s merely a technology company and that it doesn’t want to police what users post and share. However, Facebook has since softened its stance by saying it would explore ways to cut back on fake news.\nFacebook’s development of censorship tools is driving at least partly by the potential riches of reentering China.\nFortune contacted Facebook and will update this story if we hear back.",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nA last minute upset in an Anaheim city council race will bring a new face and likely a new focus to Anaheim city policy. Jose Moreno, who won on a platform of prioritizing neighborhoods over the the city's resort district, will represent District 3 on the new council. \nIncumbent Jordan Brandman has conceded the race. He was ahead in the vote count up until Monday evening, when the Orange County Registrar of Voters posted its latest tally showing that Moreno had pulled ahead by 44 votes. \nRegistrar Neal Kelley said that although a few ballots will trickle in up until he certifies the election in early December, the results for Anaheim's District 3 are unlikely to change. Moreno posted a victory message on his campaign Facebook page Monday evening, saying \"the people have spoken.\" \n\"Most importantly I want to thank everyone including our Anaheim youth, families, working people and organizations who took a risk on making 'this time Anaheim.' Si Se Pudo!\" \nMoreno, whose parents were immigrants, is the first Latino candidate to be elected under Anaheim's new by-district voting system. He was also the plaintiff named in the voting rights lawsuit that forced Anaheim to switch from at-large to by-district elections. \nThe lawsuit alleged that Latinos' voting power was diluted in the at-large system. Latinos make up more than half of the population in Anaheim but, with a few exceptions, the city's elected leaders have been white. \nIn District 3, which Moreno will represent, 72 percent of residents are Latino, the largest concentration of any of the new districts. \n\"What our election I think shows is one, if you move to a smaller environment, then you really do empower the electorate that’s disenfranchised, so Latinos will engage, their vote will matter,\" Moreno told KPCC. \nThe council's new makeup could also mean a shift in focus away from the city's resort district, dominated by Disneyland, and towards its neighborhoods. Anaheim's leaders have approved or renewed several generous tax breaks for Disney and other businesses in the resort district in recent years, angering some residents and local leaders — including Mayor Tom Tait — who say the deals amount to corporate giveaways. \nThe new council makeup will almost certainly be less friendly to Disney. Along with Moreno, Denise Barnes, who also ran on a campaign of halting tax breaks for the resort district, claimed victory on Monday evening in District 1. \nMoreno and Barnes will join Mayor Tait and Councilman James Vanderbilt, both vocal opponents of the tax breaks. \nDisney spent close to $1 million to support business-friendly city council candidates and to oppose Moreno and Barnes, according to campaign finance data collected by the online news site Voice of OC . \nThe new City Council will be sworn in on Dec. 13. \nThe best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

      "text": "Facebook will help find free WiFi options soon Facebook is testing a new feature that will help spot free WiFi options nearby. A + A - \nFacebook may soon help solve the problem of finding free WiFi access while on road. The company is testing a new feature that will help spot free WiFi options nearby. \nThe feature was first spotted by TheNextWeb on iOS app, where select users can see a 'Find WiFi' option in their app. Once the user toggles the button, he/she can spot places with free WiFi option near their location along with the name and nature of the network. Also Read: Not just Google, soon Facebook may also provide free WiFi at Indian railway stations \nIn order to access the feature, user has to give Facebook the permission to access his/her location and its history. \"To help people stay connected to the friends and experiences they care about, we are rolling out a new feature that surfaces open Wi-Fi networks associated with nearby places,\" a Facebook spokesperson told VentureBeat . The feature is being tested only in select countries for now. \nThe feature can be of great use when travelling. User can save money on pricey roaming data plans and even go live when travelling. Facebook is reportedly also working with the Indian Railways to bring WiFi to railway stations in country. The free Wi-Fi offered by RailTel and Google is already available at over 19 stations and the aim of the programme is to bring it to at least 100 stations by the end of 2016. \nHowever, it Facebook-Railtel duo may even go beyond the stations in their partnership. Reportedly they will also expand the WiFi coverage not only to railway stations but to villages settled around the stations too. \nFacebook's last attempt to bring internet to more Indian users through Free Basics faced flak from web activists and regulators after it was found that the programme was similar to digital land grab, with Facebook dictating terms of how Free Basics could be used and acting as a gatekeeper.

Courtesy: Movie Cats \nDave and Sarah are both movie lovers and feline admirers, so they thought by combining their two favorite things, they might just get something that lots of people would enjoy. \nSo the idea of recreating scenes from famous movies starring their own cats was born. Because cats make everything better! \n\"We host a pub quiz every few weeks, so we started doing it for the film/TV round, and we enjoyed it so much we decided to keep doing it as a regular quiz question,\" the couple told Love Meow . \n\"The cats clearly think we're weird, but they get loads of treats doing it which tends to be their main focus.\" \nAlien! Courtesy: Movie Cats \nWillow and Tara are the stars of the whole project. The humans take photos of their beloved cats and then use photoshop to put together the finished products. They share the images on Instagram , and ask their followers to guess what film they are trying to recreate. \nAmerican Beauty or now, American Beautiful Kitty! Courtesy: Movie Cats \nNow every Sunday, it's a collaboration between the kitties and their humans to live out their creative dreams. They turn each film into a feline version of the story, and the kitties help the humans create the most amazing movie pictures ever made. \n\"We have a lot of terrible 'out take' photos which are hilarious.\" \nThe details are stunningly accurate. What film is this one? \nWillow and Tara love the attention and all the treats, and are quite a natural in front of the camera. \nGuess the film! ",

      "text": "Home > Internet > Facebook builds on friendship with brands Facebook builds on friendship with brands | 0 Comments Umang Bedi, Managing Director, Facebook India and South Asia \nIndia is the most strategic and critical market for social media giant Facebook. The importance is, however, not just because the country is home to its second-largest user base with 166 million monthly active users. India is also fast emerging as a critical market for ad revenues for it. \nCapitalising on the increasing demand for “mobile first” campaign strategies of brands in the country, Facebook is working with several companies to help them boost brand awareness, increase brand consideration, increase in-store sales, boost offline sales by engaging with their target audience, among others. \n“Great marketing starts with great creatives,” said Umang Bedi, Managing Director, Facebook India and South Asia, adding that the company’s biggest bet is on mobile growth, user engagement, and digital advertising. \nBedi may be right. Several of these initiatives seem to have shown good results for brands. \nRecently, Facebook worked with cab aggregator Ola. Ola wanted to use Facebook to boost its brand awareness as part of its #ChaloNiklo brand campaign. Ola ran a series of targeted video ads and photo ads featuring content from its #ChaloNiklo campaign. The video content and photos contained calls to action that encouraged people to download Ola’s mobile app. In five weeks, its Facebook ads strategy achieved 3X increase in Ola’s customer acquisition rate, 4X increase in brand-related online searches and 60% increase in sales, Facebook claims. \n“Video is a fantastic medium to tell the brand story, also to get people to remember your brand long after they stop seeing the content. Facebook was an obvious choice for us, in terms of a digital partner, with one of the largest penetration in India among smartphone users. It allowed us to set up and launch our campaign very quickly on a massive scale,” said Sudarshan Gangrade, vice president, marketing, category and alliances, Ola. \nAds are extremely important for Facebook. For the year 2015, worldwide ad revenues at Facebook stood at $17.08 billion, while the overall revenues were $17.93 billion. These worldwide ad revenues are expected to touch nearly $25.9 billion this year, according to the estimates of forecasting firm eMarketer. This will make Facebook the biggest ad publisher after tech giant Google. This year, each Facebook user, world over, is expected to generate nearly $15.83 for the firm, eMarketer said. \nWhile, Facebook has been registering noticeable increase in its ad revenues, the company had admitted a few days ago that it discovered a few bugs and errors which led to misreporting of numbers across Instant Articles, Page Insights and video. \n“We believe in complete transparency. We have validation from third parties,” said Bedi on the impact of ads in India. \nLast year, Facebook launched three new tools for marketers – Blueprint, training modules for advertising on Facebook; Learn How, which is all about success in advertising through Facebook; and Ad Copy Cheat Sheet to improve ad copies. Since March 2015, Blueprint eLearning has hit 1 million enrolment and India ranks as the second largest country signing onto Blueprint. \nIn October Facebook had launched its enterprise messaging service Workplace, which will compete with Slack, Google Hangouts, Microsoft’s Yammer, Salesforce’s Quip and Evernote. India is one of the top five adopters of Workplace, besides Norway, US, UK and France. \nThere are over two million SMB (small and medium-sized business) Pages on Facebook in India as of October 2015, the company said in a media meeting on Wednesday, with over 2.4 billion interactions generated between businesses and people in India. More than 30% of active SMB pages on Facebook are owned by women. \nFacebook says it contributed $4 billion and 335,000 jobs to India through its marketing, platform and connectivity efforts, citing a 2015 Deloitte report. \nLike this report?

Yet those who do study history are doomed to stand by helplessly while everyone else repeats it.\" \nI do study history. In fact, I have a bachelor's degree in history from Rutgers University, where I graduated with honors. And, for the past week or so, I have felt doomed to stand by helplessly while everyone else is repeating history. \nMy only problem is that I can't figure out if we are repeating the 1980s and we are doomed to repeat voodoo, trickle-down Reaganomics, another disease like AIDS, and another scandal like Iran-Contra; the 2000s and we are doomed to repeat another 9/11, two more illegal, immoral, costly wars and another Great Recession; or 1932 and we missed our one great, golden opportunity for another Franklin D. Roosevelt with Bernie Sanders, and, instead, we settled for the extremely dangerous German version of history to repeat.\nI am praying for the 1980s.\nRobert K. McFadden \nUpper Macungie Township",

      "text": "Life is a story, write it. // Writer and Author. 5 mins ago Facebook and China Reports that Facebook is building (and considering deploying) a censorship tool in an effort to get into the Chinese market has created a lot of controversy. Essentially what we have here are two points of view clashing. One view is that connecting the world and engaging with countries without free speech is a savvy way of playing the long game and ensuring that, eventually, these countries open up. This has been the rationale behind economic engagement with China for a long time. George W. Bush, before he was President, said this : “First, trade with China will promote freedom. Freedom is not easily contained. Once a measure of economic freedom is permitted, a measure of political freedom will follow.” “I view free trade as an important ally in what Ronald Reagan called ‘’a forward strategy for freedom.’’ The case for trade is not just monetary, but moral, not just a matter of commerce, but a matter of conviction. Economic freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy. There are no guarantees, but there are good examples, from Chile to Taiwan. Trade freely with China, and time is on our side. . . .” Of course, the other argument is that these policies have only made China richer while it has not gotten freer. China has shown, for now, that you can get rich without being a western-style democracy. I think there are truths to both sides. On the one hand, it seems impossible to imagine China going back to an isolated North Korea-style communist dictatorship. China has come too far. Xi Jinping’s daughter went to Harvard. The top rungs of Chinese society do not reject the outside world. Indeed some argue that China is now keeping the world’s free trade system together . Ironic for a Communist party, to say the least. In that sense, trade with the outside world has locked in progress. But, on the other hand, China falls short on the sort of rights we expect in western democracies. It has proven that you, at least for now, do not need to be free to get rich(er) and you don’t need to be a democracy to succeed. And, with the surprising election of Trump, it is clear that nondemocratic models are certainly looking more appealing to some. How China handles a potential coming economic crisis will be the true test.",

The Boss also has a reproduction of Joel's Sacred Cow bobber. The Sacred Cow started out lfie as a Kawasaki W650, according to Cycle World.\nBilly Joel prepares for a sunset ride on his Indian motorcycle at the \"All For The Sea\" 10th anniversary concert at Southampton College featuring Bob Dylan August 19, 2002 in Southampton, New York. (Photo: Matthew Peyton, Getty Images)\n\"Bruce is always looking for a character bike,\" said Joel to Cycle World in 2013 . \"He has one of the new Triumph Bonnevilles, which is a great bike. I told him about our shop, so he came down in the middle of winter. It’s freezing — minus five degrees — and he wants to take out my Sacred Cow bobber. I said, ‘Are you crazy?’ It’s so cold, and he had no gear, just a helmet. After a ride, he came back and said, ‘I want you to build me that bike.’ So he gave us the specs, and we’re almost finished with it. It started out as a Kawasaki W650. The frame is black and the tank will be metalflake gold. Man, he’s hardcore.”\nMORE: Born to Ride: 5 Springsteen motorcycle moments\nThree bikers from Freehold, Dan Barkalow, Bob Grigs and Ryan Bailey, stopped to help Springsteen when he broke down on Nov. 11.\n“I just pulled over and got off the bike and said ‘Hey, I think I know you,’” Barkalow said.\nThey tried to fix the Boss' bike to no avail. Springsteen then got on Bailey's bike and they rode to the Original Mulligans Grill in Farmingdale to wait for Springsteen's ride.\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com\n39 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/2fRU23N More Stories",

      "text": "I fooled America with fake news stories and got Trump elected \nFacebook Inc. has quietly developed a censorship tool that could persuade China to allow the world’s biggest social media network to re-enter the world’s second-largest economy after a seven-year ban, the New York Times reported Tuesday. \nFacebook developed the software, which suppresses posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographies, with the support of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the newspaper said, citing unnamed current and former employees. \nZuckerberg in March met China’s propaganda chief Liu Yunshan, who said he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China’s internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \n“However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” \nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China’s foreign ministry declined to comment. \nForeign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country’s military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against “Western anti-China forces.” \nChina, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. \nThough Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, the Times said. \nFacebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third-party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. \nThere is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. \nFacebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates.

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nABICUS has been bringing cutting edge music and fashion to the Australian city of Newcastle, NSW, for the last sixteen years. This week, they’re celebrating that massive milestone by throwing a HUGE party on November 24 – but it isn’t just any party. \nWhile there’s going to be tasty beverages, food, and a very special musical performance (that we’ve been sworn to secrecy about), owners (and husband and wife super-team) Tim McPhee and Tiffany Minell wanted to give back to their community with a little bit more. \nTo do this, the pair teamed up with Byron Bay fashion label Thrills to curate a highly unique art exhibition titled Back to the Future . Sixteen artists (eight from Newcastle, and eight from Byron Bay) were commissioned to create works that have subsequently been sewn into Thrills denim jackets. \nThe exhibition will open on ABICUS’ sixteenth birthday and continue through until December 11 when the pieces will be silent auctioned. All proceeds will be donated to youth mental health organisation Headspace . \nThe auction will happen online (via a purpose built website ), where people can also make one-off donations to Headspace. \nParty goers will also have a chance to support Headspace by purchasing a Back to the Future party bag (which will only be available on the night of the party). But, these aren’t your typical party bags. They’re full of everything from LPs and Karen Walker eyewear, to Vanishing Elephant socks and coffee beans. \nIf you’d like to get down and celebrate all things ABICUS, as well as support a very worthy cause, head over to the event page and grab all the details. About the author \nCormack is a Melbourne based freelance writer and photographer. He loves to travel, drink red wine, and spin records. On the weekends you’ll most likely find him eating pork buns or shaking up cocktails for his friends. Like (0) Videos from Lost At E Minor TV Connect with us",

Salvador Rizzo , State House Bureau, @rizzoTK 12:14 p.m. EST November 22, 2016 Christie reverses his plans to end 40-year tax agreement after cutting $300 million in public workers' health care costs. Governor Christie (Photo: North Jersey Media Group file) 31 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGovernor Christie has changed his mind and will not terminate New Jersey’s tax agreement with Pennsylvania, his office announced Tuesday. \nThe announcement means taxes will not rise for thousands of low-wage and middle-class workers – mostly from South Jersey -- who commute to Pennsylvania for work. \nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania have had a tax-reciprocity agreement in place since 1977. It allows residents to pay income taxes in the state where they live instead of where they work. \nAfter years of struggling to balance the $34.5-billion state budget, Christie in September directed the state Treasury Department to notify Pennsylvania officials that New Jersey would be withdrawing from the agreement. \nThe change was expected to kick in Jan. 1, but Christie reversed himself Tuesday. \nNew Jersey’s budget would have gained an estimated $180 million in new revenue by ending the tax compact, according to Moody’s Investors Service. \nAlthough it was his idea to end the tax reciprocity agreement, Christie on Tuesday claimed he “saved” it. \nChristie said he no longer needed the extra revenue because he had successfully cut $300 million this year in costs related to public workers’ health benefits. \nThe Christie administration identified $100 million in cuts earlier this year. A bill passed by the Legislature on Monday that streamlines the bidding process for public workers’ prescription benefits would save up to $200 million, Christie said. \n“This action will save state taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in health care benefit costs, and I’m proud my administration was again able to work with elected officials from both sides of the aisle,” he said. \nThe nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services in a research note earlier this month said it was unable to estimate the cost or savings from the bill modifying the bidding process for prescription benefits. \nChristie’s move in September to end the tax compact drew opposition from Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a South Jersey Democrat whose constituents would have been hit hardest. \nNew Jersey taxes income on a sliding scale that starts at 1.4 percent for those earning $20,000 or less and ends at 8.97 percent for those making $500,000 or more. Pennsylvania has a flat income tax of 3.07 percent. \nBeyond the impact on poor and middle-class New Jersey residents who commute to Pennsylvania, ending the tax agreement would have increased income tax rates for mid- to high-level earners in Pennsylvania who work in New Jersey. 31 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://northjersy.news/2ggWf7t More Stories",

Stephen Henderson , Detroit Free Press Editorial Page Editor 9:46 p.m. EST November 23, 2016 After a divisive election, can we come together on Thanksgiving? (Photo: File photo by Fabrizio Costantini, Special to the Free Press) \nThankful and fearful live at disparate ends of the emotional spectrum. \nBut they can find common ground in the intensity with which they’re felt, the heat of their passion. \nCan we find anything truer this Thanksgiving, just weeks after one of the most divisive election campaigns in recent history? \nThe one thing that will be tested more than any other this holiday is whether fear and thanks can truly coexist in our nation, and in our lives. Whether it’s possible to celebrate the things that bring us together — family, love, belief — at a time when we feel so bitterly, justifiably, on opposite sides of the world, maybe of the universe. \n► Stephen Henderson: Vote for Trump was a consent, purposeful or not, to bigotry \nAnd that’s all swirling before we get to the dinner table in the first place. \nMore than before, any time before, I’ve heard stories from friends about familial discord so bitter that Thanksgiving looms as a war over values and politics, or has been threatened altogether as deeply entrenched factions vow to go their separate ways. \nI know people who will not share thanks over turkey with their parents for the first time, because the things that got broken over the past 18 months couldn’t get fixed in time. \nI know siblings who can’t bring themselves to speak to one another, because one is thankful for the outcome of the election, while the other is equally filled with fear. \nIt has become impossible, for many, to live on either side of that equation without damning the other. And forget the idea of putting it aside for a day. It’s too hard, too much. It would mean a sacrifice of ourselves, our essence. \nNo question, I can relate. The fear is real in the American communities that Donald Trump promised to savage. Fear also drives the thanks that so many are expressing for the election outcome — the fear of being forgotten and looked over, the fear of being left behind. \nThanksgiving could be, for many of us, an opportunity to see more of that commonality, and understand it a bit more where it exists closest to us — in our families. \nI can also relate to the idea of strife over holiday. \nI grew up in a family, my mother’s, that seemed to thrive on spirited dinner-table debate, and nowhere was that more vivid than on Thanksgiving. My mom and her parents and siblings could unpack every problem in the world, and get after each other over every facet of those problems. Politics. Economics. Child-rearing. \nNothing seemed off-limits, and the discussions often boiled over as arguments, sometimes with tearful, passionate endings. \nI remember asking my mother once why everyone in our family seemed to be angry with one another, so determined to take that anger out at holiday dinner. \nShe tried to tell me the difference between passion and anger, and reminded me that despite the anticipated rancor, everyone always showed up. \nWhy? \nBecause we all love each other, she said. \nMaybe one of the keys to getting through this Thanksgiving is focusing on memory. \nRemember the love that each of us has for this country. And it wouldn’t hurt for us to try, at least, to remember that both the thankful and the fearful among us are driven, at some level, by that love of our country. \nAnd remember, in our families, that we are connected regardless of our emotional states or political leanings. Thankful or fearful, we should try to remember why we love each other, and that our love should be stronger than anything else. \nComplexity of thought and feeling is not an impeachment of that love, but at the heart of its strength. \nOur ability to overcome, to persevere and remain bonded — that is the essence of both our American spirit, and our familial mettle. \nI am fearful that this election is the dawn of an uglier age, the unveiling of an America that is meaner and less caring, that is more accepting of bigotry and dangerously open to ideas that border on tyranny. \nBut I am thankful, still, for this country's existence, and especially for those closest to me, regardless of their own thoughts about what will come next in America. \nI am thankful that there is still time, still room, for us to come together, maybe just for a day, over a ritual of meal and conversation. Not as much to celebrate as to remember, and to embrace love and civility as vehicles for repair, as a bridge between the poles of thankfulness and fear. \nAnd I am hopeful, just a little, that no matter where we are on the emotional spectrum today, most of us will find a way to do that.

      "text": "Comments \nIn his 30s, Chris Pan has accomplished a lot for his age. He worked as a Senior Consultant at McKinsey & Co, followed by two years as a marketing director for PepsiCo. He then spent four years working at Facebook. While he was there, Mark Zuckerberg took an interest in learning Chinese and recruited Pan to help. \n“I facilitated weekly discussions on various topics with other mandarin speaking colleagues.” Pan told NextShark. “It was such a meaningful and inspiring experience getting to spend quality time each week with Mark. \n“He is really down-to-earth, thoughtful, and a super quick learner. After just learning mandarin for 2 years, he hosted a Q&A in mandarin with 20 CEOs from the biggest Chinese companies (that collectively represent 4% of China’s GDP) almost entirely on his own! However, my biggest takeaway is his deep sense of mission and purpose.” \nAfter four years (a long time for Silicon Valley), Pan was ready to explore other ideas. He started traveling the world, and eventually met a new friend Ingrid Sanders who offered to make him an intention bracelet. \n“She asked me to choose a word as a daily reminder. The first word that came to mind was ‘impact’ – probably from my Facebook days where we had big posters that said ‘FOCUS ON IMPACT’. I also wanted to remind myself to make a difference.” \nA few weeks later, Sanders gave Pan a kit and told him to make these for his friends as he was moving to Los Angeles. When Pan moved to LA, he was seeking community and positivity. \n“ I started hosting Sunday gatherings doing yoga, meditation, singing, and painting. We would also set-up a table with the kit for making intention bracelets. We would ask each other “What’s Your WORD?” The conversations around finding your ‘WORD’ really set a positive and meaningful tone for the gatherings.” \n“There was such a buzz around finding your word. For some people, it was a virtue that they wanted more of in their life. For others, it was a challenge they wanted to overcome, or a passion they wanted to spend more time on.” \nPan started getting calls from friends asking for more bracelets. He was also invited to a fundraiser by actress Torrey Devitto to raise money for orphans with HIV in Africa. \nMore requests came in and Pan started hiring friends to make the pieces. The MyIntent project was born: \n“Our mission is to be a catalyst for meaningful conversations and positive energy. We believe there is purpose inside each of us and we want our efforts to encourage people to share more truth and inspiration with each other. We are not a jewelry company – we are an intentions project.” \nTo maximize impact, Pan wanted to keep pieces affordable which meant keeping costs low and being scrappy. He started in a friend’s living room and eventually sublet warehouse space in LA’s skid row. \nWord spread organically, including many celebrities in LA. Jay Z, who loved the concept, invited Pan to his Roc Nation brunch, where celebrities including Rihanna (FAITH) and Beyonce (SURRENDER) also chose words. Since then, influencers like Justin Bieber (PURPOSE), Katie Couric (FAITH), Conan O’Brien (DEATH BED), Blake Griffin (FOCUS), Larry King (WHY), and Daymond John (HEALTH) have all been seen wearing a MyIntent Bracelet. \nMost recently, the founders of Airbnb gifted all their attendees a MyIntent Bracelet at the annual Airbnb Open and invited Pan to speak.

(@myintent) on Nov 21, 2016 at 1:17pm PST \nAlthough it looks like a simple piece of jewelry, it’s magic is in connecting people with the power of their own intention. \nA photo posted by MyIntent – What’s Your WORD? (@myintent) on Nov 23, 2016 at 1:46am PST \nLast December, the Today Show aired a feature on MyIntent and they suddenly had a 4-week backlog of orders. \nSince then, they’ve quadrupled their production capacity. They are also offering kits so you can make your own pieces for friends. \nThese are perfect as holiday gifts. For NextShark readers, they are offering a special 20% discount off everything in their store – use code NEXT20 at checkout: www.MyIntent.org (Visited 67 times, 129 visits today)",

      "text": "3 Thanks, this is a great point, which highlights why Facebook is so reluctant to manage the flow of content to bring up the ‘good’ and submerge the ‘bad’, and why we shouldn’t want it to : any solution to a problem of democracy that relies on preventing people expressing their views is no solution at all. However, this post is all about the perspective of Facebook users when we’re in sharing mode, not in receiving mode. I’d like to know more about how we feel about what we see. When Tim forwards us a link from Ending the Fed, do we take it at face value? How much of our trust in content is invested in who shares it with us, rather than the producer? How likely are we to call out material from friends that we think is misleading, untrue or dangerous? If the processes Facebook has created to allow us to communicate our identities are genuinely corrosive of our politics, then it’s not an answer to say “it’s just people expressing themselves.” It’s still in our, and I believe Facebook’s, interest to find better ways for it to serve its purpose, with fewer negative externalities.",

      "text": " Share Share on Facebook + Comments \nThe Seahawks won the SB in February 2014 with a robust running game led by The Beast and a great run blocking offensive line. Two years later, every member of the offensive line, starters (Okung, Carp, Unger, Sweezy, Breno) and backups (McQ, JP, Bailey, Bowie), was gone . \nIf you accept the view that OL performance hinges on continuity, familiarity, synergy and chemistry developed over time, the performance of our OL over the past two years is exactly what you'd expect. \nBut is it? \nYes, the Seahawks OL has been \"a work in progress\" in the past two years and has not performed adequately especially in the first half of both seasons. But, if you take a closer look at this OL with a view ahead, it is nothing short of miraculous . \nAllow me to explain – \nThe current starting OL looks like the Seahawks had zero trust in whatever it is the college coaches teach their players. The players on this OL are either tackles drafted in the top 4 rounds playing as Guards and Center (Ifedi – 1st rd, Britt – 2nd rd, Glow – 4th rd) or athletic UDFAs with no experience whatsoever as offensive linemen playing at Tackle (Gilliam, Fant). \nStop and think about it for a minute. \nYes, it's common to draft college tackles to play guards in the NFL. It is not uncommon to have a college Tackle end up playing Center in the NFL. Having a UFDA that hardly played any football at all and the little he did play was as TE and converting him into a functional starting Tackle in the NFL is the stuff that \" against all odds \" sports movies are made of. Tackles are the most important members of the OL and even college superstars at that position fail miserably at the NFL level. Finding a player that never played on an OL and making him an NFL starter is a once in a lifetime aberration \nSo, if this unlikely aberration is a sports fairy tale, what do you call a team that starts TWO of those at both Tackle positions? – A MIRACLE . \nFant and Gilliam will not be on any list of 10 Best Tackles in the NFL. I am pretty sure that neither of them will break the top 32 tackles list (this year). Still, the fact that they are the starting left and right tackles for the 7-2-1 Seahawks is mind-boggling. \nWe can take this miracle and turn it into a statement about John Schneider's genius in uncovering untapped potential or we can make it about Cable's coaching talent, but I am going to talk about how it affects the current and future Seahawks team. \nDuring RW's four years under a rookie contract, we heard a lot about the benefits of a franchise QB earning a rookie salary. A lot of the Seahawks' success was attributed to being able to divert the starting QB cap space to other positions and elevating the roster quality. I would posit that two starting tackles that did not cost the team draft picks or cap space is just as huge an advantage as a 3rd round rookie franchise QB. \nWhen you consider how hard it is for an NFL team to find a solid LT, having one that is a UDFA on his first year of 5 years under club control is a huge advantage. \nLooking ahead, when the veteran on your OL is a 3rd-year player and your game day backups are rookies you have all the pieces in place to create continuity, synergy and chemistry over the years to come. \nIn other words, the weakest position group on the Seahawks roster in the past two years has all the ingredients to become solid, if not a position of strength next year given that the entire group will return in 2017. Cable can use the off-season to tweak a group that has already played together for a year rather than invest the majority of his practice time teaching the basic ZBS technique to a bunch of wide eyed newbies. \nAll of this is going to happen on a team that has all the offensive weapons under contract for next year and beyond, including a franchise QB entering the prime of his career. \n2017 could be the year that the Seahawk's offense will challenge the defense as the dominant side of the team. \nI am very optimistic regarding our chances to win it all this year. I believe that this team is reaching its prime and if we can avoid losing some trap games like this Sunday (TB's offense against our depleted secondary) and make it to the playoffs in good health – nothing should stop us. \nThe miracle of the OL should bear sweet fruit next year and potentially set this team up for a legendary-type of season that may surpass anything we have ever seen. I am talking about a 19-0 type of a season (or 18-1 if you allow for that inevitable RAMS game we forget to show up to). \nGO HAWKS",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nSomehow we're squeezing 18 people into our apartment for Thanksgiving this year, a year when too many people are worrying about fraught post-election conversations. My relatives, who luckily are all cut from the same political cloth, range in age from my mother, aged 92, to my 32-year-old nephew (my 17-month-old granddaughter's political leanings are still unfolding.) \nI love them all, but in a way the one I know best is the middle-aged man across the table whose blue eyes look just like mine: my younger brother Paul. \nPaul and I irritated each other when we were kids; I would take bites out of his precisely made sandwiches in just the spot I knew he didn't want me to, and he would hang around the living room telling jokes when he knew I wanted to be alone with the boy on the couch. \nBut as adults we've always had each other's backs, especially when it comes to dealing with our mother's health crises, which have become more frequent in the past few years. Paul is the first person I want to talk to when there's something that worries me about Mom; I know he'll be worried, too. \nThere's probably a biological explanation for the intensity of the sibling bond. Siblings share half their genes, which evolutionary biologists say should be motivation enough for mutual devotion. \"I would lay down my life,\" British biologist J.B.S. Haldane once said, applying the arithmetic of kin selection , \"for two brothers or eight cousins.\" Siblings are a crucial part of a child's development, too, teaching one another socialization skills and the rules of dominance and hierarchy, all part of the eternal struggle for parental resources. \nWhen psychologists study siblings, they usually study children, emphasizing sibling rivalry and the fact that brothers and sisters refine their social maneuvering skills on one another. The adult sibling relationship has only sporadically been the subject of attention. Yet we're tethered to our brothers and sisters as adults far longer than we are as children; our sibling relationships, in fact, are the longest-lasting family ties we have. \nMost such relationships are close — two-thirds of people in one large study said a brother or sister was one of their best friends. One thing that can scuttle closeness in adulthood is a parent who played favorites in childhood; this sense of resentment can last a lifetime. \nJill Suitor, a sociologist at Purdue University, and her colleagues polled 274 families with 708 adult children (ages 23 to 68) in 2009 and found that the majority had good feelings toward their siblings. Most didn't remember much favoritism when they were kids, but those who did reported feeling less loved and cared for by their siblings. It didn't matter whether they felt themselves to be the favored or the unfavored child. The simple perception of parental favoritism was enough to undermine their relationship. \nThat's one thing Paul and I have going for us: We're pretty sure our parents treated us the same when we were growing up. Yet we're very different people. Paul is gregarious while I'm shy, funny while I'm not, a terrific amateur saxophonist while I can't read music or carry a tune. This isn't unusual. In families with more than one child, every sibling seems to get a label in contrast to every other sibling. \nSo if your kid sister is the queen bee in any social gathering, you might get labeled \"the quiet one\" even if you're not especially quiet, just quiet in comparison. And if you're a bright child who always gets good grades, you might not get much credit for that if your big brother is a brilliant child with straight A's. There's only room for one \"smart one\" per family — you'll have to come up with something else. (I was smart, but Paul was smarter; I ended up being the \"good one.\") \nThe very presence of siblings in the household can be an education. When a new baby is born, writes psychologist Victor Cicirelli in the 1995 book Sibling Relationships Across the Life Span , \"the older sibling gains in social skills in interacting with the younger\" and \"the younger sibling gains cognitively by imitating the older.\" \nThey learn from the friction between them, too, as they fight for their parents' attention. Mild conflict between brothers and sisters teaches them how to interact with peers, co-workers and friends for the rest of their lives. \nThe benefits can carry into old age. The literature on sibling relationships shows that during middle age and old age, indicators of well-being — mood, health, morale, stress, depression, loneliness, life satisfaction — are tied to how you feel about your brothers and sisters. \nIn one Swedish study , satisfaction with sibling contact in one's 80s was closely correlated with health and positive mood — more so than was satisfaction with friendships or relationships with adult children. And loneliness was eased for older people in a supportive relationship with their siblings, no matter whether they gave or got support. \nThat's why it's so sad when things between siblings fall apart. This often happens when aging parents need care or die — old feelings of rivalry, jealousy and grief erupt all over again, masked as petty fights ostensibly over who takes Mom to the doctor or who calls the nursing home about Dad. \nMany families get through their parents' illnesses just fine, establishing networks where the workload is divided pretty much equally. So far, Paul and I have done fine, too. But about 40 percent of the time, according to one study , there is a single primary caregiver who feels like she (and it's almost always a she) is not getting any help from her brothers and sisters, which can lead to serious conflict. \nAnd because of the particular intensity of sibling relationships, such conflict cuts to the bone. People grieve for the frayed ties to their siblings as though they've lost a piece of themselves. \nThroughout adulthood, the sibling relationship \"is powerful and never static,\" said Jane Mersky Leder, author of The Sibling Connection . Whether we are close to our siblings or distant, she writes, they remain our brothers and sisters — for better or for worse. \nSo let this all percolate as you sit down to turkey with your sometimes-complicated family. And remember the immortal words of folksinger Loudon Wainwright III, in a song called Thanksgiving. It's about spending the holiday with a brother and a sister he rarely sees but still has intense feelings about: \nOn this auspicious occasion, this special family dinner \nIf I argue with a loved one, Lord, please make me the winner. \nScience writer Robin Marantz Henig is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and the author of nine books.

      "text": "Birmingham First church recreates Bethlehem for children Photo from Facebook # Comments \nTravel back to the ancient city of Bethlehem at 3:30 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 3 at Birmingham First. \nChildren will be provided with denaria to “spend” at the marketplace. They can shop for a headpiece at the clothier, combine spices at the spice shop, help build a special cradle and make a wooden driedel. They can weave fibers, stamp papyrus scrolls, knead bread dough, punch tin and make clay pinch pots. \nThe census taker, roaming villagers, story tellers and market vendors along with live animals (donkey, alpaca, goats, sheep and rabbits) all make this an interactive experience for families this Christmas season. Explore the village and then stay for the free “Dinner at the Inn.” Dinner at the Inn is available from 5 to 6 p.m.. \nThe church is located at 1589 W. Maple Road (between Southfield and Cranbrook) in Birmingham. Advertisement",

      "title": "NSFW: Instagram ‘Vulva Gallery’ Lauds Beauty In Diversity Of The Female Body",
      "text": "Like us on Facebook “All vulvas are amazing and beautiful just the way they are.” Illustrator Hilde Atalanta from Amsterdam initiated Instagram account ‘The Vulva Gallery’ this year to change people’s perspective about diversity of the female external genitalia. As the name suggests, the gallery is an illustrated collection that showcases the vast diversity of the vulva. “The only way to change the way...individuals experience their bodies is to educate them, and others, about the natural diversity,” Atalanta writes on the gallery’s website . Pressures from society and body “ideals” have led to women opting to have their genitals surgically enhanced. “In the past decade there has been an enormous increase in labiaplasty amongst young women,” Atalanta explains. Labiaplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure to partially or entirely alter the size of the labia minora–the inner fold of the vulva. “In my opinion, labiaplasty because of cosmetical reasons isn’t a good development. No vulva-owning individual should have to undergo this just because they want their vulva to look like the ones they see on the internet (for example in porn), or like what they think other people expect them to look.” “…to have a surgeon cut away such a delicate part of your body–a part that is so sensitive, that gives you sexual pleasure, a natural part of yourself–just to look ‘pretty’; it’s hard for me to grasp that this is happening so often.” Advertisement Similar to many other youths out there, Atalanta had experienced insecurities about her own body growing up. Nevertheless, she expresses sadness upon seeing the vast impact that societal pressures have had on females–ultimately pushing them to undergo surgery. “Showing them that there are so many different body types, in many shapes, sizes, and colours. I hope that The Vulva Gallery can contribute to the way people view the broad range of vulvas, and that they are perfect just the way they are. Because diversity is beautiful.” Preview some of the works on the Instagram below and follow ‘the.vulva.gallery’ for regular updates.

Victims are then prompted to install browser extensions to view the \"video\". After that, Locky is downloaded and installed Locky is relatively new ransomware that is quite nasty. It attacks all local drives as well as network drives and uses both RSA and AES encryption to lock files on an infected machine Locky encrypts your files and demands a ransom for the cryptographic key to unlock them Payment is typically demanded via Bitcoin \"As always, be wary when someone sends you just an 'image' – especially when it is not how he or she would usually behave,\" - security researcher Bart Blaze Blaze added: \"Even though both Facebook and Google have excellent security controls/measures in place, something bad can always happen.\" \"Given that so many users check their Facebook at work, there's a big risk of this attack bleeding through into the enterprise. The best thing for businesses to do to minimize their risk is to ensure employees are aware of this scam.\" - security researcher Fraser Kyne Locky has rapidly become a favorite of criminals because of it's advanced capabilities As of this writing, Google has removed the malicious extensions from its Chrome Store If you've installed the malicious extensions, you should remove them immediately. Google how to remove extensions for your browser If you get Locky, a recent backup is your only hope other than paying the ransom You can learn more about Locky here: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/03/look-into-locky/ Make your smartphone battery last longer: As smartphones get increasingly powerful and useful, they consume power more quickly, making battery life an irritation for many users Other than the obvious choice of ensuring that you always have a charger available (chargers are worth more than gold at my house) here are some things you can do to extend battery life: Decrease the brightness of your screen Decrease the timeout for your screen so that it goes dark sooner Disable Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi when not needed (good for security too) Disable your phone’s vibrate function and haptic feedback Disable key tones and lower the volume of your ringtones Disable Location services Explore your phone's power saving mode: My Android phone has a Power Saving Mode and Ultra Power Saving mode Ultra Power Saving mode will vastly extend the life of my battery. With a 63% charge, it's estimated to last 7.9 days. However, it has very limited functionality Avoid using the flash for photography Disable or limit notifications and background services Minimize application use, especially those that run constantly in the background, and games. Pokemon Go is notorious for killing batteries Update your apps regularly. Updates may contain fixes that make apps more efficient Get an external battery Last, and probably too obvious, turn the phone off I grew up in Delhi Township and graduated from Oak Hills H.S. in 1983.

      "title": "11 Gifts for the Beer Geek in Your Life",
      "text": "Uncommon Goods Like us on Facebook \nThe beer lover in your life doesn’t need another hilarious “Will Work for Beer” t-shirt this year. Instead, try one of these options. 1. 99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL SCRATCH-OFF ; $35 \nIt can be hard to find tasteful home décor that reflects a love of beer, and it can be just as tough to keep track of the brews you’ve tried. This print from Pop Chart Lab cleverly solves both issues by featuring 99 lauded beers—from American classics like Three Floyds’ Zombie Dust to European stalwarts like Drie Fonteinen’s Oude Geuze—in a scratch-off format. When your brew-loving buddy tries a new beer, he or she can scratch it off to track their progress. It’s like an instant lottery game, except they win every time. 2. UKEG 64 PRESSURIZED GROWLER ; $139 \nGrowlers offer a great way to bring home a beer that doesn’t make its way into cans or bottles, but they’re not perfect. Unless you plan to drink all 64 ounces in a single sitting, you’re likely to end up with flat beer. Present a solution: The uKeg 64 Pressurized Growler uses a CO2 cartridge to ensure that the last pour from this growler is as lively as the first, and its custom tap makes it easy to pour one out. 3. THE OXFORD COMPANION TO BEER ; $43 \nBeer lovers can be a little obsessive about their passion, and if you’re shopping for someone who’s thirsty for knowledge, there’s no better place to start than this comprehensive reference. Edited by Brooklyn Brewery brewmaster Garrett Oliver, the Oxford Companion crams an incredible amount of information about beer culture, history, styles, brewing methodologies, and more into 900 pages. Even the most well-versed know-it-all will learn something from this text. And if you’re shopping for a beer-loving foodie, Oliver’s classic The Brewmaster’s Table: Discovering the Pleasures of Real Beer with Real Food makes an excellent gift, too. 4. BEER CAP MAP OF THE UNITED STATES ; $35 \nBrewers keep making more intricate and beautiful bottle caps, and it’s a shame to just chuck that art into the trash each time you pop a bottle. If your giftee is trying to drink their way through all 50 states, this fun wooden map helps them keep track of progress while preserving standout caps. 5. LIBBEY CRAFT BREW SAMPLER CLEAR BEER GLASS SET ; $25 \nPouring a beer into a glass enhances the whole sensory experience each sip offers. By allowing the user to better see and smell what they're drinking, the glass is a valuable aid in fully enjoying each brew. And since different shapes of glasses suit different styles of beer, a beer geek’s glassware collection can never be too large. While there’s a dizzying variety of cool brewery-branded glassware on the market, this six-piece set from Libbey covers all the bases and enables your favorite beer geek to sip everything from dense Russian imperial stouts to refreshing German hefeweizens. Plus, at just $25, it's a steal. 6. BROOKLYN BREW SHOP BEER MAKING KIT ; $38 \nWith a little know-how and the right recipe, home brewers can make beers that rival the offerings of their commercial counterparts. If someone on your list wants to dip their toe into the home brewing waters, Brooklyn Brew Shop offers kits that come with almost everything they'll need to make a gallon of beer. With styles ranging from Everyday IPA to Chocolate Maple Porter to Jalapeno Saison, there’s something for everyone. 7. BEER SOAP ; $10 \nFor a number of reasons, it can be hard to enjoy a delicious, hoppy IPA whenever you want one. Enter the next best thing: catching a pleasant whiff of brew. Swag Brewery craft soaps made with real beer. Available in nine varieties—including oatmeal stout, IPA, and Belgian witbier—these soaps will finally give you even more reason to wash your hands. 8. DAS CAN-IN-STEIN ; $10 \nDrinking from a pewter tankard is a great way to add a colonial-grog-house vibe to an evening, but it’s not always practical. Das Can-In-Stein changes that. Your loved one just needs to slip their favorite 12-ounce can into the frame and enjoy. 9. BEER CARRYING BRIEFCASE ; $40 \nTraveling with a six-pack can be tricky. You want to be inconspicuous, but you’ve got that bulky shape and bottles inevitably jingling together conspiring to blow your cover. Help a brew-loving buddy out. This padded briefcase securely holds a six-pack of standard 12-ounce bottles, enabling them to safely transport suds from point A to point B—all while feeling just a little bit like a secret agent. 10. WESTMARK GERMAN HERMETUS RESEALER BOTTLE OPENER ; $6 \nDowning an entire 22-ounce bomber of a boozy imperial stout or double IPA in a single sitting can be a delicious but questionable decision. With Westmark’s clever bottle opener, saving part of the bottle for the next day is a little easier. The Hermetus opener pops caps like normal, but once your giftee is ready to call it quits, it slides across the top of the bottle to form a tight, bubble-preserving seal. \nFind It: Amazon 11. BEER; PRICE VARIES \nDon’t overthink this. If you’re shopping for a beer lover, you can’t go wrong picking up a six-pack or growler as part of the gift. Free beer is the best beer, and you might get your recipient something they would have overlooked on their own shopping trips. If you’re traveling for the holidays, you’re sure to put a smile on a beer lover’s face by bringing them a local offering they can’t normally get their hands on. If you’re lucky, you might even spot a holiday gift pack that throws in a free glass with a few bottles. \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers and may receive a small percentage on any purchase you make. But we only get commission on items you buy and don’t return, so we’re only happy if you’re happy. Thanks for helping us pay the bills! More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works \nThere are several different ways hackers use a breached Facebook account. Automatic logins through Facebook allow hackers access to many different site accounts once they've taken over your Facebook account. Spammers hack Facebook accounts to gain access to your following. Your account also gives a hacker a lot of personal information about you that can be used to steal your identity. \nIf you worry that your account has been hacked, there is a simple way to check. Go to the arrow in the upper right-hand corner of your Facebook page and click on it. In the menu, select Settings. A new menu will pop up.Choose Security and then Where You're Logged In . \nA list of all of the devices that you've logged into and their locations. If there is a login you don't recognize, chances are you may have been hacked. If you see anything that isn't you, click End Activity on the right side of the log to end the session. The hacker will be logged out, temporarily. Photo by Alina Bradford/CNET \nSome other ways to tell if your account has been hacked are: Your name, birthday, email or password has been changed Someone sent out friend requests to people you don't know Messages have been sent from your account, but you didn't write them Posts are appearing on your timeline that you didn't post What to do if your Facebook has been hacked \nOnce you click on End Activity, change your password right away. Next, get Facebook's help. Facebook has a system to help you if you've been hacked. \nGo to the Facebook help page , click on I think my account was hacked or someone is using it without my permission , and then click on secure it . Facebook will take you to a page where you log in and then go about the steps to securing your account. Share your voice ",

Brian Dickerson , Detroit Free Press Columnist 12 a.m. EST November 27, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump gives his acceptance speech during his election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (Photo: John Locher, AP) \nDear President-elect Trump: \nEver since your election, I've been asking myself what I, an ordinary citizen, could do to help you prepare for the awesome burden of responsibility you're about to assume. So I decided to help out by reading your mail. \nI hope you don't mind. I don't think I'm violating any federal laws here; I haven't hacked your private e-mail server or anything like that. \nAnd I'm not acting on behalf of WikiLeaks or Edward Snowden or the Russian government. \nI simply noticed that an awful lot of the people seeking your attention as you plot your White House agenda have chosen to do so by writing you open letters that are easily accessible to anyone with internet access. \nMy sense that this has become the go-to format for supplicants seeking presidential favor was confirmed when my Google search for the phrase \"an open letter to President-elect Trump\" yielded 24,000 results. \nThat's a lot of open letters (Does anyone dash off notes meant for one person anymore?), and I figured that whoever is responsible for managing this digital tsunami could use some help sorting and summarizing it. \nThe range of people and organizations with urgent messages is breathtaking: In a first pass, I discovered open letters from university presidents , anti-abortion activists , rape survivors , the Greater Coachella Valley (Ariz.) Chamber of Commerce , and David Miscavige, royal imperial galactic sovereign and protector of galaxies , (who describes himself as a \"fellow global leader\" and \"goodwill ambassador for the Church of Scientology,\" although he appears not to be on the payroll there). \nThere is even a website called LetterToDonaldTrump.com , which bills itself as \"your place to leave an open letter to the 45th President-elect of the U.S..\" \nBut the authors of these missives fall roughly into one of two broad categories: people who are afraid you won't actually do any of the things you've promised to do, and people who are afraid you will. \nI've tried to include examples of both groups in the sampling I've provided here. (In each case, I've included an executive summary as well as a link to the actual letter; I know how you feel about information that's been filtered by gutter-dwelling professional journalists such as myself, most of whom should have been deported long ago; although, like many of my colleagues, I like to imagine you were only kidding when you said all those things, many of which were \"not nice,\" and even \"sad!\") From Catholics \nMost voters understand the difference between the aspirations presidential candidates invoke on the campaign trail and things a victorious candidate can expect to accomplish in office. \nBut not everyone makes this crucial distinction, as this letter from an organization called Catholic Vote suggests: \nYou boldly offered very specific promises including 1) Defunding Planned Parenthood, 2) Nominating pro-life justices to the Supreme Court, 3) Signing new legislation to protect religious liberty, including the First Amendment Defense Act, and 4) Supporting greater access to school choice . . .Your backing of these policies, combined with your pledges to protect life and religious liberty, enabled the Trump-Pence ticket to win Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — giving you the necessary votes to deliver victory. ( www.catholicvote.org ) \nThe letter excerpted above hints at the disappointment some literal-minded Catholics may feel if you fail to translate their aspirations into concrete government policies, \nBut I wouldn't worry about it too much. After all, if you can't figure out how to repeal Roe v. Wade in the next four years, who are these voters going to turn to? Elizabeth Warren? From Elizabeth Warren \nSpeaking of the senior senator from Massachusetts, it seems she has written you an open letter , too: \nDuring your campaign … you promised that you would \"not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long,\" and that you would \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, D.C. Now it is time to live up to those promises. Unfortunately, you already appear to be failing. Within days of your election, you have elevated a slew of Wall Street bankers, industry insiders, and special interest lobbyists to your transition team. Even more are rumored to be named as potential cabinet members. Based on public reports, your transition team and your potential cabinet include over 20 Wall Street elites, industry insiders, and lobbyists making decisions that could have huge implications for their clients or employers. ( www.warren.senate.gov ) \nI think you see where Sen. Warren is going here. Sen. Warren is not your friend. From a hip-hop music magnate \nNot all liberals are as eager to distance themselves from you as Sen. Warren is. Among those who hope to appeal to your progressive side is Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons, who calls himself an old friend and says in his open letter to you that it's time to come home to your Manhattan homeboys: \nYou have many progressive friends from New York. … It is time to bring them back into your circle, so you can get honest advice from people who have known you for years. Those who have surrounded you during the campaign have offered some very dangerous policies that would hurt people and the planet, which I want to believe you still care about. The far right wing and the alt-right were your most staunch supporters, but those people are not your friends and you know that. You have the chance to be the first true independent president this country has ever seen, but your radical beliefs you ran on during your campaign must be addressed. ( www.huffingtonpost.com/author/russell-simmons ) \nI can hear you rolling your eyes, sir. Or maybe you were just distracted by that Saturday Night Live skit CNN keeps playing over and over, But Russell Simmons is one of those guys who may come in handy sometime in the next four years. (You know what I'm talking about.) \nMaybe send him tickets to one of the lesser inaugural balls? From the makers of Ben & Jerry's \nAn open letter affords its author the opportunity to address many target audiences besides the primary one. This missive from the folks at Ben & Jerry's is a case in point, reminding a customer base that is a teensy bit more left-leaning than your own that the Vermont-based company has not abandoned them: \nWe stand with women, people of color, Muslims, migrants, refugees, the LGBTQ community, the poor, and others whose lives may be further compromised by the policies and rhetoric you espoused during your campaign. And we commit to stand with you if your work is toward building a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. ( www. benjerry.com/values/issues-we-care-about/democracy/dear-president-elect-trump ) \nYou get the drift, sir: Ben & Jerry's is headquartered about an hour east of Burlington, Vt., where Bernie Sanders began his political career. They're not averse to being pleasantly surprised if you throw a few bones their way, But they're not planning to name a new ice cream flavor in your honor any time soon. From Pravda \nOf all the congratulatory messages pouring in from overseas, few are as sickeningly obsequious effusive as this open letter from Lisa Karpova, a columnist for the Russian online newpaper Pravda.ru, who gushes: \nI hope you have even a small idea of the huge sigh of relief going across the globe. Your victory has saved the planet from the globalists, from Clinton and her determination to take things over the edge to the unthinkable. World War 3. ( www.pravdareport.com/world/americas/14-11-2016/136160-open_letter_trump-0/ ) \nKarpova invites you to visit Moscow on May 9, the anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender to the Soviet Union and suggests that \"you will be surprised by what you find when you meet Vladimir Putin and see that Russia has a form of democracy that works for the circumstances that are unique to Russia.\" \nA cautionary note here: While Karpova is a huge Putin fan, her online publication is no longer the official organ of the Communist Party, and 'it's not clear that she speaks for Putin in the same way that, say Steve Bannon speaks for you. \nBut I don't think you have to worry about losing the Russian press. \nP.S.: Got your text about Karpova, Not much online in the way of photos, But yes, I'll try to find out what she looks like. \nRepublican president-elect Donald Trump gives greets people in the crowd after delivering his acceptance speech at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) From the National Press Club \nA lot of the open letters I've reviewed are from various elites whose irrelevance was decisively established by your electoral victory. Their hysterical protestations of their continuing significance are typified by this plea from the National Press Club, which unreasonably suggests that you should continue to observe the rules of engagement observed by the less media-savvy presidents who preceded you: \nAs the new leader of the free world, we expect that you will preserve longstanding traditions that ensure coverage of the Trump presidency. The idea of a press pool that covers all of the president's movements is one that dates back to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration. Every president of both parties has treated this important tradition with respect. The role of the press pool is critically important to our country, whose citizens depend on and deserve to know what the president is doing. This isn't about access for the press itself, it's about access for Americans in diverse communities across the country. ( www.press.org/news-multimedia/president ) \nNo need to dignify this with a response. If White House reporters want to ask you a question, they can tweet at you like anyone else.

When Deepak opened up to Sarang, he took him to a restaurant in the area, since the child said he always wondered how things are inside.\nIn his Facebook post, Sarang narrates how excited Deepak was to see the washroom and kept splashing water on himself when he took him inside to wash hands. He also mentioned how the little boy’s happiness gave him joy that concerts or fancy cars couldn’t.",

What will you give? (Photo: iStockphoto) \nAfter the retail frenzy that is Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you may have a bit of a retail hangover. The cure for that slightly sick feeling could be the great feeling you get from helping others, and that's what Giving Tuesday is all about. Claire Costello, national philanthropy practice executive with U.S. Trust, answers key questions about the event, held the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. \nQ: What is Giving Tuesday? \nA: Giving Tuesday is a globally celebrated day of giving back. The holiday has gained massive influence thanks to the power of social media, with #GivingTuesday serving as a call-to-action for people around the world to donate money, time and talent to the causes they care most about. The day is also intended to signify the kickoff to the charitable giving season surrounding the holidays and annual year-end giving — though, for many, giving starts even earlier or is a year-round activity. Charity choices and precautions: Find the right one for you \nQ: How do you decide which organizations or causes to support? \nA: A recent study from U.S. Trust revealed that affluent donors’ greatest challenge when it comes to charitable giving is identifying what causes they care about and deciding where to donate. A good place to start is asking yourself some key questions: What are your values? What are you passionate about? What issues of the day matter most to you? What is your ultimate vision of the impact you wish to make? Is your goal to advance a global cause, to engage with issues in your local community, or perhaps both? Your answers will help inform the issues that you choose to address. From there you can begin to develop specific goals aimed at achieving your vision and to establish the criteria for the type of organizations to partner with — whether large or small, blue chip or fledgling, community-based or nationally focused, to name a few. \nClaire Costello, national philanthropic practice executive for U.S. Trust. (Photo: U.S. Trust) \nQ: How do you vet an organization? \nA: As is true with any investment, it is important to do your due diligence before giving to a non-profit. This includes identifying what your preferences and criteria are with respect to the organization mission, type, profile, financial situation and leadership. Information about an organization can be gathered from a number of sources, including personal references from others who have worked with the non-profit, information from the organization itself (e.g., websites, annual reports, etc.), public reports in the media and third-party sites such as GuideStar , Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving site. Perhaps the most effective way to evaluate an organization is through your own personal engagement, be it through volunteering or a site visit at the non-profit. \nQ: How much should you give? \nA: Giving is a highly personal and idiosyncratic process. As such, there is no right answer when it comes to gift amounts. Having an annual giving budget and strategy in place is a best practice that can help to determine the amount of your contributions. The needs of the organizations that you are supporting are obviously important to consider as is whether there is a specific purpose of your contribution or whether it is being given as general operating support. It is also important to bear in mind that monetary gifts are but one way to support an organization. Giving of your time, talents and skills, making introductions or hosting events for the organization are some other ways to provide valuable support. \nQ: What is the best way to give (cash, checks, credit cards, time)? \nA: Giving with cash or check continues to be the most popular means by which to make a charitable contribution. Credit cards, meanwhile, can have the added bonus of incentive programs such as those that give rewards points for charitable donations; however, due to interchange fees, the charity receives slightly less than 100% of what you give. Gifting of IRAs and illiquid assets — real estate, securities, art collections etc. — can often benefit the recipient organization while also achieving wealth structuring goals of the donor. Depending on your giving goals, you could also choose to structure your giving in a giving vehicle, such as a donor-advised fund, charitable trust or private foundation. Regardless of the method you choose, it’s important to understand the benefits and regulatory requirements of each giving method so you can determine what fits best with your style and overarching financial plan. Retirees who help charities are happier, but don't give until it hurts \nGiving as a family provides a powerful opportunity to engage with one another, and can provide an experience often unrivaled by other family activities — be it vacationing together or running a family business. Engaging the next generation in giving helps to pass important values, inform your family culture, promote a deeper understanding of each other and of social issues, foster a sense of caring and responsibility and provide an opportunity to acquire financial acumen. According to a Merrill Lynch giving study last year, creating family giving traditions around the holidays is a highly effective way to teach generosity to the next generation. \nQ: What kind of records should you keep? \nA: According to the U.S. Trust study, wealthy donors gave to eight different non-profit organizations last year on average. Keeping your charitable giving records organized will make life easier during tax season. You should be carefully tracking each gift you make throughout the year, and obtain and file a receipt or written acknowledgement of your gift from the organization. Depending on the frequency of your gifts, it can be helpful to transfer records to an online financial planning program to stay organized and get a big-picture view of all of your gifts and tax deductions you may be eligible for. If you have structured your giving in a giving vehicle such as a donor-advised fund, the fund sponsor typically provides regular reporting reflecting your giving activity. If you give through a family foundation, you are required to file an annual tax return which requires that you retain underlying documentation. \nOn a more substantive level, it is important to monitor and evaluate the impact of your giving. If there were milestones built into your grant agreement, those should be retained and reviewed at appropriate junctures along the grant period. Communication from the non-profit organization about impact achieved as well as information from public sources addressing progress can also be helpful in assessing whether your giving is having its intended effect. This type of analysis enables you to learn from your giving and inform future giving decisions. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

And in part thanks to this shift, we've seen people increasingly leverage platforms like Facebook as a central place for health-conversation. — Sachin Nanavati, Facebook Health LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM, November 28, 2016 / EINPresswire.com / -- Sachin Nanavati, Manager of Global Marketing Solutions at social media giant Facebook, joins the expert speaker line-up for the 9th Social Media in the Pharmaceutical Industry which takes place on the 18th and 19th of January 2017 in London. With a focus on leveraging the Facebook platform to achieve personalised marketing at scale, Sachin’s keynote presentation will explore the advantages of using Facebook as a central place for evidence-based healthcare discussions through full-funnel marketing so as to reach and engage the right patients with the right message at the right time. He will also discuss creative best practices for branded and unbranded campaigns. In a recent interview with SMi Group, Sachin talked about how shifts in consumer behaviour have brought forth an avenue for patients and HCPs to engage more on Facebook. “One key shift is how rapidly people have moved to mobile. And in part thanks to this shift, we've seen people increasingly leverage platforms like Facebook as a central place for health-conversation. In fact, there are 6 million health related-groups on Facebook with over 70 million members. This level of health engagement presents a massive opportunity for healthcare brands to contextualize the right message to the right patient at the right time on Facebook - particularly on mobile. It's a content discovery platform where nearly 1.8 billion people come to engage with the people and brands that matter most to them in their lives. It's really exciting to think about this from a patient perspective and the possibility that a more open and connected world has to improve health outcomes. Facebook is a safe and powerful way for marketers to engage patients at scale with contextualized evidence-based messages to help them make the best decisions for their health. It’s also powerful channel for vibrant patient communities where people can safely connect, share and meet other people like them. Patient communities like ActuallySheCan and SaveYourBreath are great examples of brands building meaningful platforms on Facebook that go beyond the pill.” The full interview with Sachin is available to view at the Download Centre on www.social-media-pharma.com/EIN . Sachin joins an line-up of expert healthcare practitioners and marketers who will discuss and debate the latest trends in e-healthcare, technologies, and top tricks of the trade to maximise digital strategy. Other speakers include CREATION, Lundbeck, MHRA, Merck, Pfizer, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, AbbVie, Leo Pharma, and more For more updates on the conference, follow SMi Group on @smipharm and join the conversation using #pharmasocialmedia on Twitter. 9th Social Media in the Pharmaceutical Industry 18 & 19 January 2017",

      "title": "11 Twisted Facts About ‘The Far Side’",
      "text": "Amazon Like us on Facebook \nFor 15 years, \"The Far Side\" added a dash of irreverence to the funny pages. Offbeat, macabre, and sometimes controversial, Gary Larson’s trailblazing cartoon was a gigantic success that ran in nearly 2000 newspapers at the height of its popularity. It also gave an entire generation of humorists a renewed appreciation for cow jokes. \nHere are 11 things you should know about this highly-evolved comic strip. 1. IT EVOLVED FROM AN EARLIER STRIP CALLED NATURE’S WAY . \nA native of Tacoma, Washington, Gary Larson was born on August 14, 1950. At a very young age, he developed the passion for wildlife that would give \"The Far Side\" its unique flavor. In his early years, Larson spent countless hours chasing amphibians and nurturing pet snakes . So when he enrolled at Washington State University, his decision to major in biology surprised no one. But halfway through college, Larson’s focus shifted. “I didn’t want to go to school for more than four years, and I didn’t know what you did with a bachelor’s degree in biology, so I switched over and got my degree in communications,” he told The New York Times . “It was one of the most idiotic things I ever did.” Had he pursued a scientific career, Larson says that he’d want to become an entomologist. \nAfter graduating, he landed a job at a record store. Dissatisfied with the gig, Larson began to draw bizarre, single-panel cartoons in his spare time. One day in 1976, he presented six of these to the editor of the popular Seattle magazine Pacific Search . The half-dozen comics were swiftly bought up (for $3 apiece) and published under the title \"Nature’s Way.\" Following his print debut, Larson took a three-year hiatus from cartooning. Then, in 1979, The Seattle Times agreed to revive \"Nature’s Way\" as a weekly comic strip . Riding high on newfound success, Larson decided to see if any other publications might be interested in his work. The quest began—and ended—with a visit to the San Francisco Chronicle ’s headquarters. Editor Stan Arnold took an immediate liking to Larson’s comic strip and successfully got it syndicated nationwide. \nEarly on in the process, Larson was asked if he’d mind changing the title from \"Nature’s Way\" to \"The Far Side.\" Mildly put, this wasn’t a problem; Larson once joked that for all he cared, “They could have called it ‘Revenge of the Zucchini People.’” \"The Far Side\" that we all know and love made its grand debut in newspapers across America in January, 1980. 2. FROM THE GET-GO, GARY LARSON DIDN’T WANT \"THE FAR SIDE\" TO INCLUDE RECURRING CHARACTERS. \nChronicle Features syndicated \"The Far Side\" and asked Larson to embrace at least one aspect of the standard comic strip formula before it was distributed nationally. “They… wanted me to develop characters like Charlie Brown or something [who] would always come back,” the cartoonist said in a 1998 NPR interview . At the time, he explains, it was widely believed that every strip needed a cast in order to be successful. Larson felt otherwise . \n“I instinctively thought of that as very limiting,” Larson explained. “And I also just didn’t see humor as something that had to be confined to one particular character. To me, what was exciting was trying to do something that would crack someone up. And I didn’t see how characters or a particular character enhanced that. In fact, I think it would work against it in some cases. A certain face on a character would work in one instance but not in another. Although admittedly, as the years went by, all my stuff got boiled down to about six faces.” 3. AN ODD CHILDREN’S BOOK WAS ONE OF LARSON’S BIGGEST INSPIRATIONS. \nYou need a fairly warped imagination to come up with things like teenage dragons lighting their sneezes. \"The Far Side\" brand of comedy took some of its cues from Larson’s family and what he has described as their “morbid sense of humor.” Older brother Dan Larson left a particularly big impact on his developing mind: When the two weren’t out collecting tadpoles or salamanders together, Dan would pull all sorts of pranks on his younger sibling. “[He’d] scare the hell out of me,” the cartoonist said. \nAnother influence was the picture book Mr. Bear Squash-You-All-Flat by Morrell Gipson. True to its title, the story is about a large bear who goes around sitting on other animals' houses. In 1986, the TV program 20/20 ran a feature on Larson. Halfway through the interview, he was visibly delighted when Lynn Sherr surprised him with a copy of the then-out-of-print book. “There was something so mesmerizing about the image of this big bear going through the forest and squashing the homes of these little animals,” Larson said. “I just thought that was the coolest thing in the world.” 4. ONE EARLY STRIP CONFUSED SO MANY READERS THAT LARSON HAD TO EXPLAIN ITS MEANING IN A PRESS RELEASE. \nWith \"The Far Side,\" Larson turned bovine jokes into a real cash cow. From gags about vacationing cattle to the exploits of a bloodthirsty vampcow, the strip was loaded with heifer hilarity. “I’ve always thought the word cow was funny,” Larson said . “And cows are sort of tragic figures. Cows blur the line between tragedy and humor.” \nEvery so often, though, this affinity for the hoofed mammals got him into trouble. In 1982, Larson drew a cartoon that was supposed to satirize the outdated anthropological belief that, of all creatures, only Homo sapiens makes tools . The strip in question shows a cow presenting an assortment of low-tech gadgets she’s built. Larson’s caption reads, simply, “Cow Tools.” Some people didn’t get the joke. In fact, hardly anyone did. Chronicle Features was bombarded with letters and phone calls from confused readers begging for an explanation. Within 24 hours of the strip's publication, Larson was asked to write a press release explaining its significance to the masses. \nThat October, his official statement appeared in newspapers throughout the U.S. “The cartoon was meant to be an exercise in silliness,” it claims. Larson goes on to say “I regret that my fondness for cows, combined with an overactive imagination, may have carried me beyond what is comprehensible to the average ‘Far Side’ reader.” Embarrassing as this incident was, Larson got the last laugh. On more than one occasion, he’s credited the \"Cow Tools\" debacle with boosting the popularity of \"The Far Side.\" 5. \"THE FAR SIDE\" GAVE BIRTH TO A WIDELY-USED PALEONTOLOGY TERM. \nStegosaurus is world-famous for its lime-sized brain and the quartet of nasty-looking spikes on its tail. A 1982 \"Far Side\" strip decided to have a little fun with the latter attribute. In that cartoon, we find an early human anachronistically lecturing his fellow cavemen about dinosaur-related hazards. Pointing at the rear end of a Stegosaurus diagram, he says “Now this end is called the thagomizer … after the late Thag Simmons.” Without meaning to, Larson’s strip plugged a gap in the scientific lexicon. Previously, nobody had ever given a name to the unique arrangement of tail spikes found on Stegosaurus and its relatives. But today, many paleontologists use the word “ thagomizer ” when describing this apparatus, even in scientific journals. 6. FANS OF THE STRIP HAVE NAMED THREE DIFFERENT INSECTS AFTER GARY LARSON. \nIn 1989, entomologist Dale Clayton discovered a brand new species of biting louse that exclusively targets owls. When the time came to name it, his first choice was Strigiphilus garylarsoni . Clayton wrote the cartoonist to ask for his blessing . This proposed insect name, he explained, was the scientist’s way of recognizing the “enormous contribution that my colleagues and I feel you have made to biology through your cartoons.” Larson happily gave Clayton the green light . “I considered this an extreme honor,” the \"Far Side\" creator said in retrospect. “Besides, I knew that nobody was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me.” \nIndeed, scientific nomenclature has yet to give us a “Larson’s swan.” However, in addition to Strigiphilus garylarsoni , there’s now a beetle called Garylarsonus and a butterfly known as Serratoterga larsoni . 7. ONE COMIC TOOK SOME HEAT FROM THE JANE GOODALL INSTITUTE. \n“Well, well—another blonde hair … Conducting a little more ‘research’ with that Jane Goodall tramp?” A sassy chimpanzee makes this remark while grooming her mate in a 1987 \"Far Side\" comic. The one-liner started a controversy that erupted and then vanished in record time. Shortly after the cartoon ran, Larson’s syndicate received an angry letter from the Jane Goodall Institute’s executive director. Its author minced no words. “To refer to Dr. Goodall as a tramp is inexcusable—even by a self-described ‘loony’ such as Larson,” read the dispatch . \n“I was horrified,” Larson wrote in The Prehistory of The Far Side: A 10 th Anniversary Collection . “Not so much from a fear of being sued … but because of my deep respect for Jane Goodall and her well-known contributions to primatology. The last thing in the world I would have intentionally done was offend Dr. Goodall in any way.” \nBut in a stunning turn of events, it turns out that Goodall herself loved the comic. “I thought it was very funny. And I think if you make a Gary Larson cartoon, boy you’ve made it,” she said . The chimpanzee expert claimed that she was away in Africa when the director lashed out at Larson’s syndicate without her knowledge. Later, the “offending” cartoon appeared on special T-shirts that generated cash for the Institute. Also, Larson got the chance to visit one of Goodall’s research facilities in 1988. Here, he met a chimp named Frodo—who apparently wasn’t a \"Far Side\" fan. Without warning, Frodo pounced on an unsuspecting Larson, leaving the artist with a patchwork of scrapes and bruises. 8. AN OHIO NEWSPAPER SWITCHED THE CAPTIONS FROM \"DENNIS THE MENACE\" AND \"THE FAR SIDE\"—TWICE. \nThe Dayton Daily News committed an unforgettable funny page blunder in August, 1981. Back then, the paper would run \"The Far Side\" right next to the more traditional \"Dennis the Menace.\" On that fateful August day, their captions were switched. \"The Far Side\" strip now showed a young snake who kvetches at the family dinner table by saying “Lucky I learned to make peanut butter sandwiches or we woulda starved to death by now.” Elsewhere, Dennis Mitchell—who’s munching on a sandwich of his own—groans “Oh brother … Not hamsters again!” \n“What’s most embarrassing about this is how immensely improved both cartoons turned out to be,” Larson opined in The Prehistory of The Far Side . Somebody at the Dayton Daily News made the same mistake two years later. This time, readers were confronted with a psychic cavewoman asking “If I get as big as Dad, won’t my skin be too TIGHT?” Dennis Mitchell, meanwhile, casually looked his mother in the eye and said “I see your little, petrified skull … labeled and resting on a shelf somewhere.” 9. TWO ANIMATED \"FAR SIDE\" SHORTS EXIST. \nCBS aired a 20-minute program called Gary Larson’s Tales From the Far Side in 1994. Conceived as a Halloween special, the film was essentially an animated reinterpretation of several classic \"Far Side\" cartoons. Marv Newland—an animator whose best-known work is the Larson-esque short film Bambi Meets Godzilla (1969)—directed Tales , which won a Grand Prix award at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival. The year 1997 brought with it a sequel, Gary Larson’s Tales From the Far Side II . By then, the comic strip which inspired both movies had been laid to rest, as Larson retired in 1995. He has said that the two animated projects presented an interesting challenge because he “didn’t want any dialogue” in the finished products. 10. A \"FAR SIDE\" MUSEUM EXHIBIT OPENED UP IN 1985. \nNatural History Magazine once called Gary Larson “the unofficial cartoonist laureate of the scientific community.” For physicists, biologists, and naturalists around the world, his work is the subject of near-universal admiration. By the mid-1980s, numerous hallways in the San Francisco-based California Academy of Sciences had basically been wallpapered with \"Far Side\" cartoons. Inspired by this décor, the facility got the bright idea to set up a special exhibit in Larson’s honor. Dubbed \" The Far Side of Science ,\" it featured some 600 individual cartoons. The display first opened at the CAS in December, 1985 then traveled through such cities as Los Angeles, Denver, and Orlando—often breaking attendance records along the way. 11. LARSON HAS LIKENED HIS OTHER BIG PASSION—MUSIC—TO CARTOONING. \nA lifelong jazz fan , Larson would frequently listen to the work of genre maestros when he needed to generate ideas for \"Far Side\" comics. He ranks legendary guitarist Herb Ellis among his favorite musicians. In 1989, Ellis asked Larson if he’d design the cover of his next album, which was to be named “Doggin’ Around.” The humorist took the job—in exchange for a guitar lesson. Nowadays, with \"The Far Side\" (mostly) in his rear view mirror, Larson dedicates a portion of each day to honing his skills as a jazz guitarist. \nThis new pursuit, he says, isn’t all that different from drawing comics. “It has some parallels to cartooning because it’s improvisational—you never know exactly how something is going to turn out,” Larson told the Associated Press. “Taking a solo on a tune is always a little bit scary. Yet it has structure, there are certain rules to follow, and you try to create something with those rules.” More from mental_floss...",

Join the Conversation Good Life: Positive achievements for Nov. 29 Poughkeepsie 12:49 p.m. EST November 28, 2016 This year’s winning photograph of a scene in Mountainville in the Town of Cornwall was submitted by Casey O’Mara of Cornwall-on-Hudson. (Photo: Photo by Casey O’Mara)   \nOrange County resident wins photo contest \nThe winner of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp.’s fourth annual Fall Foliage Photo Contest and $250 prize is Casey O’Mara of Cornwall-on-Hudson, who submitted her photograph taken in Mountainville, in the Town of Cornwall. Of the 25 finalists, O’Mara’s photograph received the most votes by Central Hudson’s Facebook followers with 936 votes. A total of 7,763 votes were cast. \n“Congratulations to Casey on her award and for the beautiful scene she photographed depicting the Mid-Hudson Valley’s signature autumn colors,” said Denise D. VanBuren, vice president of public relations at Central Hudson. \nThe contest opened on Sept. 29, inviting Central Hudson customers to submit photographs of the region’s fall season taken within the company’s service area by Nov. 2. More than 105 images were submitted, and 25 finalists were selected and posted to the company’s Facebook page. Voters were asked to “like” their favorite of the finalists, and official voting ended Nov. 21. \n“Thank you to all who participated by voting and submitting photos highlighting the Mid-Hudson Valley’s autumn scenery,” said VanBuren. “We were once again impressed with the stunning selection of entries, and offer our sincere appreciation to each contestant for sharing their amazing photographs.” \nTo view the images of all 25 finalists, go to the company’s Facebook page at www.Facebook.com/CentralHudson \nFunds to benefit Italian earthquake victims \nIn August, an earthquake struck Amatrice and several other small villages in the Lazio region of Italy. In an effort to help the people of these mountain hamlets, members of the Italian Center, Poughkeepsie, and community raised funds for the victims. \nIn early September, Ernie Bruno, president of the Italian Center, asked County Executive Marcus Molinaro to lead the effort as the fund’s honorary chairman. The community heard the appeal and began sending contributions to both the Italian Center or directly to Catholic Relief Services (CRS). \nMembers of Arlington High School’s National Honor Societies also responded to the appeal. including Nicole Crispino, group president, who stated that, “After hearing about the tragic disaster in Italy, I was moved to coordinate an effort by our organization to assist in the relief effort for the Italian victims, said Nicole Crispino, group president. “In October, our organization conducted a three-day bake sale which, along with a private donation, raised $250 for the Italian Relief Effort. Please know that the Italian earthquake victims are in our thoughts and prayers.,” Crispino said. \nThe check for $250 from school’s Italian National Honor Societies, along with an additional check of $1,000, was sent by the Italian Center to Catholic Relief Services. For those who would like more information about how to contribute to help the people of the Lazio Region of Italy, please click onto the Italian Center’s website, www.theitaliancenter.com and click onto CRS. \nDo you have good news to share?

      "text": "\nWhat can a powerful, all-seeing algorithm predict about you, based on your online footprint, publicly available information and Facebook Likes? \nI, whom you can henceforth refer to as Human #1067494, have found out. \nTo do so, I’ve engaged with an online environment called Predictive World : an interface to process users’ data that was recently released by videogame publisher Ubisoft. \nTo partake, you either have to agree to let the program access your Facebook profile (for the most accurate profiling) or to hand over basic information on your own. \nThe game-maker developed Predictive World in collaboration with the Psychometrics Centre of the University of Cambridge. \nBased on their research, the thinking goes, it can generate accurate predictions of who we are, how many pints we put away every week, how much we weigh, how tall we are, how much we smoke, and when we’re going to die, among many other variables. \nThe game-maker has delved into the dangers of big data and predictive algorithms as one of the themes of its action-adventure game Watch Dogs 2 : a game in which hero Marcus Holloway is wrongly profiled as a main suspect for a crime he didn’t commit by a city-wide operating system that collects and analyzes data on all citizens. \nUbisoft assures us that this is where fiction meets reality. Predictive World is all about demonstrating how seemingly trivial data about us can be pulled together and processed into profiles and patterns: \nEach day, we leave a trail of more than 5 billion gigabytes of data behind us. This information comes from billions of collection points: from online transactions of course, to GPS signals, social media likes, texts we exchange, or even parking tickets, soda dispensers, etc. \nThey are then sold, bought, and analysed through different touch points in order to create strong and accurate probabilities on who we are or what we’re most likely to do. \nAs we often write about on Naked Security, Big Data covers many categories. \nIt’s not necessarily the photos you snap of your cat, for example. \nBut the term most certainly includes a collection of a million different cats , organized by location as precise as street address, that you may have contributed to by making your photo APIs publicly available on sites like Flickr, Twitpic, Instagram or the like. \nYou can take that scenario and replicate it on all the sites where our data is amassed: Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras are another good example of how we can be tracked, given that our plate numbers stay the same while our locations change. \nIn fact, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been building a national license plate reader (LPR) database over several years that it shares with federal and local authorities, with no clarity on whether the network is subject to court oversight. \nThen too, there’s the giant database of Wi-Fi access points from Google’s StreetView cars that it was using to aid and abet its geolocation services. \nPredictive World is far from the first online tool to crunch our online selves to show us how all those Big Data players come up with profiles. Those profiles can be used, for example, to pass us over for jobs, given that most recruiters nowadays pore over our social network profiles before they decide whether to call us in for an interview. \nOne example of the tools used to demonstrate the data trails we leave behind was a site called “We know what you’re doing”. It aggregated some of our choicer social media content for us, delivered courtesy of Facebook via its Graph API . \nAnother was Please Rob Me. When it launched in 2010, it was using check-in data from the location-based Foursquare social network that was subsequently posted to Twitter. \nWhen the information becomes publicly available on Twitter, it makes it theoretically possible for a robber to know when you’re away from home. \nWell, maybe it was theoretical when they launched the site, but it sure didn’t stay theoretical for long. One set of burglars put the theory to the test by breaking into the home of friends after reading their Facebook updates to find out when they’d be away. \nBut back to Predictive World. After you sign in (I allowed it access to my Facebook profile to see how well it would do when spoon-fed), it collects data such as your gender, age, and pages you’ve liked, and combines them with local demographics to generate a profile of who you are. \nHow did it do? \nWow, the details that can be gleaned about you from Facebook! \nWow, how wrong they can be! \nPredictive World believes that I’m tall, fat, have a 12.8% chance of smoking pot, make about double the minimum wage, have a conscientiousness factor of something like 43%, and will die at the age of 84.9 years. \nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. \nSo let’s reframe the initial question: what can a powerful algorithm that corporations or police may well consider to be all-seeing but is in actuality peering through cracked glasses with severe myopia guess about you based on your online footprint? \nIn my case, it guessed that I’m 4″ taller than I am, that I weigh 49 lbs. more than I do, that I make 31% of what I actually earn, that I drink two pints of beer a week (are you kidding?! I’m gluten intolerant!), and that my “risk” of smoking marijuana is 12.8% \nHow much do those, and myriad other inaccuracies, affect predictive analytics? \nA lot, if Predictive World is indicative: my life expectancy shot up from 84.9 years to 95.1 when I corrected those variables. \nWhile it’s easy to see where big data can siphon concrete personal information such as our age or our location from Facebook (if we’ve made such data public and haven’t lied about it), it’s worth asking how it guesses at more subjective things, such as our level of satisfaction with life. \nPredictive World is happy to tell you. You can click on each one of a series of rays that emanates from a throbbing circular graphic to get details on how a particular variable is derived. \nFor instance, people who like the same things as I do on Facebook tend to describe themselves as loving life. It can’t be all about the likes, though: my 94.13% satisfaction level shot up from 63% after I told the tool I wasn’t as poor as it initially assumed. \nIt isn’t, in fact, all about the likes. Predictive World is based on an algorithm developed by the Psychometrics Centre using a wide range of data sources, such as psychological and social media data from more than 6 million research participants, along with a bespoke infrastructure designed for the project that contains 6.3 billion data points. \nThat enables Predictive World to visualize the relationships between gender and salary, location and crime risk, personality and longevity, and much more. \nCollecting and processing users’ digital footprints and combining predictions with open data, the system is able to make 70 data-driven predictions about an individual, from personality traits and intelligence to life expectancy and even financial risk propensity. Sophos Home Learn More \nBut does it really matter if it’s accurate or not? \nWhat’s worth noting is that this kind of information can be, and is being, used to build up detailed profiles of us. Not necessarily accurate, mind you, but highly detailed nonetheless. \nEarlier in the month, for example, before Facebook called off the plan, a UK car insurer was going to use young drivers’ data to analyze their personalities and offer quotes based on their profiles. \nPredictive World posed this question: do I want my insurance company to have this type of information about me? \nNo, I can’t say that I do. \nI don’t know which would be worse: having insurance companies think I’m going to die at 85 so they can offer me long-term care and not go broke; have them find out I’m diabetic (Predictive World doesn’t seem to know that; if it did, it would probably have guessed, based on average life expectancy of diabetics , that I had already kicked the bucket); or having insurers construct a more accurate profile of me so they can drop me like a hot potato when they find out that diabetes thing. \nI don’t know whether I want to sharpen the accuracy of Predictive World’s, or insurance companies’ or banks’, vision of who I am. I’m leaning toward keeping my Facebook profile nice and fuzzy. \nWhat’s your plan? ",

      "text": "Share (Image credit: Honeybrains via Facebook) \nYou probably remember that milk does a body good and grandma told you that carrots help you see in the dark, but Honeybrains restaurant, which opened November 28 in New York City, promises an entire neurologist-designed menu to feed your brain. \nDr. Alon Seifan, who runs the Institute for Progressive Neurology, co-owns the small, casual spot with his brothers, Galit and Tomer. He tells the New York Post the restaurant is, \"the first café dedicated to brain wellness, is in part dedicated to fighting diseases like Alzheimer's.\" \nThe restaurant team, which also includes nutritionist Amy von Sydow Green and executive chef Kevin Chun, boasts menu items like avocado toast, a soy soba bowl, and an entire \"Honeybar\" featuring local and imported honey. (Image credit: Honeybrains via Facebook ) \nAlthough there are foods that support brain health through functions like promoting blood flow and stabilizing blood sugar level, Alzheimer's Association's Heather M. Snyder, PhD, warns there is no conclusive research that a particular diet helps lower your risk of Alzheimer's. \nIf, however, you're interested in delicious food that's on trend, nutritious, and Instagram-ready, it doesn't take a brainiac to figure out Honeybrains could be up your alley. → Learn more about HoneyBrains Café in New York",

      "title": "Facebook brings games to Messenger",
      "text": "By James Walker 2 hours ago in Technology Facebook has announced you can now play games from within Messenger. The app includes a selection of social \"instant games\" that will augment conversations with fun and competition. Games can be played with friends you're already connected to. Facebook said the feature will help people to \"connect, banter and share\" using Messenger. Games are accessed by tapping the new game controller icon beneath the message bar. Selecting a game will immediately start it, hence the term \"instant games.\" Games can be played alone using Facebook's News Feed. The company is expecting most people to play competitively in Messenger though. Once you've finished a round, your score will be displayed in your current conversation. The other people in the chat will be given the chance to compete with you and attempt to gain a higher score. New games can be discovered by searching from within Messenger. At launch, 17 titles are available including favourites like Words with Friends: Frenzy , PAC-MAN , Space Invaders , EverWing and Galaga . Facebook is partnering with developers to build additional titles and said that \"many more\" games are on the way. Instant Games on Messenger Facebook All the games are designed to be social and competitive, encouraging you to invite other people to join and participate in your gaming. There's score-based leaderboards and strong integration with group chats that’s designed to get you challenging your friends to games and wasting hours to the simple titles. \"The one billion people who use Messenger every month connect, banter and share in so many ways,\" said Facebook . \"Now they can connect and compete over their favorite games. We think this is just the beginning for games on Messenger — look for new titles to be added, and for new ways to play. Game on!\" The addition of games to Messenger marks Facebook's ongoing efforts to make the app a place you never have to leave. It now supports voice and video calls, integration with third-party services and built-in mobile payments . Facebook is turning Messenger into a single app you can use for all your online activities, centred around socialising and chatting with friends. Instant Games on Messenger Facebook Instant Games are based on modern HTML5-based technologies and can be played on mobile and desktop systems. To help drive traffic to the games, Facebook posts can link directly to individual titles. Tapping a post that contains the \"Instant Play\" call-to-action will immediately launch it without the waiting time and storage consumption of installing a new app. Instant Games can be played in Messenger from today in 30 countries worldwide. They are currently limited to iOS 8 and later and Android 5 and later. Facebook said it will be bringing the games to more regions and platforms in the future, aiming to make gaming more sociable and accessible.",

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 4 Joanna Allhands , The Republic | azcentral.com 1 p.m. MST November 29, 2016 6 Shares \nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) \nForgive me. I (and most of the media) pegged Donald Trump wrong. \nWe thought he would line his cabinet with people who were unfailingly loyal to him. People who would cheer without question for everything he touted on the campaign trail. \nTrump values loyalty, after all. Even people within his own transition team will tell you that. \nBut that's not all he values. \nTake how he's handling his pick for secretary of state. Trump's giving us an insider's view \nIt's unconventional (would you expect anything else from our president-elect?). He has made the inner workings of this appointment much more public than presidents typically do. Usually there is a lot of closed-door wrangling for top seats. \nThe process has aired a lot of dirty laundry about Republicans and Trump's transition team. We know there is dissension among the ranks about how to move forward -- so much so that it has bogged down the process of selecting other cabinet members. \nBut this is an important one to get right, and I think Trump knows it. Our incoming commander-in-chief is lean on foreign-policy knowledge. Yet that's perhaps the area where he has the most power -- and could do the most damage. Witness the global waves Trump made with one tweet about Cuba . \nI think that's why Mitt Romney is reportedly a top contender for the job. (Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker and retired Gen. David Petraeus also are on the list.) x Share After more infighting within Donald Trump's transition team, Mitt Romney has a new challenger for the secretary of state spot. Newslook \nRomney is not a popular choice. Trump adviser Newt Gingrich said \"there's nothing Mitt Romney can say that doesn't sound phony and frankly pathetic ,\" while Kellyanne Conway warned of a “breathtaking” number of voters who would feel “betrayed” if Romney got such a prominent cabinet position. \n“We're all for party unity,” she said, but “I don't think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position.” \nThey don't like that Romney is part of the Republican establishment, the D.C. \"swamp\" that Trump promised to drain. And Romney was one of Trump's greatest critics. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee called Trump \"a phony, a fraud\" and warned that \"he's playing the American public for suckers.\" \nThose are fighting words. Yet, somehow, Trump doesn't seem to be too hurt by them. He sees something in Romney , and I think it's more than just a strategic move to keep the GOP establishment satisfied. Trump may be deeper than we thought \nNow, imagine what it would mean if Romney becomes Trump's pick. He's going to have to work closely with someone who not only isn't a big fan, but who also isn't sold on Trump's ideas. Romney will likely balk much of the president-elect's foreign-policy agenda. \nI dig that. It shows Trump is far more complex than we've pegged him. He's not just bringing in a bunch of yes men to stroke his ego. Maybe he even wants competing ideas and contrarian input. \nOh, I could be wrong. The cabinet doesn't function like it used to , where presidents would strategize for hours behind closed doors with their top secretaries. Mitt Romney could be a secretary of state in name only, while Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their advisers do all the heavy lifting. \nBut there's something powerful about simply considering a critic for a big post. If cabinet appointments are less about who fills them and more about how the president intends to lead, Trump is hitting the right notes.

      "text": "Glass 3 hours ago \nNo, Eduardo Saverin didn’t really storm into the Facebook offices and smash Mark Zuckerberg’s laptop in retaliation for having his company shares diluted—but that does make for great cinema (video). \nThat iconic scene from The Social Network , along with every other scene from over a dozen recent Oscar contenders, was assessed for its historical accuracy in a project by David McCandless, a British data journalist who runs the infographic site Information is Beautiful . \nMcCandless and his team broke down each film scene by scene, evaluating whether the story depicted was accurate (you can see the detailed analysis and historical sources used in this spreadsheet ). Scenes were either deemed true , true-ish (“some tweaks, but true in spirit”), false , false-ish (“pretty false but with reasonable or understandable dramatic license”), or unknown . The project did not include omissions in its study—it only assessed what was presented in the films. \nThey then gave each film a score, based on the percentage of scenes in that film that were either true or true-ish. Here’s what they found: \n(You can filter the data by “pedantry level,” allowing for more questionable scenes to be considered accurate. Selma , for instance,jumps to 100% if you choose the “flexible” filter. The above chart is based on the “absolute truth” filter, the least lenient tier.) \nMcCandless’s analysis of Selma suggests that the film about the US civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. is quite accurate. Some historians disagree , particularly on the film’s portrayal of former US president Lyndon B. Johnson. \nThe Imitation Game , however, was found to be wildly inaccurate , a conclusion that most who have studied the film’s subject, British computer scientist, mathematician, and codebreaker Alan Turing, would agree with. \nThe interactive allows you to look at each scene individually, along with an assessment of whether it’s accurate. Here’s an infamous scene from The Wolf of Wall Street deemed false: (Information is Beautiful) \nAnd here’s one deemed true: (Information is Beautiful) \nHistorically accuracy is, of course, only one element of a history-based film, and not the sole criterion one should use to determine its merits. There’s a long history of classic films being incredibly inaccurate , including Amadeus , Braveheart , and JFK . Some films are meant to closely hew to the history, while others want only to present it loosely. \nStill, the topic is becoming increasingly relevant as Hollywood produces more and more films ripped from very recent headlines . These films are released before we’ve had a chance to fully process the events that they depict. The result is the films themselves help shape how later generations understand the history.

(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFor many people, the interior of their medicine cabinet looks like a hodgepodge of containers, tubes, ointments, sprays, and drops. It is a real challenge to decipher one from the other, to keep specific instructions for each, to know when and how to administer, and to know when one or more of them have outlived their days. Yet, this knowledge is vitally important in effectively managing your health care. \nAccording to Lisa Oronzio, R.Ph., director of pharmacy services at NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, “Medications that are not used according to physician instructions can pose potential dangers. It is important to use them as instructed and only for the time frame indicated by the doctor.” \nShe offers the following tips to handle medications the right way: Stay current: Keep an updated list of medications, dosage, and frequency to present to your doctor or healthcare professional at each visit. The list should include all over-the counter medications and any vitamin and food supplements you are taking. Be consistent: Try to obtain medications from the same pharmacy whenever possible in order to screen for potential drug interactions and duplications. If it is not feasible to use the same pharmacy, a list of current medications and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and food supplements should be given to the pharmacist so he or she can determine if there are adverse interactions that may arise by adding the new medication. Keep medications at the proper temperature: Check the label to make sure medications are stored properly; for example, some require refrigeration. Do not leave medications in a car, where temperatures can be too high or too low, for long periods of time. Ideally, they should be stored at room temperature, from 68-77 degrees, but in some cases, the pharmacist will advise storing in the refrigerator after opening. Avoid storing in humid places: Heat, light, and moisture can affect the active ingredients in your medication, so avoid storing drugs in places where they are exposed to extreme temperatures, light, or moisture. These include places like the bathroom, above the stove or on a windowsill. Don’t share medications with others: Medications are prescribed for specific individuals and conditions. The dosing and selection of medications is based on the weight and age of a patient, the presence of allergies and existing diseases, and potential interactions with other medications that are being taken. All of these factors vary from one patient to the next. Therefore, even if two individuals have the same disease, the best treatment for each may not be the same. Keep out of reach of children and pets: Consider places where kids are likely to get their hands on medicines — such as in purses and on nightstands. Place purses and bags in high locations, and avoid leaving medicine on a nightstand or dresser. Check expiration dates: Expired drugs may lose effectiveness and should not be taken after the expiration date. The ingredients may decompose or evaporate making the medication less effective, and some medications may become toxic after they expire. Dispose of old medications correctly: There are a number of options to do so safely and securely. National Prescription Drug Take Back Days held by local law enforcement agencies offer disposal services, and there are even communities that have permanent take-back locations that provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of drug disposal. \n“Most importantly,” says Oronzio, “keeping up to date with your medications, taking them as directed, and knowing how to properly handle them can go a long way towards keeping you healthy.” \nTo find a physician, visit nyp.org/lawrence or call 914-787-5000. \nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital .

      "text": "Share Save \nFacebook is one of the strongest tools to any politician or big business, for many reasons. The social networking giant has turned into the place where billions of users get their news at. And as a result, there are serious issues at hand. First off, Facebook is plagued with fake news stories by sleazy digital marketers who want to make a quick buck or troll the internet. The majority of shares in these false stories are generated utilizing purchased social media signals from black hat stores. Consequently, Facebook users will look at the massive popularity and share it with friends, thinking it's going viral. But Facebook is only part of the problem. These hoaxing culprits have managed to infiltrate other social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, and even YouTube. According to Mental Daily , Twitter bots, created as part of a botnet, are being blamed for manipulating the US election with both Democrats and Republicans involved. Essentially, approximately one-fifth of the entire election conversation on Twitter was generated by a bot, said Emilio Ferrara, a computer scientist, and researcher. Ferrera, along with his team of researchers, analyzed over 20 million Twitter tweets as part of a mission to figure out how many were generated by bots. The tweets, created between September and October 2016, originated from both political parties. Researchers found that bots generated as much as 3.8 million tweets — that's about 19 percent of the entire social media conversation, based on research data reported by the Daily Dot . Now, shifting back to Facebook, the Washington Post has received shade from the mainstream media after calling out fake news. Aside from Wash Post, other news outlets such as Rolling Stone, TIME, and USA Today have reported on fake news stories, influenced by hoaxers and social media \nHowever, according to a USA Today report , fake election news outperformed real news, which reportedly attacked Hillary Clinton during the heat of the email scandal. Bottom line: There is still much to learn about these fake news stories, however, what we do you know is that social media played an essential role in the development of these fake stories. And maybe, perhaps, helped Donald Trump secure his place in the white house. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "share Russian app Prisma launched the ability to apply impressive filters to live Facebook video earlier this month. On the same day, Facebook revealed its own plans to bring filters to its Live Video feature “soon.” Facebook is now blocking Prisma’s Live Video access through the company’s APIs, and blaming the fact that Prisma is essentially duplicating functionality. TechCrunch reports that Facebook told Prisma: “Your app streams video from a mobile device camera, which can already be done through the Facebook app. The Live Video API is meant to let people publish live video content from other sources such as professional cameras, multi-camera setups, games or screencasts.” Facebook’s FAQ for its Live API does not explicitly state smartphone cameras are banned, and it even states “it allows you to send live content directly to Facebook from any camera.” Facebook also encourages developers to use special effects like on-screen graphics, similar to the type of filters that Prism uses. An example of Prisma filters Facebook’s explanation for the ban doesn’t really hold up to its own FAQ, even if the company is trying to market the Live API to cameras outside of regular smartphones. The timing, alongside Facebook’s own video filters, makes it appear that the company is simply trying to block competition by claiming a rival is duplicating its own functionality. It’s a tactic that Apple deployed many times during the early days of the App Store, preventing third-party browsers and email clients before the company grew a strong ecosystem and finally relented. Facebook has been aggressively targeting competition in the social video sharing space recently. The social network has lifted many features from Snapchat and implemented them into Instagram and even WhatsApp . Live video filters are just the latest battleground for companies to convince users to stick to their app, and not the cool new competition. More From The Verge ",

      "text": "iStock Like us on Facebook \nIt pays to be a smart shopper—especially during the holiday season. So as you head to the bookstore this year with your list of beloved gift recipients, we want to arm you with some seriously bright ideas. These 50 books will cover everyone on your list, and maybe even inspire some much-deserved self-gifting. And if you need even more fabulous texts, be sure to check our guide from last year , because great books are never out of date. 1. FOR THE BUDDING GENIUS: WOMEN IN SCIENCE: 50 FEARLESS PIONEERS WHO CHANGED THE WORLD BY RACHEL IGNOTOFSKY \nFemale pioneers often go underrepresented in the history books—especially in the fields of science and mathematics—but this tome aims to tip the scales. Ignotofsky’s picture book features 50 inspiring, beautifully illustrated mini-biographies of trailblazers, inventors, and heroes. (Consider keeping the girl power going by picking up Bonnie Burton's Crafting with Feminism , which features 25 awesome projects ranging from finger puppets of kick ass women to \"em-broad-ery hoop art.\") \nBuy at Amazon . 2. FOR YOUR ROOMMATE, THE GERMAPHOBIC POET: ON IMMUNITY: AN INOCULATION BY EULA BISS \nLyrical prose meets juicy research and personal narrative in poet Eula Biss’s meditation on contamination and purity. The book rightly blurs the line between medical and cultural history, tapping into fears both ancient (vampirism and the stain of sin) and current (toxins in baby products, contaminated vaccines). Biss arrives at no tidy conclusions, preferring instead to dwell vulnerably in the uncertainty of motherhood and modern life. 3. FOR THE CURRENT EVENTS JUNKIE: BREAKING CAT NEWS: CATS REPORTING ON THE NEWS THAT MATTERS TO CATS BY GEORGIA DUNN \nBreaking Cat News began as a joke among friends, as cartoonist Georgia Dunn imagined her three cats reporting on mundane events in their little world. The joke took off, and today this “ surreal and sweet ” comic ( Publishers Weekly ) has joined Garfield in the comics section of newspapers across the country. The book is a terrific introduction to the boys in the newsroom and makes a great gift for fans of comics, cats, and hard-hitting journalism. (Cat owners will especially identify with BCN’s investigation on the bathroom titled “ The Woman Is In a Room We Can’t Get Into .”) 4. FOR THE HARRY POTTER-OBSESSED MUGGLE: HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE: THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION BY J.K. ROWLING AND JIM KAY \nIf you've been thinking it's time to reread the Harry Potter series, there's no better way to start than with the vivid illustrations of Jim Kay. The British artist reimagines the expansive world with a new full-colored edition of the first book in the series. The entire illustrated series will eventually be published, but so far you can only purchase the first two. Kay has gone on record as a huge fan of the series, so you know the beloved characters are in good hands. 5. FOR THAT FRIEND WHO CAN APPRECIATE A DARN FINE CUP OF COFFEE: THE SECRET HISTORY OF TWIN PEAKS : A NOVEL BY MARK FROST \nThe new Twin Peaks season isn’t coming out until 2017, but you can bide the time with a new novel from co-creator Mark Frost. Presented like a history book, the novel details the events of the town, starting with Lewis and Clark’s journals and ending with the events in the show’s finale. The intention of the book is to expand on the mythology of the show without giving away any spoilers of the new season. \nBuy at Amazon . 6. FOR THE ADVENTUROUS HOMECOOK: ALTON BROWN: EVERYDAYCOOK BY ALTON BROWN \nFor nearly two decades, Alton Brown has turned his fans on to the science of good eats though his informative books and TV shows. His latest cookbook, titled EveryDayCook , takes a more personal look at the culinary habits of the uber-nerdy celebrity chef. As Brown puts it, the recipes in this book reflect what he cooks “to feed myself and people in my immediate vicinity.” If lacquered bacon and “Chocapocalypse” cookies are among his standbys, anyone in his immediate vicinity should count themselves lucky. 7. FOR THE FRIEND WHO NEVER GOT RID OF HIS TOY DINOSAUR COLLECTION: THE TYRANNOSAUR CHRONICLES: THE BIOLOGY OF THE TYRANT DINOSAURS BY DAVID HONE \nTyrannosaurs were the undisputed kings of the dinosaurs when they roamed the Earth 65 million years ago. All they left behind were their fossilized bones and some footprints, but as David Hone shows in this exhaustively-researched book, that can tell us a lot about how these creatures once lived. From how they hunted to what they looked like, The Tyrannosaur Chronicles delves into the biology of these tyrant lizards with surprising detail. 8. FOR THE FRIEND WITH AN ANNUAL AQUARIUM MEMBERSHIP: THE SOUL OF AN OCTOPUS: A SURPRISING EXPLORATION INTO THE WONDER OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY SY MONTGOMERY \nAfter reading this book,you’ll never look at a cephalopod the same way again. For The Soul of an Octopus , author and naturalist Sy Montgomery made regular trips to the New England Aquarium where she forged intimate connections with its eight-armed residents. The book uses the intelligent animal as a springboard for asking heavy questions about the nature of consciousness while teaching readers a bit of marine biology at the same time. 9. FOR THE FRIEND WHO HAS SEEN EVERY FREAKIN' SHOW: TV (THE BOOK): TWO EXPERTS PICK THE GREATEST AMERICAN SHOWS OF ALL TIME BY ALAN SEPINWALL AND MATT ZOLLER SEITZ \nThe next time you’re prepared to binge on a classic television series, you should hit the streaming sites armed with Sepinwall and Seitz’s gloriously geeky examination of the greatest American shows to ever air on the small screen. The two critics don’t always agree—their verbatim exchanges about how to rank all-timers like Breaking Bad and The Wire are a highlight—but their passion for the medium is infectious. 10. FOR THE TRUE CRIME FANATIC: MOP MEN: INSIDE THE WORLD OF CRIME SCENE CLEANERS BY ALAN EMMINS \nJournalist Emmins became so intrigued by the morbid duties of crime scene cleaners that he decided to tail one in San Francisco. With Emmins alternating questions with dry heaves, Mop Men is by turns hilarious, disgusting, and poignant, a peek inside an industry that few care to think about and even fewer are prepared to explore. 11. FOR ADVOCATES BRIMMING WITH PATIENCE AND FORTITUDE: PATIENCE AND FORTITUDE: POWER, REAL ESTATE AND THE FIGHT TO SAVE A PUBLIC LIBRARY BY SCOTT SHERMAN \nIn a riveting expose of bureaucracy almost trumping art, Sherman details a misguided 2008 economic plan to dissolve the New York Public Library locations and store their remains—including the famous lions—in New Jersey. It took a team effort of professors and citizen groups to keep the historic collection in one piece. \nBuy at Amazon . 12. FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THAT ANIMALS ARE THE BEST MEDICINE: H IS FOR HAWK BY HELEN MACDONALD \nSome people struggle with grief by throwing themselves into work; Helen Macdonald decided to procure a hawk. The result is a highly original memoir of a falconer who bonds with an ornery bird and finds a way to cope with her father’s death in the process. \nBuy at Amazon . 13. FOR THE '80s KID: ART OF ATARI BY TIM LAPETINO \nVideo games have earned considerable respect since Atari’s heyday, but appreciation for their covert art has lagged behind. That’s likely to change with Lapetino’s coffee table guide to some of the company’s biggest hits, with commentary and rough sketches provided by the artists. 14. FOR THE DANA SCULLY IN YOUR LIFE: THE UNPERSUADABLES: ADVENTURES WITH THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE BY WILL STORR \nJournalist Will Storr embeds with Holocaust deniers, UFO-chasers, young earth creationists, and people who believe in baby-eating cults as he pursues a great mystery: How and why do people believe in the unbelievable? Throughout this thought-provoking romp, Storr stumbles upon the psychological biases that distort our handling of reality and arrives at a stunning conclusion—your world is shaped by a hardwired knack for storytelling. 15. FOR THE AUDIO/HISTORY/CULTURE-PHILE: THE REST IS NOISE: LISTENING TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BY ALEX ROSS \nMost books about classical music only appeal to fans of classical music, preaching—sometimes literally—to the choir. Not this book. Ross, a music critic at The New Yorker , paints a history of 20th century western music without drowning us in the usual deluge of composer hagiographies. Instead, with colorful stories and nimble analysis, he illustrates how musical moods and movements reflected, and occasionally contributed to, the tumult of 20th century society. Readers will come away with a new understanding not just of western music, but of the past century. 16. FOR THOSE IN PURSUIT OF THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED: ATLAS OBSCURA: AN EXPLORER'S GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S HIDDEN WONDERS , EDITED BY JOSHUA FOER, DYLAN THURAS, AND ELLA MORTON \nIf this compendium of the weirdest, wackiest, and most wonderful destinations on the planet doesn't fill you with insatiable wanderlust, then you need to check your pulse. 17. FOR THE WRITER: STYLE: THE BASICS OF CLARITY AND GRACE BY JOSEPH WILLIAMS AND JOSEPH BIZUP \nHey, writers! Joseph Williams' guide for wordsmiths is the only style book you will ever need. (Sorry, Strunk and White. Your finger-wagging Elements of Style is overrated.) Emphasizing principles over prescriptions, Williams will teach you how to write clear, shapely, elegant sentences. And that's not even the most amazing part: It's also fun to read. 18. FOR THE BIBLIOPHILE: YOU COULD LOOK IT UP: THE REFERENCE SHELF FROM ANCIENT BABYLON TO WIKIPEDIA BY JACK LYNCH \nDictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference books are supposed to be dry, dusty, and boring ... right? Not true says Lynch, an English professor at Rutgers University: \"[Reference book] authors are not always sexless cartoon characters but include quirky geniuses, revolutionary firebrands, and impassioned culture warriors, many of them with the unflagging intellectual energy of a whirling dervish.\" This is the story of the people who cataloged and preserved the world's knowledge. What could be more exciting? 19. FOR THE LOVER OF GHOST STORIES: GHOSTLAND: AN AMERICAN HISTORY IN HAUNTED PLACES BY COLIN DICKEY \nAbout half of Americans believe in ghosts, depending on what poll you want to put your faith in. Why are ghost stories perennially popular in a nation that likes to imagine it’s science-forward? \nThe answer, of course, is that ghosts serve a social and emotional purpose for us, which means they’re worth considering in depth. In Ghostland , Dickey takes a historical and anthropological approach to the spooky tales that haunt many of the nation’s famous places, from the plantations of the South to the midcentury hotels of Los Angeles. He shows how such stories often highlight some of the darkest aspects of our history—slavery, conflict with Native Americans—while also intersecting with more modern sources of anxiety, such as the foreclosure crisis. The book might not change whether or not you believe in ghosts—that’s not the point—but it will change how you think about the next spooky tale someone tells you. 20. FOR THE BIOGRAPHY READER: SHIRLEY JACKSON: A RATHER HAUNTED LIFE BY RUTH FRANKLIN \nAuthor Shirley Jackson was controversial in life: Her short story \"The Lottery,\" published in The New Yorker in 1948, prompted widespread outrage, and despite being popular with many fans, her work was often dismissed by critics. But her crystalline portraits of desperate women and small-town horror have stayed fresh, and are now undergoing renewed interest. In a new biography, author and critic Ruth Franklin explores Jackson’s troubled life in New England, where the author nurtured her creative genius and several children amid an often-difficult marriage, trouble with the neighbors, and substance addictions that may have hastened her death. \nBuy at Amazon . 21. FOR YOUR BOJACK HORSEMAN -LOVING SIBLING: HOT DOG TASTE TEST BY LISA HANAWALT \nYou don’t need to love—or even particularly like—hot dogs to appreciate the delightfully odd stream-of-consciousness work that is Lisa Hanawalt’s sophomore graphic novel, Hot Dog Taste Test . The American cuisine staple is merely a springboard for Hanawalt to explore a smorgasbord of colorful musings like, are runny eggs actually bad? Or (from her James Beard Award-winning piece “On the Trail With Wylie”) why isn’t poop called “doof,” since that is food spelled backwards? Hot Dog Taste Test is the rare type of book that has the capacity to inspire “foodies” and casual consumers alike to log the minutiae of day-to-day life in hopes of one day churning out a book that is, at best, half as clever or delicious. \nBuy at Amazon . 22. FOR THE RELATIVE WHO LOVED THE DA VINCI CODE : THE VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT , EDITED BY RAYMOND CLEMENS \nThe Voynich Manuscript is a mysterious medieval text, written in a language no one can read. For years it's baffled the world's best cryptologists , trumped the most powerful code-breaking computers, and been written off as a masterful hoax—cracked and debunked, again and again. This new examination of the artifact includes photographs as well as essays from experts who tackle the bizarre manuscript from a variety of angles. Who knows, maybe you're the one who can put all the puzzle pieces together. 23. FOR THE ENGINEERING STUDENT: RISE OF THE ROCKET GIRLS: THE WOMEN WHO PROPELLED US, FROM MISSILES TO THE MOON TO MARS BY NATHALIA HOLT \nThe so-called \"rocket girls\" were the women of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the '40s and '50s—the decades leading up to the Apollo missions and, of course, man walking on the moon. Their story has been largely absent from the history of space travel, but Holt puts a spotlight on these mathematicians (they were also called \"human computers\") and the invaluable work they did to revolutionize rocket design, develop satellites, and propel humankind to the final frontier. 24. FOR THE STARGAZER: COMING OF AGE IN THE MILKY WAY BY TIMOTHY FERRIS \nFerris's history of cosmology and astronomy is a compellingly written, accessible tour of many of the main people behind humanity's biggest insights into the nature of the universe. It's a classic of popular science writing from one of the world's most accomplished science journalists. \nBuy at Amazon . 25. FOR THE MEDICAL STUDENT (WHO ACTUALLY HAS TIME TO READ WHILE ON HOLIDAY BREAK): THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS BY REBECCA SKLOOT \nIn 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a poor African-American tobacco farmer and mother of five, died of cervical cancer. She died without knowing that the doctors who had treated her for the disease had also removed cervical cells from her body to study and manipulate. These cells, known as HeLa, lived on, and became vital to the development of polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and much more. In this award-winning book, Skloot explores the impact of Lacks' \"immortal\" cells on both medicine and her family in engrossing—and often painful—detail. \nBuy at Amazon . 26. FOR LITERALLY ANYONE WITH A HEART: SLOTHLOVE BY SAM TRULL \nA coffee table book packed with ridiculously adorable pictures of—and fascinating facts about—sloths, this volume offers up both the heart and science of wildlife conservationist Sam Trull , who rescues, rehabs, and releases wild orphan sloths in Costa Rica, all while enlarging the scientific knowledge of these largely mysterious (and did we mention ridiculously adorable?) animals. It'll delight your brain—and make your day. 27. FOR THE CURIOUS FOODIE: THE OXFORD COMPANION TO AMERICAN FOOD AND DRINK , EDITED BY ANDREW F. SMITH \nIf you’re more interested in the why, when, and who of cooking and food than the “how” that cookbooks give you, crack open this reliably fascinating reference that covers all the people, places, and trends that lead us to eat the things we eat. With thousands of concise entries spread across hundreds of pages, the volume gives you the opportunity to fall into a delicious rabbit hole of culinary knowledge. On one page, you’ll learn about how Russian immigrant Samuel Born invented a way to automate putting sticks in lollipops before founding the Peeps giant Just Born. On the next, you’ll learn how Carl Karcher turned a $311 loan into the Carl’s Jr. empire. You’ll only want to put it down when you get so hungry you’ve got to stop for a snack. 28. FOR THE CRAFTER: PEOPLE KNITTING: A CENTURY OF PHOTOGRAPHS BY BARBARA LEVINE \nHere's a book you judge by its cover. This collection of vintage photographs of crafters with their yarn and needles is a charming look at a skill that spans time and demographics. It serves as a history of knitting itself, and how its place in the culture has changed over the decades. It's sure to inspire your favorite knitter's next big project. 29. FOR YOUR OWN ZIGGY STARDUST: DAVID BOWIE RETROSPECTIVE AND COLORING BOOK BY MEL ELLIOT \nDavid Bowie was one of the few people actually deserving of the designation of \"icon.\" The ever-evolving folklore and imagery surrounding him were as important as the music itself—which makes Bowie a surprisingly apt candidate to be at the center of a coloring book. It's a perfect way to remember the Thin White Duke, from David Jones (his given name) to his turn as Jareth the Goblin King in the 1986 film, Labyrinth . \nBuy at Amazon . 30. FOR YOUR FRIEND WHO'S ALWAYS MORE INTERESTED IN THE PICTURES: THE ART OF BEATRIX POTTER BY EMILY ZACH \nLong before she created her best-known work ( The Tale of Peter Rabbit ), Beatrix Potter was drawing and painting (and studying ) landscapes, plants, and animals in gorgeous detail. Her works, much like the natural history art we often see in museums and reference books, are delicate reflections of the biological world. Amid photographs, notebook pages, and essays, this collection traces Potter's inspirations, and the work that preceded her classic book. \nBuy at Amazon . 31. FOR THE FRIEND WHO CAN SING ALL THE WORDS TO HAMILTON : THE HAMILTON COLLECTION , EDITED BY DAN TUCKER \nThanks to the insanely popular Broadway show based on his life , interest in Alexander Hamilton has never been greater. For those with an insatiable appetite for all things related to the founding father, there's Tucker's collection of writings from the man himself. All manner of ephemera are included—from government correspondence to love letters with Elizabeth Schuyler (who would become his wife), and even Aaron Burr. There's no better way to get a sense of the man behind the legend. And lest we inadvertently cause a duel, let us also recommend Alexander Hamilton's Guide to Life by Jeff Wilser—which includes even more nuggets of wisdom, straight from Ham. (As Wilser notes in the introduction, the dude loved maxims, and used the word 209 times in one collection of his writings.) \nBuy at Amazon . 32. FOR THE FRIEND WHO LIKES TO PSYCHOANALYZE EVERY CONVERSATION: PSYCHOBOOK: GAMES, TESTS, QUESTIONNAIRES, HISTORIES , EDITED BY JULIAN ROTHENSTEIN \nWhether or not you believe that all of your adult anxieties are your mother’s fault, there’s no denying that the history of psychology—both as a science and a cultural obsession—is endlessly fascinating. This gorgeous coffee table book offers a comprehensive peek into the history of psychological testing, by gathering up dozens of photographs, illustrations, and psychological tests that have been used to delve deeper into people’s psyches over the years. (Yes, there’s a whole chapter dedicated to inkblots.) When you consider the cost of an hour’s worth of therapy, the $30 cover price is a steal. 33. FOR THE PARENT WHO CONSTANTLY UPS THEIR GARDENING GAME: EXPLORERS' BOTANICAL NOTEBOOK: IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THEOPHRASTUS, MARCO POLO FLINDERS, DARWIN, SPEKE AND HOOKER BY FLORENCE THINARD \nIf you've ever wanted to peek inside the workbook of a scientist, here's your chance. The Explorers' Botanical Notebook catalogs the work of 80 pioneering botanists, with gorgeous spreads showing their findings, thoughts, notes, stories, and more. These naturalists traveled the world with the intent of finding, collecting, observing, and preserving the world's flora. The collection includes maps, photographs, and sketches, and truly feels like a glimpse inside the quite tactile work of history's botanical explorers. 34. FOR THE FRIEND WHO'S MORE OF AN OBSERVER: OVERVIEW: A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF EARTH BY BENJAMIN GRANT \nIt's amazing what a shift in perspective can do. Grant's compilation of satellite images of everything from cities, to the ocean, to tulip fields in the Netherlands, takes a look at Earth from above, and offers a revealing glimpse at the planet and our impact on it. For a taste of the \"overview effect\" (a term for the feeling astronauts experience when they look down at Earth from space) check out the Instagram account where the project began. \nBuy at Amazon . 35. FOR THE MAP ENTHUSIAST: YOU ARE HERE BY KATHARINE HARMON \nNew York City is among the most mapped places in the history of the world, 200 of which can be found in this collection. Harmon has compiled maps depicting NYC in stunning real and imagined forms. From a Ghostbusters subway map to Brooklyn composed in constellations, with these renderings, even the most knowledgeable New Yorker will walk away seeing the city in a whole new light. (And for even more cartographical awesomeness, check out Harmon's previous book .) \nBuy at Amazon . 36. FOR THE FRIEND WHO'S ALWAYS SENDING YOU INFOGRAPHICS: DEAR DATA BY GIORGIA LUPI AND STEFANIE POSAVEC \nIt's a great time to be a numbers nerd, and this gorgeously sketched book brings data visualizations—something usually reserved for the world wide web—to paper, with a healthy dose of humanity. Dear Data chronicles one year of correspondence between Giorgia Lupi, an Italian living in New York, and Stefanie Posavec, an American in London. The pair swap postcards full of writings and sketches, turning the details of everyday life into data sets. It's a whole new way of looking at the particulars of life that often go unchronicled. 37. FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE NERD: WHO BUILT THAT? BRIDGES: AN INTRODUCTION TO TEN GREAT BRIDGES AND THEIR DESIGNERS BY DIDIER CORNILLE \nThe Who Built That? series spotlights the practical design we often take for granted. Author Didier Cornille previously tackled modern homes and skyscrapers, and he's now turned his eye toward bridges, specifically 10 famous bridges—from the Golden Gate to Sydney Harbour—in appreciation of the engineering, raw materials, and design that brought them to fruition. Simple and engaging drawings elevate the work, paving the road for even those who might've never considered the grandeur of this ubiquitous piece of design. 38. FOR THE AMATEUR LINGUIST: SPEAKING AMERICAN: HOW Y'ALL, YOUSE, AND YOU GUYS TALK BY JOHN KATZ \nIn 2013, The New York Times released an interactive dialect quiz , created by Katz, that you yourself probably took, or at least saw on Facebook. (It reportedly became the most viewed page in the paper's history.) That quiz, highlighting how word choice—about everything from athletic footwear to the sweet stuff we spread on top of a cake—can locate us geographically, is now a book. It's a fun look at language quirks, and what they can tell us about history, language, and who we are. \nBuy at Amazon . 39. FOR THE FRIEND WITH AN INSTAGRAM DEDICATED TO THEIR CAT: THE LION IN THE LIVING ROOM BY ABIGAIL TUCKER \nLove cats? Instead of watching yet another YouTube video of an adorable kitten, check out The Lion in the Living Room (2016)—Smithsonian science correspondent Abigail Tucker’s in-depth look at Felus catus . By tracing the history of feline domestication, Tucker explains why the tiny animals may have chosen to form a relationship with humans. She also takes a look at the ecological harm caused by cats, and tries to figure out why our culture is currently obsessed with all things fuzzy and whiskered. 40. FOR THE CRAFTY WORDSMITH: WHAT THE DICKENS?! DISTINCTLY DICKENSIAN WORDS AND HOW TO USE THEM BY BRYAN KOZLOWSKI \nCharles Dickens’s fiction featured convoluted plots and eccentric characters, but his colorful language is what truly takes center stage. Writer Bryan Kozlowski scoured 15 of the Victorian author’s books and hundreds of his short stories for 200 eccentric turns of phrase, and compiled them all in a handy reference book explaining their definition and historical context. 41. FOR THE RESIDENT MIXOLOGIST: CONTRABAND COCKTAILS: HOW AMERICA DRANK WHEN IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BY PAUL DICKSON \nEven the most skilled booze-slingers might not know about the cocktails that surreptitiously flowed during Prohibition. This look at the cocktail culture of the era fuses history, literature, music, and more, with recipes and plenty of geeky libation lingo to keep every reader entertained. After all, shouldn't a cocktail book be a good party in itself? \nBuy at Amazon . 42. FOR ALL THE LADIES (AND THE GENTS, TOO): ALL THE SINGLE LADIES BY REBECCA TRAISTER \nSociety has lots of names for unmarried women; none of them (with the exception of “cat lady,” of course) are especially flattering. In this fascinating investigation, Traister admits that she set out to write about the state of the Single Woman in America today. But through a deep and comprehensive look into the history and current state of the demographic, Traister finds that single women have always been a force to be reckoned with, and have shaped the course of our nation’s history in profound ways—which only becomes more relevant as the group continues to grow. (For a look at what it was like to be a woman in the Victorian era, pick up Therese Oneill's Unmentionables: The Victorian Lady's Guide to Sex, Marriage, and Manners .) \nBuy at Amazon . 43. FOR FOR THE YOUNG ARCHITECTURE BUFF WHO KNOWS WHAT “USONIAN” MEANS: THIS IS FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT BY IAN VOLNER AND MICHAEL KIRKHAM \nFrank Lloyd Wright is one of history’s most famous architects. He was also a failure. For every success that this pioneer of the open floor plan had (and there were many, many of them), he also suffered many setbacks. This graphic-filled biography follows the ups and downs of the revered architect’s life and work. It's the first in Lawrence King Publishing’s “This Is” series, which takes a graphic novel-esque approach to art history, telling the life story of some of the world’s most creative minds (Andy Warhol, Paul Gauguin, and Jackson Pollock are among the series’ other subjects) in a way that would make Stan Lee jealous. Just with more cantilevers. 44. FOR WANNABE WHITTLERS: GOOD CLEAN FUN: MISADVENTURES IN SAWDUST AT OFFERMAN WOODSHOP BY NICK OFFERMAN \nNick Offerman is best known as the mustachioed actor who played a guy with a passion for fine steaks and woodworking on Parks and Recreation .

FOR THE LONG READS JUNKIE: NOTHING TO ENVY: ORDINARY LIVES IN NORTH KOREA BY BARBARA DEMICK \nTold through the experiences of six residents over the course of 15 years, Nothing to Envy is a snapshot of North Korea during the tumultuous late '90s and aughts.

It's heart-wrenching—and essential—reading. 46. FOR THE ATHLETE: FOX TOSSING, OCTOPUS WRESTLING AND OTHER FORGOTTEN SPORTS BY EDWARD BROOKE-HITCHING \nBeing an expert on sports history isn't just about knowing obscure stats and athletes—it's also about cataloging the lesser-known pastimes. Take \"aerial golf,\" which consisted of a player on the course and a pilot in the skies above, who would tee off by dropping balls from the aircraft. Or \"dwile flonking,\" a 1960s sport-of-sorts in which locals in Norfolk, England gathered to dance to an accordion and hit one another in the face with beer-soaked rags. Hey, we didn't say they all made sense. \nBuy at Amazon . 47. FOR THE RECENT GRADUATE: MY SALINGER YEAR BY JOANNA RAKOFF \nThis spiritual sibling to The Devil Wears Prada takes place in the publishing world, where Rakoff worked after leaving graduate school in the '90s. She gets a job at an agency that represents J.D. Salinger, and is tasked with replying to his many pieces of fan mail. Rather than brushing them off with the standard form-based reply, Rakoff starts to pen more thoughtful responses. The poignant and funny memoir is about the industry, as well as finding your place in the art world and the world at large. 48. FOR YOUR TRIVIA TEAM: 1234 QUITE INTERESTING FACTS TO LEAVE YOU SPEECHLESS BY JOHN LLOYD, JOHN MITCHINSON, AND JAMES HARKIN \nYou wouldn't be reading this list if you weren't hungry for some knowledge—and QI serves it up in bite size morsels that you can devour and dish out to impress even the savviest trivia nerds.

FOR THE FRIEND WHO LOVES ALL CREATURES, GREAT AND SMALL (AND VERY OLD): HORSESHOE CRABS AND VELVET WORMS: THE STORY OF THE ANIMALS AND PLANTS THAT TIME HAS LEFT BEHIND BY RICHARD FORTEY \nLife on earth is fragile, but as Fortey, a British paleontologist, chronicles in Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms, a small group of organisms has stood the test of time. These \"living fossils\" have stayed pretty much the same for millions of years, surviving countless threats along the way. They're impressive biological specimens, and a window into the world as it used to be.",

      "text": "Mercer basketball game broadcasts on Facebook Live Mercer basketball game on Facebook Live Kasandra Ortiz, WMAZ 11:57 PM. EST November 29, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nMACON, GA.-- - Mercer University is leading the way and they are doing it by merging sports with technology. You will now be able to watch the Bears from anywhere with just the click of a button on Facebook Live. \nThere is nothing like being at a basketball game and seeing a buzzer-beater, or hearing the band and listening to the crowd cheer after a basket. \nBut what if you could experience the game from anywhere? Mercer is making it a reality. The university broadcasted their first basketball game on Facebook Live Tuesday against Davidson. The school says it is one of the first Division One college basketball games broadcasted live on Facebook. \n\nThe President of the University, William Underwood, says there's no substitute for being at the game, but he says watching sports online is the wave of the future.\"But if you can't be here, we want the game to be accessible to people and we want it to be engaging. This idea of broadcasting on Facebook is a way to make it broadly accessible and hopefully to engage people in the game experience even though they can't be here,” says President Underwood. \nThe game was streamed on the Mercer Athletic page and shared by the Southern Conference, Atlantic 10, Sports on Facebook, and even the opposing team.\"We're just trying to find multiple venues so that our fans all around the state all around the south and the nation hopefully can tune in and watch the bears,” says Jim Cole, the university’s Athletic Director. We can be sure that even after just one Facebook Live broadcast people in other countries are already tuning in.\"I'm from Canada so I know my parents are watching right now live. It's a good way if you can't make it to the game to watch it live for sure,” says Junior Patrick Dehueck.\"It's awesome, it's a new platform. Not everybody has ESPN 3 or a TV for that matter. But everyone has Facebook it seems like, so it’s good for people to get on Facebook and they can watch the game,” says student Will Deines.\"There's always something about being at a live basketball game so Facebook Live it's almost like you're in the action you're sitting there, you're a fan,” says Junior Matt Quinn. If you are a fan of watching the game online keep tuning in because Mercer may bring the excitement of the next game to a computer near you once again. \nTowards the end of the game over 250 people were watching it on Facebook Live. Leaders at Mercer University say they are going to review the numbers of tonight's game on Facebook live and determine later whether they will be broadcasting online for the Mercer Bear's next basketball game.

Image: William Steel A swarm of bees simultaneously sipping water, the cutest baby gorilla cuddling its mommy and other awesome wildlife photos that made our Facebook fans click 'like'. \nThese astounding photos were snapped by the finalists in the Sunday Times Wilderness Photograph of the Year competition . \nDuring the course of this exciting competition, we asked our Facebook fans to vote for their favourite images from a gallery of top entries each month. \nOur expert judges now have to decided which one of these seven Public Choice images will earn a spot in the top 15 photos, which will be considered for this year's grand prizes courtesy of Canon and Wilderness Safaris. \nWe'll announce which Public Choice photo made the cut on the Sunday Times Facebook page next week. September 2016 public choice winner: Wildlife Behaviour - \"These zebra gathered at the Mara river, wondering if they should cross its croc-infested waters,” recalls Corlette Wessels. “They eventually crossed after almost three hours and made their way to Tanzania.\" Image: Corlette Wessels November 2016 public choice winner: Endangered Africa - “African honeybees catch a sip of water during the extreme drought and high temperatures of November last year,” says Derek Turner, who took the image in his Sun City garden, North West Province, South Africa. \"Usually seen as little pests hovering around cool drinks in public places, it is often forgotten that without them there would be no pollination of plants, meaning no fruits, no flowers and, ultimately, the extinction of a large variety of flora.” Image: Derek Turner May 2016 public choice winner: Endangered Africa - A mountain gorilla baby, nestled close to its sleeping mother, deep in the Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. An endangered subspecies, there are 680 wild mountain gorillas left. Image: Karyn Parisi June 2016 public choice winner: Endangered Africa - “This black eagle – just before jumping off his perch to shake his feathers – suddenly noticed me and stood still as if he knew I was photographing him. He had a lost look in his eye and I wanted to capture that.” Eagle Encounters rehabilitation centre, Spier, Stellenbosch, Western Cape. Image: Kerryann Collier October 2016 public choice winner: Endangered Africa - A majestic elephant bull on the banks of the Levuvhu River, nestled in a magical part of the Kruger National Park – Pafuri. The elephant stands beneath the trees, his beauty framed by theirs. The region offers around 80% of the park’s diversity in one area – yet, the photographer notes, it is undervisited compared with the south. Image: Mike Sutherland July 2016 category winner: Endangered Africa - A martial eagle, the largest African eagle, feasts on a hadeda near Lower Sabie, Kruger National Park. The species' status is vulnerable. Image: Craig Morrison Don't miss out on this story Login, upgrade or subscribe to continue reading. Login",

There are numerous studies that point towards how social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter often causes depression and other such related mental conditions among individuals.\nHowever, there is a new study published in a recent journal research that suggests that social networking platforms actually serve as a resource for managing depression for many.\nThe study goes on to talk about the positive and negative effects of websites like Facebook and Twitter on a person’s well-being, the frequency, quality and the purpose of the experience individuals have on the platform.\nThe study further highlighted the relationship online social networking plays in managing depression. On similar lines, the study points how platforms like Facebook and Twitter act as social support systems to those who enjoy virtual experiences.\nThis review article was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking was done by David Baker and Guillermo Perez Algorta from Lancaster University of Britain.",

      "text": "via Comedy Central\nTomi Lahren is a difficult character to decipher. She pops up on your Facebook feed via a share from one of your Trump friends, screaming at the camera as if she’s the one who’s been consistently wronged in her life. Yes, while her viewpoints are certainly within the realm of reason, it’s her delivery that dilutes her message. As Trevor Noah points out, she’s known for being angry, so her saying she isn’t angry is preposterous. But Noah gives her a master class in getting a message across. While Tomi tenses up and raises her voice, Noah is able to take a deep breathe and keep his tone under control. He comes off as more reasonable, and therefore, more correct. I just think if Lahren were to tone down her rhetoric a bit and stop condescendingly yelling at everyone she disagrees with, she’d receive more of the fame she clearly deserves.\nBecause I will say this, the chick hustles. She got put on television straight out of college. She’s 24, a mere year older than I, and she already has brought national attention to her name. Can’t knock the hustle in that regard. She’s intelligent, she’s outspoken, she’s clearly hot, and is going to be in news media for a while. It’s only a matter of time before she’s hired by Fox News, right?\nThis embed is invalid\nTomi Lahren Photos: Must-See Pictures Of The News Anchor In 2016, it’s easier than ever to snatch your 15 minutes of fame.

My work explores the beauty of nature that is all around us, light, colors, textures and patterns. \nWhether in the form of landscape, flora or the human figure, I explore these subjects by slightly abstracting them with oils, acrylics and pastels. My handwoven textile pieces represent fractured light and patterns one would see in natural stones or elements of the earth. \nWhen dealing with naturally awe-inspiring subject matter, the struggle is to find new ways to reinvent, while not losing its beauty. In my work, I strive to overcome this struggle by using different mediums from paint to yarn and interesting color combinations to draw attention to overlooked focal points. \nBio: \nI am a contemporary artist from Louisiana, now residing in Greenville, South Carolina. I received a BA in Studio Art and Psychology from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana and have participated in over 15 art shows throughout the South and the Northeast. Since college, I have helped manage and teach painting classes at an art studio, and I have worked in the school system as an art instructor. I currently work out of my own studio in downtown Greenville. My work is comprised of oil paintings on wooden panels, as well as woven textile pieces. My work is distinguished by pastel hues and the over emphasizing of understated details. Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2gP9ydQ TOP VIDEOS",

Jayme Deerwester , USA TODAY 11:13   Won't some conservative please explain to Trevor Noah what the right way to protest is? (Photo: Comedy Central) \nThroughout his years on The Daily Show , Jon Stewart had Fox News' Bill O'Reilly as his friendly foil. While diametrically opposed, they frequently appeared on each other's shows and were able to laugh together. \nAnd now, successor Trevor Noah may have found his own Bill O'Reilly in The Blaze conservative commentator Tomi Lahren, who appeared on Wednesday night's show. They engaged in a spirited but respectful debate and managed not to talk over each other, a feat that's become all but unheard of on cable news the last few years. I had a great time with @Trevornoah on @TheDailyShow and I respect our obvious differences but common goals. https://t.co/yyAs4ipx2Y — Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) December 1, 2016 \nAnd viewers noticed — and appreciated it. Best part about this is they didn't yell or over talk each other just a great conversation. https://t.co/1TX2dGN0YR — Charlamagne Tha God (@cthagod) December 1, 2016 I don't agree w/ @TomiLahren on anything, but this was impressive. It's not easy to walk into \"the lion's den.\" #TDS https://t.co/2y26IL35Re — T. J. Clark (@TheTEEDGE) December 1, 2016 \nThursday morning as fans on both sides of the political spectrum heard about the interview, Lahren went from combative to conciliatory. After a late-night twitter swipe at \"liberal snowflakes,\" she had another message for both her fans and his: \"Trevor Noah is not an (expletive) or a jerk. I'm not an (expletive) or an (expletive). We are people with opposing views, that's it.\" \nNoah extended an open invitation for her to come back. \"Our goal should be to destroy these 'bubbles,' not each other.\" Thank you for being my guest Tomi. Our goal should be to destroy these \"bubbles\" not each other. You're always welcome on my show. https://t.co/AairL3cdAy — Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) December 1, 2016 \nSix minutes of their 26-minute conversation aired; you can watch their entire conversation below or scroll down to read some of the most interesting threads. <!--iframe--> On anger and Ellen \n\"I'm actually not that angry,\" she told Noah. \"It's just that there are things that need to be said and a lot of people are afraid to say 'em.\" \n\"You can't say you're not angry,\" he pressed. \"This is what you're known for. It's a strange thing to say, 'I'm not angry' but that's like Ellen saying, 'I don't like dancing.' Yeah, you do, Ellen, you do. You are angry, about everything, it seems.\" \n\"Sometimes, people just need to be called on their (expletive),\" Lahren said calmly. \"Protesting a free and fair election? You're going to get called on your (expletive) a little. It's time to clear the street, accept reality and move on.\" BLM is not the KKK \nNoah called Lahren out at times, especially regarding her previous comments on the Black Lives Matter movement , whom she compared to the Ku Klux Klan on Twitter. \n\"For someone who's not racist,\" he pointed out, \"you have to spend a lot of time a lot of time saying, 'I'm not racist.'\" \nAsked to name her biggest bone of contention with BLM, she said, \"It started with good intentions. The moment they started pushing up 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot,' which is a false narrative proven time and time again — the minute that became their slogan, the moment protesting turned into rioting, looting and burning and militant actions, that's when I lost respect for Black Lives Matter.\" \n\"How are you labeling the actions of a few and condemning an entire group?\" he asked. \n\"I saw it in my city of Dallas,\" she explained. \"Point blank, the shooter ( Micah Xavier Johnson, who killed five police officers in July ) said he was doing this because of Black Lives Matter.\" Dallas shooting marks deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 \nNoah earned cheers from the audience when he came back with, \"Just because you say the thing, it doesn't mean that's what it stands for. You're the same person who argued on your show that just because Donald Trump has supporters from the KKK, doesn't mean he's in the KKK.\" Black Lives Matter: Don't blame movement for Dallas police ambush It was all going pretty well until ... \nLahren remarked \"To me, true diversity is diversity of thought, not diversity of color. I don't see color.\" That one drew a loud response from the audience. \n\"I don't believe in that at all when people say that,\" said the biracial Noah, who grew up under apartheid in South Africa. \"There's nothing wrong with seeing color. It's how you treat color that's more important.\" On Colin Kaepernick and the right outlet for political protests \n\"(Kaepernick) says he's protesting the anthem and the flag because of the oppression of black people in this country,\" Lahren said. \"I'd like him to further explain what he's talking about. Is it against police? Is it against the government? I'm not sure what kind of oppression he's discussing. I'd love to have him come on my show and discuss it with me. To me, when you make the flag and the anthem the outlet for your anger or the outlet for which you're going to protest your country that you live in, you reside in and that you take $19 million a year from, I don't think that's the correct outlet.\" \nThat prompted Noah to ask a question that he genuinely wanted to know the answer to: \"What is the right way for a black person to get attention in America? How should a black person bring up their grievances? ... I just want to know if you've thought of the how.\" \nShe pointed out that women didn't receive the right to vote until after blacks did, but that she refuses to feel marginalized by that. \"I don't protest my country. I don't see what he's protesting ... I don't protest. I'm not a victim.\" On keeping Donald Trump honest \n\"As you've said, your side has won,\" Noah acknowledged. \"The liberal snowflakes are melting in the street as they protest and now I would like to know from your side, do you believe that Donald Trump will follow through on his promises?\" \n\"I will be a vocal opponent if he doesn't,\" she promised. \"I'm not somebody that gets on the cheerleading bandwagon. If he does something I disagree with, I will discuss it.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Source: Christopher Cowles, Facebook NORTH FORT MYERS, FL - \nAn investigation is underway after a Good Wheels bus driving eight special needs passengers caught aflame Wednesday afternoon. \nFirefighters quickly put out the flames, and the passengers were taken to safety thanks to the driver. \nThe CEO of the Company said management debriefed the driver amidst praise from witnesses and the CEO for doing the right thing. \nAs the investigation moves forward, witnesses are still processing what they saw happen. \n\"All of a sudden, I saw smoke coming from behind the trees back here and it was really pluming and I could hear people yelling \"get them out, get them out,\" said Shawn Conway. \nDrivers working for Good Wheels must have at least 160 hours of training, per the CEO. He said this includes training in crash-like situations, CPR and First Aid. \nThe investigation will determine the cause of the fire. \nGood Wheels operates about 50 buses in Lee County. This specific route will not be affected. Most Popular Stories Relentlessly bullied teen kills herself in front of her family 2016-12-01T19:40:16Z \nBrandy Vela's bedroom is covered in post-it notes.
