By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: November 17, 2016 12:48 PM Microsoft is no longer a Steve Ballmer company. It has Satya Nadella written all over it now. \nOnce archenemies, Microsoft has blown everyone away by joining Linux; and in a surprising move joins Google as well. Microsoft has Satya Nadella written all over it now. It no longer is a Steve Ballmer company. At the Microsoft Connect conference for software developers in New York, the company’s executive vice president Scott Guthrie along with Linux Foundation president Jim Zemlin, announced that Microsoft is joining Linux. This news might have been unthinkable a decade back, as both the companies had completely different set of beliefs. As closed was Microsoft with its Windows OS, its nemesis changed the game with an open-source OS. \nThe tech giant also announced that Google will join a committee of the independent .NET Foundation too. Google is Microsoft’s rival in applications and cloud services. The .NET Foundation promotes the usage of the company’s .NET software development tech. The Foundation had other member companies like Samsung and RedHat. Google has earlier brought tools in order to help .NET developers to work using Google Cloud Platform. The late decision might be a result of Microsoft’s previous CEO Steve Ballmer viewing open source software like Linux an existential threat. Ballmer, once in the year 2001, called Linux as a ‘cancer’. He said, “Linux is cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.” \nThese moves by Microsoft, clearly indicate the big change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella. Since then Microsoft has invested in a lot of non-Microsoft technologies, even joining the Eclipse Foundation, which is an important open-source institution. Interesting, after Microsoft softened its stance on open-source, this year even Ballmer said that now he loves Linux and even congratulated the current CEO. It is an undeniable fact that developers love to work on Linux platform, and though late, Microsoft is finally realising the need to join it, and want them to work on Microsoft Azure Cloud. Linux is an open source software which essentially means free or almost free, while Windows a proprietary software package costs money. \nThe company has indeed taken up Satya Nadella’s vision, making Visual Studio Code, PowerShell, and Microsoft Edge’s JavaScript engine as open-source recently. It has also tied-up with Canonical to get Ubuntu in Windows 10, also buying Xamarin to help in mobile app development. Xamarin’s SDKs and developer tools were also open-sourced. Microsoft also brought SQL Server to Linux. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now",

      "title": "Microsoft releases new Office Hub app for Windows 10 Creators Update to Insiders",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft has quietly released a pretty major new feature coming with the Windows 10 Creators Update to Windows Insiders. The software giant today released the new Office Hub feature to Insiders as an update for the Get Office app on Windows 10 PCs. At the moment, the app shows up as “Get Office” — however, when you look at the task manager, you’ll see that it’s showing up as “Office Hub”.\nThis is what makes the app quite interesting as it is believed to be one of the major new features coming with the Creators Update. Microsoft’s internal plans suggest that the company could be integrating it right into Windows 10, allowing users to be able to access their Office documents right from the taskbar (as a Cortana-like UI) or the Action Center. In addition to this, the app is actually a Project Centennial app — meaning that it’s a Win32 app which users can download or update right from the Windows Store. As a result, Office Hub will have access to all the Win32 features which possibly aren’t available on the Universal Windows Platform.\nGallery At the moment, the Office Hub/Get Office app is pretty limited — it only shows your recent documents, lets you open some Office apps, get support, and that’s it. If Microsoft goes ahead with its plans, Office Hub could get integrated into a Cortana-like user-interface which users can access from the taskbar. For now, you can’t really do much with it. This will likely change over the coming months when Microsoft officially releases the new feature.\nIt’s worth noting that Office Hub is also expected to have mobile apps which will allow users to access all of their Office documents right from their smartphone, in addition to the desktop app.\nOffice Hub is just a part of Microsoft’s plans to improve productivity features on the Windows 10 Creators Update — the company already revealed new features such as MyPeople , and the update is also expected to bring a OneClip replacement to Windows 10 devices. The update is scheduled to arrive in early 2017 , likely in March 2017. ",

      "title": "Microsoft Surprisingly Joins The Linux Foundation",
      "text": "Pinterest \nMicrosoft has done the unthinkable by joining the Linux Foundation as a new platinum member. The company’s entire business model has long been the exact opposite of what Linux has been trying to achieve; with former CEO Steve Ballmer once calling the open source project “cancer”. \nAll that seems to be in the past now, with Microsoft openly embracing Linux – and open source – development under current boss Satya Nadella. In fact, Redmond has been one of the top contributors on GitHub for the last several years. This even includes adopting community feedback and solutions; which is something that would have been extremely unusual in the past. \n“By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.” \nIn another twist to the story, Microsoft also welcomed Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group. Google has traditionally distanced itself from the .NET framework, as it focuses on rival Java development for the Android platform. However, it looks like the company has come to realise that .NET has become increasingly important. Microsoft Lumia 550 Officially Confirmed For Malaysia: Coming To Enterprise Customers First \nSimilarly, Samsung has announced that it will be releasing a preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen. It looks like the South Korean company is ramping up focus on its own mobile operating system. Especially since it has also introduce a new incentive programme for Tizen developers starting next year. \nCompanies moving to support more platforms and open source development can only be a good thing. There might be some cynicism with Microsoft’s move to support Linux, but the company has shown that it is willing to cater to competing platforms to expand its reach.",

Check it out below. \nThe Xbox One S launched in August of this year and has been one of the main contributors to the Xbox One line of consoles outselling Sony’s PlayStation 4 several months in a row . The Xbox One S is expected to continue selling well into the 2016 holiday season with a dip expected next year when Microsoft releases another iteration of the Xbox One model, currently named Project Scorpio . Project Scorpio will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox One and Xbox One S however and many are speculating that it could feature another console generation-level of upgrades. \nHave you bought an Xbox One S yet or are you going to wait for Scorpio? What do you think the most important feature is? Let us know in the comments below. In this story stream:",

However, the discount is only applicable on the Core i5 model featuring 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. \nCustomers interested in the tablet can grab it for £969 instead of £1,079, a discount of £110. This is a good deal as Surface Pro 4 is a very decent device considering the specifications it comes with. \nYou have to act fast if you’re interested in picking up the Surface Pro 4 as the promotion is set to expire on November 20th. \nAs a quick recap, the Surface Pro 4 ships with a 12.3-inch display, a Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. As far as the operating system is concerned, the new Surface Pro 4 ships with Windows 10 Pro as its operating system. Grab it before the deal ends.",

      "text": "After OpenAI Partnership, Microsoft Joins The Linux Foundation To Dive Deeper Into Open-Source Code 16 November 2016, 8:10 pm EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Microsoft has officially become a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation, pledging to drive innovation under open-source terms. The news comes just one day after the company announced a partnership with the Elon Musk-backed OpenAI nonprofit, marking major milestones toward open sourcing. ( The Linux Foundation | Twitter ) Advertisement \nNo, hell is not freezing over, but Microsoft did indeed join the Linux foundation in a bid to step up its open-source game. \nJust one day after announcing a partnership with OpenAI , a nonprofit research organization backed by Elon Musk, Microsoft has more big news: the company just joined the Linux Foundation to further embrace open-source technology, although it hasn't been that open to them in the past. \nThe Linux Foundation helps shape the development of Linux and other software built for the open-source community, allowing everybody to use and modify software to benefit from its advantages. Cloud-First And Mobile-First Experiences \n\"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry's shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,\" says Scott Guthrie, EVP of Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise. \nGuthrie further adds that this deeper collaboration with the open-source community will enable Microsoft to offer smart, flexible and open tools and cloud services to help developers provide innovation at a greater scale than ever before. \nBy joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member, Microsoft wants to boost innovation and collaboration in a vast ecosystem, working closely with the open-source community so that more people can take advantage of mobile and cloud experiences. \nThe collaboration is uncanny considering the great, long-standing rivalry between Linux and Microsoft, as the free Linux has long been seen as a threat to Microsoft's Windows. Microsoft Changing Under Satya Nadella \nHowever, while former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was openly against Linux, the attitude and strategy over at Microsoft has seen significant changes with Satya Nadella at the helm of the company. \nMicrosoft has started releasing some of its own tools under open-source terms and even announced a version of SQL Server , its database management software, coming to Linux in mid-2017 . Embracing Linux And Open Source \n\"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" says Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of The Linux Foundation. \nZemlin further highlights how Microsoft is now supporting Linux and open source and has been actively participating in many major projects. \n\"Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions,\" adds Zemlin. Linux Developers On Azure App Service Beta \nFurther sweetening the deal, Linux developers can now start working with an Azure App Service beta designed to handle the infrastructure management for cloud-based apps. \nThis should make it notably easier for developers working on PHP and Node.js apps running on Linux to build web and mobile apps with easy scaling and integration with other services.

      "title": "Checkmarx Furthers Agile and Secure Development for Microsoft Visual Studio Teams",
      "text": "Checkmarx Furthers Agile and Secure Development for Microsoft Visual Studio Teams [November 16, 2016] Tweet \nCheckmarx , a global leader in application security testing, today announced a new Checkmarx plugin for the Microsoft ( News - Alert ) Visual Studio Team Services platform. The new Checkmarx (CxSAST) Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services Plugin allows organizations with agile development practices to embed security into their software development lifecycle (SDLC) without the delays traditionally caused by application security testing. \nSoftware development is now occurring at unprecedented speeds. According to Puppet's State of DevOps survey, high-performing IT organizations deploy 200 times more frequently than low performers. As organizations increasingly turn to DevOps, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to help automate and increase deployment speed, it's crucial for security to keep pace. Creating a Rugged DevOps team that can seamlessly bring security into the DevOps process isn't always easy, as many security solutions and developer practices don't perfectly align. \nThe Checkmarx plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services integrates seamlessly into Visual Studio team's SDLC, enabling early detection and remediation of crucial security flaws. This allows teams to efficiently fix flaws as part of the CI toolchain, without iposing delays on the DevOps or CI/CD deployment cycle. Other benefits of using the Checkmarx Static Source ( News - Alert ) Code Analysis include: Faster feedback loop - Checkmarx's unique incremental scan capability means only new or modified code (that hasn't been scanned before) along with the related dependencies will be scanned. This means scan time is reduced from hours to minutes, perfect for organizations using CI/CD. Set your risk threshold and automate - Checkmarx allows users to easily set an organization's security thresholds to an acceptable risk level. Users can then decide if they want to break builds based on whether scans met the thresholds or not. Saves precious remediation time: Checkmarx doesn't leave a long list of vulnerabilities to remediate, but actually goes a step further and uses algorithms to correlate the different findings and identify the best fix locations which can eliminate multiple vulnerabilities with a single fix. This unique capability optimizes the remediation process and cuts down developer hours dedicated to remediation by up to 80 percent. Seamless integration: The Checkmarx plugin for Visual Studio Team Services platform is simple to install and configure. Visual Studio users can simply install CxSAST from the Visual Studio marketplace. \n\"Checkmarx equips CI/CD and DevOps teams with a seamless way to integrate security into their development practices and \"push security left\" so developers are empowered to deliver secure code without slowing down development\" said Moshe Lerner, senior vice president, Product Strategy and Corporate Development at Checkmarx. \"To ensure minimal impact on development cycles, it's important to work with security testing solutions that can automate your security scans and integrate with your existing IDEs, source repository and build servers, which is what we've done with Visual Studio Team Services. We're excited to be a part of such a vibrant and growing ecosystem.\" \nShawn Nandi, senior director, Microsoft Corp. said, \"Development teams are looking for ways to reduce security risks while also accelerating the DevOps cycle. Checkmarx's integration with Visual Studio Team Services tackles this problem head-on by scanning your code as part of the pull request in the Continuous Integration flow.\" \nThe Checkmarx Static Source Code Analysis (CxSAST) Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services Plugin has been launched in beta and is available here . A short video describing the plugin's unique capabilities, can be viewed here \nAbout Checkmarx Checkmarx is an Application Security ( News - Alert ) software company, whose mission is to provide enterprise organizations with application security testing products and services that empower developers to deliver secure applications.

      "text": "Cubic Joins Forces with Microsoft CityNext to Bring Innovation to Cities across the Globe Cubic Transportation Systems and global public sector initiative enable cities to harness a new era of innovation through a people-first approach November 17, 2016 01:  \nSAN DIEGO-  Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS), a business unit of Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB) , today announced its participation in Microsoft CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do “new with less,” by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft’s partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nNextCity™ is Cubic’s coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world’s urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity – contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation – and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies. \n“Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we have secured projects in North America and Australia,” said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. “The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County’s Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft’s Azure.” \nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic’s solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities. \nLeveraging a broad portfolio of familiar and security-enhanced consumer-to-business software, partner solutions, devices and services and Microsoft’s history of successful education and social programs, Microsoft CityNext is a collective effort that helps cities anticipate and plan for these changes and challenges, enabling them to meet citizens’ needs, thrive economically and embrace modernity. \n“We’re thrilled to partner with Cubic on Microsoft CityNext. Microsoft prioritizes a people- and partner-first approach across all our initiatives, and this initiative is no different,” said Trudy Norris-Grey, managing director, business development, Worldwide Public Sector, Microsoft. “While cities are feeling the strain from economic challenges, Microsoft CityNext ushers in innovative technology solutions to create opportunities for cities and their citizens, enabling them to accomplish what they never thought possible. We’re inspired by our diverse partner ecosystem and know that working together we can help cities realize their full potential.” \nAttendees of Smart Cities Expo can visit Cubic and Microsoft in Stand D400 at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain.

      "text": "November 17, 2016 \n# Microsoft Joins the # Linux Foundation As Everyone Now Loves Open Source Microsoft has announced today that it’s joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, no less than 15 years after former CEO Steve Ballmer described the open source platform as “a cancer.” Microsoft has slowly but surely migrated towards the open source world, but the icing on the cake has been announced today when Redmond confirmed that it’s becoming a platinum member of the Linux Foundation. Unsurprisingly, the software giant made this announcement with much fanfare and officials of the Linux Foundation applauded Microsoft’s involvement. “By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.” With Satya Nadella at the helm of the firm, Microsoft gradually increased its focus on Linux and the open source world. Projects such as PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and the Edge JavaScript engine have one by one been open sourced as part of a broader effort that pushed the company closer to a world that it once hated. Furthermore, with Windows 10, Microsoft is stepping closer to Linux, as the operating system comes with Ubuntu built-in. Earlier this year, Microsoft also released SQL Server for Linux. Microsoft says that it started focusing more on the open source community “in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core.” \nGoogle’s surprise announcement Also today, Google has announced that it’s joining the .NET Foundation as part of the Steering Group. The surprise announcement was made at the Connect()’ developer conference. “Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET,” Microsoft concludes.

      "text": "show chapters \nTime to buy Microsoft?\n“Fast Money” trader Pete Najarian pitches why to buy Microsoft to the desk.\nTime to buy Microsoft?      Tuesday, 15 Nov 2016 | 5:51 PM ET | 05:25 Forget the FANG stocks — one \"Fast Money\" trader believes that investors' tech dreams can be found with Microsoft . \nMicrosoft shares dropped 2 percent since last Tuesday's election, making the company one of the tech giants that seemed to have no place in the so-called Trump rally propelled by financials, consumer discretionary and energy stocks. Despite the weakness, \"Fast Money\" trader Pete Najarian gave three reasons why he thinks Microsoft is still a buy. \nOn Tuesday's \"Fast Money,\" Najarian made Microsoft his \"Fast Pitch\" play, emphasizing that compared with other mega-cap tech stocks, Microsoft actually fared better following the election. Tech titans Facebook and Amazon , for example, are both down 5 percent from last Tuesday, even though the tech sector reversed some of its losses in Tuesday and Wednesday trading this week. This makes Microsoft's 2 percent drop less severe, relatively speaking, and therefore Najarian believes that like other tech stocks, Microsoft's drop was due to overreaction about Trump's victory. \nBut Microsoft's cloud component is another huge sell to Najarian, who believes that cloud will be the key to Microsoft's success. In July following its earnings report, Microsoft reported that its cloud segment, which includes the Azure platform, grew 7 percent to be worth $6.7 billion. \n\"They're not only getting into the cloud, but they're making it a huge aspect of the Microsoft world,\" said Najarian. \nFinally, Najarian believes that the company's fundamental structure allows Microsoft to be worth the buy. \n\"You got more than $137 billion in this company,\" said Najarian. \"You've got a company that's giving you incredible yield and share repurchase. When you combine all of that with the growth, I think right now this is a great buy in the $58 area.\" \nMicrosoft is currently up almost 7 percent year to date, breaking out most recently at the end of October following its big earnings beat.",

      "text": "Financial Conduct Authority concerned about cyber security of banks Coca-Cola cloud project bottles rewards for 25,000 staff Cloud backup saves data after fire destroys school Download Current Issue \nOn the very eve itself of Microsoft’s third major developer event this year — Connect() 2016 in New York — the firm has taken another directly open stride in its Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts. Microsoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI , the nonprofit research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.

But why did the firm do any of this? We wanna democratize, with a zee \n“We want to democratize AI,” asserts the usually fairly gutsy non-marketing official Microsoft blog channel. \nMicrosoft’s says its partnership with OpenAI will be focused on making ‘significant contributions’ to advancing the field of AI. Yeah… like what? \nThe firm points to advances in fields such as ‘ reinforcement learning ‘ and says that this technique helps make tangible progress in the effort to build systems that have true AI. This is an area of AI in which software ‘agents’ (a computer program that acts for a user (or indeed another other program) in what should be thought of a relationship of agency) learn how to complete a task by being given a lot of room for trial and error… and are then rewarded when they make the right decision. Azure AI, aye aye \nMicrosoft points to AI inside the Azure cloud platform work including Azure Batch, Azure Machine Learning and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK). \nOpenAI has also chosen Microsoft Azure as their preferred cloud platform. OpenAI’s use of Azure will help OpenAI advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. \nSo what else is new in Microsoft AI Azure cloud land? Azure bot, hot to trot? \nThe firm is now bringing forward a preview of Azure Bot Service: this service is supposed to allow developers to accelerate the development of bots using the Microsoft Bot Framework and deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure. Also note the below: General Availability of Azure Functions : Azure Functions can be used to maximise development agility and operational efficiency of nearly any app or service at lower cost — it runs on Azure Functions, which allows the bots to scale on-demand. Azure N-series VMs: Generally available starting in December, the Azure N-series is designed for intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. \n“Microsoft is infusing AI into all of its products and everything it does across hardware and software to accelerate the path from research into products. Today’s announcements are part of Microsoft’s continued commitment to democratize AI – making AI more accessible to all,” said the firm. Can Microsoft beat IBM in the AI wars? \nSo can can Microsoft beat IBM and the monolithic Watson brand in the AI wars? \nWell the answer kind of comes down to a) whether it can successfully re-position the Azure cloud platform, fabric, layers and tools as some kind of AI supercomputer and b) whether it can continue to drive its focus successfully enough away from the ‘old’ PC market (yes apparently the new Surface is very good and of course it still has a massive interest in PCs) to reaffirm a focus on IoT, mobile and the cloudy backend to drive all the new devices. \nOne might argue that Microsoft could see better developer and/or consumer-type level adoption of its cognitive APIs for AI areas such as natural language undertanding, speech recognition, text analytics including sentiment analysis and key phase extraction and other associated areas of machine learning. Why? Simply becuase the firm has broader popular reach at the developer level some would say… although that may be grossly unfair to IBM, the firm has no problem at all packing out a whole raft of developer-centric conventions on a year-on-year basis. \nLook even further ahead at areas like Project Catapult — the technology behind Microsoft’s hyperscale acceleration fabric. The firm says that this at the centre of a set of investments Microsoft is making to build a supercomputing substrate that can accelerate our networking, security, cloud services and Artificial Intelligence. \nHave we learn enough yet about AI? No sir, not by a long way. Harry Shum, Microsoft AI and Research Group executive vice president, and Sam Altman, co-chair of OpenAI.

It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.\nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.\nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.\nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.\nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal.\nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.",

The announcement, made at the Connect conference in New York on Wednesday, will bring the former rivals closer. \nThis is a far cry from Microsoft's previous stand on Linux. The company's former CEO had, in 2001, called Linux a “cancer.” \nStill, this is not the first time that Microsoft has collaborated with Linux. The company was one of the sponsors of Linuxcon 2016 and supported Linux-based projects such as Node.js, OpenDaylight, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium and the Open API Initiative. Related Stories Why Mac, Windows And Linux Will Not Be Able To Load Google’s Chrome Apps Starting 2018 \nIn March, Microsoft revealed that it was bringing its flagship SQL server to Linux. Until now, access to the server was access-only, but as of Nov. 16, the public preview of the next version of SQL is available on both Windows and Linux. \nThe Linux version will include standard SQL features, which accompany the Windows version such as always encrypted, row-level security and memory columnstores. Microsoft corporate Vice President Julia Liuson told Techcrunch that users will soon be able to run SQL Server on Linux and in Linux-based docker containers. This will, in turn, give them more choices in deploying databases. \nIn addition to the SQL Server for Linux, Microsoft has announced preview Linux support for its Azure app service. \nThe first service pack for the SQL Server 2016 for Windows has also been announced at the event, with access to developer features that were previously restricted to the enterprise edition.

      "text": "Sign In Subscribe Microsoft Isn’t Feeling Any Russian Thaw Putin’s drive to cut reliance on foreign technology is threatening the Russia sales of U.S. tech giants. Share on Facebook \nIn a Nov. 14 phone call with President-elect Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin held out the prospect of better relations between their two countries. But U.S. tech companies shouldn’t expect warmer ties to ease a Kremlin effort to freeze out their products. \nSeeking to cut dependence on companies such as Google, Microsoft, and LinkedIn, Putin in recent years has urged the creation of domestic versions of everything from operating systems and e-mail to microchips and payment processing. Putin’s government says Russia needs protection from U.S. sanctions, bugs, and any backdoors built into hardware or software. “It’s a matter of national security,” says Andrey Chernogorov, executive secretary of the State Duma’s commission on strategic information systems. “Not replacing foreign IT would be equivalent to dismissing the army.” \nSince last year, Russia has required foreign internet companies to store Russian clients’ data on servers in the country. In January the Kremlin ordered government agencies to use programs for office applications, database management, and cloud storage from an approved list of Russian suppliers or explain why they can’t—a blow to Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle. Google last year was ordered to allow Android phone makers to offer a Russian search engine. All four U.S. companies declined to comment. \nAnd a state-backed group called the Institute of Internet Development is holding a public contest for a messenger service to compete with text and voice apps like WhatsApp and Viber. Russia’s Security Council has criticized the use of those services by state employees over concerns that U.S. spies could monitor the encrypted communications while Russian agencies can’t. \nTrump’s election hasn’t changed those policies, according to Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “This doesn’t depend on external factors,” he says. “It’s a consistent strategy.” On Nov. 10, Russia’s communications watchdog said LinkedIn would be blocked for not following the data-storage rules. The company says it’s seeking a clarification of the matter. That same day, the Communications Ministry published draft legislation that would create a state-controlled body to monitor .ru domains and associated IP addresses. The proposal would also mandate that Russian internet infrastructure be owned by local companies and that cross-border communication lines be operated only by carriers subject to Russian regulation. \nIn October, U.S. intelligence agencies blamed Russia for hacking U.S. political groups and leaking e-mails stolen from organizations such as the Democratic National Committee. In a statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security said the thefts and disclosures were “intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.” While U.S. intelligence officials say spying to better understand another country’s plans or motivations is expected and generally acceptable, Russia crossed the line when it leaked stolen material to influence the election. The Obama administration says it will take some punitive action but won’t necessarily publicize what it does. \nThe biggest effect of the Kremlin’s internet campaign can be seen in the Moscow city administration, which is testing Russian-made e-mail and calendar software MyOffice Mail on 6,000 machines at City Hall. The city aims to replace Microsoft Outlook with the homegrown alternative, from Moscow-based New Cloud Technologies, on as many as 600,000 computers in schools, hospitals, and local agencies. Now the city says it may also substitute local software for other Microsoft programs such as Word, Excel, and even the Windows operating system. And in March, Putin proposed an extension of the domestic-software requirement to state-owned companies and promised to personally monitor progress, a powerful incentive in Russia. That could dramatically increase the potential number of users in a country where the state and state-owned companies account for 70 percent of the economy. “Money from Russian taxpayers and state-controlled companies should be spent primarily on domestic software,” Communications Minister Nikolay Nikiforov told reporters in September. “It’s a matter of jobs, of information security, and of our strategic leadership in IT.”— With Stepan Kravchenko and Nafeesa Syeed \nThe bottom line: A push by Putin to cut reliance on foreign technology threatens the Russian sales of U.S. tech giants.

      "text": "Youtube Microsoft Translator’s speech translation will now be powered by Neural Network \nMicrosoft announced that neural networks will now power all the speech translations on Microsoft Translator. Skype Translator and Microsoft Translator app for mobile devices will now use neural networks \nThe technology is available to all developers and users who want to use the Microsoft Translator speech API to integrate the technology into their favorite apps and services. Neural networks powers a total of 10 languages supported by the Microsoft Translator speech API, namely Arabic, Chinese Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Spanish and Japanese. Microsoft says, these ten languages together represent more than 80% of the translations performed daily by Microsoft Translator. \nNeural networks capture the context of full sentences before translating them, providing much higher quality and more human-sounding output. Just yesterday, Google announced that Google Translate app is now also powered by Neural Machine Translation. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

( Array, 3 elements ) Printer-friendly version Cubic Transportation Systems and global public sector initiative enable cities to harness a new era of innovation through a people-first approach \nSAN DIEGO – November 16, 2016 – Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS), a business unit of Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB), today announced its participation in Microsoft CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do “new with less,” by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft’s partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nNextCity TM is Cubic’s coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world’s urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity – contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation – and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies. \n“ Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we have secured projects in North America and Australia, ” said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. “The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County’s Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft’s Azure.” \nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic’s solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities. \nLeveraging a broad portfolio of familiar and security-enhanced consumer-to-business software, partner solutions, devices and services and Microsoft’s history of successful education and social programs, Microsoft CityNext is a collective effort that helps cities anticipate and plan for these changes and challenges, enabling them to meet citizens’ needs, thrive economically and embrace modernity. \n“We’re thrilled to partner with Cubic on Microsoft CityNext. Microsoft prioritizes a people- and partner-first approach across all our initiatives, and this initiative is no different,” said Trudy Norris-Grey, managing director, business development, Worldwide Public Sector, Microsoft. “While cities are feeling the strain from economic challenges, Microsoft CityNext ushers in innovative technology solutions to create opportunities for cities and their citizens, enabling them to accomplish what they never thought possible. We’re inspired by our diverse partner ecosystem and know that working together we can help cities realize their full potential.” \nAttendees of Smart Cities Expo can visit Cubic and Microsoft in Stand D400 at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain.

Microsoft CityNext empowers cities to do new with less, by building on existing infrastructure and investments to digitally transform cities’ systems, services and operations; engage citizens and businesses by delivering personalized services and apps that foster real-time dialogue; and accelerate innovation and opportunity through programs and partnerships that empower and nurture the next generation of skilled workers.

      "title": "Why Did Microsoft Invest $500,000 in Linux Foundation?",
      "text": "Share Like This Page on Facebook Email This Print This + Why Did Microsoft Invest $500,000 in Linux Foundation? \nMicrosoft recently announced at its Connect(); 2016 event that it’s joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, the highest tier of membership in the Foundation, which will cost them $500,000 annually. Microsoft \nThe Linux Foundation was started in 2000, is a non-profit tech group which focusses on accelerating open technology development and commercial adoption. Currently, the foundation provides tools, training and events to improve any open source project, not just limited to Linux. \nThis might come as a surprise to many of you, but Microsoft has been working with Linux since 2009. \nSince then, they’ve been monitoring Linux and UNIX, and also have contributed to projects like Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container initiative, R Consortium and Open API initiative. \nLinux has been a sizable commitment for Microsoft for some time now, but their relation is garnering a higher public profile since the company became a member of the Linux Foundation. \n“Microsoft is already a substantial participant in many open source projects and has been involved in open source communities through partnerships and technology contributions for several years. Microsoft has demonstrated time and again that the company is evolving and maturing with the technology industry,” Jim Zemlin, Executive Director at Linux Foundation stated . \nFollowing this new membership, Microsoft is going to collaborate with the open-source community to improve user experience on mobile and cloud technology. \nMicrosoft has taken heed to the users’ suggestions to improve their products better and will work towards heterogeneous support both on Windows and Linux platforms. This partnership is going to beneficial to the open source community as well as the end-users of the products of these communities. The software giant had already been offering its products such as Office365 , Skype and RDP clients on devices running Linux-based operating system as well as BSD-based operating systems. \n“Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but it’s perhaps bigger news for the open source community, which will benefit from the company’s sustained contributions. I look forward to updating you over time on progress resulting from this relationship,” Jim Zemlin added. \nFollowing the open-sourcing of .Net in 2014 and of Visual Studio Code editor in 2015, a platinum membership seems the right way to go for the software giants. This way, they are also defying skeptics who feel that Microsoft, a largely closed-source software maker, is interested in joining the open-source space just for PR sake. \nOver the past few years, Microsoft has also brought SQL servers to Linux, partnered with Red Hat, SUSE and built Ubuntu distribution into Windows 10, among various other projects . \nOther members of the Linux Foundation include Amazon, Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle and Red Hat. \nJohn Gossman, an architect on the Microsoft Azure core team, will get a seat on the Board of Directors at the Foundation. Microsoft handing over a sizeable cheque worth half a million dollars to the Linux Foundation comes as a shock to many as the software giant’s former CEO, Steve Ballmer, famously remarked over 15 years ago that ‘Linux is cancer’ and established his dislike for the open-source software. \nThe main of Microsoft remains to serve users working across cross-platforms with ease and collaborating with open-source communities which can help a product improve manifold within a short span of time is an added advantage, both for the company and the end-user.

      "text": "You Have to See How the Microsoft Who-Bot Will Help Your Team \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has threatened to bar all Muslims from entering the country, and suggested building a \"big, beautiful, powerful wall\" across the southern border of the U.S. Recently, he said he would deport millions of undocumented immigrants at once. In the beginning of his campaign, Trump said that the 11 million immigrants in the country needed to go. \nHenderson takes issue with Trump's stance on immigration from a personal standpoint -- As someone recently awarded American citizenship, and from a business perspective, as a co-founder. \nSlack, which builds office communication software, employs a significant number of immigrants from around the world. \"I don't have a constant fear of being deported now,\" said Henderson, \"but I have a lot of friends that are also British expats who work in tech, and that's a terrifying situation for them.\" \nGiven that Trump has, more recently, reneged on some of his more controversial proposals, entrepreneurs point out that the future is uncertain. \"It's unclear what a Trump presidency would do to affect that directly in the Slack case, but there's definitely a prevailing animosity towards all 'Other,' and that's something we're super against,\" Henderson said. \nWhen it became clear last week that Trump had defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the Slack co-founders posted in their company's \"general announcements\" channel, ensuring employees that the office culture would remain tolerant and diverse in the years to come. \n\"Just because the president's insane doesn't mean we're going to suddenly turn mad,\" Henderson explains. He then amends that: \"Fuck, it's so terrible though.\"  ",

      "text": "0 0 \nIt appears Microsoft is satisfied with the overall stability and performance of build 14965 , and as a result, just released it to Slow Ring Insiders. Windows 10 build 14965 was released last week for Fast Ring Insiders, bringing a series of interesting updates and improvements. \nAs a quick reminder, here are the key improvements: Controlling external monitors from tablets just got easier: U users can now drive content on a second display from their tablet without ever having to attach a mouse. The virtual touchpad lets you do more with a tablet and a second screen – just connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, go to Action Center and tap on the “Project” Quick Action to extend your screen. Sticky Notes updates include: Support for Insights extended to many more languages and regions: flight detection added for Germany (Germany), and more English locales (Canada, Great Britain, India, Arabia), email and URL recognition added for every locale, as well as phone number recognition for all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. The performance of text input while typing has been improved. Numerous Windows Ink Workspace improvements , such as better performance of loading Sketchpad, the number of Recently Used apps shown in the Windows Ink Workspace has been increased to 6, and more. The Address Bar in Registry Editor has been improved. You can now use CTRL + L to set focus to the address bar and use shorthand notation for HKEY names. \nBuild 14965 also brings 16 fixes for PC that include patches for Internet Explorer crashes, Cortana issues , File Explorer crashes and more. \nThe fact that Microsoft rolled out build 14965 to Slow Ring Insiders only means one thing: a new Windows 10 Creators Update build for Fast Ring Insiders is on its way. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft: SQL Server for Linux is the real deal - InfoWorld",
      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nThose who wondered what it would be like to run Microsoft SQL Server on Linux now have an answer. Microsoft has released the first public preview of the long-promised product. \nMicrosoft also wants to make clear this isn’t a “SQL Server Lite” for those satisfied with a reduced feature set. Microsoft has a four-point plan to make this happen. [ The InfoWorld review: SQL Server 2016 boosts speed, analytics . | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter , our summary of the top tech happenings. ] \nFirst is through broad support for all major enterprise-grade Linux editions: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and soon Suse Linux Enterprise Server. “Support” means behaving like other Linux applications on the distributions, not requiring a Microsoft-only methodology for installing or running the app. An introductory video depicts SQL Server installed on RHEL through the system’s yum package manager, and a white paper describes launching SQL Server’s services via systemd. \nSecond, Microsoft promises the full set of SQL Server 2016’s features for Linux users—not only support for the T-SQL command set, but high-end items like in-memory OLTP, always-on encryption, and row-level security. It will be a first-class citizen on Linux, as SQL Server has been on Windows itself. \nThird is Linux support for the tooling around SQL Server—not SQL Server Management Studio alone, but also the Migration Assistant for relocating workloads to Linux systems and the sqlps PowerShell module. This last item is in line with a possibility introduced when PowerShell was initially open-sourced : Once ported to Linux, it would become part of the support structure for other big-name Microsoft applications as they, too, showed up on the OS. That’s now happening. \nBy bringing SQL Server to Linux, Microsoft can compete more directly with Oracle, which has long provided its product on Linux. Oracle may be blunting the effects of the strategy by shifting customers toward a cloud-based service model , but any gains are likely to be hard-won . \nThe other, immediate benefit is to provide Microsoft customers with more places to run SQL Server. Enterprises have historically run mixes of Linux and Windows systems, and SQL Server on Linux will let them shave the costs of running some infrastructure. \nMost of all, Microsoft is striving to prove a Microsoft shop can lose little, and preferably nothing, by making a switch—and a new shop eyeing SQL Server has fewer reasons to opt for a competing database that’s Linux-first.

      "text": "Microsoft Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate for Windows Launched Visual Studio for Mac is actually a re-branded version of another app Visual Studio 2017 RC has several improvements over version 2015 Microsoft’s seen to be embracing open-source more than ever \nMicrosoft Visual Studio is a well-known Integrated Development Environment (IDE), primarily used to develop applications for the company’s Windows operating system as well as websites and Web-based apps. Since Visual Studio 2015, developers are also able to create apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Linux, apart from Windows. \nOn Wednesday at the Microsoft Connect(); 2016 conference in New York, a Mac version of the suite was unveiled as tipped by leaked documents earlier this week. The preview version, now available for download from Microsoft's website, will let developers build native apps for cloud, iOS, Android, and macOS, using C#, a general-purpose object-oriented language developed by Microsoft. Notably, it will not let Mac users develop for Windows. But as reported earlier this week by Ars Technica, this isn’t the actual Visual Studio that’s coming to macOS, but rather a re-branded version of Xamarin Studio, a cross-platform C# development environment. The California-based maker of this software, Xamarin, was acquired by Microsoft early this year. What this means of course is what Microsoft is launching is very different from Visual Studio available on Windows, with the latter being a more capable product.\nIn the meanwhile, Microsoft has released Visual Studio 2017 for Windows as a release candidate in Community, Professional, and Enterprise editions. Visual Studio 2017 RC is touted to have several improvements with the biggest change making it easier to install, upgrade, and uninstall the software. Other changes include improvements for speed, code navigation, IntelliSense, debugging, and more. \nMicrosoft has been on a path to embrace open-source technologies more lately; on Wednesday it announced it would join The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. Under the wing of CEO Satya Nadella , the motto of Visual Studio today plainly says - “Any developer, Any App, Any Platform”.",

      "text": "Tagged: microsoft , linux \nMicrosoft is obviously serious about its new found support of Linux, having just joined the Linux Foundation at the top tier of membership.

You can pop by The Inquirer to read more about this unexpected turn of events. \n\"The non-profit group advances open technology development and promotes Linux, and Microsoft has signed up as a Platinum member, the highest-ranking option that comes with a $500,000 annual fee.\" \nHere is some more Tech News from around the web:",

      "text": "Word Processing Expert By Rebecca Johnson Adding Line Numbers to your Microsoft Word 2010 document takes just about a minute to do. But why would you want to? One word – Collaboration!\nHonestly, I can’t count the times that I have sat through meetings, all of us with the same document in front of us, flipping pages to try and find the same paragraph or sentence. It took me years to figure out how Line Numbers can help in meetings or actually anytime two or more people are working on the same document. Instead of saying, let’s look at the 18th sentence in the 3rd paragraph on page 12, you can say, let’s look at line 418. It takes the guess work out of working in a group with a document! Page numbers. Photo © Rebecca Johnson All About Line Numbers \nMicrosoft Word automatically numbers all lines except for a select few. Word counts an entire table as one line. Word also skips text boxes, headers and footers , and footnotes and endnotes . \nMicrosoft Word does count figures as one line, as well as a text box that has Inline With Text wrapping applied; however, the lines of text within the text box are not counted. \nYou can decide how Microsoft Word 2010 handles Line Numbers. For example, you can apply Line Numbers to specific sections, or even number in increments, like every 10th line. \nThen, when it is time to finalize the document, you simply remove the line numbers and voila! You are ready to go with no frustrating flipping of pages and hunting for lines during meetings and group projects! \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: Overview of the Ribbon Page Numbers. Photo © Rebecca Johnson Add Line Numbers to a Document Click the Line Numbers drop-down menu in the Page Setup section on the Page Layout tab. Select your option from the drop-down menu. Your choices are: None (the default setting); Continuous , which applies line number continuously throughout your document; Restart at Each Page , which restarts line numbering on each page; Restart Each Section , to restart line numbering with each section; and Suppress for Current Paragraph , to turn off line numbering for the selected paragraph. To apply line numbering to an entire document with section breaks, select the entire document by pressing CTRL + A on your keyboard or \\selecting Select All from the Editing section on the Home tab. To add incremental line number, select Line Numbering Options from the drop-down menu. This opens the Page Setup dialog box to the Layout tab. Click the Page Numbers button. Select the Add Line Numbering check box and enter the desired increment in the Count By field. Click the OK button on the Line Numbers dialog box, and then OK on the Page Setup dialog box. To remove line numbers from the entire document, select None from the Line Numbers drop-down menu on the Page Setup section on the Page Layout tab. To remove line numbers from a paragraph, click in the paragraph and select Suppress From Current Paragraph from the Line Numbers drop-down menu on the Page Setup section on the Page Layout tab. Give it a Try! Now that you have seen how easy it is to add Line Numbers to your documents, make sure you try them out the next time you are working with a lengthy Microsoft Word 2010 document in a group! It really does make collaborating easier!",

      "title": "Three Free Alternatives to Microsoft Word",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated November 13, 2015 . \nMicrosoft Word is one of the most popular word processing programs on the market, but that doesn't mean you have to spend hundreds of dollars for your document creation needs. Buying a word processor may be outside your budget, so here are three free alternatives to Word that are compatible with the popular program and help you get the job done. 1. Google Docs \nPerhaps not as ubiquitous as Microsoft Word, Google Docs is growing in popularity and offers a set of features that approaches those available in commercial word processors.Google Docs does not offer just a word processor, however. It has expanded into a suite of productivity options that includes Google Sheets , Slides , Forms , and a cloud storage service called Google Drive . The software runs directly from your Web browser, so there's no need to install a program on your computer. Google Drive allows you to save and access your files wherever you have Web access, and you can download your documents to your computer if desired. \nWhat's more, Microsoft Office documents are compatible with Google Docs, so you can upload and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents in Google Docs. More » \ncontinue reading below our video How to Speed up Your Home Wifi 2. Microsoft Office Online \nMicrosoft Word Online is Microsoft's answer to Google Docs. Like Google Docs, it is a completely Web-based, free word processing program.Word Online offers free editing tools and online storage space in Microsoft's cloud service OneDrive. You can use Word Online from both Windows and Mac machines. Not as feature-rich as the commercial version of Word, Word Online gives you the essentials.Need more than just word processing? Word Online is part of Microsoft Office Online , an entire suite of Web-based productivity apps. It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote , and other apps. All of these are connected by the OneDrive cloud storage service, so your files are accessible when you need them. More » 3. OpenOffice \nOpenOffice proves that free software can be just as good as the pricier commercial programs. OpenOffice is a full productivity suite with features that rival Microsoft Office.In addition to Writer, the word processing component, you get a spreadsheet, database program, drawing program, and presentation program all for free. The only thing missing is email. (For email, try Mozilla's free Thunderbird .)OpenOffice is the most popular free Office suite, and it is easy to see why. Your documents will be compatible with Microsoft Office. And, you get features that let you accomplish exactly what you want with your documents. For those who aren't ready for online software, OpenOffice could be the program for you!OpenOffice runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. More »",

      "title": "Inserting Excel Data into Your Microsoft Word...",
      "text": "By Rebecca Johnson Updated May 30, 2016 . \nHave you ever found yourself in a situation where you need to insert a part of an Excel Spreadsheet into a Microsoft Word document? Maybe your spreadsheet contains key information that you need in your Word document? Maybe you need a chart that you created in Excel to show up in your report? \nWhatever your reason, accomplishing this task isn’t difficult, but you do need to decide if you are going to link the spreadsheet or just embed it in your document. The methods we discuss in this article will work for any version of MS Word but we do have some links below for articles geared specifically to Word 2003 and 2007. What's The Difference?. \nA linked spreadsheet means that whenever the spreadsheet is updated, the changes are reflected in your document. All of the editing is completed in the spreadsheet and not in the document. \nAn embedded spreadsheet is a flat file. That means that once it is in your Word document, it becomes a piece of that document and can be edited like a Word table . There is no connection between the original spreadsheet and the Word document. You can link or embed Excel Data and charts into your Work documents. Image © Rebecca Johnson Embed a Spreadsheet \nYou have two main options when embedding a spreadsheet into your document. You can simply copy and paste from Excel into Word or you can embed it using the Paste Special feature. \nUsing the traditional copy and paste method is definitely a lot faster and simpler but it also limits you a bit. It may also mess with some of your formatting and you may lose some functionality of the table. \nUsing the Paste Special feature gives you more options on how you want the data to appear. You can select a Word document, formatted or unformatted text, HTML, or an image. \ncontinue reading below our video Exporting Data in Excel Embedded spreadsheet data appears as a table in Microsoft Word. Image © Rebecca Johnson Paste the Spreadsheet Open your Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet . Click and drag your mouse over the content that you want in your document. Copy the data by pressing CTRL + C or clicking the Copy button on the Home tab in the Clipboard section. Navigate to your Word document. Click to place your insertion point where you want the spreadsheet data to appear. Paste the spreadsheet data into your document by pressing CTRL + V or clicking the Paste button on the Home tab in the Clipboard section Paste Special offers many formatting choices. Image © Rebecca Johnson Use Paste Special to Paste the Spreadsheet Open your Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. Click and drag your mouse over the content that you want in your document. Copy the data by pressing CTRL + C or clicking the Copy button on the Home tab in the Clipboard section. Navigate to your Word document. Click to place your insertion point where you want the spreadsheet data to appear. Click the drop-down menu on the Paste button on the Home tab in the Clipboard section. Select Paste Special . Verify that Paste is selected. Select a format option from the As field. The most common selections are Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object and Image . Click the OK button. Paste Link connects your Word document to your Excel Spreadsheet. Image © Rebecca Johnson Link Your Spreadsheet to Your Document \nThe steps for linking your spreadsheet into your Word document are similar to the steps for embedding the data.

      "text": "Lack of integration with other Microsoft Office Web Apps Limited feature set Difficult to create documents from template Documents can't be created on iPhone or iPad \nDescription The Office Web Apps include 25GB of storage. You can store all your documents for access anywhere. \ncontinue reading below our video What Can The Apple Watch Do And Do I Need One? The Word Web App offers a basic set of tools in a familiar package. Documents can be uploaded or downloaded easily. They can even be opened in Office 2010 on the desktop with a few clicks. \nGuide Review - Microsoft Word Online \nThere are many free Microsoft Word alternatives. But, why settle for an alternative when you can get Microsoft Word for free? Microsoft Web Apps is a free, online version of its popular Office suite. It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Anyone can use the program--after signing in with a Microsoft Live ID. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free Live ID.Most online word processing apps can't match the features of Word. And, the Microsoft Word Web App is no exception. It includes a healthy set of tools. But, you won't find all the options available in the desktop version of the program. After all, you can't expect Microsoft to give away one of its biggest cash cows for free.The program is fine for those who need to do light word processing work. For example, if you just need a program to write the occasional letter, the Word Web App is fine. It's also handy for those who want to work on their document anywhere or who want to share them with others. With your account, you get an impressive 25 gigabytes of storage. That should be enough storage space for anybody!As you would expect from Microsoft, the Word Web App has a nice feel to it. It is surprisingly fast, and it resembles the desktop version of Word. That's nice for those who don't have time to learn how to find their way around a new program. Uploading and downloading documents is also easy. And, you can even opt to open a document directly in Word 2010.Still, there are some areas where the Office Apps are lacking. It would have been nice to see more integration between the apps. One of Office's strongest suits is the ability to share data between programs. But that seems to be missing in the online apps. Also, there is no easy way to use a template with the Word App , despite Microsoft's generous collection of free templates online.But, the biggest drawback is the lack of support for the iPhone and iPad. It is possible to access and view your documents from your iPhone or iPad. But, you can't do any editing. With more and more people using iPhones and iPads, Microsoft can't afford to ignore these devices.The Word Web App finally brings Microsoft Office to the cloud. It's a solid offering. And, if Microsoft addresses some of its shortcomings, the Office Web Apps could help Microsoft fend off its competitors.",

      "text": "By James Marshall Updated September 15, 2016 . \nMicrosoft Word no longer allows you to set a background color solely for display—one you see onscreen but that doesn't print when you run out the document. In early versions of Word, you could set the background to blue and the text to white, purely for display, but when the time came to print the document, the text printed as usual without a background tint. The reasoning for including this option was that the white text on blue background was easier on the eyes while you worked. You haven't been able to do this since Word 2003 . More recent versions of Word have options for changing the colors of background and text, but those colors print out as part of the document. Many Word documents are viewed digitally rather than printed, so there's no reason to be shy about adding color. Here are some of the color changes you can make in Word 2013. Change the Background Color of a Word Document Go to the \"Design\" tab. Click \"Page Color\" to display a list of color options available as background tints. \ncontinue reading below our video 9 Tips to Extend Your Phone's Battery Select the color you want from \"Standard Colors\" or \"Theme Colors.\" To add a custom color, click \"More Colors\" and choose a color. To remove a page color, select \"No Color\" from the Page Color panel. \nYou aren't limited to solid colors for the document background. You can add a pattern, texture or image as a background. To do this, click \"Fill Effects\" and select \"Gradient,\"\"Texture,\"\"Pattern\" or \"Picture\". When you are in the correct section, click on the options you want to apply. Change the Text Color in Microsoft Word \nUsing colorful text in a document is an easy way to draw attention to parts of the document. Microsoft gives you the controls to change all or part of the text to colors other than black. Select the text you want to work with. Go to the \"Home\" tab and click the Font Color drop-down indicator to bring up the Font Color menu. As you move your mouse over the colors, you can see a preview of the color on the text you have selected. To see additional colors, chose \"More Colors\" at the bottom of the menu to open the Colors dialog box. Click on the color you want to apply to the selected text. Highlight Text in Color \nAnother way to emphasize important information in your document is to highlight it. Think back to the days of yellow markers and paper textbooks and you'll get the idea. Select the text you plan to highlight. Go to the \"Home\" tab and click the \"Text Highlight Color\" drop-down indicator to bring up the Highlight Color menu. Click on any color in the menu to apply the highlighting effect to the selected text. Click on \"No Color\" to remove highlighting. \nIf you have a lot of text to highlight, it is faster to change the cursor into a highlighter. Click the \"Text Highlight Color\" icon in the Highlight Color menu to change the cursor to a highlighter. Then, just click and hold as you drag over the lines of text you want to highlight. Apply a Standard Color Theme \nMicrosoft Word ships with several standard Color Themes you can choose for your document. To see them, go to the \"Design\" tab in Word and select \"Colors.\" The color palette in the upper left corner shows the color theme currently in use, but you can select from any of the options displayed in the window for your document. Apply a Custom Color Theme \nIf you prefer to create a custom color theme, click \"Customize Colors\" at the bottom of the Standard Color window. You may be looking for exciting warm colors, friendly neutrals or calming cool colors. Click the arrow next to any of colors in the current theme to bring up a Theme Colors palette where you can select and change colors to customize your theme. To save your custom color theme, type a memorable name in the \"Name\" field and click \"Save.\"",

If you're using Firefox or another browser, click the \" Microsoft Download Center \" link to see a list of popular downloads. You can search for Word updates and updates for other Microsoft Office Suite products. \ncontinue reading below our video Tech 101: Recovering Lost Data \nIt is to remember that there will be no new updates after a certain point, because Microsoft no longer offers support for these products. Use Microsoft's Windows Update Tool \nYou can check for updates for your Microsoft Office Suite 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013 using Microsoft's Windows Update Tool. \nRegardless of what version of Windows you are using, you can run the Windows update tool by following the same basic process. Press the \"Start Button\" Click on \"All Programs > Windows Update\" (Windows Vista and 7) Click on \"Settings > Update and Recovery\" (Windows 8, 8.1, 10) \nOnce you have done that, Windows will automatically contact the Microsoft Update servers and check whether thee are any updates for your computer and for your Office Suite. \nEnable Automatic Updates One of the best ways to keep your Microsoft Office Suite up to date is to enable automatic updates.

      "text": "By James Marshall Updated February 12, 2016 . \nYou're probably familiar with text alignment in your Word documents, whether it's right, left, center or even justified. This alignment adjusts the positioning of your text on the page horizontally. Did you know you can also align your text vertically on the page in Word, too? How to Align Text Vertically in Word \nOne method for centering text in Word uses the vertical ruler. This is a bit time consuming and impractical, however, if you’re working on a document with many pages. If you want the vertical alignment of your document to be justified, the task is virtually impossible to do manually. \nWord allows you to align text vertically to the top of the page (default), the center, the bottom, or to justify it vertically on the page. \nHere’s how: 1. Word 2007, 2010 and 2016 Click the Layout tab in the top menu. In the Page Setup group, click the small expansion arrow in the lower right corner. This will open the Page Setup window. Click the Layout tab in the Page Setup window. In the Page section, click the dropdown list labeled \"Vertical alignment\" and choose an alignment: top, center, justfied, or bottom. Click OK . \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: How to Create Columns 2. Word 2003 Click File in the top menu. Select Page Setup… This opens the Page Setup window. Click the Layout tab. In the Page section, click the dropdown list labeled \"Vertical alignment\" and choose an alignment: top, center, justfied, or bottom. Click OK . 3. How to Vertically Align Part of a Word Document \nChanging the vertical alignment as explained above affects the entire document by default. If you want to change the alignment of only part of your Word document, you can; however, you can’t have multiple alignments on a single page. \nFollow these steps to vertically align only part of your document: Select the text you wish to vertically align. Follow the steps for vertical alignment show above, but with one one change: After selecting the vertical alignment, in the Preview section click the dropdown list and select Apply to . Choose \"Selected text\" from the list. Click OK, and the alignment choice will be applied to the selected text. \nText after the selection will retain the alignment characteristics of the rest of the document. \nIf you have not selected text in the document, the vertical alignment can be applied from the cursor's current location to the end of the document only. \nSimply follow the steps above, but in the select \"This point forward\" in the Apply to dropdown list.",

      "title": "Explained: Insert and Overtype Modes in Word,...",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated November 29, 2015 . \nMicrosoft Word has two text entry modes: Insert and Overtype. These modes each describe how text behaves as it is added to a document with pre-existing text. Insert Mode Definition \nWhile in insert mode, new text to a document simply pushes any current text forward, to the right of the cursor, in order to accommodate the new text as it is typed or pasted in. \nInsert mode is the default mode for text entry in Microsoft Word. Overtype Mode Definition \nIn overtype mode, text behaves much as the name implies: As text is added to a document where there is existing text, that existing text is replaced by the newly added text as it is entered, character by character. Changing Type Modes \nYou may have reason to turn off the default insert mode in Microsoft Word so you can type over current text. There are a couple of ways to do this. \nOne of the simplest ways is to set the Insert key to control insert and overtype modes. When this option is enabled, the Insert key toggles insert mode on and off. \ncontinue reading below our video Top Ways to Make Your Home \"Smarter\" \nFollow these steps to set the Insert key to control modes: \nWord 2010 and 2016 Click the File tab at the top of the Word menu. Click Options . This opens the Word Options window. Select Advanced from the lefthand menu. Under Editing options, check the box next to \"Use the Insert key to control overtype mode.\" (If you want to turn it off, uncheck the box). Click OK at the bottom of the Word Options window. \nWord 2007 Click the Microsoft Office button in the upper left corner. Click the Word Options button at the bottom of the menu. Select Advanced from the lefthand menu. Under Editing options, check the box next to \"Use the Insert key to control overtype mode.\" (If you want to turn it off, uncheck the box). Click OK at the bottom of the Word Options window. \nWord 2003 \nIn Word 2003, the Insert key is set to toggle modes by default. You may change the function of the Insert key so that it performs the paste command by following these steps: Click the Tools tab and select Options... from the menu. In the Options window, click the Edit tab. Check the box next to \"Use the INS key for paste\" (or uncheck it to return the Insert key to its default insert mode toggle function). Adding an Overtype Button to the Toolbar \nAnother option is to add a button to the Word toolbar . Clicking this new button will toggle between insert and overtype mode. \nWord 2007, 2010 and 2016 \nThis will add a button to the Quick Access Toolbar, located at the very top of the Word window, where you will also find the save, undo and repeat buttons. At the end of the Quick Access Toolbar, click the small down arrow to open the Customize Quick Access Toolbar menu. Select More Commands... from the menu. This opens the Word Options window with the Customize tab selected. If you're using Word 2010, this tab is labeled Quick Access Toolbar. In the dropdown list labeled \"Choose commands from:\" select Commands Not in the Ribbon . A long list of commands will appear in the pane below it. Scroll down to select Overtype . Click Add >> to add the Overtype button to the Quick Access Toolbar. You may change the ordering of buttons in the toolbar by selecting an item and clicking the up or down arrow buttons to the right of the list. Click OK at the bottom of the Word Options window. \nThe new button will appear as the image of a circle or disc in the Quick Access Toolbar. Clicking the button toggles modes, but unfortunately the button does not change to indicate which mode you are currently in. \nWord 2003 At the end of the standard toolbar, click the small down arrow to open the customization menu. Select Add or Remove Buttons . A secondary menu slides open to the right. Select Customize . This opens the Customize window. Click the Commands tab. In the Categories list, scroll down and select \"All Commands.\" In the Commands list, scroll down to \"Overtype.\" Click and drag \"Overtype\" from the list to the place in the toolbar you want to insert the new button and drop it. The new button will appear in the tool bar as Overtype . Click Close in the Customize window. \nThe new button will toggle between the two modes. When in overtype mode, the new button will be highlighted.",

      "text": "John Lund on Getty Images Updated June 16, 2015 . \nMacros for MS Word are one of the best ways to boost your productivity but you do need to consider your security settings. Macros are customized recordings of custom commands and actions to be performed in Word that you can use to streamline frequently performed tasks. When recording a macro, you can either assign the macro to a keyboard shortcut combination or to a button above the ribbon. Security Risks and Precautions \nThe one drawback of using macros is that there is a certain amount of risk involved when you begin using macros that you download from the internet since often times, macros from unknown sources may contain malicious codes and processes. \nFortunately, there are ways to protect your computer from malicious macros whether you are using Microsoft Office Word 2003, 2007, 2010, or 2013. The default Macro security level in Word is set to “High.” This setting means that if a macro does not meet one of the following two requirements, Microsoft Office Word will not allow it to run. \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: How to Record Macros The macro you are trying to run must have been created using the copy of Microsoft Office Word that is installed on your computer. The Macro you are trying to run must have a digital signature from a verified and trustworthy source. \nThe reason that these security measures have been put in place are because people reported malicious code implanted in Macros to Microsoft in the past. While this default setting is ideal for protecting most users, it will make it a bit more difficult for you to use macros from other sources that may not have digital certificates. There is however, a workaround for those of us who need more lax security. \nWhen editing the macro security levels in any version of Word, I highly recommend that you never use the low setting and instead select the Medium setting. This is what we will teach you to do for all versions of Word.",

      "text": "Microsoft (MSFT) Management on UBS Global Technology - Call Transcript (Seeking Alpha) \n“Azure is the #2 market share vendor in the cloud space, and has grown 100 percent or more yoy eight of the last ten quarters, and in fact growth accelerated in Q3 16,\" said Goldman Sachs’ Heather Bellini. \nBellini upgraded the rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $60 to $68. \nBellini explained that there were three reasons for the upgrade: 1) Accelerating growth in gross profit dollars driven by its cloud transition. 2) An inflection in incremental operating margins as cloud profitability ramps and operating expense growth remains muted. 3) Upside potential to consensus out year EPS forecasts. \nThe new price target represents upside potential of 16 percent for the stock, as compared to 11 percent upside for the rest of Goldman Sachs’ coverage. \nThe tech space saw a selloff following the U.S. presidential election, although the pullback in Microsoft appears to have been an overreaction. Azure To Drive Growth \n“With a large Microsoft customer base and strong C-level relationships, we believe Azure can continue to grow revenue and improve margins over time,” Bellini mentioned. \nThe analyst noted that this perception was supported by channel partners, who recently commented that they had been seeing robust uptake of Azure by enterprise customers, especially hybrid cloud. \nAccording to Mr. Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise Group, the reputation as a “trusted provider” of hybrid solutions “resonates” with vendors who are attempting to attract their own enterprise customers.

      "text": "Cubic Joins Forces with Microsoft CityNext to Bring Innovation to Cities across the Globe [November 17, 2016] Tweet \nCubic Transportation Systems (CTS ( News - Alert )), a business unit of Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB) , today announced its participation in Microsoft ( News - Alert ) CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do \"new with less,\" by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft's partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nNextCity™ is Cubic's coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world's urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity - contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation - and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies. \n\"Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we hae secured projects in North America and Australia,\" said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. \"The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County's Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft's Azure.\" \nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic's solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities. \nLeveraging a broad portfolio of familiar and security-enhanced consumer-to-business software, partner solutions, devices and services and Microsoft's history of successful education and social programs, Microsoft CityNext is a collective effort that helps cities anticipate and plan for these changes and challenges, enabling them to meet citizens' needs, thrive economically and embrace modernity. \n\"We're thrilled to partner with Cubic on Microsoft CityNext. Microsoft prioritizes a people- and partner-first approach across all our initiatives, and this initiative is no different,\" said Trudy Norris-Grey, managing director, business development, Worldwide Public Sector, Microsoft. \"While cities are feeling the strain from economic challenges, Microsoft CityNext ushers in innovative technology solutions to create opportunities for cities and their citizens, enabling them to accomplish what they never thought possible. We're inspired by our diverse partner ecosystem and know that working together we can help cities realize their full potential.\" \nAttendees of Smart Cities Expo can visit Cubic and Microsoft in Stand D400 at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain. Follow Cubic Transportation Systems at @CubicTS on Twitter ( News - Alert ) and join the conversation on social media with #NextCity, #MSFTCityNext and #SCEWC16. \nAbout Microsoft CityNext \nMicrosoft CityNext is a global people-first initiative harnessing all the ideas, energy and expertise of a city's people to create modern, healthy, safe, well-educated and sustainable cities for the future.

      "text": "\nAnyone who works with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) has experienced challenges around auditing and reporting. Successful, effective auditing is essential for the compliance and security of your network, but the complexity of AD can present a roadblock. Add in artifacts and human error, and you can end up in a mess that could consume a vast amount of time and resources to clean up.\nToday’s networks must put a premium on security. Add in ever-expanding regulatory requirements, a largely mobile workforce, and constantly evolving technology and devices, and upping your audit game becomes a necessity. You need a method for creating an audit trail that can be searched, sorted, and filtered to track relevant actions. You need the means to automatically monitor AD for suspicious behavior. And you need a way to clean up the artifacts that can slow down performance.\nWhen evaluating your AD monitoring options, ask whether the solution provides:\nData visualization. Does the solution provide a full visual representation of your Directory Services, including domains, devices, users, groups, and organizational units (OUs)? Can you display, filter, and analyze your complete hierarchical directory structure, including AD domains and forests, as well as all LDAP-compatible directory services? Change tracking. Can you easily track changes to and permissions for AD objects? Does the solution let you automatically detect and fix changes that fall outside your organization’s change management policies? Do you have a way to detect actions that exceed baseline activity, to help you catch and prevent breach attempts? And can you configure real-time alerts for any unauthorized attempts to escalate privilege or access resources? Ability to meet regulatory requirements. Will the solution help you meet regulatory requirements laid out by SOX, HIPAA, PCI, GLB, FERC/NERC, and so on? You’ll need a solution that allows you to quickly get accurate answers to questions such as who added a user to a particular group, how a user gained access to a specific resource and what the user did as a result, whether a group policy was modified and who made the change, and who has which permissions. A strong AD monitoring tool can help you effectively manage your AD environment while saving money and improving performance and security.\nFurther Reading: Active Directory Monitoring Resources from Varonis 4 Tips to Secure Active Directory : Insight from AD admins and other security professionals on how to take action now to protect your network.\nActive Directory & DatAdvantage Overview : Learn how cleaning and keeping your Active Directory organized can save hours in your workweek and take the drudgery out of AD management.\nSecure Active Directory in 4 Steps : In this webinar, you’ll learn a simple process for monitoring and securing your AD environment.\nActive Directory Domain Best Naming Practices : Understand how your domain naming practices can aid—or hinder—AD management.\n \n \n \n.\nThe post Sponsored: Choosing an Effective AD Auditing and Reporting Tool appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "\nIn a press release Microsoft has announced that the Saarland Police Service in Germany is running a trial of HP’s Elite X3 windows 10 mobile handsets and Surface tablets to help record minor accidents in their database. Around 33,000 such incidents need to be recorded every year, and currently involves handwritten notes, sketches and photographs which then needs to be transcribed electronically, doubling the work and the odds of errors creeping in.\nSince September 1/3 of crashes are being recorded digitally at the Saarlouis police station, leaving police with more time to do other essential police work.\n“The use of mobile devices in the accident statistics not only facilitates data collection on site, but also allows for a greater integration of the entire management process,” said Professor Dr. Peter Loos from the Institute of Economics computer science at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and The University of Saarland.\nThe first interim results show police and the public are equally enthusiastic about the project, with the electronic recording cutting the period of congestion following a traffic incident by half.\n“With the digitization of the police service Saarland is breaking new ground,” says Jürgen Lennartz , Head of the State and CIO of Saarland.\nThe project will run until the end of the year, and we hope will then see a more wider roll-out.\nThe news follows reports of the long-running success of the Windows Phone deployment by the NYPD in New York, USA, who have enthusiastically embraced their Windows Phones and experienced significant improvements in their responsiveness and productivity.\n",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Jon Ogg Thursday morning was a one that was quite simply directionless, after a mild 50-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from Wednesday. Maybe things got overbought after a seven-day continuous rally without a single down day. Some of the key election beneficiary stocks had run 20% or more in the past week. That is not normal at all and might mean some overbought selling is due. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was set to deliver testimony on the Economic Outlook before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Thursday morning as well.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid.\nInvestors keep looking for new ideas for gains or income. They have proven endlessly that they will buy the sell-offs and market dips. Rising bond yields, a Fed wanting to hike rates, high valuations and a huge political upset just do not seem to be in the way. Another point to consider is that this bull market is now closer to eight years old than seven.\nThese are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Thursday morning:\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) was last seen trading down 5% at $29.97 after earnings. Oppenheimer maintained its Outperform rating and its $34 target, but it warned that tough macro issues and product weakness add to its challenges. Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and $35 target based on strong billing metrics. Cisco has a 52-week trading range of $22.46 to $31.95.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) was downgraded to Hold from Buy with a $12.50 price target (versus a $13.80 prior close) at Deutsche Bank. Note that the stock was trading under $11 just two weeks ago, and its 52-week range is $3.52 to $14.26.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $68 price target (versus a $59.65 close) at Goldman Sachs. It has a 52-week range of $48.04 to $61.37 and a consensus analyst price target of $63.79.\nNetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP) was raised to Buy from Hold with a $52 price target (versus a $34.73 close) at Drexel Hamilton. Shares were indicated up 10% at $34.75 on Thursday after beating earnings estimates. NetApp has a 52-week range of $20.66 to $36.10, as well as a consensus price target of $32.31, prior to this move.\nSunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform with a $7 price target (versus a $7.16 close) at Robert W. Baird. The firm does not see SunPower’s prospects recovering any time soon, even with the shares down 80% from a peak due to a supply glut and industry deterioration. They see its premium modules having a harder time selling, and shares were indicated down 6% at $6.72 on Thursday.\nUrban Outfitters Inc. (NASDAQ: URBN) was downgraded to Equal Weight from Overweight at Morgan Stanley. The consensus analyst target is $37.36, and the 52-week range is $20.06 to $40.80.\nFollow @Jonogg on Twitter to receive the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed. \nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades were seen in the following:",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH , Nov. 17,   GrapeCity, the largest component solution provider in the Microsoft Visual Studio Partner Ecosystem and Visual Studio 2017 RC Extension Sim-Ship Partner, today announced the 2016 v3 release of its world-renowned Ultimate offering which bundles the time-saving data and UI controls from ComponentOne Studio, Wijmo, and Xuni together for developers building future-proof web, desktop, and mobile business applications\nIn this release the company's JavaScript control collection now includes support for ReactJS and VueJS. Add to this the company's existing support for Angular2, AngularJS, and Knockout and it presents the most comprehensive interop story in the market. \"Developers who need to maintain apps in Angular 1 and 2, while developing new ones in React or Vue, are able to use the exact same components/controls—Wijmo supports them all, with no dependencies,\" said Chris Bannon , global product manager at GrapeCity.\nThe final installment of the three releases in 2016, Ultimate v3 introduces FinancialChart in WinForms, Universal Windows Platform, and Windows Presentation Foundation; a new JavaScript ReportViewer; and is now shipping source code with the company's FlexReport Designer app. The new controls and added functionality empowers every developer to build the most complete and modern applications for any platform, any device with less coding. \n\"From being the first control vendor to deliver production ready controls fully supporting Angular 2, to offering developers migration paths from Silverlight and LightSwitch, to embracing new open-source and cross-platform frameworks in order to deliver timely solutions to developers, our focus has been customer-driven development,\" said Bannon. \"With this customer-driven approach, developers are benefiting from the constant product improvements end-to-end, which further strengthens the success of Ultimate's developer tools.\"\nWhen creating reports for WinForms, WPF, and UWP, the company's FlexReport Designer offers a code-free option for migrating or building modern .NET apps with design-time and data source editors. Now that the source code is available for FlexReport, users can take code snippets and embed the Designer within their application without running an executable, and in addition may further customize it to meet their needs. \n\nToday's release builds upon Ultimate's intuitive, universal API, which is the heart of the product when it comes to powerful data visualization features, built-in interactivity, and customization. The product has been further enhanced in this release with the addition of FinancialChart for WinForms, WPF, and UWP, which offers an all-in-one financial chart control for stock dashboards. \n\"With developers everywhere being tasked with delivering fast, feature-complete applications in less time, the need for flexible UI controls is increasing and GrapeCity is in the position to provide the developer community exactly what they need to accomplish their projects,\" said Bannon. \"We are developers ourselves and we are looking to help other developers solve some of the same problems we experience, which frees up time that can be directed towards business logic.\"\nAdditions to the Flex Core controls in the 2016 v3 release include: FlexViewer for MVC, an HTML5 based report viewer that offers full print support and offers a rich viewer feature set such as search, zoom, and document map. For developers looking to display multivariate observations and chart performance metrics, FlexChart's Polar and Radar charts provide various chart types for creating circular and weather charts. Other developers who may want to expand their charting possibilities with Sunburst charts within FlexChart, will be able to plot hierarchical data in an enhanced pie chart with animation features and data binding. \nThe company offers a no-charge, 30-day trial of Ultimate, which may be downloaded at http://www.componentone.com /ultimate .  Online visitors may also access tutorials, forums, documentation, and videos as part of the GrapeCity experience.\nResources                                                                                                                                                     \nWhat's New Blog and Video: \" What's New in ComponentOne Studio November 2016 v3 \"\nWijmo Drop Highlights: \" Wijmo 2016 v3 Has Landed \" \nPromos \nCYBER MONDAY SAVINGS: November 28  only ,   from 12 AM to 11:59 PM EST , the company is offering 50% off new licenses of Ultimate.

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 5 screenshots Convert Microsoft Outlook PST files to an extensive range of formats and extract specific items easily, with this straightforward utility Outlook PST files are used by the email client to store data locally, and you may have often found yourself needing to convert them to a mode widely-used format or extract certain items. BitRecover PST Converter Wizard is a relatively easy to use application that can come to your aid in these scenarios, as it enables you to both convert PST files to other formats and extract specific messages. Handy utility suitable for processing individual files The application requires you to import an Outlook PST file immediately upon launch, and it is possible to inspect its contents in order to determine which messages, contacts, notes, tasks or other items should be processed. The file’s folder structure is displayed in the left-hand panel, and you can also read the contained messages and open any attachments that are available. Of course, BitRecover PST Converter Wizard is not capable of batch processing, so is not suitable for converting large numbers of PST files. Offers support for an extensive array of output formats Once you have selected the items that you wish to export or convert, you need to select the desired output format. The program allows you to create a new PST file or update an existing one, as well as save data to MSG, EML, PDF, HTML, RTF, EMLX, MBOX, MBX or CSV. However, Microsoft Outlook needs to be installed on your machine in order to export content. When exporting messages to separate documents, you can select one of the available naming schemes to ensure the generated files can be identified more easily. Lacks documentation and features a rather outdated user interface BitRecover PST Converter Wizard is not particularly difficult to use, but it should be noted that no documentation is available locally. From a visual standpoint, the application is not likely to turn too many heads, as it features a simplistic and outdated interface that would benefit from an upgrade. All in all, BitRecover PST Converter Wizard is a straightforward and reliable utility that can help you convert Outlook PST files to other formats and extract important items. It does not stand out in any way, but it is a great tool for processing individual PST files. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS",

      "text": "Tweet \nIf you are using Office on an Insider Preview of the Windows 10 Creators Update you are getting some goods today as Microsoft quietly released a new app. The Office Hub can now be found in the Taskbar. \nBefore you get too excited, the app is currently pretty basic right now. It allows you to view your Office documents, open Office apps and get support. However, it is expected to be improved before the final release and there is some speculation about what those improvements could be. These include mobile apps to allow access to documents. \nThis is just one update users can expect in Windows 10 Creators Update. Some that the company has already announced include a new People bar, and a OneClip replacement to Windows 10 devices. \nWe expect a final release of the operating system update in early 2017.",

      "text": "Hell freezes over as Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Hell freezes over as Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation By Joel Hruska on November 17, 2016 at 9:16 am Comment \nFifteen years ago, Steve Ballmer memorably declared Linux was a cancer. Now, Microsoft announced it was joining the Linux Foundation. That’s not a completely unprecedented move, given that Microsoft has been getting steadily chummier with open source software over the last few years. There’s a Linux Bash shell integrated into Windows 10’s Anniversary Update , after all. But joining the organization responsible for maintaining Linux and for funding various open source projects? That’s a true 180 from where the company used to be. \nMicrosoft also launched a beta of SQL Server for Linux, while Google just joined the .NET Foundation, PC World reports . Microsoft is releasing a version of Visual Studio for the Mac, although this is based on Xamarin, not a straight port of Visual Studio. Samsung has a preview version of Visual Studio for Tizen, which will allow .NET applications to be built for Samsung’s non-Android hardware. If you wanted to blow someone’s mind from 2010, try telling them that Microsoft will help build Linux, Samsung wants VS support for Tizen, and Google has added .NET after spending so much time and effort investing in Java. \nMicrosoft’s move to embrace Linux is undoubtedly driven by changing macroeconomic conditions around the PC business. For decades, as the dominant server and consumer operating system, Microsoft had very little reason to play nice with others or work to emphasize interoperability. The explosion of the mobile market and the company’s complete failure to penetrate it has left it little option but to seek other types of collaboration and cross-platform support. Building products that work seamlessly across both Linux and Windows is one way for Redmond to ensure it remains relevant across the data center and server markets. \n“Microsoft is hitting all the right notes in terms of aligning its developer business with an ecosystem much broader than Windows,” IDC Program Director Al Hilwa told PC World. “Joining the Linux Foundation is a natural progression of this strategy and one that might still generate a double take if it wasn’t for all the actions the company has already taken in terms of supporting Linux in Azure and with SQL Server.” \nSQL Server should be available on Linux by the middle of next year. Those of you hoping for a suite of consumer-friendly cross-platform announcements may need to wait a little longer — there’s no indication that general application compatibility at the consumer level is coming to either operating system, and certainly no known plans to make APIs like DirectX 11 or 12 cross-compatible. Of course, some would argue that Vulkan supersedes the need for such support in any case, but we’ve heard similar arguments about OpenGL versus DirectX (pre-DX12) for over a decade. Even after Valve’s work to bring Steam to Linux, Linux gaming lags behind its Windows counterpart. Tagged In",

      "text": "By Usama Jawad Neowin LLC @@UsamaJawad96 · 11 minutes ago with 2 comments \nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would soon be bringing SQL Server 2016 to Linux . Yesterday, Microsoft officially joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member , and now it appears that the company is looking to further strengthen its relationship with the community. To that end, it has announced the first public preview of SQL Server on Linux. The preview - which has also been released on Windows - brings performance improvements and updated versions of tools. \nWith the release of SQL Server, developers can build applications on Linux, Windows, Docker or Mac (using Docker) and deploy it to either of the first three platforms on-premises or in the cloud. Microsoft is also making it easier to install and get started with SQL Server. Users can find native Linux installations for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu Linux, with packages for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server coming soon as well. \nMicrosoft also promises \"tremendous\" performance improvements for SQL Server on Linux, saying that: \nIn-Memory OLTP today delivers up to 100x faster reads and 30x faster writes. SQL Server also owns multiple top TPC-E performance benchmarks for transaction processing and top TPC-H performance benchmarks for data warehousing, as well as top performance benchmarks with leading business applications. We also recently showcased SQL Server running more than one million R predictions per second. With the next release of SQL Server, we are bringing these leading innovations to Linux. On top of this performance, SQL Server also provides incredible efficiency, and removes the need to architect the scale of your application. \nIn terms of tooling on Linux, Microsoft has released updated versions of some SQL Server tools as well as the new SQL Server extension for Visual Studio Code. Developers can use this with Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL DW as well. The company has also made native command-line tools available for SQL Server on Linux. \nMicrosoft has promised more improvements in the next version as well, but hasn't detailed them as of yet. It is important to note that back in March, the Redmond giant announced that over 8,000 companies have signed up to try SQL Server for Linux in its first week , which includes more than 50% of the Fortune 500 companies.",

Bellini said Microsoft's Azure is the number two market share vendor in the cloud space, and has at least doubled in size year-over-year in eight of the last 10 quarters. \"With a large Microsoft customer base and strong C-level relationships, we believe Azure can continue to grow revenue and improve margins over time,\" Bellini wrote in a note to clients.

Check it out below. \nThe Xbox One S launched in August of this year and has been one of the main contributors to the Xbox One line of consoles outselling Sony’s PlayStation 4 several months in a row . The Xbox One S is expected to continue selling well into the 2016 holiday season with a dip expected next year when Microsoft releases another iteration of the Xbox One model, currently named Project Scorpio . Project Scorpio will be significantly more powerful than the Xbox One and Xbox One S however and many are speculating that it could feature another console generation-level of upgrades. \nHave you bought an Xbox One S yet or are you going to wait for Scorpio? What do you think the most important feature is? Let us know in the comments  ",

      "text": "ISBN-10: 0-7897-5785-0 ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-5785-2 \nMicrosoft Excel can perform many statistical analyses, but thousands of business users and analysts are now reaching its limits. R, in contrast, can perform virtually any imaginable analysis—if you can get over its learning curve. In R for Microsoft ® Excel Users , Conrad Carlberg shows exactly how to get the most from both programs. \n\nDrawing on his immense experience helping organizations apply statistical methods, Carlberg reviews how to perform key tasks in Excel, and then guides you through reaching the same outcome in R—including which packages to install and how to access them. Carlberg offers expert advice on when and how to use Excel, when and how to use R instead, and the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. \n\nWriting in clear, understandable English, Carlberg combines essential statistical theory with hands-on examples reflecting real-world challenges. By the time you’ve finished, you’ll be comfortable using R to solve a wide spectrum of problems—including many you just couldn’t handle with Excel. \n\n• Smoothly transition to R and its radically different user interface \n• Leverage the R community’s immense library of packages \n• Efficiently move data between Excel and R \n• Use R’s DescTools for descriptive statistics, including bivariate analyses \n• Perform regression analysis and statistical inference in R and Excel \n• Analyze variance and covariance, including single-factor and factorial ANOVA \n• Use R’s mlogit package and glm function for Solver-style logistic regression \n• Analyze time series and principal components with R and Excel ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft released its mapping service and application for Windows 10 , Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox One and Microsoft HoloLens as a Universal Windows Platform app. From time to time, Windows Maps is updated and Fast Ring Insiders have just received the new build 5.1611.3191.0 , which can be installed on both computers and smartphones. \nWindows Maps version 5.1611.3191.0 doesn’t bring any major features, but it lets users give feedback and helps developers correct inaccurate maps or solve other map issues. \nIn this Maps update, you can now tell us if something is wrong with the map itself, such as a missing road or a city name in the wrong language, just by pointing and describing what’s wrong. \nThe company encourages users to report any problem they find in this application. They can even tell if search isn’t finding something they want or if Windows Maps suggests a hospital instead of an Italian restaurant. \nIf we’ve got the details about a business wrong, such as its location or opening hours, there’s now an easy to way to report that as well. And finally, if we don’t know about the hot new bistro that just opened this afternoon, you can be the first to tell us by adding the business information directly into Maps. \nThe previous update for Windows Maps was released a few weeks ago and version 5.1610.2953.0 was available only for Windows 10. This update, which took up less space, allowed users to easily organize their favorites or to make lists with different places. Another minor change showed a user’s home, work and the place where the car was parked at the top of the favorites list. \nIn order to sign up for the Windows Insider Program for PC, users will head to All Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Advanced Options > Get Insider Preview > Get started . Then, hit Next, Confirm and Restart Now. After the computer restarts, users will need to get back to the Get Insider Preview builds area where they will choose which Insider Ring they want to join: Release Preview, Slow, or Fast. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft, Time Warner, NetApp Upgraded; Cisco PT Sliced (Investor's Business Daily) \nNetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP ) reported Q2 results and Q3 guidance ahead of expectations on the back of “yet another round of cost cuts and restructuring measures.” \nBarclays’ Mark Moskowitz maintained an Underweight rating on NetApp, while raising the price target from $25 to $27. \nNetApp’s shares recorded strong gains, which was surprising, although the company’s strategic revenue growth slowed significantly and storage system revenue declined nearly 13 percent “after almost flattening last quarter,” Moskowitz commented. Strategic Revenue Growth \nWhile NetApp’s successful turnaround is based on “consistent, strong growth from strategic revenue” and a slowdown in legacy revenue declines, neither occurred during the quarter, Moskowitz pointed out. Strategic revenue came in at $439 million, representing merely 1 percent year-over-year growth. “Even when considering relative comps, trends seem concerning.” \nThe decline in legacy revenue accelerated to -29 percent year-over-year from -24 year-over-year in the prior quarter. Storage System Revenue \nStorage system revenue fell back “into old habits,” the analyst mentioned. The reported figure of $1.34 billion was significantly short of Barclays’ estimate of $1.39 billion and the Street’s $1.36 billion. Storage system revenue declined by 12.9 percent year-over-year, “a dramatic shift after storage system revenue almost flattened in Jul-Q (i.e., declining 0.6% Y/Y).” \n“We understand that both of these declines were impacted by difficult, but in our view, manageable comps,” Moskowitz added.

      "text": "Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free Scam Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free Scam Also Known As: Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free virus Written by Tomas Meskauskas on Thursday, 17 November 2016 07:31 AM \"Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free\" scam removal guide What is \"Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free\"? \"Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free\" is a malware that lock victim's computer screen and displays a fake error message. The screen lock imitates a fatal system error (so-called \" Blue Screen of Death \"). The error states that the system has been shutdown in order to prevent further damage. What follows is display of a pop-up claiming that a virus has been detected. The error states that the system has detected suspicious activity and encourages victims to contact \"technical support\" via phone number (1-888-496-5150) provided. Victims will then receive help solving the problem and removing the potential threat (virus). On initial inspection \"Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free\" error seems completely genuine.

Cyber criminals' aim is to scare victims and trick them into calling, and paying for services that are not needed. You should never attempt to contact these persons. Viruses like \"Microsoft Security Essentials Toll Free\" are often distributed alongside with potentially unwanted programs (adware, browser hijackers) which display intrusive online advertisements, cause unwanted browser redirects, and collect personally identifiable information. Displayed advertisements often conceal the content of visited websites. Moreover, they may redirect to malicious websites, thus, even an accidental click may result in further computer infections. Display of content-concealing advertisements and unwanted browser redirects significantly diminish Internet browsing quality. In addition, rogue apps gather geo-locations, IP addresses, URLs visited, queries entered into search engines, pages viewed, mouse/keyboard movement, and other similar data that might be personally identifiable.

      "text": "Tweet 0 Share \nWith the next release of Windows, it was stated that Microsoft would be building an ‘Office hub’ into the OS to make it easier to use and manage your Office 365 subscription. With the latest update from the Windows Store for Windows Insiders, we are getting our first look at the new hub. \nThe ’Get Office’ app for Insiders has been updated to be something more than an advertisement and finally gives you a reason to open the app . If you open up the non-insider Get Office app, it will instruct you on how to sign up for Office 365, the new iteration of the app makes it possible to manage your subscription and access your frequently used content. \nThe screenshots in this post are from the updated app and it really does simplify the install and management process that previously had to be accomplished through a web browser. For me, the access to downloading the Office apps is the best part of this update as there are already numerous ways in Windows to view your frequently used Office documents. \nAdditionally, managing your subscription is now much easier with this app and can be done from the desktop rather than in a browser; you can also see when you subscription will expire too. \nIf you are running an Insider build of Windows, you likely have access to this feature now, simply open the Get Office app. If you are on a production release, this app is not yet available but will likely be arriving in the near future as it should not be dependent on a desktop release since it is a stand-alone app. \nThis is a small enhancement to the Office 365 experience but for Windows 10 users, it will hep make it easier to get the most out of your subscription too. \nThanks for the tip @win10fan Sponsored",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAmong the more annoying and useless apps that come pre-installed on Windows 10 are Get Office and Get Skype. The latter is no longer necessary, since there's now a UWP Skype Preview app that comes with the Anniversary Update , but Get Office is still there, and it's still pretty terrible. In fact, it doesn't even uninstall itself after you use it to get Office. \nBut Windows Insiders are receiving an update today where the app becomes Get Office (Beta), marking the first real change to the app since its inception. The new app brings the rumored Office Hub, and as you can see from the image above, you can use it to manage your Office 365 account. \nYou'll also be able to use the app to install various Office applications. \nSadly though, this image is a bit misleading. It doesn't directly install them from the app; instead, it takes you to a website where you can download them. In other words, Office 365 subscribers still don't have the option to install these apps on their own; you'll still have to install the suite. Of course, it's a beta, so it very well may be included in a future update. \nThe homepage of the app will show you your recent documents, offering quick shortcuts to open them in their respective apps. \nOf course, if you click \"Show more\", you'll be directed to a full page of your recent documents. \nOne thing that feels odd about Get Office (Beta) is that it's impossible to make it full screen. Even switching the PC to tablet mode will leave it in a window that won't get any larger than the one that you see. \nWhile it's entirely possible that Microsoft could release this app for non-Insiders on the Anniversary Update, all rumors have indicated that this is something that it's saving for the Creators Update, which is due to arrive in early 2017 . It's also in beta, so we'll likely see more features for the app between now and then. Tags",

      "text": "Marketers snub Slack for Microsoft, Facebook chat tools Author Nov. 17, 2016 Dive Brief: Reporting by Digiday found that, although brands and agencies never took to enterprise chat app Slack, they are now drawn to Slack competitors like Microsoft Teams and Facebook Workplace, which offer solutions technology that better fits their needs. Teams was announced just a few weeks ago, and Workplace launched in October. Other reasons for the gravitation away from Slack might include the lower cost of Workplace in particular , and the fact that Slack is a standalone app, while the competition offers a robust suite of features that go beyond chat. Microsoft Teams isn’t formally released yet, but is being tested by companies that use Office 365; Facebook Workplace has already been adopted by more than 1,000 companies, including TBWA Worldwide, Weber Shandwick, Starbucks and Heineken. Dive Insight: \nWhen Microsoft announced Teams just a few weeks ago, Slack bought a full page in The New York Times essentially taunting its newfound competitor with a list of reasons why Slack understands chat better. The move was bold, aping a similar spot Apple ran in the 80s against IBM, but was seen by some as a signal that Slack was nervous at the arrival of a legacy technology competitor. The report from Digiday confirms whatever fears Slack may have had over the arrival of Teams and even Workplace, as they are already favored by many brands and agencies. \n“Slack is great when you have to manage a limited number of small teams, but Workplace is much more user-friendly if you are part of a large number of groups with a large number of people.” Nicolas Bordas, vp at TBWA\\Europe, told Digiday. “Workplace is not just a communications tool, it is much more than that: It is Slack plus Yammer plus Whatsapp.”​ \nOne key differentiator between Slack and its new rivals is that the latter two have communication options like live video conferencing. Microsoft and Facebook also have a leg up on Slack in pure user numbers: Although Workplace is a separate platform from Facebook proper, it offers a similar interface, resulting in a user experience most people might find warmly familiar in a corporate setting. \nAnd Microsoft already has 85 million users on its Office 365 suite, which Teams will integrate with eventually. These numbers compare to Slack’s pale shadow of three million daily active users. Teams and Workplace's launch signals how many larger technology companies (and especially Facebook) are replicating the service models of smaller standalone apps, often squashing them in the process by the sheer virtues of larger infrastructure and a more established brand name.

      "text": "  \nBack in August of this year, we reported on rumors which indicated that Microsoft had plans to better integrate Office 365 into Windows 10 with an “Office Hubs” feature. A little over two months later, it would appear that these rumors are true, as Petri.com has learned that a new Office Hub is now showing up: Office Hub showing in the task mananger \nAccording to Petri, the updated Get Office app for Windows Insiders now allows you to manage your Office 365 subscription (without a web browser!) and access content which is used most often. This is significantly different from the non-insider Get Office app which rather acts as one big ad for downloading and installing Office 365. Additionally, you also can use the updated Get Office App to download and install individual Office programs, and view your subscription expiration date. which once again was only accomplished via a web browser. \nAs seen in our screenshot above, there is some extra reason to believe that this may indeed Office Hub. While the app shows up titled as “Get Office (Beta)” looking at the app in the task manager reveals the application name “Office Hub Application.” While it is just a small change, all it takes to use the updated Get Office App (or Office Hub) is to install the latest Windows Insider Build, and open the Get Office app. \nDid you notice this change in the Get Office app?
