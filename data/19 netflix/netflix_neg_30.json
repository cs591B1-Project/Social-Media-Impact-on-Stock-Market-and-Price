Follow on Twitter @FakeRobHunter. 7 hrs ago Netflix’s Spectral Brings Guns to a Ghost Fight — Watch the First Trailer Is this the 13 Hours / 13 Ghosts mash-up we’ve been waiting for? Netflix has already established itself as a home to original series that succeed both critically and commercially, and they’ve been making strides towards duplicating that success with original movies. It’s a tougher game though with feature films as they lack the ability to draw viewers back for a next episode or season and instead exist as a one-off experiences. That means the key to becoming a home for original movies that people return to again and again comes down to two factors: quality and variety. Quality is a new challenge each and every time as some movies have it ( Beasts of No Nation , 13th ) and others are Happy Madison productions, and with that in mind it falls to variety to draw viewers back. It’s clear that Netflix knows this, and it’s nowhere more evident than in their upcoming slate of genre titles including IO , Wheelman , Bong Joon-ho’s Okja , and the soldiers vs ghosts thriller, Spectral . Check out the first trailer for Spectral below. If the premise of pitting modern-day military dudes against supernatural forces isn’t enough for you — well that’s on you — then you have to at least be sold on this cast. Bruce Greenwood , James Badge Dale , Max Martini , and Emily Mortimer are all terrific character actors, and dropping them into what amounts to a Michael Bay horror movie is just icing on the bullet and ectoplasm-covered cake. Director Nic Mathieu ’s feature debut was originally scheduled for a theatrical release before being pulled by Universal Pictures and scooped up by Netflix. Four writers are listed for the film, but while that’s rarely a good sign a closer look at three of their filmographies leaves me both hopeful and excited —  George Nolfi ( The Bourne Ultimatum , The Adjustment Bureau ), John Gatins ( Hardball , Real Steel , Kong: Skull Island ), Jamie Moss ( Street Kings motherfuckers!). The trailer teases more of a dark and gritty thriller than simply Ghostbusters with a body-count, but I’m completely down for a deadly serious action romp featuring soldiers shooting ghosts. It’s pretty much impossible for me not to be. Spectral premieres on Netflix worldwide on December 9th.",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nThough the second season of Netflix’s Sense8 , a sci-fi series originally created by Lana Wachowski , Lilly Wachowski , and J. Michael Straczynski , was previously announced in August of 2015 , we’ve heard very little on the project since. That changed today as Netflix not only revealed the release date (and synopsis) for Season 2, they also announced an upcoming Christmas special for the mind-bending show. \nThe special, a two-hour holiday event dubbed Sense8: A Christmas Special will launch globally on Friday, December 23rd at 12:01am PT on the streaming network. Season 2 itself continues with 10 new episodes launching globally on Friday, May 5, 2017 at 12:01am PT. To celebrate that fact, Netflix has also revealed a batch of images from the upcoming season. Check them out following a pair of Sense8 synopses below. \nHere’s the synopsis for Sense8: A Christmas Special : \nThe journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself. \nAnd here’s the synopsis for Season 2: \nPicking up where season one left off, Capheus (Toby Onwumere), Kala (Tina Desai), Lito (Miguel Angel Silvestre), Nomi (Jamie Clayton), Riley (Tuppence Middleton) , Sun (Donna Bae), Will (Brian J. Wright) and Wolfgang (Max Riemelt) come together both physically and mentally, plunged into the middle of each other’s tragedies and triumphs. On the run from Whispers (Terrence Mann), and f orced to question their very identity, it’s a matter of survival as the Sensates must find a way to live with, understand and protect one another against all odds. \nLana Wachowski , Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski serve as Executive Producers on the series. Check out some new images from Season 2 of Sense8 below: Related Content",

      "text": "O come, all ye “ Sense8 ” faithful.\nNetflix has announced a two-hour Christmas special will be available around the globe on Dec. 23. What’s more, Season 2 will pick up with 10 new episodes on May 5.\nAs Netflix debuts are wont to do, the shows will be available to stream (and now possibly download ) starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on the given release date.\nThe description provided for the Christmas Special leaves a lot to the imagination: “The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself.” A similarly vague setup for Season 2 says that the whole cast will struggle to survive and understand one another “against all odds.”\nIn his review of the first season, Variety TV critic Brian Lowry wrote, “The main problem, simply, is that the show doesn’t make much sense.” Still, the streaming service in banking on the series to hold onto its devoted audience for the foreseeable future.\n“Sense8” stars Tuppence Middleton, Brian J. Smith, Doona Bae, Aml Ameen, Max Riemelt, Tina Desai, Miguel Ángel Silvestre and Jamie Clayton as eight strangers who become mentally and emotionally linked.\nLana Wachowski, Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski are the show’s executive producers.\nRelated stories\nHow Netflix Keeps Downloads From Eating Up All Your Phone Storage\nNetflix Picks Up 'One in a Billion' Basketball Documentary About NBA's First Player From India\nNetflix Buys Pope Francis Mini-Series From Berlusconi's Mediaset\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "ROME — Top Italian commercial TV network Mediaset has announced the sale to Netflix of its event mini-series “Call Me Francis,” which portrays Jorge Maria Bergoglio’s path from Jesuit priest to groundbreaking pontiff.\nThe four-part skein is the most ambitious title destined for the international TV market so far by the broadcaster, which is owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\nPresenting the $15 -million series to the Italian press in Milan, Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said Netflix had acquired global rights outside Europe to “Call Me Francis” and would release it in 40 territories.\nHe added that Mediaset held on to European rights, even though Netflix wanted to purchase them, in order to “pursue a pan-European over-the-top platform project” which it intends to carry out with other unspecified European partners in the wake of its breakup with French media company Vivendi.\nA European representative for Netflix did not immediately respond to a confirmation request. However, “Call Me Francis” is among titles listed by the Netflix media center in its “first run” category.\nDirected by Italian filmmaker Daniele Luchetti, “Call Me Francis” chronicles the life of Bergoglio as a young man in Buenos Aires before he finds his calling to become a Jesuit priest, and follows him as he rises through the ranks of archbishop and cardinal. Along the way, he struggles with difficult decisions under Argentina’s military dictatorship, and eventually becomes the first pontiff from the Americas, in 2013.\nArgentinian actor Rodrigo De la Serna, who played alongside Gael Garcia Bernal in Walter Salles’s “The Motorcycle Diaries,” stars in the title role for most of the show. Chilean actor Sergio Hernandez (“Gloria”) plays Bergoglio in his later years.\n“Call Me Francis,” which was conceived and shot to be both a feature film and a TV series, is produced by Pietro Valsecchi for Mediaset’s film unit, Medusa, in collaboration with Mediaset’s Taodue production unit.\nThe “Call Me Francis” feature film was released in December 2015 in Italian cinemas, where it opened at No. 2 and scored a robust roughly $4 million overall. Netflix has not purchased the feature film version.\nMediaset will air the mini-series in Italy on its flagship Canale 5 generalist channel on Dec. 8, the pope’s 80th birthday.\nRelated stories\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Ratings: Solid Start for Netflix Series\n10 Things We Learned About Latin America's New TV Scene at Ventana Sur\nNetflix's Ted Sarandos Sticks Up for Network Neutrality Amid Repeal Concerns\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Chelsea Handler hosted an emotional post-election episode of her Netflix show in November, in which she cried and talked about her disappointment with the results. She revealed more about that experience during an interview with Trevor Noah on Thursday's The Daily Show.\n\"You honestly had one of the most vulnerable moments on screen,\" said Noah.\n\"It was the worst feeling I've ever felt, it was worse than even like the worst breakup I've ever had. It was the worst kind of despair,\" said Handler. She remembered crying on the phone with her sister, trying to convince her to move to Spain like Handler had said she would do if Trump won.\n\"She's like 'We're not going to Spain, lunatic,'\" said Handler. She recalled going into work that day and telling her staff, \"There's no way I can do a show.\" Guest Barbara Boxer came in and told her that this wasn't the end of the world, and she would act as Handler's anchor during the taping.\nIn the post-election show, Boxer was also emotional about Hillary Clinton's loss, but spoke about finding hope and motivation toward action.\nHandler said she was just focusing on how she was going to get through the day without crying onscreen. \"And then I did cry on TV, and you know what? Good. I'm glad I cried. I was really upset.\"\nNoah asked her to explain the reasons she felt the way she did after the election and Handler said there were a lot of reasons Trump upset her. She pointed specifically to Trump's treatment of Univision reporter Jorge Ramos.\n\"He talked to him like he was a dog,\" said Handler. She said that the incident motivated her to give a voice to minorities who might not be able to speak up for themselves. \"Whoever needs a f - ing voice, I will be your voice.\"\nHandler spoke about how women need to support each other more, referencing the many white women who voted for Trump. She said that it wasn't about supporting Clinton because she was a woman, but because of how qualified she was. \"You get behind somebody that's done the job versus some guy who,\" Handler cut herself off and said, \"I mean I can't even discuss him in real terms. He's not a real person. He takes advantage of everyone around him.\"\nRead more: Chelsea Handler Cries as She Talks Fighting the Urge to Move to Spain Following Trump Win",

It is now evident he is all of those things, every single thing that he accused her of.\"\nField said she's trying to figure out why those who voted for Donald Trump did so. \"I want to know what other people are thinking. I want to know why they voted for this man who does not stand for anything,\" she said. \"I don't think that all the people who voted for him are bad and horrible people, I just don't understand it.\"\nSince she joined Twitter the day after the election, Field has been tweeting about the Electoral College, Standing Rock and Trump's Cabinet picks. She brought up that Clinton still won the popular vote and said, \"This is why I'm on Twitter - I don't understand when they call this a democracy and yet the people are not getting the representation that they voted for.\"\nSally Field (@realmommagump) wants to understand why people voted for Trump.

He asked Bledel to share her top four.\nBledel was ready with her answer, immediately saying Caesar was one of her favorites. \"He's underrated, he's amazing,\" she said, pointing out that Caesar is the one who runs Luke's Diner when Luke isn't around.\nBabette (Sally Struthers) and Miss Patty (Liz Torres) were next on her list. \"They were on All in the Family together,\" said Bledel. \"They were on the show for years and years, so every time they would come to set they would get together and sing show tunes. It was such a raucous day on set every time they were there, so I have to appreciate them.\"\nAnd to round out her favorites, Bledel said she agreed with Fallon that Kirk belonged in the top four.\nWatch below to see Bledel address her fans' good-natured teasing that she doesn't know how to hold things and her desire for another Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie.\nRead more: Critic's Notebook: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Spoiler Talk — The Last 4 Words and More",

      "text": "\nOfficial trailer for Narcos season 3, coming in 2017 to Netflix. December 2nd 2016 3 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ It’s more than two decades since deadly druglord Pablo Escobar’s bloody reign ended in blood. Who has stepped up to take his place? Picture: AP Debbie Schipp news.com.au @debbieschipp Share \nIT’S more than two decades since Pablo Escobar, the drug lord who pioneered Colombia’s cocaine trade and became the leader of one of the most powerful, and fearsome criminal organisations ever assembled, was killed on a rooftop in his native Medellin. \nThe death of the man who made and lost billions, ordered the executions of thousands, and had his own army of kill-on-demand “soldiers” signalled the end of an era of drug trafficking. \nAnd the birth of another. \nThe megalomaniac the world knew variously as El Doctor, Don Pablo, El Patron and El Senor was legendary for his ruthlessness. He dealt with his enemies with what he called “plate o plomo”— literally, “silver or lead”. \nIt meant if bribes didn’t work, bullets came next. \nRegarded as one of the most notorious and wealthy drug lords of all time, at the height of his reign he was on the Forbes rich list as the seventh richest man in the world, and in the 1980s was reportedly responsible for up to 80 per cent of the cocaine imported to the United States. \nHis story prompted books, movies, and, more recently, hit Netflix series Narcos . \nBut 23 years on, there’s a rival for Escobar’s crown. A consortium of rivals. actually. \nThey’re the new brand of drug lord, and if you cut one individual down, another springs up from the business-style drug cartel’s “boards” which rule the trade to take his place. \nWHO HAS TAKEN PABLO’S SPOT? \nMexico has stolen Medellin’s mantle as the biggest operator. \nTwo cartels do the bulk of the business: the Sinaloa cartel, generally regarded as the most powerful and wealthiest cartel in Mexico and in the world, and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), which according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) now rivals the Sinaloa. \nAnd it’s from those cartels that three men — the new versions of Pablo Escobar — have emerged: Sinaloa’s Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García and Rafael Caro Quintero and CJNG’s Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes are the DEA’s most wanted men. \nAt least for as long as a bloke named “El Chapo”, the violent head of Sinaloa stays behind bars. Sean Penn and recaptured Mexican drug lord Joaquin Guzman Loera also known as 'El Chapo'. The Hollywood actor met El Chapo after his escape from a Mexican prison in 2015. Picture: Rolling Stone Source: Supplied \nBUT FIRST, ‘EL CHAPO’ \nUntil his arrest in January this year, Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera headed Sinaloa, Escobar-style. \nHe’s the man who infamously was interviewed by Hollywood star Sean Penn while on the run last year, sparking controversy and condemnation. \nThe US Federal Government considered him “the most ruthless, dangerous, and feared man on the planet”. \nIndeed, even his flight from justice resembled Escobar’s — Escobar’s number one assassin, Jhon “Popeye” Jairo Velásquez Vásquez said El Chapo’s ability to flout the law and undermine Mexico’s politicians made them alike because of their “grave political costs”. \nIn an interview with news magazine Proceso in August 2015, “Popeye” compared Escobar’s 1992 escape from prison to El Chapo’s second, in July 2015. \nEl Chapo escaped twice from Mexican high-security prisons, first in 2001 in a cart of dirty laundry, and in July last year using a mile-long tunnel that led directly to his cell. \n“Popeye” said like Escobar, El Chapo’s ability to flout the law made him a threat to Mexico’s political class. \nAsked did he compare the two fugitives “Popeye” said: “Yes, for their grave political costs. The states remain like banana republics. But in the case of ‘El Chapo’ I think that it is stronger still, for the tunnel, for the corruption.” \nEl Chapo’s escapes humiliated the Mexican government, who have agreed to extradite him to the US, a decision El Chapo’s legal team is fighting. \nThe DEA’s website has an emphatic “CAPTURED” stamped on his mugshot on its website. \nMost people say the Sinaloa will confine its operations through its vast networks. \n“The drug trade will continue to operate without ‘El Chapo’, but ‘El Chapo’ represented drug traffickers who could defy the government,” Grillo, author of Gangster Warlords , told Business Insider . \nWhich makes El Chapo’s right-hand man, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García, the world’s most powerful drug kingpin. Ismael Zambada García leads the world’s biggest drug cartel, the DEA says. Source: YouTube \n‘EL MAYO’ ZAMBADA, THE MOST WANTED \nHe’s described by a former head of international operations for the DEA as “one of the most elusive drug lords ever”. \nWhile “El Chapo” has served time in prison, Ismael Zambada García, also known as “El Mayo” Zambada, has never served a day behind bars. \nHe keeps a far lower profile than El Chapo, and certainly Escobar, ever did. \nThe Sinaloa cartel operates like a company, with a “board of directors”, and, El Mayo, 68, remains its most powerful player because he is free. \nHe’s accused of murder, and ordering multiple executions, trafficking, conspiracy and violence. \nHe teamed up with El Chapo after El Chapo’s first escape from jail in 2001, according to journalist Malcolm Beith’s book, The Last Narco. \nIn a 2010 magazine interview, El Mayo said his capture or death would make “little difference” to drug trafficking in Mexico: “there would always be others” to take his place. \nFormer DEA international operations head Mike Vigil spent more than a decade working in Mexico, and described El Mayo as “one of the most elusive drug lords whom Mexico has targeted”. \n“He has the ability, he is widely respected by the organisation, he knows who the sources are for cocaine, and other drugs, and has a great understanding in all the aspects involved in cultivation, transportation and distribution.” Quintero says he’s left the business. DEA officers say he’s a ‘psychopath’. Source: Supplied \nRAFAEL CARO QUINTERO \nHe’s described as a “psychopath”, and if there’s a prime example of El Mayo’s belief his own capture won’t dent the deadly drug trafficking trade, it lives in his deadly former Sinaloa sidekick Rafael Caro Quintero. \nAmong the litany of crimes including murder, ordering executions, trafficking, possession and violence, he’s accused of the kidnapping and murder of a US Federal agent. \nHe was captured in 1985 in a crackdown launched following the kidnap, torture, and murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena. \nHe was given 40 years jail. But in 2013 after he’d served 28 years, a judge released him on a technicality. By the time the paperwork for a fresh warrant was sorted, he was gone and on the run. \nWithin Sinaloa, some say Caro Quintero resumed a prominent role. \n“The situation with Caro Quintero was pretty tragic,” Vigil told The World Post . \n“He is a killer, a complete psychopath, who has no respect for human life. \n“For him to be released after killing Kiki Camarena and a multitude of other people is a travesty of justice.” \nBut the man himself has pleaded for “a second chance”, telling Vice News in July he’d paid for his crimes, wanted to be left in peace and refuting reports that he is currently heading an assault on territory controlled by former allies in the Sinaloa cartel. \nThe 63-year-old fugitive said once known as “The Prince” claimed he no longer has any criminal relevance. \n“I stopped being a drug trafficker in 1984 and will never be one again,” he said. Nemesio ‘El Mencho’ Oseguera Cervantes is high on the DEA’s most wanted list. Source: Supplied \n‘EL MENCHO’, THE RISING FORCE \nNemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes is the prominent leader of the on-the rise Jalisco New Generation cartel, known as CJNG in Spanish. \nStatements that have been reported by some of the CJNG members who have been arrested have said that El Mencho is a ruthless man who does not tolerate disobedience and likes to be asked for forgiveness when he’s going to kill someone, according to the Borderandbeat website. \nCJNC is thought to be the fastest-growing on Mexico’s seven main drug cartels, in the past five years it has grown to come second only to Sinaloa. Once they were seen as Sinaloa’s little brothers. Not they’re challenging them all over the country. \nThey run drugs, but appear to have a special interest in producing methamphetamine. \nUnder El Mencho, it’s been a bloody and violent rise: the most public in 2015 when they carried out several attacks on law enforcement in the state of Jalisco. They even shot down a military helicopter in May that year. In August, two of El Chapo’s children were kidnapped, then mysteriously released a few days later. It’s believed CJNG were behind it. \nEl Mencho is believed to have begun the rise by violently seizing other gangs’ turf and was able to expand rapidly in western Mexico, where a rival cartel was deteriorating. \nThe added danger is that CJNG has the capability to build its own guns. \nA raid last October turned up evidence that CJNG members were making their own AR-15 assault rifles with “highly sophisticated machinery,” according to Jalisco Attorney General Luis Carlos Najera. \nAccording to the DEA, the group now rivals the Sinaloa cartel in terms of trafficking operations in parts of Asia, Europe, and Oceania. \n“It is spreading like a cancer in Mexico,” Vigil said. \n“It’s the fastest expanding cartel and they could in the near future overtake the Sinaloa cartel as the most significant organised group in Mexico.” \nThe new face in the most wanted list on the governments of Mexico and the United States. El Mencho reportedly grew up cultivating avocados, migrated to California and was then deported for his involvement on a heroin distribution network. ",

      "text": "4:00 AM increase font size Hail to the queen, and the rest of the royal gang, in Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ The Buckingham Palace drama makes Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip young again. By Hank Stuever The Washington Post Share Read Article \nEvery crumb of Netflix’s Buckingham Palace drama “The Crown” is scrumptious, all 10 hours of it, but job No. 1 remains the hardest: How do you make two of this planet’s dullest people even halfway interesting? \nThat would be Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Philip Mountbatten, and the answer, of course, is to make them young again and more beautiful and fascinating than they probably ever were – or still are – in real life. Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II and Matt Smith as Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh, in \"The Crown.\" Below, John Lithgow as Winston Churchill. Photo by Robert Viglasky,/Netflix John Lithgow as Sir Winston Churchill in Netflix's \"The Crown.\" Alex Bailey, Netflix Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \n“The Crown,” which began streaming in November, qualifies as the epic masterwork from creator/writer Peter Morgan, who has come at the modern Elizabethan era a couple of ways now, most notably with the 2006 film “The Queen,” an intimate rumination on the burdens of royalty in the scandal-driven infotainment era, when an aging Elizabeth (Helen Mirren, in an Oscar-winning performance) fought to comprehend the national grief and dismaying shift in protocol that followed the tragic 1997 death of her ex-daughter-in-law, Diana. \n“The Queen” excelled by zeroing in on a one-week period, chronicling a crisis of public relations. “The Crown” is a deeper and more deliberately constructed saga, spanning eight years, starting with the 1947 wedding of Elizabeth (”Wolf Hall’s” Claire Foy) and Philip (”Doctor Who’s” Matt Smith) and working its way through the earliest years of her marathon reign. Even then – especially then – every action in Elizabeth’s life would be pre-considered through the optics of public perception, in a palace still roiled by the shocking abdication 11 years earlier of her uncle (Alex Jennings), known to the family as David and to the world, briefly, as King Edward VIII. She’s a girl who understood early on that her life would never be her own. \nThe essential theme, therefore, is always the same: “The Crown” invites sympathy about the burden of duty and the loss of self in service to country. From the amount of blood that Elizabeth’s father, King George VI (Jared Harris), keeps discreetly coughing into his handkerchiefs, it can only be a matter of time before the young bride ascends to the throne – and Morgan gets there in a matter of two episodes, which feels a little rushed. \nNOT A LOVE STORY \nThe first episode is curiously stripped of character development, and the pace seems slightly off. Viewers never learn why Elizabeth loves Philip or why he loves her – or even how they met and decided to marry. There is whispered disapproval of the marriage from Elizabeth’s mother (Victoria Hamilton) and her grandmother (Eileen Atkins), but it’s up to you to Google around and figure out why from royal historians. Only after two episodes does it become clear that Morgan isn’t interested in making a love story. \nInstead, it’s about a house full of people experiencing their own versions of identity crises: a queen terrified of seeming incompetent; a husband who feels publicly and personally emasculated. To that add a sister, Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby, going at it with true relish), whose casual take on celebrity is about 40 years ahead of her time, with instincts that are more Kardashian than Windsor. Finally there’s the biggest prima donna – the entitled, petulant, newly re-elected prime minister, Winston Churchill. John Lithgow plays the part with such a commanding presence that it becomes surprising and genuinely moving as the layers are peeled back and we see Churchill at his most vulnerable. \nAfter the royal wedding, which is lovely to look at, we jump so far ahead that their first two children, Charles and Anne, are already ignored and seldom-seen toddlers. Not one episode – nor any significant scene – examines Elizabeth’s feelings about motherhood or the traveling that took her away from her children for weeks and months at a time. We learn more about her relationship to her champion horses and her companionable corgis. For all the beauty and grace that Foy brings to the part (a little too much of both), her performance and Morgan’s writing struggle most in moments meant to humanize the central character. Heavy lies “The Crown,” indeed. \nAnd so the show’s sense of momentum relies mainly on tragically beautiful eye candy, high manners and lifestyle – the building blocks of televised Anglophilia. It’s so much to look at and consider, it often feels like Netflix has given us an extravagant and beautifully wrapped present. Morgan excels at mixing the historical record with sensitive imagination – he takes us inside the hushed elegance of Elizabeth and Philip’s world with such a careful instinct for realism and detail that makes it easy to believe that what we’re seeing is exactly how it happened. \nBut it’s not all luxurious fluff and nonsense – and anyone who tells you that “The Crown” is the new “Downton Abbey” has beans for brains. “The Crown” is far more thoughtful and serious than Julian Fellowes’s sudsy fixation with the incidental dramas between the upstairs and downstairs. \nWhat viewers have here is the opportunity to watch 10 one-hour movies about Queen Elizabeth’s world. It’s one of the rare cases in which I’d recommend watching the series slowly, at a rate of one episode per week, if you can show that sort of discipline. Pieces of “The Crown” are more brilliant on their own than they are as a series, taken in as shorter, intently focused films like “The Queen” and another Morgan achievement, the play and film versions of “Frost/Nixon.” \nThere could, for example, be a stand-alone movie in the episode where Elizabeth discreetly employs a tutor (Alan Williams) to help fill in the gaps in her dreadfully narrow education. There could also be a terrific movie in the testy but meaningful exchanges between Churchill and painter Graham Sutherland (Stephen Dillane), who is hired to make a portrait of the prime minister at 80. (Churchill hated the painting, by many accounts a masterpiece. Lady Churchill, played by Harriet Walter, had it destroyed.) \nAnd smack in the middle of the series, there’s a terrific mini-movie about Elizabeth’s official coronation, not up close and personal, but as seen from Paris, where a disinvited Uncle David, the Duke of Windsor, gathers friends and his wife, Wallis Simpson (Lia Williams), to watch the event on the newfangled telly. After flinging a few barbs at the young woman he nicknamed “Shirley Temple,” the duke finds himself deeply moved by the ceremony. \n“Symbol upon symbol,” he says. “An unfathomable web of arcane mystery and liturgy, blurring so many lines no clergyman or historian or lawyer could ever untangle any of it.” \n“It’s crazy,” one of his guests remarks. \n“On the contrary, it’s perfectly sane,” the duke replies. “Who wants transparency when you can have magic? Who wants prose, when you can have poetry? Pull away the veil and what are you left with? An ordinary young woman of modest ability and little imagination. Wrap her up like this and anoint her with oil and hey, presto – what do you have? A goddess.” \nThen and now, you also have captivating TV. Share",

      "title": "Researchers Use Google, Netflix Algorithm To Determine Stability In Distant Planetary Systems",
      "text": "Researchers Use Google, Netflix Algorithm To Determine Stability In Distant Planetary Systems 4 December 2016, 10:14 am EST By Livia Rusu Tech Times New research employed a machine learning algorithm in order to analyze the stability of planetary systems. The new method is much faster and efficient than the previous ones. ( NASA | Tim Pyle ) Advertisement \nA new scientific approach uses a model inspired from Google's algorithm to determine the degree of stability of the planetary systems. The researchers employed a machine learning technique in order to create a mechanism that is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods when it comes to predicting stability. \nThe study, published Nov. 23 in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters , was carried out at the University of Toronto Scarborough by a team of scientists, and it employed a novel instrument in the analysis of planetary stability. Using Machine Learning In Analyzing Planetary Stability \nMachine learning is an artificial-intelligence based technique which allows a computer to learn without being programed to carry out a particular task or set of tasks. Its major advantage lies in the dynamism of the instrument when in contact with new data. \nThe processing is done more rapidly and more efficiently through this method. Machine learning has also become widely used in the 21 st century in various industries, from preventing fraud and detecting email spam in Google to Netflix movie recommendations. \n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" noted Dan Tamayo, lead author of the research. \nAs part of the research , the team of scientists developed a series of workshops at the university, in an attempt to detail the way machine learning can be employed in analyzing planetary stability . Previous Techniques - Slower And Less Efficient \n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" adds Tamayo. \nPrevious approaches have all struggled with the interpretation and analysis of such a massive amount of data, which makes it nearly impossible to see the bigger picture. While progress was made within the instruments that were used for this process, the new study revolutionizes the practice through the nearly endless capacity of analysis and synthesis that machine learning offers. \nThe importance of understanding whether planetary systems are stable or not lies in the correlation that can be made between this particular behavior and their formation. This type of analysis can also provide insight on exoplanets that are currently unobservable through our existing means. \nWhile a series of methods employed in the detection of exoplanets currently exists, they are not always reliable, as they don't offer significant details about their structure and characteristics, such as the mass or the degree to which their orbit is elliptical, which are essential in understanding stability.

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nDT’s weekly entertainment show, Between the Streams , is your guide to all of the hottest, most important, and (of course) dumbest new developments in streaming and entertainment, providing a handy recap of the week that was, and a preview for what’s ahead. Follow us here every Friday or add us via RSS, iTunes, or Stitcher at the links below to take BtS on the road!\nbadge_itunes-smallest More\nstitcher-smallest More rss-smallest More Well, it’s December, and that means we’re neck-deep in the holiday season. But for true Star Wars fans, December may as well be Rogue One: A Star Wars Story month — there’s that much hype around this new movie, the first of Disney’s Star Wars spinoffs, which follows the unsung heroes who discovered the plans to destroy the Death Star ahead of the events of the 1977 film that started it all. We’ve gotten a ton of sneak peeks at the new movie and things were ramped up this week, with a new trailer on November 25, new footage of Felicity Jones’ Jyn Erso kicking some ass on Jimmy Fallon, and on Friday, even more footage revealed in a live Twitter event. You might say we’ve hit Rogue One overload, but this is Star Wars, so you won’t — and neither will we. We’ll be discussing the new footage at length this week, and talk about why this film feels special, even though it’s not technically part of the main canon.\nMore: Between the Streams: ‘Fantastic Beasts,’ ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ best movie theater ever\nSpeaking of teaser overload, Universal is hoping to manufacture some serious hype for its own megafranchise, which will begin with a reboot of one of its most popular movie monsters, The Mummy. The studio released a “trailer teaser” for the film this week. Not to be confused with a teaser trailer, a short trailer that gives a small peek at the movie in question, a trailer teaser is a sneak peek of the trailer itself. If that sounds a bit ridiculous, it is, but it’s also pretty common for today’s biggest blockbusters, and we have to say that this tiny hint of footage does look intriguing enough. Most interesting is the shot of the eyes of the Mummy (played by Sofia Boutella), which reveals dual irises for a chilling effect.\nThere’s not much else to see here, except Tom Cruise running around, and military helicopters flying over a desert landscape to remind us that, unlike the Brendan Fraser version, the reboot will take place in modern day. The Mummy ‘s full trailer is set to appear on Sunday, and we’ll be chatting about whether or not a cinematic universe built around Universal’s monster properties is a good idea or not.\nElsewhere in the movie universe, it’s a bit of a dull week in theaters when it comes to new films. The only feature of note is Jackie , which is being praised for Natalie Portman’s stirring performance as Jackie Kennedy. Set just after the JFK assassination, the film will follow the dark days that followed through the eyes of the first lady. Other than that, we’ll be recommending you go and see one of the other fantastic films still in theaters that you haven’t gotten around to yet, including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Doctor Strange, Trolls, Moana, Arrival, Hacksaw Ridge, and Edge of Seventeen , among other choices.\nWe also got some cool news from TV land this week, not the least of which is Netflix’s decision to take things offline with free downloads of select titles for all subscribers. We’ll give you a crash course on how this will work, and talk about what this means for the streaming king going forward.\nSpeaking of streaming services, CBS’ new service, CBS All Access, is the only place to see the new Star Trek adventure currently in development, Star Trek: Discovery . After months of speculation, we finally got word on the first cast members for the series this week. They include Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’s Michelle Yeoh as Captain Georgiou, the leader of the Starship Shenzhou, another Starfleet vessel. In addition, Discovery has added Doug Jones, who will play an alien, and Anthony Rapp, who will play a science officer who specializes in space fungus — you can’t make this stuff up, folks.\nAlso this week, we’ll be talking about Emerald City — NBC’s weirdo new take on The Wizard of Oz — Alien Covenant news, the latest from Martin Scorsese, and more.\nBetween the Streams: ‘Fantastic Beasts,’ ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ the best movie theater ever Between the Streams: ‘Arrival’ blows minds, ‘Curb’ Returns, ‘Valerian’ goes ‘Fifth Element’ Between the Streams: ‘Logan’ gets deep, ‘Guardians’ stays light, ‘Black Mirror’ returns",

The series follows strangers from around the world who are mysteriously connected.\n\"The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other's lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself,\" a synopsis for the holiday program said.\nThe subscription-streaming service also offered details about Season 2.\n\"Picking up where Season 1 left off, Capheus [played by Toby Onwumere,] Kala [played by Tina Desai,] Lito [played by Miguel Angel Silvestre,] Nomi [played by Jamie Clayton,] Riley [played by Tuppence Middleton,] Sun [played by Donna Bae,] Will [played by Brian J. Wright] and Wolfgang [played by Max Riemelt] come together both physically and mentally, plunged into the middle of each other's tragedies and triumphs,\" a press release explained. \"On the run from Whispers [played by Terrence Mann,] and forced to question their very identity, it's a matter of survival as the Sensates must find a way to live with, understand and protect one another against all odds.\"\nLana Wachowski, Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski serve as executive producers on the series.\n  Netflix December 2016: What's coming and going Alexis Bledel tells Jimmy Fallon her favorite 'Gilmore Girls' characters Dave Chappelle to headline three Netflix comedy specials Sean Astin and Paul Reiser join 'Stranger Things' for Season 2",

      "text": "Comment The latest Netflix update allows you to download select movies and TV shows for offline viewing. However, you can only do so on tablets and mobile devices. \nFor all of Netflix’s advantages, there is one rather glaring disadvantage: you can’t watch anything offline. It is, after all, a streaming service so that shouldn’t be a big surprise, but one of Netflix’s biggest competitors, Amazon Prime, gives their subscribers the option to download titles for offline viewing. \nAccording to Netflix Life , the latest update to their app has given people a feature that they’ve been clamoring for: Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nEven though this came from Netflix US’ Twitter account, this feature is also available in the UK and Canada. A good way to check is by opening a title, and seeing if the download option is available. There’s also an “Available for Download” tab on the menu. \nThere are some obvious drawbacks to this. While you don’t have to rely on wi-fi or data to watch Netflix titles anymore, it does require a lot of free space, which is a luxury not many people have. It’s also only available on iPhone and Androids, which means you can’t download titles to your computer. And there’s also not a lot to choose from. \nOriginal series such as Orange Is the New Black, Narcos, House of Cards, Stranger Things, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None and The Crown are available for download, but the Gilmore Girls revival is not. As far as other titles, there’s pretty slim pickings. Supernatural, The Office, The Flash and The 100 are among the shows you can download, but that’s about it.

However, this is a promising start. If you’ve got a long commute, spend a lot of time in the air, or just want to tune out your family in the car, this is for you. Happy bingeing! Top Stories",

Netflix allows users to binge-watch favorite shows without using data Updated: 2:33 PM CST Nov 30, 2016 Netflix allows users to binge-watch favorite shows without using data Updated: 2:33 PM CST Nov 30, 2016 Share Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! \nNetflix is making it possible for you to keep tabs on your favorite shows while on the go without using up your precious data. Advertisement \nEddy Wu, the company's director of product innovation, announced Wednesday that the latest versions of iOS and Android applications for phones and tablets will come with a download feature for select titles. That means you can download a show at home, while you're still on Wi-Fi, and watch it while on a road trip without streaming. \nNETFLIX SAYS DOWNLOAD VIDEO NOW AVAILABLE IN FACEBOOK VIDEO \nThe enhancement follows Amazon and Google, which offer download viewing for members of Amazon Prime Video and YouTube Red, respectively. \n\"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way,\" Wu said, specifically pointing out big shows like Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown, which are all Netflix Originals.

      "text": "Dec 4, 2016 1:35 PM Marvel's Luke Cage Share Tweet \nLooks like it’s going to be a sweet Christmas in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s version of Harlem, because Netflix has just announced that Luke Cage is getting a second season. This news comes straight from Marvel’s Twitter account, which shared a quick clip of Pop’s Barber Shop with some new neon in the window: — Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) December 4, 2016 \nSadly, it doesn’t look like the sign has been updated to say “Heroes For Hire” just yet, but that has to be coming eventually. \nWe don’t know when this new season might premiere, but like the second season of Jessica Jones and the third season of Daredevil , it’s definitely not coming until after the Defenders team-up series is finished —which will probably happen next fall. That also means that season two of Luke Cage will probably come after Jessica Jones and Daredevil as well, so it might be more than a year before it actually premieres. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

Now, Netflix has announced that season two of Sense8 will premiere on Friday, May 5, with a press release explaining that it will be “picking up where season one left off.” It will feature the Sensates coming together “both physically and mentally” as they run from Whispers and “question their very identity.” \nIf May is too far off for you, though, Netflix has announced that a two-hour Sense8 Christmas special will premiere on December 23. Here’s how the press release describes that: \nThe journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another, and struggling to identify with more than just oneself. \nUnfortunately, that doesn’t tell us anything about the Christmas special beyond the fact that it’s Sense8 -related, so you’ll have to go in spoiler-free. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

      "text": "\nThe end of September brought the debut of Luke Cage , Netflix’s latest TV series from Marvel Studios, the third of an entire line-up of shows leading up to the assembly of the street-level superhero team known as The Defenders. Now it appears both Marvel and Netflix were satisfied with the reception of the show, because Luke Cage season 2 has just been officially announced by Marvel Studios with a little teaser video that you can watch below. \nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \n\nThat location should look familiar to Luke Cage fans, but the little neon sign announcing that a second season is “coming soon” is a nice little addition. However, there’s no indication as to when the second season will actually debut on Netflix just yet.\nAs of right now, 2017 already will see the debut of Iron Fist , the fourth series that leads up to The Defenders , which is currently in production and also slated to hit the streaming service in 2017. There’s also the first season of the Daredevil spin-off The Punisher expected sometime that same year as well, marking the first time that Marvel will have three shows debuting in a single year.\nAfter that, 2018 is presumed but not guaranteed to bring the second season of Jessica Jones and the third season of Daredevil . Since that’s only two shows scheduled so far, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Luke Cage’s second season arrive that year as well, assuming Marvel is looking to have new seasons of current shows or new shows hitting Netflix three times a year.\nAs for what’s in store for the second season, the end of the debut season left plenty of roads open to travel down. Plus, series star Mike Colter already teased the potential for Heroes for Hire to make a debut , teaming up Luke Cage and Iron Fist. It’ll probably be awhile before we get any solid details, but at least fans can take solace knowing that Luke Cage season 2 is on the way.\nAfter a sabotaged experiment leaves him with super strength and unbreakable skin, Luke Cage becomes a fugitive trying to rebuild his life in modern day Harlem, New York City. But he is soon pulled out of the shadows and must fight a battle for the heart of his city–forcing him to confront a past he had tried to bury.\nThe entire first season of Luke Cage is available to stream exclusively on Netflix right now.\nThe post Marvel Announces ‘Luke Cage’ Season 2 Is Coming Soon appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "Luke Cage Headlines OFFICIAL: Marvel And Netflix Renew LUKE CAGE For A Second Season Season one of Luke Cage was a hit, and Marvel and Netflix have finally confirmed that the series will return for a second batch of episodes after The Defenders . Hit the jump for further details! The first season of Luke Cage was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, but it's been a while since it premiered on Netflix and we've heard nothing about a second season...until now! As you can see, Marvel has confirmed that the series will return, but a premiere date has yet to be announced. Jessica Jones was also renewed for a second season shortly after hitting the online streaming service, but it wasn't released this year and won't be with us during 2017 as the likes of Iron Fist , The Punisher , and The Defenders are on the way instead. So, while we'll see Luke Cage in the latter, we may have a couple of years to wait before getting to see Power Man set off on another solo adventure in Harlem! What would you guys like to see in season two of Luke Cage ? Let us know your thoughts below. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 Sweet Christmas arrived 21 days early! Season Two coming soon! Forward....Always.",

That’s why today’s news/tease that Marvel’s Luke Cage has a second season on the way shouldn’t come as any sort of immense shock.\nConfirmation of the bulletproof black man’s series coming back for another round was provided with a simple (but welcome) Twitter clip featuring a neon message in Pop’s Barber Shop reading: “Season 2 Coming Soon.” Unfortunately, “soon” is about as definitive of a release date as we’re going to get. Mike Colter ‘s Cage still has to align forces with the likes of Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist for 2017’s ensemble superhero offering The Defenders , plus there’s loads of other Marvel Netflix fare being promised in the next few years. As we’ve seen, Marvel has a particular way of dishing these things out, so it’s very important society doesn’t collapse until we have the appropriate multi-year bubble that can facilitate season 2 of Luke Cage .\n",

      "text": "Netflix \nJust a few years ago, Netflix found its fame when it offered movie-watchers the opportunity to rent movies and television shows without leaving their house. People everywhere had their favorite flick sent to them in the mail, as easy as 1-2-3. (This lovely convenience is one of the things that put Blockbuster out of business.) Then, before you knew it, a new thing came onto the scene! Move over snail mail, and hello high-speed streaming. Now, Netflix is responsible for creating TV-bingers out of millions across the globe. \nBut, you know the Spider-Man phrase, “With great power comes great responsibility?” Well, that also works in reverse. After Netflix became responsible for providing everything from the hottest new shows to classic black-and-white features, the service gained the power to bring television series back from the dead. Many fantastic shows are canceled because not enough people watch live. But that’s not our fault — we hate commercials! So, Netflix put these shows on its platform, and even produced brand-new, original episodes. Sneak a peek at a few awesome TV shows that Netflix brought back to life: \nSkip this Ad ADVERTISEMENT Gilmore Girls \nOver 15 years ago, in October 2000, the first episode of Gilmore Girls aired on The WB (now The CW). Almost instantly, every girl in America was obsessed with the fast-talking, coffee-loving mother-daughter duo and the adorably quaint town of Stars Hollow. The show had humor, romance and just enough drama to make us wait with bated breath for the next episode to air. It had a good, long run before coming to an end in 2007. \nBut, if you've ever seen Gilmore Girls , you'll know that 7 years just isn't enough, especially since creator Amy Sherman-Palladino wasn't a part of the final season. \nThankfully, after uploading the original seven seasons, Netflix premiered four 90-minute, brand-new episodes in a season entitled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Taking place nearly 10 years later, fans everywhere were able to return to Stars Hollow and catch up with their favorite gabbing girls. \nPhoto: Netflix Full House \nBefore Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were aloof and mysterious fashion designers, they were child actresses that no one could stop talking about. They got their big break on a show called Full House , which aired on ABC from 1987-1995. The sitcom followed a widowed father of three daughters, who asks his brother-in-law and best friend to move into his San Francisco home with him to help raise his family. \nOver the course of eight seasons, the family (and laughs) grew to be bigger and bigger. Then, a whopping 20 years later(!), Netflix revived the show as an all-new series called Fuller House . This time, the kids of the family (minus Mary-Kate and Ashley, sadly) are all grown up and raising children of their own. A lot of the original cast returned for the February 2016 revival, and it performed so well, a second season of Fuller House will premiere in December 2016 on Netflix! \nPhoto: Netflix Arrested Development \nIn the fall of 2003, Fox aired a 22-episode season of Arrested Development . The comedyfeatured a star-studded cast, including Jason Bateman , a young Michael Cera , Will Arnett , and Portia de Rossi ( Ellen DeGeneres ' now-wife). They, along with the rest of the cast, played a highly dysfunctional family that was ridiculous and witty. \nDespite the numerous laugh-out-loud moments (such as blowing up a banana stand, a boy in love with his cousin and a family living in a model home), the viewers simply weren't tuning in. For 2 consecutive years, Fox cut the episode order until, finally, canceling the series after three seasons in 2006. \nBut, 7 years after the last episode aired, Netflix premiered a fourth season with 15 fabulous episodes. \nSince then, there's been talk of plans to create a fifth season and even a potential movie. But, until that happens, you can watch all four seasons of the Bluth family on Netflix. \nPhoto: Netflix Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt \nYou know how October 3 is unofficially Mean Girls Day? Well, Mean Girls , the best chick flick of the 2000s, was created by Tina Fey . She also created the show 30 Rock , which aired for an impressive seven seasons on NBC. But, despite her genius, success and previous relationship with NBC, the network backed out of a deal to run her new hit, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . \nThe outrageously hilarious show, about female empowerment and perseverance, was originally supposed to air a 13-episode season in 2015 on NBC. But, possibly due to the uniqueness of the comedy, NBC sold the season to Netflix without ever airing a single episode on its network. \nJoke's on them, though! Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was a breakout hit on the streaming service, and a second season premiered a year later. A third season is currently in the works! \nPhoto: Netflix Black Mirror \nBlack Mirror was a British television show that aired on UK network Channel 4. Similar to American Horror Story , Black Mirror was an anthology series. Each season featured three episodes, and each episode had a different cast, characters and plot. However, one thing they shared was that nearly all of the seven episodes (two seasons and one Christmas special) was a dark satire on modern society. \nBut, perhaps the show's concept was a little too confusing, because Channel 4 canceled it after 3 years. Netflix, on the other hand, once again, saw potential and commissioned 12 new episodes, split among two seasons. The third season, consisting of six episodes, premiered on Netflix in 2016; the fourth season is to be released sometime in 2017. \nPhoto: Netflix The Killing \nThe Killing originally premiered in 2011 on AMC. The crime drama, which was based off of the original Danish version of the show, followed Seattle homicide detectives Linden and Holder as they solved one major crime each season. Once the second season ended in 2012, AMC canceled the series. \nHowever, after a little negotiating with different studios, AMC picked it back up and aired a third season on its network. \nFast forward only one year, in 2013, AMC canceled The Killing yet again. This was even more upsetting to fans because the third season ended on a cliffhanger. \nSo, Netflix decided to air a mere six original episodes to properly conclude the series. Is Netflix a streaming site or a superhero? \nPhoto: Netflix Longmire \nBased on the Walt Longmire mystery book series, A&E's Longmire centered on a recently widowed Wyoming sheriff who returns to solving major crimes in his small-town jurisdiction. Though filled with drama and intrigue, A&E only aired three seasons on its network, from 2012-2014. \nLuckily, Netflix saw the program's potential and snatched it up. Since 2015, 20 new episodes of Longmire are available for streaming on Netflix, in addition to the original 33 episodes that aired on A&E. In 2017, Netflix will debut a sixth and final season. \nPhoto: Netflix ",

      "text": "Mike Colter, Marvel's Luke Cage | Photo Credits: Netflix Mike Colter, Marvel's Luke Cage | Photo Credits: Netflix Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop , a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. - Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \nOther Links From TVGuide.com ",

What's more, Season 2 will pick up with 10 new episodes on May 5. \nAs Netflix debuts are wont to do, the shows will be available to stream (and now possibly download) starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on the given release date. \nThe description provided for the Christmas Special leaves a lot to the imagination: \"The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other's lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself.\" A similarly vague setup for Season 2 says that the whole cast will struggle to survive and understand one another \"against all odds.\" \nIn his review of the first season, Variety TV critic Brian Lowry wrote, \"The main problem, simply, is that the show doesn't make much sense.\" Still, the streaming service in banking on the series to hold onto its devoted audience for the foreseeable future. \n\"Sense8\" stars Tuppence Middleton, Brian J. Smith, Doona Bae, Aml Ameen, Max Riemelt, Tina Desai, Miguel Angel Silvestre and Jamie Clayton as eight strangers who become mentally and emotionally linked. \nLana Wachowski, Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski are the show's executive producers. | Updated: our guidelines | Comments FAQ ",

      "text": "Up Next Play me a story: How video game storytelling has evolved \nFans probably sensed it coming. On Saturday, Netflix announced dates not only for the second season of its original series \" Sense8 ,\" but gifted viewers with a Christmas special. \nThe Christmas special will be available to stream December 23, and the second season of the sci-fi show will premiere on May 5, 2017. \nSure, the two-hour Christmas special is just around the corner, but some fans felt that May was too long to wait for those who'd perhaps binged the entire 12-episode season back in June 2015. \n\"Sense8\" is an Emmy-nominated sci-fi drama from \" Babylon 5 \" creator J. Michael Straczynski and \" The Matrix \" creators Lana and Lilly Wachowski, although BuzzFeed reported in May that Lilly would be stepping back from the second season. It focuses on eight strangers from around the world who find out they are \"sensates,\" humans who are mentally and emotionally linked. Share your voice",

      "text": "The streaming giant continues to build out its comic book universe. \nNetflix is not done with Luke Cage . \nThe streaming giant announced Sunday that has renewed the Marvel drama for a second season. \nThe series is Marvel's third drama for Netflix, joining Daredevil (renewed for its third season) and Jessica Jones (renewed for season two), with the fourth — Iron Fist — due in 2017. The stars of all four shows will team for Marvel mash-up The Defenders , which is awaiting a premiere date at Netflix. . \nLuke Cage stars Mike Colter as the titular superhero, an African-American ex-con with bulletproof skin and superhuman strength living in Harlem. The series has been praised for its inclusive casting and timeliness, with THR TV critic Daniel Fienberg calling it \"vital and alive and of-the-moment.\" \nMahershala Ali, Alfre Woodard, Simone Missick, Theo Rossi and Frank Whaley round out the cast of the drama that was developed by Cheo Hodari Coker and Marvel. It's unclear when season two of Luke Cage will debut given Netflix's crowded Marvel landscape and forthcoming miniseries The Defenders, in which Colter will reprise his role alongside stars from Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist . \nMarvel has become a major provider of content for Netflix. In addition to the four dramas and upcoming mini Defenders , Marvel next has Daredevil spinoff The Punisher , starring Jon Bernthal. The comic book powerhouse next has FX's Noah Hawley X-Men take Legion due on top of ABC veteran Agents of SHIELD and Imax co-production The Inhumans , the latter of which is set for the fall. On the development side, Marvel is working with Hulu on The Runaways and scored a straight-to-series order at Freeform for Cloak and Dagger , the latter of which is due in 2018 and remains uncast. \n",

Netflix confirmed the news via the official Luke Cage Twitter account complete with a short video that announced a second season was coming soon with a neon sign in Pop's barber shop. \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Of course, when it premiered earlier this year, Luke Cage was such a hit with fans and critics alike that a second season was very likely anyway - just like Daredevil and Jessica Jones before it. But as this is the first actual confirmation of it we've gotten from Netflix, it's definitely time to get excited. © Myles Aronowitz/Netflix The 13 episodes saw Luke team up with nurse Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) and policewoman Misty Knight (Simone Missick) to take down villain Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes (Mahershala Ali). Unfortunately for them, it soon became clear that there were people even worse than Cottonmouth who needed defeating. All in a day's work for a superhero, eh? ",

We are taking a look at this photo series by Louis Dazy and I just love this series for many thing including the Double Exposure, chasing that Neon light and the creative exploration during his experimentations. Hope you like it! \nTypography: Scripts with Depth \n\nScripts with Depth is a typography project shared by Katt Phatt and as the name suggests it is a set of beautiful 3D type with a super clever usage of depth. We are all used to seeing quotes and phrase with script lettering, it was quite trendy a couple of years ago. What Katt did was to play with the Z axis to create a super fresh effect. There's even some depth of field going on, check it out \nUI Design: PayPal Concept Design \n\nPayPal seems to be one service that a lot of designers use for UI design or concept redesigns. I quite like that because it's a finance application. It's in a way not towards social/user generated content where it's all about style or beauty. It's about money, balance, transfers and stuff like that. Filippos Protogeridis shared a good one on his Behance profile.The simple and super elegant UI design, it is more image heavy when necessary, like on the promo page and utilitarian when it needs to be. Overall I quite like this concept, much more than the official and current design. \nNYC Illustrations \n\nWe are fans of the work of Romain Trystram on Abduzeedo, we always loved his Tron-stylesque illustrations where he uses a vibrant colour palette that seems always be happening at night time. What I do thought about his latest NYC Illustration series is that the colour palette has completely reversed from night to day and the lighting is just stunning. You can easily recognize some spots from the famous New York City and wildly felt like some illustrations are also been featured on the late Casey Neistat vlogs. Hope you will enjoy these!",

And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location.

Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "December 4, 2016 | 11:19AM PT \nSweet Christmas! “Marvel’s Luke Cage ” is officially getting a second season. \nNetflix announced the news on the show’s Twitter and Facebook pages on Sunday, posting a short video that featured a sign in Pop’s Barber Shop reading “Season 2 coming soon.” The posts are also accompanied by Pop’s own motto, which Luke Cage takes to heart in Season 1: “Always forward.” \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \n“Luke Cage” is now the third Marvel show to get a second season on the streaming platform. “Daredevil” was first to be renewed for a second season, and has also received the greenlight for a third. “Jessica Jones” was also renewed after its critically acclaimed freshman season. Related ‘Marvel’s Luke Cage’ Star Mike Colter on Why Netflix Show Is ‘Inclusively Black’ \nNext up in Netflix’s Marvel universe are “Iron Fist” and the crossover “The Defenders,” which will combine all four superheros that had their own shows on Netflix. A release date for “Luke Cage” Season 2 was not announced on Sunday. \nSeason 1 of “Luke Cage” was well received by critics and fans alike. In her review, Variety ‘s Maureen Ryan said , “Nothing is cooler than watching bullets bounce off Luke Cage as he brings the ruckus and schools all the fools.” \nMike Colter plays the titular bulletproof superhero in “Luke Cage,” which also starred Rosario Dawson, Mahershala Ali, Simone Missick, Theo Rossi, and Alfre Woodard. Colter will also star in “The Defenders,” along with Charlie Cox, Krysten Ritter, and Finn Jones. Filed Under: ",

A short animation, some news, and that's it.

      "text": "E-mail \nNetflix introduced the ability to download content so you can watch it offline on mobile devices this week, which is fantastic news for subscribers to the streaming platform, as it now means you can do things like watching content on slower connections where streaming isn’t ideal or save things to watch on a long-haul flight! \nTo help people deal with storage demands on their mobile devices, as well as save on bandwidth for both their uploads and your downloads, they’ve started to deploy a new codec . While streaming, they still exclusively use H.264/AVC, but when it comes to downloads on Android, it’s their new VP9 codec, which is an open source video codec created by Google, allowing for same video quality while reducing data usage! \nWhile you would think it makes sense to use that everywhere, not every device supports it. Android is the obvious starting place, as Google obviously support their own codec. Apple on the other hand? No support for VP9 at all, and no sign they’ll be doing so anytime soon. Netflix is helping other devices by using their H.264/AVC High encoding profile for downloads on no VP9 devices, while still using their AVC Main encoding on streaming. They even go as far to use slightly different encoding per show/movie, helping them reduce their data overheads even further. While downloads are chopped up and each one-to-three minute part is encoded in the most optimal format, very clever. \nAll this is a lot of work, bu tit saves them and you around 37% of bandwidth on average for a video, without them looking different to the end user. Faster streaming, smaller downloads, less data usage, same quality!",

And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Comments The Mike Colter-starring superhero web series is confirmed to return for another season following a well-received season 1. \nNetflix can't get enough of \" Luke Cage \". The streaming service officially announces that they have picked up the Marvel series for a second season. \"Always forward,\" the show quotes the hero's signature phrase when breaking the news on Twitter and teasing that the sophomore set is \"coming soon.\"  Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \"Luke Cage\" became the first ever black superhero series. It premiered on September 30 and Netflix went down soon afterwards. It's unclear whether the problem was caused by \"Luke Cage\" overload, but fans who wanted to binge-watch the Mike Colter -starring show called out the streaming service over the hitch. \"Luke Cage\" is the third Marvel series on Netflix. \" Daredevil \" starring Charlie Cox came out first before \" Marvel's Jessica Jones \" starring Krysten Ritter followed. The next series will focus on Marvel's Iron Fist starring Finn Jones before those four outsiders will team up in one big ensemble called \" The Defenders \". \n© AceShowbiz.com",

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix   7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Subscribe to KEAN 105 on As far back as I can remember, I’ve been a sucker for movies where soldiers fight monsters. Aliens . Predator . Starship Troopers . Dog Soldiers . Heck, even mediocre films like Battle: Los Angeles are the cinematic equivalent of catnip to me. Take a group of hardened soldiers, throw them into a paranormal environment, and sit back and enjoy as the bullets start flying and everything falls apart. It’s like the best of war movies and the best of monster movies, all swirled together in one high-octane bundle of crazy. So yeah, I’m all in on Netflix ’s upcoming science fiction thriller Spectral . As pointed out by the folks over at /Film , Spectral is more a misplaced theatrical release than a direct-to-video production, with Universal Pictures pulling the film from its release calendar back in June of this year. Despite this vote of no-confidence by Universal, there are still reasons to get excited. Spectral was written by the people behind The Bourne Ultimatum and Kong: Skull Island , comes with a brand new score from Mad Max: Fury Road composer Junkie XL , and even has some A-list special effects work courtesy of Peter Jackson ’s Weta Workshop. Deadline broke the news last month that Netflix had snapped up the rights and would be releasing it just in time for the holidays. Here is the full plot synopsis for Spectral courtesy of the Deadline piece: A brilliant DARPA scientist embarks on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a battle-scarred, war-torn city, where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilian deaths. Spectral stars James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer , Bruce Greenwood , and Max Martini and will be made available globally by Netflix on December 9.",

      "text": "“Luke Cage” Renewed For Season 2  10 pm \nNetflix announced on Sunday that it has renewed the Marvel drama “Luke Cage” for a second season. \nThe series is Marvel’s third drama for Netflix and the third to get a renewal, joining “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones” which both have a third and second season on the way respectively. A fourth, “Iron Fist,” is due in 2017 alongside the mashup series “The Defenders”. \nWhat’s not clear is when season two will debut. With the crowded Marvel-Netflix landscape it’s likely “Luke Cage” Season 2 won’t hit until 2018 at the earliest. \nThe series’ first season scored solid reviews for its first half but the second half was decidedly less well received. \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 SHARE",

Smith), and Wolfgang (Max Riemelt) — who are “finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself,” according to a Netflix press release. \nSeason 2, which premieres May 5 at 3:01 a.m. ET with 10 new episodes, will pick up at the end of season 1’s events as the Sensates find themselves on the run from Whispers (Terrence Mann) after coming together physically. Questioning their identity, the eight are trying to find a way to survive and protect each other along the way. ",

      "text": "pixabay.com/stux Stay on target Netflix May Come In Pill Form One Day North Korean workers given crystal meth to speed construction Magic mushrooms might join ecstasy as a potential treatment for a bevy of mental illnesses. Psilocybin, the active chemical in shrooms, can cause feelings of warmth, happiness, as well as some hallucinations. Due to their psychoactive effects, they’ve been illegal in the US for over 40 years, but now researchers have started giving them a second look.\nA new study, published Thursday , shows that mushrooms could be effective in treating anxiety and depression. The study followed cancer patients who were struggling not only with the physical effects of cancer, but the emotional toll terminal illnesses can take. After a few sessions, 80 percent of the participants showed statistically significant improvement.\nAbout half of all new cancer patients suffer from anxiety and depression as a direct result of their diagnosis. Even worse, is that most don’t respond to standard antidepressants. In the 1950s, psilocybin and a variety of other hallucinogens were gaining traction in psychological research. But, as a result of the Nixon administration’s attempt to deal significant blows to anti-war counter-culture, research for many of these substances became prohibitively expensive.\nResearchers can still do studies with illegal drugs, but they face a lot of limitations and restrictions and compliance with DEA security standards (to prevent the drugs from getting out of the lab or hospital where the study takes place) costs a lot of money. That cost has kept scientists from exploring these treatments for the past few decades, but, now, out of options for many traditional forms of therapy, interest is rising in the medical applications of psychedelics.\nThe study’s authors say the floodgates have been opened for research into treatments using criminalized substances. And part of that comes from just how stark these results have been. There’s always been, at least for me, a stigma against people who claim that weed can cure cancer or whatever else. These substances are by no means miraculous, but with legitimate, well-constructed research behind them, they could dramatically improve many lives.\n“Psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression,” the study says. “And led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual well-being, and increased quality of life… sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death.”\nHere’s hoping that more research gets greenlit. There’s a lot of potential good here for those fighting the toughest battles of their lives.",

      "text": "Fans probably sensed it coming. On Saturday, Netflix announced dates not only for the second season of its original series \" Sense8 ,\" but gifted viewers with a Christmas special.\nThe Christmas special will be available to stream December 23, and the second season of the sci-fi show will premiere on May 5, 2017.\nSure, the two-hour Christmas special is just around the corner, but some fans felt that May was too long to wait for those who'd perhaps binged the entire 12-episode season back in June 2015.\n\"Sense8\" is an Emmy-nominated sci-fi drama from \" Babylon 5 \" creator J. Michael Straczynski and \" The Matrix \" creators Lana and Lilly Wachowski, although BuzzFeed reported in May that Lilly would be stepping back from the second season. It focuses on eight strangers from around the world who find out they are \"sensates,\" humans who are mentally and emotionally linked.\n ",

Marvel’s hit TV series, Luke Cage will return for a second season. Marvel and Netflix confirmed the news earlier today, with a new video on the show’s official Twitter account, which you can check out below. \nThe first season debuted last September on Netflix. The first season of the show starred Mike Colter as the titular hero, Simone Missick as Misty Knight, Frank Whaley as Rafael Scarfe, Mahershala Ali as Cottonmouth, Theo Rossi as Shades, Alfre Woodard as Mariah Dillard, and Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple. \nThe first season of Luke Cage is currently available to stream on Netflix. Mike Colter will next appear as Cage in the upcoming eight-part series, The Defenders , which is due out in 2017. The second season of Luke Cage does not yet have a release date. But with 2017 set to feature the premieres of Iron Fist , The Defenders , and The Punisher , a new season of Luke Cage would likely not debut until 2018 at the very earliest.",

      "text": "It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button.\nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go.\nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content.\nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title.\nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.”",

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix   4:14 PM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Netflix’s LUKE CAGE To Get A Second Season Hopefully they'll give him something to do this time. By Evan Saathoff Dec. 04, 2016 \nI guess some things are just inevitable. And one of them is that a Netflix Marvel show will get a second season. In other words, it’s not all that surprising that we’re going to get a Luke Cage season two. — Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) December 4, 2016 \nSome of you really liked Luke Cage , so this is obviously good news for you folks. For me, it at least gives me incentive to finally finish season one at some point in the future. I tapped out around episode nine. Maybe now I’ll finally have a reason to trudge through the rest. \nIt’ll be a while before we actually see season two, of course. Up next for those wacky Marvel Netflix people is Iron Fist . After that, we’ll finally get the big Defenders shebang, which at only eight episodes is something I’m super looking forward to. I suppose Jessica Jones and The Punisher will follow soon after. It’s Marvel’s world. We just live in it (and get to enjoy watching it for the most part). Related Product:",

      "title": "Marvel’s Luke Cage Will Be Getting A Second Season On Netflix",
      "text": "Marvel’s Luke Cage Will Be Getting A Second Season On Netflix  13 PST \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nSo far Netflix and Marvel are three for three in terms of their TV shows. Daredevil was a resounding success, along with Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. This is why it doesn’t really come as a surprise to learn that Luke Cage will be getting its second season , as confirmed by the official Luke Cage Twitter account. \nHowever there is no mention of what the plot will be and when the second season will premiere, and given that Netflix has their plate full with the other Marvel TV series, we reckon fans of Luke Cage might be in for a wait. What do we mean by this? Basically in 2017 we’ll be seeing the release of Iron Fist . It has also been confirmed that the Punisher will be released in 2017 , plus The Defenders mini-series to take into consideration. \nLet’s not forget that Daredevil has been renewed for a third season and Jessica Jones season 2 has also been confirmed . This basically means that there are at least five Marvel TV shows on Netflix that have yet to debut ahead of the second season of Luke Cage. Netflix has stated earlier this year that they want to release their Marvel shows faster , so maybe instead of getting 2 new Marvel shows a year, we could be looking at 3, which will definitely cut down the backlog. \nFiled in General .

      "text": "Photo via Marvel/Twitter It's 'coming soon.' \nHere’s an early Christmas gift for TV fans, with confirmation straight from Marvel itself— Luke Cage is returning to Netflix for its second season. That makes it a trio of Marvel properties that have garnered enough success on Netflix to earn second seasons, with Luke Cage joining Daredevil and Jessica Jone s. And it’s yet another sign that Netflix ’s gamble to directly finance shows and bypass broadcast TV altogether is paying off in a big way. \nAt about 2pm ET on Sunday, the official Marvel Twitter account announced the news in an understated way but one instantly recognizable to fans of the series—with the words “Season 2 Coming Soon” lit in neon in the window of Pop’s Barber Shop. The actual text in the tweet, of course: “Always forward.” — Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) December 4, 2016 Luke Cage drew rave reviews for its first season, and it quickly established itself as one of Marvel's small-screen hits. Many fans were particularly enthusiastic at having a comic with a predominantly black cast, and an iconic black protagonist , get the Netflix treatment. \nUnfortunately, if you're already getting juiced to see what season 2 will bring, the release date hasn't been made public just yet (and as fans of Daredevil and Jessica Jones know, the waiting game can take a while ). Hopefully it'll come around sooner rather than later.",

As you can see, Marvel has confirmed that the series will return, but a premiere date has yet to be announced.\nJessica Jones was also renewed for a second season shortly after hitting the online streaming service, but it wasn't released this year and won't be with us during 2017 as the likes of Iron Fist , The Punisher , and The Defenders are on the way instead. So, while we'll see Luke Cage in the latter, we may have a couple of years to wait before getting to see Power Man set off on another solo adventure in Harlem!\nWhat would you guys like to see in season two of Luke Cage ?

      "text": "Netflix gives 'Luke Cage' a second season More evidence that Marvel's online-only shows have a big audience. Save Steve Sands/GC Images \nMarvel must be feeling glad that it bet on a slew of internet-only superhero shows -- Netflix has confirmed that it's renewing Luke Cage for a second season. There's no mention of a date for the new episodes (the teaser's \"always forward\" is a nod to Pop's motto), but the mere mention of more Cage is likely enough for now. \nIt's surprising that the news didn't come sooner, if we're honest. The gritty series has been well-received by both critics and fans, and there was even a temptation to pin an outage on the show's debut (though it wasn't likely the cause). The big question: will Iron Fist , The Punisher and The Defenders carry the torch as well as Luke Cage , Daredevil and Jessica Jones have so far? The track record suggests yes, but there will always be concerns that the hot streak might end due to either a flop or viewers tired of non-stop Marvel programming.",

As  Variety  reports , this makes  Luke Cage , the story about a bulletproof black man putting on for the city of Harlem, the third Marvel series to receive a second season order ( Daredevil &apos;s second season premiered in early 2016, while season 2 of  Jessica Jones  doesn&apos;t have a release date, but might end up dropping in 2018 (considering that Marvel&apos;s Netflix line-up already features the first seasons of  Iron Fist ,  The Defenders , and  The Punisher ).\nWhen we spoke to  Luke Cage  showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker back in September , we specifically asked him if there were any plans for a second season. \"If you&apos;ve heard anything, please tell me\" was his response, which was echoed whenever anyone asked about it, and judging by his tweet about the news, he&apos;s just as ecstatic as the multitude of  Luke Cage  fans around the globe.\nSweet Christmas arrived 21 days early! Season Two coming soon! Forward....Always.\n— Cheo Hodari Coker ( @cheo_coker ) December 4, 2016 There&apos;s a lot that  Luke Cage  left hanging at the end of season 1; Luke was on his way back to jail after the massive Seagate breakout. Mariah Dillard and Shades were left walking the street, down to continue working the angles. Willis Stryker (a.k.a. Diamondback) was left beaten, but not dead, so it&apos;s likely he&apos;ll be gunning for Luke some time soon. Claire Temple was holding out for her man, but also grabbing a flyer for Colleen Wing&apos;s defense class, which leads right into  Iron Fist  (as Wing is one of Iron Fist&apos;s friends).\nThe fact of the matter is, we could very well see  Iron Fist ,  The Defenders , and  Jessica Jones  happening before  Luke Cage  returns for his second season; that&apos;s a helluva lot of Marvel to run through, and could change everything for where we&apos;ll see Luke in a few years.\nAt least Pop&apos;s Barber Shop is still standing. Hopefully the swear jar  and naming episodes after Gang Starr song titles are back in effect.\n  Marvel Comics , Netflix , Luke Cage , Marvel Cinematic Universe",

      "text": "Carter Lee \nSome of the best psychological movies can be found on Netflix during December 2016. Sometimes Netflix viewers want movies to make them laugh, or to make them cry, and sometimes they want titles to make them think. The movies listed below are either favorites of Netflix subscribers or by critics, and they are all available during December 2016. The Best Psychological Movies On Netflix For December 2016 \nRed Lights \nThough critics panned this movie, Netflix audiences have rated it above three stars (out of five). Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver star in this X-Files- esque thriller about psychic phenomena. Fox News explains why this is one of the best psychosomatic movies on Netflix for December 2016 . \n“Gimmicks and all, ‘Red Lights’ is an astute psychological puzzle that flows…Writer and director Rodrigo Cortés (‘Buried’) gives us a sophisticated, yet uneven, game of cat and mouse – an entertaining debate between science and the paranormal. [It] keeps us guessing to the very end – and with a film like this, you can’t really ask for much more.” \nThe Perfect Host \nDavid Hyde Pierce played a psychiatrist in Frasier , and in this film he portrays a man in desperate need of one. The less a viewer knows about this film the better, and if you like your movies with mystery and dark comedy then look no further. [Image by Magnolia Pictures] \nBlink \nA blind woman receives a transplant that allows her to see again. She then witnesses a murder and is soon stalked by a serial killer, but with her site not being 100 percent, she learns that she can’t always trust what she sees. \nNightcrawler \nEdgy, suspenseful, and dark, Nightcrawler is one of the most thought provoking movies on Netflix. Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly portrays a man who makes his living as an L.A. crime journalist. But as the line becomes blurred on reporting news and creating it, he becomes the star of his own story. \nWe Need To Talk About Kevin \nThis film has an impressive rating of four out of five stars by subscribers, and Rotten Tomatoes explains why this is one of the best movies on Netflix for December 2016 . \n“A suspenseful and gripping psychological thriller, Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin explores the factious relationship between a mother and her son. Tilda Swinton, in a bracing, tour-de-force performance, plays the mother, Eva, as she contends for 15 years with the increasing malevolence of her first-born child, Kevin (Ezra Miller). Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, We Need to Talk About Kevin explores nature vs. nurture on a whole new level as Eva’s own culpability is measured against Kevin’s innate evilness.” \nExam \nSome of the best independent movies can be found on Netflix, and judging by subscribers’ ratings and the critics, this deserves to be on that list. \nThe Forgotten \nIf you like movies that leave you with more questions than answers, then you will most likely enjoy The Forgotten . Julianne Moore portrays a mother searching for the disappearance of her son, even though her psychiatrist claims she is delusional and he never existed. \nThe Machinist \nIf you have ever wondered what insomnia can lead to, or what Christian Bale looks like thin, then look no further. Bale portrays a man that has trouble sleeping, then he has an accident at work, and then he starts seeing people who aren’t there. The Machinist is one of the most compelling movies on Netflix. \nThe Scapegoat \nTwo men who are very opposite have one thing in common—a face. When a man gets his identity stolen from his doppelganger, he resumes the life of the man who stole it. But his new image comes with some complications, including family secrets that could prove fatal. \nThe Da Vinci Code \nIn one of his most controversial movies, Tom Hanks stars in this fun adventure filled with mystery and intrigue. Tune into the mystery soon because The Da Vinci Code leaves Netflix on December 14. [Image by Columbia Pictures]",

      "text": "Netflix (Finally) Adds Offline Viewing Netflix (Finally) Adds Offline Viewing Choose from a number of TV shows and movies available to download. \nNo Internet? No problem. Netflix subscribers can now download content to watch offline. \nThe latest app update includes a download button on the details page of a movie or TV series. \nVisit the \"Available for Download\" option in the left-hand menu, or just take your chances looking for available content. Then click the downward-facing arrow to save and watch the video later—on the subway, during a camping trip, or in that basement dead zone. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, said in an announcement. \nThe feature is included in all plans, and accessible for Android- or iOS-based phones and tablets. You'll need a device running iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later, as well as plenty of device storage space. \n\"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you're offline,\" Wu added. \nOriginals Orange is The New Black , Narcos , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , and The Crown , as well as popular shows like Bates Motel , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , and Suits , are available for download now. Or save Sicario , Good Will Hunting , and Blackfish for that long drive to the in-laws' this holiday season. \nBulk download options and viewing times vary based on individual licensing agreements. For some, offline watching must be completed within 48 hours of pressing play; expiration dates can be found on the \"My Downloads\" page of the Netflix app. In some cases, the company may limit the number of titles one user can load onto their device at a time. Still in its infancy, the new feature may require some personal trial and error. \nNetflix often cites its belief in the ubiquity of high-speed Internet as the reason for its reluctance to add offline viewing. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos earlier this month hinted at the new function—perhaps in an effort to keep up with streaming rival Amazon Video . \nAmazon became the first online streaming service to support offline viewing when it launched the ability to download select movies and TV episodes from Prime Video to iOS and Android devices in September last year. In contrast with Netflix—which is rolling this out globally—Amazon initially offered the option to viewers in the US, Germany, and the UK. ",

A release date for “Luke Cage” Season 2 was not announced on Sunday.\nSeason 1 of “Luke Cage” was well received by critics and fans alike. In her review, Variety ‘s Maureen Ryan said , “Nothing is cooler than watching bullets bounce off Luke Cage as he brings the ruckus and schools all the fools.”\nMike Colter plays the titular bulletproof superhero in “Luke Cage,” which also starred Rosario Dawson, Mahershala Ali, Simone Missick, Theo Rossi, and Alfre Woodard. Colter will also star in “The Defenders,” along with Charlie Cox, Krysten Ritter, and Finn Jones.\nRelated stories\nNetflix Announces 'Sense8' Christmas Special and Season 2 Premiere Dates\nHow Netflix Delivers Better-Looking Downloads Without Eating Up All Your Phone Storage\nNetflix Picks Up 'One in a Billion' Basketball Documentary About NBA's First Player From India\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

On Sunday, the TV show's Twitter account announced that Luke Cage has been renewed for a second season via a video featuring Pop's Barber Shop and the news flashing in neon in the window. So when will Luke Cage Season 2 premiere ? The announcement did not include an exact return date for the series, which stars Mike Colter as the title character. The show debuted to rave reviews in September, so usual Netflix premiere date prediction formula would let me say that it's likely to expect Season 2 to bow a year from now, but Luke Cage is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and that makes it trickier to predict. \nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe's Netflix world also includes Jessica Jones , Daredevil , and the upcoming Iron Fist, which debuts in March 2017. These heroes are set to unite in the limited eight-episode miniseries The Defenders in 2017, which has caused both Jessica Jones Season 2 and Daredevil Season 3 to be pushed to 2018 , according to Screen Crush. The publication didn't specify a reason for the delay, only that the news came from Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos at the Summer TCA press tour. Entertainment Weekly writer Natalie Abrams also confirmed Netflix's order of release on Twitter .

But Luke Cage, Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Daredevil (Charlie Cox), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) will all appear in The Defenders to ease the wait for more Marvel on Netflix. \nImages: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix; LukeCage /Twitter Must Reads ",

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again. As just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements: a short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season, as well as the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting to fans about the teaser is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \nOther Links From TVGuide.com Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",

      "text": "Luke Cage Is Getting a Second Season from Marvel and Netflix Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 4, 2016 at 7:26 PM TV Guide \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again. As just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements: a short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season, as well as the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. Always forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nWhat's most interesting to fans about the teaser is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke (Mike Colter) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders, which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next... \n  Marvel's Luke CageMike Colter About Us",
