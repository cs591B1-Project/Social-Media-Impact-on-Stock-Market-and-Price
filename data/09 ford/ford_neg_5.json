      "title": "Why Donald Trump's NAFTA Plan Will Cost Ford and General Motors Billions",
      "text": "Will Donald Trump follow through on his threat to shut down imports from Mexico?\nRight now, it's not clear exactly what kinds of programs President-elect Trump will choose to push once he takes office, or how far he'll be able to get with some of his more outside-the-box ideas.\nIt seems pretty clear, though, that he'll try to deliver in some way on one of his most frequently repeated promises: to renegotiate or dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nIf he succeeds, that will be a costly headache for Ford Motor Company ( NYSE:F ) , General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) , and just about all of the other big global automakers. Here's why.\nGM's factory in Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico builds Chevrolet Silverados and other GM trucks. It's one of many Mexican auto factories that currently send vehicles to the United States. Image source: General Motors.\nWhat Trump has promised to do about NAFTA First, let's look at what President Trump might try to do. In his 7-point trade plan , Trump said that if elected, he would:\nTell NAFTA partners that we intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. If they don't agree to a renegotiation, we will submit notice that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the deal. Eliminate Mexico's one-side backdoor tariff through the VAT and end sweatshops in Mexico that undercut U.S. workers.\nTrump also, famously, castigated automakers generally and Ford in particular for building new factories in Mexico and not in the United States. He even suggested that he'd try to enact a 35% tax on vehicles imported from Mexico.\nOne way or another, it seems clear that Trump will try to end free trade between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. That means (again, if he's successful) that vehicles coming into the U.S. from Mexico would face a tariff, probably a steep one.\nThat would disrupt a lot of commerce, and impact a lot of automakers.\nThere are a lot of vehicles coming into the U.S. from Mexico Since official reports of exports and imports are tallied in terms of financial value, it can be hard to tell exactly how many cars and trucks are imported into the U.S. from other countries.\nBut we know there are a lot of them: According to figures from the Mexican Automotive Industry Association, about 79% of the 2.9 million vehicles built in Mexico this year through October were exported. About 86% of those exports, just under 2 million, went to North America, and the vast majority of those were sent to the U.S.\nThere are more coming: According to a recent report from the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), new factories that are under construction in Mexico will push the country's total production capacity over 5 million vehicles a year sometime in 2018.\nThose factories are getting built because right now, it makes very good business sense for American automakers to build cars and trucks in Mexico and then import them into the U.S.\nWhy automakers have been building factories in Mexico The list of auto factories in Mexico is a long one, and it has been growing quickly in recent years. Just since 2014, Mazda , Honda , Volkswagen and Audi , and Hyundai and Kia have all opened plants in Mexico. There are more on the way: Ford, Nissan , BMW , Volvo, and Toyota all have Mexican factories under construction or in the works now. They'll join GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( NYSE:FCAU ) , and other vehicle manufacturers that have had factories in Mexico for several years.\nBut why Mexico? Lower-cost labor is part of the story, but there's quite a bit more to it:\nFree trade with other countries: Thanks to free-trade deals, exports from Mexico are exempt from tariffs in 44 other countries, including the European Union (counted as one \"country\"), versus just 20 from the United States. That makes it an appealing base for any company that wants to produce goods (global small-car models, for instance) for export. Free trade with the U.S. -- and easy shipping: One of those 44 countries is the world's second-largest auto market, the United States. Because it shares a huge border with Mexico, shipping vehicles from Mexican factories to U.S. dealers is relatively simple and inexpensive. Lower-cost, but highly qualified, workers: Yes, Mexican workers are paid less, averaging a little over $8 an hour in wages and benefits while their American counterparts make about $46. But they're also well-qualified: Mexico has made huge strides toward an educated workforce, with over 90,000 engineers and technicians graduating annually. Robust existing infrastructure: The number of factories already operating in Mexico means that the country has a rich network of suppliers, logistics firms, and other resources that automakers seek. Mexico also has good deep-water ports on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, facilitating longer-distance exports. Long story short: If you're manufacturing vehicles that can be sold in many global markets -- in particular, small cars, small SUVs, and heavy trucks -- and you do business in the U.S., there's a strong business case for building those vehicles in Mexico.\nBut that business case changes in a hurry if NAFTA goes away and the U.S. imposes tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles.\nHow a tariff would put Mexican-made cars at a huge disadvantage in the U.S. While Mexico's free-trade agreements and established infrastructure are a big part of why automakers are attracted to Mexico, the cost advantage is real. But it might not be as large as you think.\nHere's a real-world example. For a while, Ford built Fusions for the U.S. market in two factories, one in Michigan and one in Mexico. Not everything is cheaper in Mexico: Labor and locally made parts cost less, but some other things (including shipping to U.S. dealers) cost more. Overall, CAR estimated that the Fusions built in Mexico cost Ford $1,200 less per car than the ones built in Michigan.\nThat difference in cost is profit for Ford -- or looked at another way, it's margin that Ford can use to price the Fusion more aggressively, as it is doing now.\nAt the moment, competition in the Fusion's segment (midsize sedans) is fierce. The Fusion's average transaction price is about $22,500 right now, according to J.D. Power data made available to The Motley Fool. That's still higher than the average of the Fusion's competitors (about $21,800), reflecting Ford's pricing discipline and the fact that the Fusion was recently revamped.\nThe Ford Fusion is one of many familiar vehicles made in Mexico for the U.S. market. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\nBut Ford probably isn't making a ton of money on Fusions at that price, even Mexican-built ones. Profit margins on individual products are closely held secrets, but we can estimate that Ford's overall profit margin on the Fusion is probably around 8% right now, or in the neighborhood of $1,800 per car. (Its profit margins on smaller vehicles are almost certainly thinner.)\nA 35% tariff would add an average of $7,875 per car, leaving Ford deep in the hole. Ford can't just pass that on to consumers, because the Fusion competes (fiercely) with vehicles made in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even adding a few thousand dollars to its price would drop it out of consideration for a lot of potential buyers.\nSo why can't Ford just live with the $1,200-per-car cost disadvantage and make those Fusions in the U.S.?\nWhy the Detroit automakers don't want to build new U.S. factories The short answer is that Ford doesn't have room: Most of Ford's U.S. factories, and those of its rivals, are running near full capacity. Most are making (more profitable) trucks, SUVs, or luxury vehicles. (Ford no longer makes Fusions in Michigan; that assembly line now builds more-profitable Lincoln Continentals instead.)\nIf Ford was forced to build Fusions in the U.S., it would have to build a new factory. But here's the thing about auto factories: They cost a lot of money no matter how busy they are, and the market for new cars is cyclical .\nIt can cost a billion dollars or more to build a new auto factory -- but that's just the beginning. The industry rule of thumb is that an auto factory becomes profitable when it's at or over 80% of \"capacity,\" which in the industry's lingo means two shifts working five days a week. Most of Ford's (and GM's, and Fiat Chrysler's) U.S. factories are at or above capacity right now, because the U.S. new-car market is very strong. That's why Detroit's profit margins in North America have been so high.\nFiat 500s at an FCA factory in Toluca, Mexico. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\nBut it won't last. Remember, history shows us that the new-car market is cyclical. In fact, we're probably past the peak of the current cycle , which means that sales (and therefore production) will drop at some point.\nBy limiting the number of factories it operates, and running them flat-out when times are good, Ford (and GM, and the others) can keep most of them above that break-even line when sales drop, as in a recession.\nIf the recession is prolonged or severe enough, some will fall below that 80%-of-capacity break-even line. When that happens, a U.S. factory will lose more money per day than a Mexican factory, because its fixed costs (including labor) are higher.\nAlso, because of Mexico's network of free-trade agreements, it's possible that Ford (or whoever) could keep a Mexican factory above break-even during a steep U.S. recession, by building products for export to some of those 43 other markets with which Mexico has free-trade deals. That's harder to do from the United States.\nThe upshot: An end to NAFTA would be expensive and disruptive To sum up: Right now, if the automakers are going to build factories to supply the U.S. market, it makes much more sense to build them in Mexico instead of the U.S.\nChanging that by taxing vehicles imported from Mexico, as President-elect Trump has said he will do, would force the automakers to spend billions on new U.S. factories, depleting their cash reserves and exacerbating their losses when the economy turns south.\nIt would increase the costs of manufacturing small and midsize mass-market vehicles for the U.S. market. Some of those costs would be passed on to consumers, making the least-expensive new vehicles more expensive than they are now.\nOn the other hand, it would create U.S. manufacturing jobs -- assuming the automakers don't find ways to bring the cars in from elsewhere, or to increase the use of automation in their existing factories.\nWill it be worth it? We may find out.",

      "text": "QR Code Link to This Post 2000 Ford Excursion 7.3 liter Powerstroke Diesel Limited Green with gold/bronze trim, Grey leather interior Three row seating, back row removable, middle row folds flat (will fit 4x8 sheet) Stock with 8 person seating capacity (potential to fit 9 if front console is changed to console seat) Heated front seats & mirrors, power driver's seat, mirrors, & windows. All stock except for muffler, shocks, steering stabilizer, engine air intake, wheels/tires, and added Hellwig 1.25\" rear sway bar. Muffler changed to a Walker BTM (big truck muffler) Shocks are Rancho RS8000 adjustable & Rancho RS5500 stabilizer Air intake changed to a large canister filter with sock cover (sometimes called Tymar) Wheels are 2004 Ford Super Duty 18\" Harley Davidson Edition stock wheels (hub-centric per factory spec.) Front hub were replaced as well as the passengers side glow plug relay (which is also the valve cover gasket). The four door actuators need replacement. Rear door lock actuator was replaced. AC was discharged because of a hole in a rear line (rubbed on leaf spring mount). Did not get repaired because we never really used the AC. The Excursion is an SUV but it is on an F-250 Super Duty frame, suspension, and running gear. It has rigid axles with leaf spring suspension front and back. This ensures full-size truck capabilities but with vastly increased interior capacity and the same wheel base as a standard cab long bed truck. It has wear & tear of 104K miles and 16 years but nothing significant inside or out. Drivers seat has wrinkles in the leather and the steering wheel grey is worn to black in the regular places. No tears or holes in leather. Outside has some chips, some light scratches, & a couple dings. The worst are 2 hood chips that have grown to about nickel size. I have a few ounce bottle of green, haven't gotten to fixing hood chips. Will consider trade option for a 4x4 tractor with loader, (maybe sub-compact or a little bigger) backhoe attachment desirable, 4-door Jeep Wrangler. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5829174050",

The only reason it's for sale is because I have a tko600 that's been faceplated. Which is sorta the same thing. Just more extensive. I just had the whole Trans gone thru this past week.

He rebuilt this truck with lots of new parts, so we could use it to haul a large camper with ease and then we sold the camper and never needed the truck. Anyways, its been repainted with a real nice paint job inside and out in Ford White color about 3 years ago. He also took it down to the frame and painted the frame itself and everything that bolts to the frame such as; rear-end, springs, shocks, everything, it looks new. It has pretty much been parked in the garage with an occasional trip to the dump to keep fresh gas in it. To list some of the new parts; radiator and hoses, belt, battery and battery terminals, plugs, wire, distributor cap, thermostat, windshield wipers, all new tie rods, new calipers, rotors, brake pads, wheel bearings and seals, steering box, power steering pump, new gas shocks on the front, new heavy duty air bags on the rear with electric air pump-you can adjust the air bags from inside the cab, all new U-Joints, both drive shafts were repainted, two new fuel pumps and one new gas tank, all new weather stripping for doors and windows, 2 new electric window motors, sliding back window and adjustable sliding mirrors, 2 new electric door locks, new catalytic converter new heavy duty real truck muffler, and a very nice new Pioneer CD Player, all new lenses, 2 new headlight assembly's, all new bulbs, new chrome emblems, new rubber bed mat, new plastic bed rail protectors, nice chrome tie down hooks and probably more. The truck is rust free and was rust free before being painted, good tires, runs and drives like a new truck. AC, PB, PS, and a tow package. Duel gas tanks with locking gas caps. He put a lot of these new parts in because we wanted a nice dependable truck to travel in although the other parts were not worn out either. We bought this truck in Medford about 10 to 12 years ago from a dealership. We were told that the gentleman that owned it traded it in for a new truck and he was the original buyer/owner of this truck. The truck had roughly 68,000 miles on it when we bought it. The interior is in nice shape other than a little wear on the drivers seat from getting in and out. When we wash this truck and take it out we get a lot of compliments. It is a real nice truck. We don't use it much anymore. He just pulled it out and sprayed it off, but he still has to wash it good. and then he will put new pictures on here. He may not even wash it until someone is serious and wants to purchase it. It runs GOOD. He is not interested in no trades of any kind. Sorry.",

      "text": "2016 Ford Explorer Test Drive and Review Boxy is back! Updated May 31, 2015 . About.com Rating \nThe original Ford Explorer is one of the vehicles credited with kicking off the SUV craze in America, but in the last few years, the Explorer has fallen by the wayside. The previous iteration featured a useful interior, but its strange exterior styling didn't do it any favors. \nNow Ford is back with an updated Explorer, and they haven't just made a few minor changes: The new Explorer has a new look, a new driving demeanor, new techno-gadgetry, and even a couple of new engines, with EPA fuel economy estimates ranging from 16 to 19 MPG in the city and 22 to 28 on the highway. The Chicago-built Explorer is covered by a 3-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty with 5 years or 60,000 miles of powertrain coverage. So is the Explorer ready to retake its crown as the standard-setter for full-size SUVs? Let's drive it and find out. \nFirst Glance: Looks good, like an Explorer should \nI liked the previous-generation Ford Explorer … sort-of. It had roomy back seats and a spacious cargo area, both of which are SUV must-haves in my book. The driving experience was okay; not great, just okay. But what I couldn’t get over was the styling. Maybe it’s because of my age; I can remember when the first Explorer hit the market, and to me, Explorers will always be boxy, practical things. The outgoing Explorer’s wacky looks made it hard for me to take seriously. \nFord has re-done the Explorer for 2016, and while there are a lot of improvements—including to areas I didn’t think could be improved—my favorite change is the styling. I’m not a fan of conservative design—I like strange-looking vehicles like the Nissan Juke and Fiat 500L —but I think the 2016 Explorer’s blockier shape is a big improvement. The new look is solid and smart, and while there are still some cues from the old design (that reverse-slanted rear window pillar would be very expensive to get rid of), the new Explorer looks like a proper Ford SUV. I see it sitting there and I think, “Now this is a vehicle to which I would entrust the safety of my family.” \nBut there’s more to the 2016 Explorer redesign than a pretty face. Ford has made other updates that improve the Explorer’s practical nature and driver appeal. \nIn the Driver’s Seat: Setting the standard for space \nFor my critique of the interior, let’s start at the back. Most seven-passenger crossover SUVs have useless third-row seats. They’re fine for very small children or for use in a pinch, but for all intents and purposes, these seven-seaters are really five-seat vehicles. Even some of today’s biggest SUVs have lousy way-back seats (I’m looking at you, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL ). But the Explorer’s third row is a pleasant surprise: It’s a real seat, one that you can ask your adult friends to sit in without fear of being subject to a UN war crimes tribunal. And while the second row seats slide fore and aft, you don’t need to move them forward to provide adequate third-row legroom. As someone who sits in the way-back of a lot of SUVs—this is my job, people!—the Explorer’s is one of the best I’ve encountered. \nAnd unlike many SUVs in this size class, using the Explorer's third-row seat doesn't preclude the carrying of cargo: There's still 21 cubic feet of luggage space that reaches deep below the bumper, shaped so as to accommodate medium-size suitcases standing on edge. The third-row seats fold flat into the floor—electrically on higher-trim Explorers and through a well-labeled set of latches and pull-straps on lower-spec models—opening up a generous 43.9 cubic feet. Folding down the second row nearly doubles that to 81.7 cubes. And Ford's kick-to-open liftgate (which requires you to wave your foot under the bumper; you don't actually kick the car, tempting as that may be) is optional. \nMoving forward, the second row is lovely, with big, supportive seats (either a pair of captain’s chairs or a three-seat bench) that offer plenty of legroom. Pricier Explorers get 110 volt outlets for the back seats as well as what Ford calls \"Smart Charging\" USB ports that have the amperage to charge big devices like tablets, ensuring a constant flow of take-it-with-you entertainment for the kids. And Ford's airbag-equipped seatbelts, which offer additional protection for smaller occupants, are an available option. \nAt last we arrive in the front row, where Ford has made only a few subtle changes, most notably the move away from a capacitive touch panel for the stereo and climate controls; they are getting back to good old fashioned buttons. Ford's MyFord Touch system, which controls infotainment and navigation through a four-zone touch screen and buttons on the steering wheel, is no longer standard on lower-spec Explorers. I, like most car critics, find MyFord Touch to have a high learning curve, so this is not the worst news in the world. \nOverall, I found the Explorer's cabin a nice place to be, with top-notch materials and a subtle, relaxing design. One of my few quibbles has to do with the doors: They extend below the Explorer's side sills to the bottom of the body. The advantage of this design is that you're less likely to get dirt on your trousers as you get in; the disadvantage is that if you park the Explorer next to a high curb, you can't get the doors open (and you risk a nasty dent if you try). \nOn the Road: New engines, but I'll take the old one, thanks \nFord offers three engines in the 2016 Explorer. All feature a six-speed automatic transmission and all but the top-of-the-line engine offer a choice of front- or all-wheel-drive. \nOnly the entry-level engine, a 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6, remains unchanged, and while it's EPA fuel economy estimates aren't stellar (17 mpg city/24 mpg highway with front-wheel drive and 16/23 with all-wheel drive), it's actually my favorite engine in the lineup: It's smooth and quiet and provides strong, smooth, even acceleration. \nNew this year is a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine, which replaces last year's 2-liter. EcoBoost is Ford's trade name for their turbocharged and direct-injected engines. The idea is to provide an engine that provides six-cylinder power with four-cylinder fuel economy. The power is certainly there: 280 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque, the latter far more than the 255 lb-ft of the entry-level V6, and aside from a slight hesitation from rest, this engine does indeed pull like a V6. But fuel economy is another story. EPA fuel economy estimates are 19 mpg city and 28 mpg highway (18/26 with all-wheel drive), but in my experience, you'll only see those numbers if you have a very light foot—a very light foot, and maybe not even then. Real-world fuel economy will most likely be similar to the standard V6, so why spend the extra money on the EcoBoost engine? \nEngine number three is Ford's 3.5 liter EcoBoost V6, standard in the Explorer Sport and top-of-the-line Explorer Platinum. Ford designed this engine to do the work of a V8, and that it does, with 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. EPA fuel economy estimates are 16 mpg city and 22 mpg highway with all-wheel drive (your only choice with the 3.5-EcoBoost engine), but unlike the four-cylinder EcoBoost, these are realistic numbers. With so much oomph available, you needn't rely on the power-boosting turbochargers as much as you do with the four-cylinder EcoBoost engine, and that improves real-world fuel economy. Take note, however, that if you want to get as much power as possible out of this engine, you'll need to run it on premium fuel. (It'll work just fine on regular, with a slight reduction in power.) \nFord has changed the Explorer's steering setup for 2016; it now has a slower ratio, which means more movement of the steering wheel is required to turn the car, and that gives it a more relaxed feel on the highway. I like it, as I do the Explorer's comfortable and library-quiet ride. \nThe Explorer comes with a host of optional driver-assistance technologies. Ford pioneered the self-parking car (it's actually a cooperative effort; the driver controls the gas and brakes while the car does the steering.), and the 2016 Explorer gets an updated system that not only does parallel and perpendicular (stall) parking, but also helps the driver get out of those ultra-tight spots into which it is able to squeeze itself. Also new is a side-sensing system that beeps to warn you of objects beside the car that you might not be able to easily see from the driver's seat, such as those concrete posts that protect the pumps at gas stations. This is a useful feature, though one Explorer I sampled seem to be hyperactive; it sounded an alarm whenever I'd pull up next to another car at a stoplight. The Ford engineers thought that particular Explorer was defective, but you might want to try this feature out on your test drive. \nJourney's End: Explorer finds its feet \nOverall, I'm extraordinarily pleased with the new Explorer. After a few lost years, it feels like this well-known SUV has once again found its feet. The new Explorer looks the part, and it sets the standard for interior space, offering true seven-passenger seating with more comfort than most full-size SUVs. \nFord will offer the Explorer in five trim levels: Base, XLT, Limited, Sport, and Platinum. Prices start at a reasonable $31,595 for the Base model but rise to an eye-watering $57,225 for an all-wheel-drive Explorer Platinum with every available option. Over on Ford's Build and Price site , I created an Explorer XLT with the base V6 engine, all-wheel-drive, dual-zone climate control, a dual-pane sunroof, and a Class III trailer-towing package (which allows the Explorer to tow 5,000 lbs), and the total came to $41,405. \nSo what else is out there? I've always liked General Motors'\"Lambda\" SUVs—the Chevrolet Traverse , Buick Encore , and GMC Acadia —but they feel badly dated compared to the Explorer. Chrysler offers the Dodge Durango , an underrated and oft-overlooked SUV that is a great choice if you need to tow a trailer. The Nissan Pathfinder clearly benchmarked the previous-gen Explorer for interior space, and Nissan's reliability is legendary. Most intriguing of all maybe Honda's all-new 2016 Pilot , which comes close to the Explorer for third-row comfort and offers impressive real-world fuel economy. \nThe Explorer faces some stiff competition, but it's certainly well equipped for battle. There was a time when the Explorer was the standard by which other SUVs were judged. Perhaps those days will come again. – Aaron Gold",

      "title": "2014 Ford Explorer Test Drive and Review",
      "text": "2014 Ford Explorer Test Drive and Review Back for more exploring Updated October 01, 2015 . About.com Rating \nNow three years removed from a major makeover, the Ford Explorer returns for 2014 with minor upgrades and changes. Carrying base prices from $29,600 to $40,780 ($45,560 as tested), the seven-passenger Explorer comes with 3-year/36,000-mile basic warranty and a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Let's drive. \nHere's how I start out with the Explorer -- I forget everything I thought I knew about Explorer. That popular body-on-frame, rugged and ubiquitous SUV that helped kick off the SUV craze of the 1990s and continuing through four generations through 2010 shares only a name and a logo with the current unibody crossover vehicle of today -- and that's okay. Today's Explorer is safer, more efficient and more comfortable than the Explorer of old. Explorer is dead; Long live Explorer! \nI last reviewed Explorer back in 2011 , and my opinion hasn't changed much. I still like the way it looks, both outside and inside. Now with a little benefit of a little bit of time, I can confirm that the exterior design is aging quite well. It still looks fresh and contemporary, even if it isn't a tremendously distinctive design it is attractive. Inside, Ford did a great job, and Explorer has a flexible, roomy and even elegant cabin, with genuine comfort in store for all seven passengers. The third row is a decent place to sit, not just a token perch for elementary school students. \nThere are now two engine choices for Explorer: a naturally-aspirated (non-turbo) 3.5-liter V6 that's rated to produce 290 hp and 255 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder EcoBoost engine that cranks out 240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque. The V6 can be ordered with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and the EcoBoost only comes with front-wheel drive. Both engines get six-speed automatic transmissions. The EPA estimates that the V6 4WD will achieve 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway; V6 FWD gets 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway; and the EcoBoost does 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway. My test vehicle was an LTD V6 4WD model. I liked the responsiveness of V6, which gives a nice kick in the pants when called upon to accelerate, yet lopes along comfortably in low-demand situations. Hopping on to the freeway was an effortless affair, and my usual jackrabbit style of city driving was easily accommodated by the eager engine. \nHandling also impresses, as Explorer's relatively low center of gravity (at least compared to the old body-on-frame Explorer) helps give it a planted feel on the road and around the curves. The suspension is a little softer and floatier than I like, but that made for very comfortable travel over city streets and highway expansion joints at the expense of sharp cornering -- a fair tradeoff for the Explorer's intended purpose. \nMy test vehicle was equipped with a $5,425 package of options called \"Equipment Group 302A,\" which included voice activated navigation, luxury seating, powerfold third row seats, a power liftgate, power tilt and telescope steering column, blind spot monitoring, active park assist and more. That is to say, my test vehicle was loaded to the gills with options. Addressing just a few, Ford's active park assist is the best in the biz, in my experience. It's easy to use, accurate and fast. I pride myself on my parallel parking skills, but this system still came in handy in moments of high stress. Blind spot monitoring also has its place, and the LA freeway system is one of them. A subtle visual warning that your blind spot is occupied can save a lot of heartache. \nI was a bit frustrated with the voice activated navigation system, which operates with the SYNC/MyFordTouch interface in the Explorer. No matter how many times I tried to input addresses by voice, I couldn't get the system to recognize my commands accurately. I tried slowing down my speech, over annunciating, talking louder, talking softer -- no matter what I did, the system misinterpreted my wishes. Your results may vary. My best advice, if you select this feature on your Ford, make sure that you get a very thorough training session from your salesperson before you accept delivery of your vehicle, and take the time to really dig in to the instructions and manuals. \nExplorer hasn't stood still, and neither has the competition. Jeep's Grand Cherokee just underwent a major makeover for 2014, and Dodge Durango is scheduled for one, too. Nissan's Pathfinder made the transition from body-on-frame to unibody for 2013. Toyota Highlander is already unibody, and a refresh has been announced for 2014. GM's Chevrolet Traverse / Buick Enclave / GMC Acadia trio also take people-moving very seriously. \nIt's interesting to see where Explorer fits into the Ford/Lincoln universe, where three vehicles share the same platform. The Ford Flex takes the Explorer's three-row layout in a more street-oriented direction, while the Lincoln MKT takes the concept to the extreme in a near-luxury new livery layout. Slicing the market very precisely, Ford seems to have found a place for the Explorer. If you find a space in your garage for an Explorer, you'll have filled it very nicely.",

      "title": "Strong Running 2003 F350 7.3 Diesel 4 Door 4x4 LOTS OF EXTRAS (Whitesboro, TX) $13500",
      "text": "transmission: manual   2003 Ford F350 Super Duty with a Manual transmission and the coveted 7.3 Diesel engine. This was the last year that Ford made the 7.3 and I'm only selling it because I bought a dually. It's running strong and cold starts like it wants to work. 4 Door, 4x4 off-road suspension, 8' long bed, silver with black trim and tinted windows. Been used as a pilot car and an RV and boat transporter. Only 130,000 miles on the engine, and the injectors and transmission are still under warranty by Ford. The odometer has 281k miles on it. Everything from the air intake to the exhaust has been beefed up to last including the turbo and the addition of a South Bend Clutch. It features a custom Power Hungry Performance chip that allows you to switch on the fly with a push of a button including anti-theft settings and it has boost and EGT gauges. Oversize 305/65R18 tires still have plenty of tread left and not only lower the RPMs but the extra width also adds stability and traction. Custom black Moto Metal rims give it a little attitude without going overboard. It does have a few dents on the outside... the bed rails got bent from a faulty 5th wheel hitch a couple years ago and a tree got too close on the right front door :-) ... all are shown in the pictures. Inside the interior features gray cloth front seats that are in excellent condition with no tears, stains, or holes. The center seat folds down to also act as a nice console with cup holders. The back seat is an upgraded dark gray split leather seat that is also in excellent condition and folds down or up for optimal storage options. An inverter is wired directly to one of the batteries that offers three 110 outlets and two USB outlets for keeping electronics charged up going down the road. The AM/FM stereo comes with a CD player or a cassette deck that can also play your phone or laptop's music straight through the truck speakers. Two custom toggle switches can be wired for extra lights. It is currently set up with a custom headache rack that houses red, amber, and white LED lights plus a custom mount for the CB antenna that allows you to point the antenna at different angles, or even put it down when you need the extra clearance. On top, there's a 56\" low-profile light bar that features amber lights plus side and front white alley lights. There's a CB radio and speaker installed inside the truck and a light bar controller that even shows you which lights are coming on and when so that you can customize the pattern. The long bed has hitch rails installed to easily connect a gooseneck plate, 5th wheel hitch, or both at the same time even. Currently there's a gooseneck hitch that can be sold with the truck or separately. I've had this truck for over three years and I've thoroughly enjoyed it and taken care of it. The most I've ever hauled with it was 15,000 pounds but most of what I hauled was in the 2,500 - 7,500 range. I do turn down larger loads which is why I bought the dually and am selling this one. It got oil changes with Mystic (a synthetic blend oil) every 10,000 miles and it was seen by a mechanic for preventive maintenance at least every 25,000 miles. Inspection and tags are all current. I'll sell it as-is with the light bar & controller, headache rack, CB radio & antenna, gooseneck hitch, inverter, PHP chip, and a few extra parts such as a spare South Bend clutch, spare set of 4 tires and a set of 4 black Bushwacker fender flares for $13,500 or make an offer. I have a clean title in hand. Call me if you're interested, I assume all texts are scams. (Nine Zero Three) 820-1665 do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5874328226",

      "text": "transmission: automatic QR Code Link to This Post 1968 Ford Mustang Super Clean Zero Red Hot Rust Cruiser. Up for sale is a my 1968 Mustang which was restored a few years back and has been a weekend cruiser ever since. The car was restored with a base coat clear bright red paint that I would consider a upper end driver quality job. It has few flaws but will hold its own in any local car show or meetup. The amazing part about this car is the floors and body, I have found no rust anywhere. The floors have never been touched and only have light surface rust from being stored inside for years. The quarters are all original and show no areas of repair. I was thinking of painting or coating the underside but felt it's better to let people see it's unmolested originality. The interior is in excellent shape and has upgraded 1969 front seats with headrests for comfort. Their are no rips or holes in any of the interior surfaces. All of the electrical works including lights,blinkers,wipers,interior lights, etc. The car runs awesome with a documented engine and trans rebuild. The original 289 was replaced with a .40 over-bored 302, balanced and blueprinted, cam dynamics mild cam and topped with a Edelbrock aluminum intake and Holley 650cfm 4 barrel. The automatic C4 transmission was rebuilt with upgraded parts and shift kit. The car sounds nice with a low rumble from long tube headers and dual exhaust. The engine bay is really nice and detailed perfectly with just enough chrome and blacked out old school edelbrock valve covers and air cleaner. The car has had all of it's cooling system has been gone through including a bigger radiator, new hoses, 6 blade ford high performance fan and shroud. The heating system works and has a new fan motor and heater core. The brake system has bee completely gone through and all wore parts have been replaced. The car rolls out on older Graiger wheels with almost new classic white letter tires. The cars drives awesome and suspension and steering feels nice with new power steering parts installed. If your looking for a really nice cruiser you will be hard pressed to find another mustang like this for the money. I have looked at many mustangs and this is not your misleading ad that claims a perfect car or a waste of time with false allegations of no rust. Please feel free to come look at it and see for yourself. Copy and paste my walk around video in your URL to see the car run. Sorry it's short it started to rain.

      "text": "( google map ) QR Code Link to This Post I have for sale a completely rust free 8 foot bed that is in very good condition minus a dent on the passenger side of the bed which is easy to fix. The entire underside of the bed is in excellent shape and was painted with por-15 paint. There are a few dings on the upper bed rails but if you put a bed rail protector the dings will be covered. I wanted to restore my 96 F350 but I changed my mind. Again this is a rust free bed in excellent shape. It was recently painted jet black 2 months ago Asking 1000 OBO, it comes with a tailgate that's rust free just a small dent on top do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5874459072",
