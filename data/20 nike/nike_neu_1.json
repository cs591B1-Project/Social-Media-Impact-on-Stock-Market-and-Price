Jim Cramer Nov7,20161:00AMEST \nJim Cramer shares his views every day on RealMoney. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nCramer: Nike Is a Victim of Price Wars; There Will Be Others \nPosted at 11:56 a.m. EDT on Monday, Oct. 31, 2016 \nNike! Say it ain't so! Nike ( NKE ) gets taken to a sell at Bank of America Merrill Lynch; this, one of the greatest innovators, the dominant athletic apparel company of our time. What the heck? What's going on? \nSimple. \nCompetition. \nFor years, Nike had the run of the table. Ever since Phil Knight blew away the competition, all laid out beautifully in his autobiography, Shoe Dog , and then taken to the next level by Mark Parker, Nike has had no peer in the business. Periodically, there'd be a challenger. I remember when we heard about Fila as a competitor. Or Reebok. Or Saucony. All pretenders. \nAnd yes, Adidas ( ADDYY ) did have a good run for certain. \nBut they all died on the vine as Nike ran away with the business worldwide. \nSuddenly, though, out of nowhere, Nike has not one powerful competitor, but two of them. Adidas has made a powerful return with its retro Stan Smith shoes. Most of you probably don't know who Stan Smith is. He was the great tennis player of my formative years -- the guy we all wanted to be in the seventies. His shoe has made a remarkable comeback.

      "text": "With early rumors suggesting this silhouette to be the Nike LeBron Ambassador 9 , it’s now featured in a timeless palette of black/white, following an initial reveal in wine red . \nThe sneaker essentially flaunts a refined aesthetic compared to its predecessor, as the synthetic/mesh upper is rendered in black, while pops of white are utilized for its enlarged Swoosh branding on the toe box and outsole unit to pronounce its simplistic profile. Other notable details include the number “2” and “3” on the tongues and its “SFG” pull heel tab.\nA release date for this pair has not been announced, but, stay tuned to KicksOnFire for further updates.\nAuthor’s Take It’s a versatile option in this colorway. I like the sleek design of the silhouette overall. \n\nThe post A Classic Colorway Of The Nike LeBron Ambassador 9 Is Revealed appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Isaiah Thomas sneaks into Boston train station to view his new Nike campaign Published 24/7 \nBoston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas has come a long way and enjoyed almost a meteoric rise since he was selected with the 60th pick in round two of the 2011 draft. \nSecond round players are not usually expected to make big impacts in the NBA but Thomas hasn't followed that script and has made a name for himself, particularly in Boston. \nThe 27-year-old has seen his stock rise considerably since being traded to the Celtics in 2015 and has been one of the main reasons for the franchise being considered as contenders once again. \nThe 5'9\" guard became an All-Star for the first time last season and is now the face of the most decorated team in league history. \nHis status in Boston has grown in the last year and he recently discovered just how big he's become thanks to a campaign by Nike. \nThe sports brand, whom Thomas has an endorsement deal with, have created a \"Come out of Nowhere\" campaign featuring multiple basketball players and Isaiah's face is plastered across the city's railway stations with the message \"Pick Me Last Again\". \nFans had been sharing images of it with the Celtics star via social media, but he decided he had to see it for himself and snuck into South Station - Boston's largest railroad station and bus terminal - in the early hours of Saturday morning. \n\"That was like a dream. I can’t even explain it,\" Thomas said. \"The workers said they've been doing it for the last four or five days and they've still got way more to do. I was taking pictures and [security] was telling me that it was against the rules to take pictures in the train station, but I kept telling them, 'I know you got to do your job, but I'm taking these pictures and these videos. I'm sorry.'\" \nThe former Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings man was aware that Nike was putting together a commercial featuring himself, Draymond Green and Paul George, but he admits he had no idea just how big it would be. \n\"Nike said they had something special for me, but I didn’t know it was going to be that,\" Thomas said. \"When people sent me pictures on social media, it was of like North Station, and then my wife had taken a picture of it last game. \n\"But the next day someone said South Station had bigger ones. I’m like, 'I gotta go by this.' So that was my first time ever even at South Station. The posters are like everywhere. It’s unbelievable. \n\"When I went last night, me and my wife, we had a moment.\" \nThomas' rise to stardom is certainly one of the best stories in the NBA and it's not one that's about to end soon.

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 4 images from this gallery. \nIf you’re looking for wheat-inspired kicks for this winter season, there’s truly no shortage in options – and while tried-and-true options such as Timberland’s classic 6″ boots serve well, that isn’t stopping Nike from going ahead with unleashing new “Wheat” models.\nNike’s Air Unlimited silhouette is the newest in a long line of wheat colorways, and while this color option is entirely new to the silhouette, Nike has elected to keep the model true to its nature with crossing straps on the upper reminiscent of the Air Jordan VIII, and a curvy Nike Air-injected midsole unit. On the heel portion of the sneaker’s outsole, you’ll find a nice little addition of a hit of gum to pull the aesthetic together.\nThe Nike Air Unlimited “Wheat” is set to release at Nike retailers like Shoe Palace beginning November 13 for a retail price of $180 USD.\n",

      "text": "Yesterday, we previewed the JJ Watt sneakers that Reebok is releasing for Veteran’s Day , and now we’re getting a look at one of the shoes that Nike has readied for Friday’s military holiday.\nFor what is sure to be just a few of many Veteran’s Day-inspired styles from Nike, the brand has created an exclusive player edition of the Kobe 11 to be worn by the Michigan State Spartans and Arizona Wildcats during Friday’s Armed Force Classic game. Related Cam'ron Surprises New Yorkers With a Massive Sneaker Giveaway \nNo uniform is complete with out the kicks. Check out our black camo @nike Kobe 11’s in action this Friday in the Armed Forces Classic pic.twitter.com/Xtt8VD27Rs \n— Spartan Basketball (@MSU_Basketball) November 8, 2016 \n\nFor Michigan State’s exclusive, Nike covered the Kobe Bryant signature sneakers in a black camouflage-like pattern that adorns the majority of the knitted upper and even extends to the rubber outsole. The black-and-grey print is accented with a white Swoosh on the lateral and medial panels, along with a Kobe logo at the tongue and a Spartans logo at the right heel.\nMeanwhile, the Arizona Cardinals received a similar exclusive, which sees the Kobe 11 adopt a grey and white camouflage patten and red branding. Like the Spartans’ edition, the Arizona pair features Wildcats branding at the right heel.\nOur entire program will don special gear for the Armed Forces Classic to honor the U.S.S. Arizona. #APlayersProgram pic.twitter.com/4w0PAK5VuF \n— Arizona Basketball (@APlayersProgram) November 7, 2016 \n\nUnfortunately, if you are hoping to get your hands on either of these “Armed Force Classics” Kobe 11s, you’ll need some serious connections, as it looks like they are an exclusive for the NCAA teams and will not be getting a public release. However, you can catch the shoes in action on Nov. 11 at 7 p.m. ET when Michigan State squares off against Arizona from Honolulu, Hawaii.\nWant more? \nA Closer Look at Nike’s New Kobe Bryant Signature Shoe \nTributes Pour In For Kobe Bryant \nKobe Bryant Kicks Off European Basketball Tour ",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 6 images from this gallery. \nBefore eventually signing with Nike, Kobe Bryant was a sneaker free agent during the 2002-2003 season. In hopes of luring him that way, Jordan Brand in turn designed a special Air Jordan 9 PE for Bryant, although he never actually wore them in a game. Now, however, you yourself will have the opportunity to purchase the once-rare “Kobe” J’s, as they are hitting retailers next week.\nAppropriately done up in an LA Lakers color scheme, the kicks note construction from white leather and purple patent leather, with yellow accents. While the original version featured Kobe’s number 8 on the heel, these in turn boast “23” branding.\nYou’ll be able to snag your size of the “Kobe” Jordan 9 beginning Saturday, November 19.\nFor more sneaker heat, check out our favorite kicks worn at this year’s Sneaker Con NYC. \n",

      "text": "12m ago • 1 min read \nJust days after signing a contract extension with Real Madrid , superstar Cristiano Ronaldo now appears to have signed another major contract -- this time with his sponsor Nike. Ronaldo took part in the unveiling of his new signature cleats over the weekend where he described it as the \"best contract of my career.\" He also suggested that his new deal with the sportswear company is \"for life.\" \nAccording to TMZ , the deal could be worth over $1 billion. That's right. That's a ton of cash. \nRonaldo has been a member of the swoosh family since 2003 and along with Brazilian star Neymar, he's one of the faces of the company. The report also suggests exactly what Ronaldo stated on the video above -- that the duration of the deal is similar to NBA superstar LeBron James' lifetime pact . \nIt's been quite a week for CR7. On Monday, he signed a new contract extension with Real Madrid , and per Forbes , he's the highest paid athlete in the world. \nNow that he struck new deal with Nike, this might help him solidify his name atop that list, eh? \nFor news, stories, results and more, follow us:",

The Portuguese soccer star has had a contract with Nike since 2003 and wears its Mercurial cleats. In a video released by the Beaverton, Oregon-based apparel maker, he suggested the deal was \"for life,\" although terms weren't released. Ronaldo said in a statement released Tuesday by the company: \"I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company. We work as a family, too. This is my brand.\" Ronaldo, a three-time world player of the year, is captain of the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this year. On Monday, the 31-year old signed a new five-year contract with Real Madrid that runs through June 2021. Ronaldo has scored 372 goals in 360 matches for Real Madrid, helping the team to two Champions League titles and the La Liga crown since joining it in 2009. ",

      "text": "  deal , football , Nike , Ronaldo , sports Now Ronaldo bags ‘long-term’ Nike deal   Madrid – A day after signing a bumper fresh contract with Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo has boosted his mind-boggling earnings with a new deal with Nike, the American sports giant said on Tuesday. Together the multimillion mega-deals are expected to cement Ronaldo’s status as the world’s highest-paid sportsman, ahead of great Barcelona rival Lionel Messi. According to American magazine Forbes, Ronaldo trumped Messi in 2016 with an income of $88 million (80 million euros, £71 million). There are no concrete figures, but Ronaldo’s new five-year contract with Real is expected to net the 31-year-old Portuguese forward in the region of a basic salary of 25 million euros a year. He could also bag up to 40 million euros a year for the Nike deal, according to Marca. Marca and AS, the Spanish sports dailies, said the Nike deal is for life, rather like the one between Nike and basketball legend Michael Jordan. “I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,” Ronaldo said in a Nike press release announcing a “new, long-term contract”. “We work as a family too,” he added. “This is my brand.” Ronaldo on Monday signalled his intention to keep playing for 10 more years after rounding off a “dream year”. The three-time World Player of the Year has enjoyed his most successful year at a collective level, scoring the winning penalty as Madrid won the Champions League for an 11th time in May before captaining Portugal to their first major tournament win at Euro 2016. – AFP",

      "text": "By Gerald Flores \nThe Nike LunarCharge is something new and old. The latest Nike Sportswear sneaker contains the DNA of four storied runners in the brand's archives. The overall shape of the shoe is inspired by 1990's Nike Air Current, while neoprene found throughout the upper is inspired by 1988's Air Flow. You might have also noticed that the eye stays are a subtle nod to the Nike Air Max '90. Unseen to the naked eye is the internal bootie system that was modeled off of the original Air Presto. \nNike's LunarCharge isn't just a monument to the past. The sneaker also features the the brand's latest laser-siped Lunar midsole technology, which first debuted in the Nike LunarEpic earlier this year. Retailing for $120, could the LunarCharge be Nike's next unexpected hit like the Roshe Run in 2012? I guess we'll see when the sneaker releases on November 18 at select Nike boutiques. Get a closer look at the new silhouette below.",

      "text": "The grand opening of Nike ‘s new retail location in NYC’s SOHO district, located on 529 Broadway at the corner of Spring St., will be held this Friday. \nTo celebrate the occasion, a special edition Nike Air Force 1 Low NYC edition will be offered to the public in very limited quantities. Flaunting a predominantly white finish, the low-top sneaker is accentuated with orange and blue accents prominent on the Swoosh branding, respective NYC logos on the tongue and heel, as well as the signature AIR stripe on the midsole unit. \nYou can find this model exclusively at Nike SOHO this Friday, November 11th. \nh/t: Nike /Sneakernews\nAuthor’s Take As a fellow New Yorker, I’m just biased. The colorway is just appealing in general as well and the style is timeless. \n\nThe post Look Out For This Exclusive Nike Air Force 1 Low NYC appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

The ultramodern sneaker culls design cues from a plethora of iconic Swoosh models—taking its neoprene upper from the 1988 Air Flow, eye stays from the Air Max 90, an internal bootie from the 2000 Air Presto and the overall design from the 1990 Air Current. Its most innovative feature goes to the l aser-siped Lunarlon outsole which is also found on the 2016 LunarEpic. \nThe LunarCharge will launch in a crisp white/deep black colorway this November 18 online and at select Nike stockists.

While some of the sneakers are forever associated with particular moments throughout basketball history, others are set up for pivotal roles in the future.\nA number of classic styles, as well as revamped updates are present within the celebratory collection, including the SF AF-1, AF-1 Upstep Warrior, Air Max 2 Uptempo, Uptempo, Uptempo 97, Air Foamposite Pro, Kobe XI Elite Low, Zoom KD 9, Kyrie 2, Air Jordan XXXI, Air Jordan IX Retro, Air Jordan XI Retro and Air Jordan XVI Retro.\nThe common theme with each shoe, however, is an undeniable sport DNA captured from a relentless focus on the needs of the athlete and an uncanny capacity to connect across cultures.\nNike’s special “12 Soles” capsule will be going on display this week at the new Nike Soho store (529 Broadway), which opens its doors on November 11. The sneakers then release at select retailers and nike.com beginning December.\n",

      "title": "Canadian Court Orders eBay to pay $86,700 for a Pair of Nike Shoes",
      "text": "REUTERS/ALBERT GEA\nTwo Canadian brothers managed to transform a $320 investment in a special pair of Nike shoes into a $98,000 sale on eBay. After eBay intervened to cancel that sale, the brothers sued the company. In a recent decision issued by a court in Quebec, eBay was ordered to pay the brothers $86,700.\nIn 2012, the brothers camped out overnight for a chance to purchase a pair of Nike “Air Foamposite Galaxy 1” shoes. Nike reportedly created a limited run of those shoes as a special sale offering.\nAfter purchasing one pair of the shoes, the brothers placed the shoes up for sale on eBay. They were apparently surprised and overjoyed as the bidding for the shoes rose rapidly higher. It seems that the small production run for the shoes and the timing of their release, in the build-up for the 2012 National Basketball Association all-star game, made the shoes highly prized among collectors.\nEventually a winning bid of $98,000 was received. The brothers were reportedly preparing to close the transaction, when eBay intervened. The company informed the brothers that it was terminating the auction and it would not permit the sale to be consummated.\nIn response to eBay’s action, the brothers sued the company. They alleged that eBay had unlawfully terminated unilaterally the contract the company had with them. In response, eBay alleged that the brothers had violated eBay’s terms of service. The court in Quebec ruled for the brothers. It determined that eBay had improperly terminated the transaction and that the brothers had not in any way violated the eBay terms of service. The court then ordered eBay to pay the brothers $86,700.\nAn interesting aspect of this case is the lack of clarity which continues to surround eBay’s decision to terminate the auction for the shoes. Reportedly, eBay routinely uses software to monitor the many auctions it manages. When a particular transaction is deemed by the software to be out of the ordinary, the auction in question is tagged for human review.\nApparently and perhaps not surprisingly a bid of $98,000 for purchase of a single pair of shoes attracted the attention of the monitoring software. Even after trial, however, it reportedly remains unclear exactly what eBay monitoring software is looking for as it monitors the numerous ongoing transactions and how exactly human intervention into those transactions which are flagged by the software is supposed to work.\nGreater transparency into both the automated and human oversight systems now routinely used to police electronic commercial transactions is required. In order to understand the impact, effectiveness, and biases associated with those e-commerce transactions and relationships, it is essential that government authorities and the public develop insight into the operations of the automated and human transaction monitoring systems upon which the global network of electronic commerce now relies.\nThe post Canadian Court Orders eBay to pay $86,700 for a Pair of Nike Shoes appeared first on Legal Solutions Blog .\n",

      "text": "With its official imagery already revealed, this variation of the Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 in the iconic BRED theme, is scheduled to make its arrival soon. \nThe performance basketball sneaker flaunts the stealthy black hue across the majority of its upper, distinctive strap system and midsole unit, while the focal point is directed at its red suede toe box. The vibrant hue is further applied on the entire outsole, along with accents on the tongue and heel via branding to cap off the respective theme.\nTopped off with reflective swooshes, this pair is suggested to debut at select Nike retailers starting December 3 for $130.\nStay tuned to KicksOnFire for more updates. \nImages: hatena \nAuthor’s Take One of the best colorways on the silhouette this season. This style has been receiving solid iterations as of late, but, you can’t go wrong with this classic palette.\n\nThe post Look Out For The Red Toe Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "\nIn October of 2015, the world got its first look at Michael J. Fox modelling the self-lacing Nike Mags from the forever feature classic Back to the Future . A year later, the highly sought after silhouette became available for raffle for the Michael J. Fox Foundation in order to help find a cure for Parkinson’s. Since then, fans have cried over unboxing videos, as the shoes continued to auction for increasingly more, with the most recent bid coming in at a heavy $200,000 USD. With a price tag like that, imagine what resell value is going to be. Anyone surprised? \nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 in black. Nike \nTo live in the future, you've got to pay the price. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 — the first mass-market sneaker to use Nike's new self-lacing technology — will cost $720 a pair, a spokesperson for the company has confirmed with Business Insider. \nInterested customers can make appointments to see and purchase the shoe in person starting December 1. It will come in three colors: black, white, and a black/gray. \nThe shoes were first announced by Nike to great fanfare at its innovation conference in March. Nike CEO Mark Parker later went on CNBC to claim that self-lacing sneakers will be as big as self-driving cars in the future, with both mainstream appeal and application. \nThe first shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0, will feature the signature adaptive fit, which senses when the wearer's foot is in the shoe using a pressure sensor, and automatically tightens the straps until it senses resistance based on an \"algorithmic pressure equation,\" according to Wired . Buttons near the tongue of the shoe provide customized adjustment if the shoe feels too tight or too loose. \nLED lights on the sole will tell you when the shoe is tightening and low on battery charge. The shoes will need to be charged like a gadget to work. It will take three hours to achieve a full charge, which will last two weeks. \nThe technology took 11 years for Nike to research and develop. \n\"We're talking about a project that's maybe the most difficult in the history of footwear,\" Nike VP Tinker Hatfield told Wired . \nSelf-lacing sneakers first entered the public consciousness in 1989's \"Back to the Future II,\" which featured a futuristic version of self-lacing sneakers called the Nike Mag. Nike produced a few Nike Mag versions and raffled them off for charity, and it even sent Michael J. Fox a pair. The shoes raised a total of $6.75 million for Parkinson's disease research.",

      "text": "The special edition Back to the Future style Nike Mag self-lacing sneakers are all gone, but you'll soon be able to get the next best thing in the Nike HyperAdapt — if you pay the high price. \nSEE ALSO: Nike Mag self-lacing sneakers fetch $104,000 at Hong Kong auction \nReports emerged Monday on social media that the HyperAdapt sneakers would cost a whopping $1,000. However, a Nike spokesperson has confirmed to Mashable that the sneakers will actually cost $720 and be released on Dec. 1, not Nov. 28, as some sources have been reporting. \nAnd while $720 is significantly lower than $1,000, the price still makes this one of the most expensive sneakers Nike has ever released. Apparently, Nike believes people will pay a premium for the self-lacing the technology embedded in an otherwise simple-looking shoe design. \n\nIf you're considering picking a pair up, here's a refresher on what you're getting: A low-top, cross training-style sneaker with a wireless charging dock embedded in its sole that lights up. When fully charged, the lithium-ion battery that powers the shoe will last about two weeks and take up to three hours to charge. \nIn addition to the glowing sole and self-lacing component, there are also LEDs on the sneaker's heel to indicate power levels. When the sneaker's sole and heel LEDs are blue, you have a full charge, when they're yellow you have a few more days of power left and when they turn red you need an immediate charge. \nAgain, the price is pretty extraordinary for a sneaker, but if you look at it in the same category as a smartphone or pair of high-end, Bluetooth headphones, the price for the tech-powered shoes may feel a bit more reasonable. \nStill, the notion of having to now also keep an eye on your sneaker's charger level, in addition to all your other mobile devices, could prove to be the central challenge, beyond price, for the HyperAdapt getting traction. We'll know more once we've had a chance to try them out in person.",

      "title": "Now You Can Finally Buy Nike's Auto-Lacing 'Back to the Future' Sneakers",
      "text": "(Photo: Nike) Nike's self-lacing shoes were the buzziest kicks in years, but they were wildly out of the price range for most sneakerheads who lusted after these  Back to the Future -inspired beauties. A single pair even auctioned off for an earth-shattering $200,000 .\nBut if you're willing to drop a nice wad of cash, Nike's auto-lacing technology could be yours thanks to a far more affordable (although still ludicrously high-priced) retail version: the $720 Nike Hyperadapt 1.0.\n(Photo: Nike) (Photo: Nike) Available in Deep Black, Crisp White and Smooth Grey, the Nike Hyperadapt 1.0 will undoubtedly set you back more than any other Nikes short of some incredibly rare collectible Jordans. But the disturbingly steep price tag comes with a near perfect fit courtesy of a lacing mechanism that activates when wearers step into the shoe. \n\nJust watch the magic happen here:\nAnd for what it's worth, that's still less than a $1,370 pair of sneakers from Berluti , and those have regular shoelaces (lame).\nContinue to covet them, or maybe even buy them as soon as Dec. 1, on Nike's website .",

More coming very soon.\" Hadid, who will walk in her first Victoria's Secret fashion show in December, has had a stellar 2016, having recently fronted for Calvin Klein and Dior Beauty, and landing too many international Vogue covers to count. \nDespite the fact that she was born and raised in SoCal, the supe will star in the brand's #NewYorkMade campaign. Among the members of her new \"Nike family\" are some of the best athletes in the world, including Serena Williams, Lebron James and Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles. \nIn this day and age, it's all too common for supermodels to land deals with activewear brands; Hadid's big sis Gigi was recently named the face of Reebok's #PerfectNever campaign, and Cara Delevingne starred in Puma's #DoYo campaign , which was directed by fellow Puma collaborator Rihanna. (Bella's ex , The Weeknd, was also recently named as a Puma ambassador .)",

      "text": "Bella Hadid Is the New Face of Nike November 14, 2016 GC Images Bella Hadid has an impressive resume: Not only has she walked for major fashion brands like Chanel, Givenchy, and Fendi, she is also slated to appear in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show (read: model career goals) and has been the face of Dior Beauty this year. Today, the 20-year-old model added another title to add to her growing list of accolades: Hadid just announced she's the newest spokesmodel for Nike via Instagram today. Loading View on Instagram In the photo, the model is seen posing in front of a \"New York Made\" Nike billboard in New York City. \"So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE NIKE FAMILY!\" she wrote in the caption. She has also hinted at more exciting news to come from the partnership—though the sportswear brand has yet to confirm the news on its own social media platforms. On Snapchat, the model posted two photos of Nike Lab. In one image, there's a table full of material swatches and a Nike Air Force 1 high-top in black and orange. Perhaps there's a new sneakers collaboration in the works? Bella Hadid's jetlag beauty survival guide: Bella Hadid/Snapchat Hadid is no stranger to athleisure. The model is often seen on the streets wearing her favorite crop tops with loose tracksuit pants and a new pair of kicks (she specifically loves the brand’s Air Force 1s). She showed support for Nike earlier this summer when she sported a black top emblazoned with the sportswear brand's iconic logo. If there's a shoes line in the works, the younger Hadid could ask her sister, Gigi, for some pointers: Fresh off the heels of her successful fashion collection with Tommy Hilfiger, the blond model recently released her booties capsule line with footwear behemoth Stuart Weitzman. Whether she's working on a new shoes collection or not, we now know what workout gear she'll be wearing while training for her Victoria's Secret Fashion Show debut . RELATED",

Share Save \nEven if you couldn't get your hands on an ultra-exclusive pair of Power Mags , there is a way to get self-lacing Nikes in 2016 . The company's HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes are about to go on sale , and they automatically adjust when the wearer puts them on. Despite internet rumors suggesting they would retail for more than $1,000 YouTuber Jacques Slade confirmed the correct price of $720. \nNike confirmed the shoes will be available to a \"small\" group of Nike+ members on November 28th via the \"Reserved for You\" feature on its app. Otherwise, they will go on sale at two of its NYC locations December 1st. Later in the month, two colorways will go on sale via Nike+ and select locations, although the exact details have not been revealed. ",

      "text": "Nike's \"Back to the Future\"-inspired shoes are almost in the present. Photo by Nike \nNike's \"Back to the Future\"-style self-lacing shoes will be here in a little more than two weeks, and now we know how much they will set you back. \nNike said Monday that its HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers, inspired by the hit 1985 movie , will cost $720 -- if you are willing to foot the bill. Nike said the shoes will be available to Nike+ members at the Nike Soho store and Nike Clubhouse in New York City beginning December 1. \nWhen you put your foot in the shoe it lights up, as a pressure sensor in the sole draws tighter an arrangement of fishing line inside. You adjust the fit with two buttons on the front. The laces on the front are just for decoration, sadly. \nInformation about booking appointments to put them through their paces and make a purchase can be found on Nike.com or through the Nike+ app. A small group of Nike+ members will be allowed limited early access to the shoes on November 28. Those people will notified of their opportunity through the Nike+ app's \"Reserved for you\" system, when they will have the opportunity to purchase the shoe.",

There, members will be able to trial and purchase the shoes. Additionally, a select group will gain early access to the shoes on Nov. 28 through the Nike+ app’s reservation system. \nNike is set to release more information on how to book an appointment to experience the Hyperadapt on nike.com and the Nike+ app. \nThe black/white-blue lagoon and metallic silver/black-white colorways of the Hyperadapt will launch at more Nike doors in the U.S. later in December. \nThe Hyperadapt is Nike’s first commercially available shoe using its adaptive lacing technology. The other shoe taking advantage of this new Swoosh innovation is the 2016 Nike Mag , which was available exclusively through charity raffles and auctions. \nImage via Nike",

But what do I know. There’s a reason I’m not Nike’s marketing guy. \nAnyway, a whole host of items are up to 50 percent off as part of this offering. There are, in total, 66 items in fact. \nThe deal includes clothing, like this sweatshirt : Normally $90, this fleece is half off today (Photo via Nike) \nAnd shoes like, to take one completely at random, this one: Normally $140, these training shoes are 50 percent off (Photo via Nike)",

The sportswear queen is officially the new face of Nike, announcing the partnership on Instagram, standing in front of a huge NYC billboard to prove it. The photo’s caption reads, “So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon.” \nNike has yet to post anything on social media or make a formal statement about it, but by the looks of Bella’s Herald Square likeness, it’s safe to say the partnership is official. Loading View on Instagram \nMost often seen in leggings and a crop top, we can’t think of a more fitting face for a company since sister Gigi partnered with Stuart Weitzman . \nThe most interesting part about the billboard is that it doesn’t seem to be shot originally for Nike. At very least, we recognize her crop top look from paparazzi photos earlier this summer. Could there be a design collaboration coming? Or is this just a tease before the brand unveils their official campaign with the brunette beauty? Stay tuned for more.",

And while they’re not quite as pricey as some estimates anticipated, getting your hands on a pair of Nike’s new self-lacing shoes is going to cost you a pretty penny – or, rather, 72,000 of them. \nEven so, the new HyperAdapt 1.0 are going to be a heck of a lot easier to get your hands on than the ultra-exclusive Back to the Future tie-ins the company raffled off recently. Starting December 1, you’ll be able to roll into Nike’s two retail shops in New York City to pick up a pair of the black/white models. \nWider availability arriving later in the month (along with a second color offering) through the Nike+ app and more retail locations – though the specifics around all of that are still forthcoming. \nThe company will also be letting a small number of Nike+ members reserve a pair through its app starting November 28 – consider it an early holiday present. \nOur own Anthony Ha had the opportunity to try them on a few months back , because he gets to do all the fun stuff. Here’s what he had to say, \nIt’s fun but also surprisingly normal to feel them automatically tightening around your feet. (And the sound the laces made as they adjusted themselves made just as strong an impression.) They tightened just enough — they were pretty comfortable, so I only fiddled with the settings to see if I could. 0",

She's gotten major gig after major gig, from Calvin Klein to the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . Now, she joins Nike. Bella posted an Instagram of herself in front of a Nike billboard with her face on it to announce the partnership. She, fittingly, showed off her abs in a black crop top and leggings. There are no further details just yet, but this marks her first fitness brand collaboration. Like her sister Gigi Hadid, who debuted a Reebok campaign just a month ago, she's always had an athletic background. She's a nationally-ranked, award-winning equestrian who even had her sights set on the 2016 Olympics before, you know, the modeling thing ended up working out. Now with Nike, she'll be among Olympic athletes like Allyson Felix, Serena Williams, Simone Biles, and Alex Morgan, nbd. You Might Also Like",

      "text": "By: NIKE, Inc. via Business Wire News Releases November 15, 2016 at 15:00 PM EST 10 Oregon High Schools Launch FUTURE YOU: Nike School Innovation Fund Initiative Designed to Fuel Innovation in Education, and Inspire Students to Create Their Futures Today, more than 20 Nike leaders hosted students and educators from ten Portland, Parkrose, Beaverton, Hillsboro and Salem-Keizer high schools at the Nike World Headquarters for a one-day “FUTURE YOU” workshop designed to inspire students and high school educators to envision their futures. \nToday, more than 20 Nike leaders hosted students and educators from ten Portland, Parkrose, Beaverton, Hillsboro and Salem-Keizer high schools at the Nike World Headquarters for a one-day “FUTURE YOU” workshop designed to inspire students and high school educators to envision their futures. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161115006627/en/ \nKen Black, NIKE, Inc. Vice President of Digital Design Transformation, addresses the Future You education workshop at Nike's World Headquarters. (Photo: Business Wire) \nFUTURE YOU is a two-part program aimed at further fueling innovative, future-thinking in education. The first part is a process that school teams go through to find their authentic voice and vision to serve their specific students. The second part is an implementation strategy to bring staff, students, parents and the community along on the journey to make school more student-centered and better engage kids in their own future. \n“Schools are the key to kids’ futures; that’s why we’re creating resources to help them—so students can find a unique view of who they are and what they can be,” said Ken Black, Nike Vice President, Digital Design Transformation, who has been instrumental in creating FUTURE YOU. “The cool thing is, it’s also relevant to a teacher or families or communities that want to find and own their own vision. The brilliance of every kid has a home somewhere. We want to help prepare them for whatever that will be.” \nThese ten Oregon high schools are piloting FUTURE YOU, with the goal of making the framework and toolkit available to others next year, so schools across the country can apply it: Beaverton, Southridge and Sunset from Beaverton School District; Century and Liberty from Hillsboro School District; Parkrose from the Parkrose School District; Lincoln, Madison and Roosevelt from Portland Public Schools; McNary from Salem-Keizer School District. \nDan Goods, who leads the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory team to develop creative ways of communicating and transform complex concepts into meaningful stories that can be universally understood, helped kick-off the day-long workshop. Representatives from AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) , EPIC (Educational Policy Improvement Center) , and Nike School Innovation Fund partners also attended the session. AVID’s research-based strategies and curriculum provide educators with training to better prepare students for success in high school, college or a career. EPIC is a nonprofit consulting group that strives to help educators better equip students for success. \nFUTURE YOU Inspired by Beaverton High School \nFUTURE YOU was inspired by Innovation Schools work at Beaverton High School supported by the Nike School Innovation Fund that helped the school kick-start the concept that has now evolved into the ten-school pilot. Members of the school administration and faculty, along with Nike leaders, have used FUTURE YOU to create a visioning framework to focus and align student and faculty efforts, so all students graduate prepared for and excited about the futures they choose. \nFUTURE YOU will also help Beaverton High School Principal Anne Erwin and her staff respond to shifting realities—economic and technical: “Every space in our school needs to be a 21st century learning site—the library, choir room, weight room and every classroom,” she said. \nNike talent development experts shared “design thinking” strategies with Beaverton High School to help shape FUTURE YOU, focusing on staff and students needs first and foremost. “FUTURE YOU is not what I or other administrators have decided is the way to solve a particular problem,” says Erwin. “This process helps us think about how we will work collaboratively toward effective change.” \nSaid Nike’s Ken Black, “I hope this goes wherever there’s a kid who needs a glimpse of what their life could be.” \nAbout NIKE, Inc. \nNIKE, Inc., based near Beaverton, Oregon, is the world’s leading designer, marketer and distributor of authentic athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories for a wide variety of sports and fitness activities.

      "text": "11/15/16 AT 3:36 PM Close \nThe futuristic, self-lacing sneakers from Nike that have received near-relentless attention over the past few months finally have a price tag. \nNike confirmed the price of its new HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers Monday — and they’re not cheap. The shoes will set shoppers back $720, according to a news release . However, Footwear News reported the high price was to be expected due to the considerable amount the company likely spent to bring the sneakers to market. \nThe kicks, which are modeled after the ones Marty McFly wears in the 1985 movie “Back to the Future,” finally have a due date, as well. Nike announced in its release that the self-lacing sneakers will hit stores Dec. 1, just ahead of the holidays (and, unfortunately, just after all those Black Friday sales). If you're a specially chosen Nike+ App user, you could get limited access on Nov. 28. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes follow the ultra-exclusive release of the Nike Mag — the actual ‘80s throwback, McFly-inspired sneakers that were raffled off — in early October. Related Stories Score A Pair Of Nike's New 'Back To The Future' Sneakers \nThe HyperAdapt shoes, which feature the same technology, have arrived in a sleek, low-top style similar to Nike’s Flyknit series. The shoes are outfitted with pressure sensors inside the shoe that respond to help tighten the laces on the sneakers. Buttons on either side allow the tightness variances to adjust depending on the wearer’s preference. Light-up LED soles also respond when the batteries in the shoes need to be charged. Wearers can recharge the sneakers by simply placing them on a charging dock. \nThe black/white/blue lagoon colorway and a metallic silver/black/white colorway will also be available later next month through some retailers and the Nike+ Plus app, according to the release. \nThe shoes were created by Nike’s vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, and CEO Mark Parker. \n\"Innovation at Nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow. It's about accelerating toward it,\" Hatfield said in a March news release . \"We're able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody. Sometimes we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it.\" Join the Discussion Everything You Need To Know, Right Now. \nThe IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind   \nIf you failed to win the prize draw for a pair of those flashy self-lacing Back to the Future sneakers, or couldn’t quite make the $100,000 bidding price that the same high-tech footwear fetched at a recent auction, then how about settling for a pair of Nike’s “power-lacing” HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes instead? \nThey’re launching at select stores on December 1, according to YouTuber and sneaker guru Jacques Slade, and will set you back a cool $720. Admittedly, that’s still enough to make your wallet recoil in fear, but if not tying your laces means that much to you, and plain ol’ slip-on shoes are just a wee bit boring, then it may be money well spent. Just CONFIRMED with NIKE. Hyperadapt 1.0 is NOT $1000. It is $720 releasing on 12/1. pic.twitter.com/eqcwybbRyN \n— Jacques Slade (@kustoo) November 14, 2016 \nThe HyperAdapt shoes are an updated alternative to the self-lacing “Mag” shoes that first showed up on Marty McFly’s feet in part two of the Back to the Future trilogy. \nThe specially designed HyperAdapt sneakers incorporate automatic “adaptive fit” technology – also known as power-lacing – that enables the shoe to gently tighten around the foot when pressure sensors on the heel are activated. \nAdded gizmos include a couple of buttons on the outside of each shoe to help you fine-tune the fit by gently tightening and loosening the footwear while you’re wearing it, while a built-in battery should keep its tech powered for up to two weeks on a single charge. \nRelated: Nike to open New York City store loaded with tech \nTinker Hatfield, who co-designed the shoe with Tiffany Beers, thinks adaptive lacing could benefit athletes as the technology offers a “tailored-to-the-moment” custom fit. \n“It is amazing to consider a shoe that senses what the body needs in real-time,” Hatfield said back in March, adding that such a design “eliminates a multitude of distractions, including mental attrition, and thus truly benefits performance.”",

      "title": "This Is The Price To Enter Under Armour",
      "text": "Summary \nPreviously I compared Nike and Under Armour in a one-to-one comparison. \nFinding Nike the winner then, I now look to see if Under Armour is worth buying due to its significant valuation depreciation. \nI conclude that investors should wait until $26.75 before buying any more Under Armour stock. Back in September, I compared Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) on a one-to-one basis. The tale of these two companies is a classic battle between the established king and upcoming contender. Ultimately I reached the conclusion that Nike was a better buy based on its dividend, UA's blooming costs, and UA's inability to meaningfully grow profits along with revenue. Since the article's publication, neither stock has fared well in the market. However, Under Armour has shed nearly double the percentage that Nike has fallen. The footwear sector has declined almost across the board due primarily to increased competition and higher inventories. However, the decline gives us a chance to reset performance expectations for these companies. Under Armour's valuation has lost a third of its value in less than a year, and this prompts me to see if it worth buying. I've been wishing for a chance to grab UA stock for some time now, all I needed was the right price. With all that has happened recently, it's time to figure out what the price is. Click to enlarge Under Armour is trading at $31.94 at the time of this writing. Looking to the past, there are two points of resistance at $30. This resistance has morphed into support, as the stock has bounced off the $30 mark earlier in November. While this support level looks somewhat sturdy, I believe the P/E ratio and selling pressure may be too high to support it for the future. As an investor, I would wait for the risk-reward scenario to improve. I expect the share price to consolidate to $30 a share, where it will ultimately be forced to make a move in either direction. Barring legitimate acquisition chatter, I expect Under Armour to break below this level of resistance. The next level of support won't arrive until the area around $26.75 (18% lower than the current share price). This is where I believe the real buying opportunity is. I support this projection with several observations. For starters, this puts the PE ratio below forty at 38.8. Secondly, I believe the fundamental story behind Under Armour will regain its shine by this point. The Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) deal will be fully in place at this point, and Steph Curry could be in the heat of the playoffs as well. Connected Fitness Segment could start returning some of the capital that was heavily invested into the efforts there. The UCLA deal will be closer to becoming a reality, as that contract begins in July of 2017. Lastly, Under Armour's international growth and foray into high fashion should yield new developments. Click to enlarge $26.75 will be the spot where short-sellers should take profits on their trade, thus pushing the stock upwards. Current short interest in Under Armour is quite large, at 26.38% of outstanding shares. (The average short interest in the S&P 500 is around 6% for comparison.) The combination of short sellers taking profits, as well as a return to fundamentals and technical support should present Under Armour the extra push it needs to deviate from its downward trend. Final Thoughts I know that some people reading this article will disagree that Under Armour could drop another 18% after losing a third of its value. And perhaps they're correct. However, investing is about making sure the risk-reward scenario is in your favor. For me, I don't believe this takes place until around $26.75.

This particular edition has been rumored since the start of this year (images of the shoe first leaked in January ) and we now know it features two notable changes: embroidered “45” branding replaces the previous “23” at the heel, and “Nike Air” tagging has been implemented on the insoles.\nThere’s also a higher patent leather cut, as well as a black mesh upper, a Concord Jumpman on the ankle, a white midsole and an icy blue outsole.\nThe Air 11 Jordan “Space Jam” is slated for release on December 10 over at Nike.com for a price of $220. We’ve also heard rumors there will be a batch of Space Jam apparel released at the same time. While we wait to find out, check out the promo video below.\n\nIn other sneaker news, hummel and Overkill traveled back to the ’80s for this old school Marathona .\nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more. \n",

      "text": "Nike's 'Back To The Future' Self-Lacing Hyperadapt Shoes Will Cost $969 AFP/Relaxnews   \nNike has announced that its new HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes will be available beginning in December for a price of $720 (approx C$969). \nThe shoes feature what Nike calls \"adaptive lacing,\" meaning that sensors at the heel level activate the lacing when a foot slips into the shoe. \nCustomers will be able to try the HyperAdapt 1.0 in its Black/White-Blue Lagoon colourway at the Nike Soho store and the NIKE+ ClubHouse at 45 Grand in New York beginning Dec. 1. Information about booking appointments will be available on nike.com and the Nike+ app. \nA small group of Nike+ app users will also have early access on November 28. \nLater in the month, the shoes will be available in Black/White-Blue Lagoon and Metallic Silver/Black-White colourways through the Nike+ app and select Nike stores in the US. \nWatch the video above to learn more about the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0. \nFollow Huffington Post Canada Style on Pinterest , Facebook and Twitter !

      "title": "Nike: When Will The Bleeding Stop?",
      "text": "Nike’s share price has declined materially in the last year. \nThis has resulted in many asking, “When will it end?”. \nThis article adds some investing psychology commentary to that notion. In a recent article I highlighted why Nike (NYSE: NKE ) may be worth a closer look. The idea was simple: due to an above average valuation and below average yield, Nike often flies under the radar of your typical stock screen. Yet shares are down materially in the last year or so, while the business continues to generate solid and growing profits. Let's focus on the price decline. Back in November of 2015 shares were trading hands around $66. And I think this is an important point to remember: this number is simply a record of what happened at the time. In general pricing tends to follow business performance (or the expectation of such), but there's no mechanism requiring the prices to react a certain way at a given moment. A lot of people get attached to past share prices. Just because someone bought and sold at $66, this does not simultaneously indicate that this is now the price . It gives you a clue as to what people are willing to pay, but in the short-term it's merely a liquidity bid. The price at which you could sell if you were so inclined. Since the end of 2015, the share price of Nike has fallen materially. It went from the high $60's to $65, then $60, then to $55 and as I write this the number is closer to $50 even. All told we've seen a decline of about 25% in just one year. And for many that sort of thing means \"doom and gloom.\" Indeed, a comment was made to this effect: \"when will the bleeding stop?\" The obvious answer is no one knows. Shares could be 25% higher or lower from here this time next year. However, the interesting part to me is the psychology involved. Many investors have a tendency to extrapolate recent events out into the future: seeing Nike decline in price recently makes them wonder, \"what if this continues forever?\" Of course in reality trees rarely grow to the sky or fall to the earth. Instead, there's a tendency for prices and valuations to come back to a reasonable range. Not always, not universally, but it's still an overwhelmingly common occurrence. And luckily for the investment world, that range is generally increasing as profits rise over the years. I'd like to use this logic to get a better framework for thinking about the recent share price decline with Nike. Let's start with some history. Here's a look at Nike's split-adjusted dividends, earnings and share price from the start of the century: You can see the tale of an excellent business and investment history play out. Note that the above numbers reflect fiscal years and not calendar years. The dividend started out as a small component of earnings, and while it has grown robustly in the last decade and a half, this cash payment still does not make up a huge portion of earnings. The dividend is impressive, staying the same or growing each year. Yet I'd contend that the earnings record is even more impressive: increasing every single year, recession or not. Nike has truly been a powerhouse of increasing profits. The share price appreciation has also been impressive: on a split-adjusted basis, going from $5 to $50. And if I told you that over this period dividends grew by 15.5% per annum, earnings by 14.2% and the share price by 15.7% per year I don't think that would be surprising. The magnitude is impressive, but you had share price performance that was roughly in line with the business gains. Interestingly, despite the long march upward, the degree to which these increases took place was not always consistent. Here's a look at the year-over-year changes for each component: On the dividend side, you see very impressive growth and a good deal of consistency as of late. With earnings you have a higher number every single year. This number is not quite as smooth, but it still marches upwards year after year. The share price is a slightly different story. Despite dividends and earnings growing each year, the share price actually declined on three separate occasions. And indeed if you count May of 2016 to today, so far we've seen a fourth period of decline. Moreover, the share price has also grown much faster than earnings on many occasions. Share prices tend to be a lot more finicky than business results. As we just saw from above share price performance tracked the business results over the long-term, but interesting divergences can occur during shorter time periods. For instance, from 2000 to 2009 Nike grew its per share earnings by 240%. And yet the share price increased by just 170%. Over this period you had a security growing very nicely (over 10% per year), but the valuation went from 20 times earnings down to 15. You had share price performance that trailed business results. From 2009 through fiscal year 2016, the opposite situation occurred. Nike grew its per share profits by 150% - a very respectable amount. Yet the share price increased by 290%. The earnings multiple went from 15 to the high-20's. In this period, share price performance drastically outperformed business results. So the recent share price decline should not be especially surprising. In the past decade you had share price performance that not only followed but also exceeded the solid business results. Given an expectation that long-term returns will track (not indefinitely exceed) business results, it follows that eventually you're going to see share price performance that trails Nike's results. That's the first thing that I'd like to point out. When you have share price outperforming business results for years, it's easy to get used to that sort of thing. Yet eventually valuation acts as an anchor, bringing shares back down to a \"reasonable\" range. This can take years, but it happens time and again. With that logic in mind, you can better think about \"when the bleeding will stop.\" If you believe 20 or 22 times earnings for Nike is more reasonable (instead of say 30) then right about now is where you'd anticipate the \"bleeding\" to stop. (If you believe a lower valuation is warranted, then a lower ongoing price could be anticipated.) From here you might anticipate that shares would more or less reflect business results over the long-term. Now there's a very important corollary. Just because the valuation may now appear more reasonable, this does not simultaneously indicate that a declining share price is now \"over.\" Shares could still decline 25% next year. Eventually long-term price performance and business performance ought to track each other if the starting valuation is reasonable, but there's no requirement that it happens this week or year. The best you can do is demand a fair valuation, which greatly ups your chances of capturing business performance (not guaranteed, but greater odds nonetheless). The nice thing is that earnings growth is largely positive (for Nike, always positive thus far). So even if you miss on the valuation a bit, say 23 times earnings instead of 20, there's a bit of wiggle room there. This holds more so the faster the business is growing. If earnings are say 100% higher 10 years from now you'd generally expect the share price to be higher as well. If the starting and ending valuation were the same, you'd expect your return to closely track business performance. And if the ending valuation goes higher or lower, your potential returns are likewise affected. That's point number two. Anything can happen in the short-term, but in general you're going to see a relationship between price and profits, with a factor of valuation mixed in, over the long-term. We've already seen it play out with Nike: price performance and business results can vary widely, but eventually you have a logical connection. Finally, I'd like to make one more point as it relates to investor psychology. When people see a much lower share price, not only do they see \"doom and gloom\" (what if this continues forever?) but they also treat it as bad news. You see a short-term decrease in the value of your holdings. On a typical scoreboard that's poor news. With investing, the inverse could very well be true. If you're a long-term owner - happy to hold for years or decades - you're also apt to be a long-term net buyer. That is, you buy more than you sell. This could be the case via \"fresh\" capital you invest, reinvested dividends or on your behalf via share repurchases. With fresh capital, your preference is obvious: you'd much prefer to buy at lower rather than higher prices. This allows for your \"capital buck\" to go a lot further: buying a greater percentage of earnings and future cash flows. A lot of people get this backwards - rooting for higher prices even as they are buying more. It's analogous to stopping for gas and rooting for the price to increase before you're done pumping. Today you can buy shares of Nike for $50. Now if you truly wanted the price to be say $70 instead of $50 - even why you're buying - I'd be happy to make that arrangement. Indeed, I'm certain any seller today would oblige. If you're selling that's a different story, but all too often the same people that are buying are the ones rooting for the higher price. If you're reinvesting the same logic holds. And indeed, the same logic holds for a company's reinvestment program. Even if you are not adding new capital and you choose to spend every dividend, your percentage in the business is still increasing on your behalf. Nike is buying out past partners via the company's share repurchase program. Here too it's lower rather than higher prices that benefit the net buyer. You'd much prefer for Nike to but out a shareholder at X as opposed to 1.2X for their ownership in the business. In all three circumstances, it's lower rather than higher prices that provide a long-term benefit. If you're looking to sell in the short-term that's a different story, but the long-term owner - who happens to be a long-term net buyer - need not be especially concerned about a lower share price with a solid business. It can be easy to forget that a lower share price could actually be good news. So many investors treat a falling stock price as a great tragedy when so often it's a great opportunity. In short, with regard to Nike's stock price and in general, share prices can do all sorts of things in the short-term. So one period, even a year, shouldn't disturb the long-term owner - there will be ebbs and flows. Moreover, price performance generally follows business results over the long-term. And as the valuation decreases, the likely of capturing this performance moving forward increases. Finally, although most treat it as an awful occurrence, a lower short-term share price could actually be good news.

      "text": "Facebook It's a mash-up of some classic Nikes. \nNike has an arsenal of iconic silhouettes, but three in particular sit towards the top of the heap: the Nike Air Presto , the Air Max 90, and the Air Current. So you might be pleased to know the athletic brand baked all three legendary styles into it's latest release, the LunarCharge. \nIn the same way that a music producer can take a sample and spin it into an entirely new song (and, often, a more satisfying result), Nike's design team has pulled the best parts of the three sneakers to use in its new lifestyle shoe. It features a breathable upper thank to some Nike Air Flow-inspired neoprene, sock-like construction that calls to mind the Air Presto, and a cushioned outsole similar to that on the LunarEpic. The most obvious wink at the past is the eyelet design lifted from Air Max 90, while the most subtle reference is the overall silhouette of the Air Current. While the LunarCharge's real strength is its roots in classic styles—which make it appropriate for everything from sweats to slim jeans—ultimately, the shoe is fit for 2016 because people can't seem to get enough of the performancewear aesthetic. \nAnd just because the LunarCharge is intended as a lifestyle shoe, we doubt anyone would object should you sport these to the gym (the better bet is they'd ask you where you got them). In our world of constantly-blurring lines between weekend and workday wears pretty much anything goes anyway (though you might get some side eye for showing up to your job as a banker in a sweatsuit). The LunarCharge is one of the coolest new shoes of 2016 to encapsulate that ever-widening gray area. \nAvailable November 18 at nike.com",

'Modern Funnel' Fleece Pullover by Nike \n. \nThis sweatshirt tunic is the next best thing to wearing a blanket out of the house, and your neck will stay toasty warm when the winter wind shows up. This pullover comes in the basic gray and black, but it is also available in a burgundy and turquoise. If you're anything like me, your closet could probably use some color \n5. Wool Swing Skirt by adidas Originals \nAlright, adidas officially takes the cake for having some of the best athleisure ever. Skirts are often more comfortable than pants anyhow, so why not incorporate them into your sport-inspired attire? Pair this skirt with a simple tee and some sneakers. Instant chic.",

Red and white also share duties on the midsole and outsole. \nLook for this colorway to land in stores sometime in January for $150. \nNike KD 9",

      "title": "Nike's Popular Flyknit Racer Will Soon Don a \"Triple Black\" Colorway",
      "text": "\n\"Triple Black\" has seen its fair share of silhouettes over the years; this time around Nike's Flyknit Racer silhouette will finally join the family. Previously released in popular colorways such as \" Volt ,\" \" Total Orange ,\" \" Multicolor \" and many more, the upcoming rendition is very straight-forward, hosting black throughout its laces, sole and Flyknit upper. Expected to release on December 1 in Europe, the design doesn't have a confirmed stateside launch set as of yet.\nIn the meantime, check out our rendering of what to expect above and let us know if you plan to cop the Nike Flyknit Racer \"Triple Black\" if it hits shelves soon.\nTrue blackout version coming later this month! ⚫️⚫️⚫️ .

      "text": "by Erin Fitzpatrick \nAre you a simple white sneaker kind or girl, or are you more adventurous when it comes to your footwear? If you're in the latter camp, you probably get as excited as we do about updated versions of classic shoes, like Rita Ora's revamped Adidas Stan Smith sneakers or Nike's self-lacing shoes . Now, the latest sneaker overhaul we're obsessed with comes courtesy of Bandier's collaboration with Nike, which features a pair of rose-gold kicks we can't wait to get our hands on. \nAvailable at Bandier's Flatiron store location in New York City, as well as Nike's website , the collaboration features shoes and clothes with rose gold touches. For fashion girls, this is music to our ears: you officially don't have to say goodbye to rosé just because it's fall. Could you really pass up the opportunity to match your shoes to your drink? \nScroll down to see Bandier's new rose gold collaboration with Nike! 1 / 5",

      "text": "by Erin Fitzpatrick \nAre you a simple white sneaker kind or girl, or are you more adventurous when it comes to your footwear? If you're in the latter camp, you probably get as excited as we do about updated versions of classic shoes, like Rita Ora's revamped Adidas Stan Smith sneakers or Nike's self-lacing shoes . Now, the latest sneaker overhaul we're obsessed with comes courtesy of Bandier's collaboration with Nike, which features a pair of rose-gold kicks we can't wait to get our hands on. \nAvailable at Bandier's Flatiron store location in New York City as well as on Nike's website , the collaboration features shoes and clothes with rose-gold touches. For fashion girls, this is music to our ears: You officially don't have to say goodbye to rosé just because it's fall. Could you really pass up the opportunity to match your shoes to your drink? \nScroll down to see Bandier's rose-gold new collaboration with Nike! 1 / 5",

      "title": "Nike’s new store in New York is like Legoland for people who love sports",
      "text": "When Heidi O’Neill, president of Nike’s direct-to-consumer business, was talking to potential customers about what they would want to see in a new Nike store, one father told her he’d like it to be a place where he could drop off his kids to play on a rainy day.\nThe company’s giant new store in New York, filling up five stories in a 55,000-square-foot space in the city’s Soho shopping corridor, is basically that. It’s like one of toymaker Lego’s popular Legoland stores, where customers go to play as (or more) often than they do to purchase, but for people who love sports. Beyond being a shiny new gem in Nike’s crown, it signals how the company is thinking about its future, and the ways that brick-and-mortar retail is changing in the age of e-commerce.\nThe store , originally scheduled to open on Nov. 11 but delayed because of a permit issue (the new opening date is Nov. 18 at noon) contains: a mini basketball court; a treadmill in front of screens simulating different outdoor runs; a small, enclosed soccer area; a customization shoe bar where shoppers can personalize a pair of Nike Air Force 1s; and dedicated coaches on staff who can put customers through drills to test out sneakers.\nThe indoor-outdoor running experience. (Nike) Cameras are set up all around the basketball court to capture the action from different angles. A camera beside the treadmill records a customer’s gait during a run, allowing a Nike staff member to analyze the results and recommend the best sneaker. And that customer can later access the footage through his online Nike account and share it on social media.\nNike spent years designing the store, according to Sean Madden, Nike’s senior director of service and experience for its direct-to-consumer business. “We’ve got a lab back on campus,” he says, referring to the company’s Oregon headquarters. “We’re trying things. We’re piloting in other stores quietly in the marketplace. And we’re finally bringing this to the consumer.” Nike plans to roll out successful elements of the Soho store through the rest of its retail fleet, which includes about 1,000 locations worldwide.\nOf course there are plenty of sneaker to buy, too. (Nike) Between those stores and Nike.com, the direct-to-consumer business is playing an ever-greater role in Nike’s sales mix. In 2015, direct sales accounted for $6.6 billion , or about 22% of Nike’s sales. But at its investor day last year, Nike said it plans to grow direct sales to $16 billion by 2020, which would be a full third of the $50 billion it’s aiming for in that year.\nThere are quite a few advantages for brands selling more of their products directly to customers. For one, margins are better, since they’re selling at the same price as retailers without having the retailers taking a share. It also means they’re less dependent on retailers that may find their businesses faltering, such as department stores or the recently shuttered Sports Authority . Not least of all, brands can control all their messaging themselves and connect directly with shoppers.\n“It is an incredibly important touchpoint,” O’Neill says of the store’s role in communicating Nike’s brand to the public. “We built this store with the idea of serving consumers one-to-one in ways that we haven’t.”\nFeel free to boot the ball. (Nike) A large brick-and-mortar store in New York is a costly investment when e-commerce sales are growing. But physical stores are still critical for brands , and the most forward-thinking companies recognize that for those stores to pay off they need to offer experiences that e-commerce can’t.\nSpeaking at a Nov. 10 conference on the future of retail, Lorna Hall, the head of market intelligence for trend-forecasting firm WGSN, said the future of retail stores will be increasingly about these interactive experiences, where “they’re treating space as a new territory, aligning [key performance indicators] more with marketing and media than selling per se.”\nJust a few blocks from Nike’s shiny new Soho shop, for instance, Pirch, which sells luxury home fixtures, has a large store where all the faucets, showers, ovens, and grills are functional . You can literally make an appointment to go shower there to test drive products before you buy them.\nRobin Lewis, who writes the retail blog The Robin Report, groups Pirch with other brands including Apple and Burberry that use experiences to detach shoppers from their phones or laptops and get them into stores, where once immersed in the experienced they will “stay longer and buy more.”\nAlways competitive, Nike thinks it can be a leader of this new push in retail.\nThis story has been updated with the store’s new opening date.
