      "title": "Lean story of McDonald's will leave you hungry for more",
      "text": "The story of McDonald’s is a quintessential American saga — it could be subtitled the life, rather than the death, of a salesman. Ray Kroc, a high school dropout and the son of immigrants, not only conquered the fast-food world, he started his assault when he was well into his 50s and wouldn’t taste success for another decade.\nIn 1961, with a $2.7 million loan, he bought out the two brothers who had started McDonald’s and began to run the company his way. With fewer than 1,000 franchises under his belt, Kroc took McDonald’s stock public in 1965 and became an instant millionaire, 33 times over. Today there are more than 36,000 McDonald’s worldwide.\nThat last numerical nugget is one of the many things readers won’t find in the surprisingly cursory duel biography, Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away (Dutton, 266 pp., ** out of four stars). It's not that author Lisa Napoli, an experienced journalist, hasn’t done considerable research or doesn’t cover the basics. She simply leaves things out that would have enlivened her narrative.\nThe first page is tantalizing enough, with the promise of a peek inside the gated world of those devil-may-care “one-percenters.” Ray Kroc apparently would fire people — actually, have his secretary do the honors — for drinking the wrong cocktail. “Manhattans, he thought, were for sissies,” Napoli writes. Joan, Ray’s third wife, also had an underling discharge “a once-beloved cook who deigned to ask for a modest raise after years of service.”\nAuthor Lisa Napoli. (Photo: Preston Wiles)\nBut thereafter the book settles into a fairly humdrum tale that offers little that is new or particularly insightful. Ray was a workaholic and a high functioning alcoholic, and he and Joan had some real donnybrooks. These are not explored in any detail, even though Joan once filed for divorce citing physical and mental cruelty and obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband. The couple reconciled.\nWe learn that Ray was a \"staunch conservative,\" that he ordered, for example, the flags at all McDonald’s to fly at full-staff after four Kent State students were killed by National Guardsmen in 1970. He gave more than $250,000 to Richard Nixon’s 1972 reelection campaign, but then the trail goes cold.\nJoan, on the other hand, was a liberal, something she hid from the world until after her husband’s death in 1984. In addition to embarking on a life of laudatory philanthropy, the widow gave $1 million to the Democratic Party in 1987 and $3.6 million to the Carter Center. (If she gave another penny to the Democrats before she died in 2003, the reader doesn’t find out).\nRay Kroc built McDonald's into a fast-food empire. (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images)\n“St. Joan of the Arches” was, indeed, a godsend to myriad causes, from National Public Radio to the Salvation Army, which alone received more than $1.5 billion (yes, billion) from her. She gave most of her fortune away; this is documented in too much detail.\nJoan Kroc, the author cautions, was not a saint. But rather than explore her complex personality, Napoli only provides bromides, such as, “She had a bawdy sense of humor, and she smoked like a fiend.” An example of an off-color joke would have been most welcome at this point.\nThe reader is left with many questions about Joan and Ray, who smoked and drank too much.\nMaybe we'll learn more from The Founder , the movie starring Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. It's set to open in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 16 and nationwide on Jan. 20.",

      "text": "November 8, 2016 Reader Resource \nPosition yourself for growth in 2017—join us live at the Entrepreneur 360 ™ Conference in Long Beach, Calif. on Nov. 16. Secure Your Seat » \nThe following excerpt is from Richard Koch and Greg Lockwood’s book Simplify . Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | iTunes \nOne day in 1954, a fifty-two-year-old man flew from Chicago to Los Angeles. The following day, bright and early, he drove sixty miles towards the Mojave Desert. His destination was a small, octagonal building, located on a corner in a small town. The stranger wasn’t impressed by the humble structure. It didn’t seem to fit with what he had heard. \nShortly before eleven o’clock, employees began to file in -- men dressed in spiffy white shirts, smart trousers and paper hats. The stranger liked that. The men began to trundle trolleys laden with food and drinks into the building, their tempo picking up so much that they reminded the stranger of ants bustling around a picnic. Cars began to arrive, the parking lot soon filled up, and lines began to form as customers stepped up to the windows. \nThe investigator was impressed by the activity, but still dubious. He joined the line and said to the man in front of him -- swarthy but well dressed, in a seersucker suit -- “Say, what’s the attraction here?” \n“Never eaten here before?” \n“Nope.” \n“Well, you’ll see. You’ll get the best hamburger you ever ate for just fifteen cents. And you don’t have to mess around with tipping waitresses.” \nThe stranger left the line to walk around the corner, where he found several workers sitting in the shade, gnawing on hamburgers. He approached a man in a carpenter’s apron and asked him how often he came there for lunch. \n“Every damn day,” he said without a pause in his munching. “Sure beats the old lady’s cold meatloaf sandwiches.” \nThe stranger was Ray Kroc, a dogged drink-machine salesman. After the lunchtime rush, he introduced himself to the drive-in restaurant’s bosses, Mac and Dick McDonald, and arranged to take them out to dinner. \nAs the brothers outlined their system that evening, Kroc became hooked by its simplicity and efficiency. The menu was strictly limited to just nine items, including drinks. The food comprised either hamburgers or cheeseburgers and fries. The burgers were all identical -- a tenth of a pound of beef, all cooked the same way. Whereas a coffee shop sold a hamburger for 30 cents, it was only 15 at McDonald’s, or four cents more for a cheeseburger. The star attraction was the French fries, though -- another bargain at 10 cents for a three-ounce bag. The menu was completed by coffee at a nickel a cup, soft drinks at a dime, or a large milkshake for 20 cents. That was it. \nThe brothers had started their business back in 1948, when they turned their barbecue restaurant into a slick assembly-line operation they called a “speedee service line.” At the time, the typical mass-market restaurant was a mom-and-pop coffee shop offering hundreds of items. The brothers’ nine-item menu never changed. Food was always cooked and served in the same automated way, so customers always got their meals immediately, when they were hot. They paid when they ordered, and cleared away their own debris after eating. \nAll of the food was good, especially the fries, yet Kroc stressed that the main attraction was the price. A meal at McDonald’s cost about half the equivalent at a coffee shop. How had Dick and Mac McDonald managed to do this? \nThey added value by subtraction. By removing menu variety, they made it much simpler to procure ingredients, operate the restaurant and cook and serve the food. By simplifying and automating the whole process, persuading customers to do some of the work, and producing assembly-line food, their labor costs per serving were reduced to a fraction of those of a typical coffee shop. The levels of throughput were astounding, too. The little shop that Ray Kroc visited had sales exceeding $400,000 a year (around $4 million in today’s money) -- more than that of an average (much bigger) McDonald’s today. \nBy sourcing beef and other ingredients in large quantities, a virtuous circle was created -- lower prices for hamburgers, leading to higher demand, further increasing purchasing muscle and overhead cost coverage, resulting in yet lower prices but also higher margins. Even when it was a tiny operation with just a handful of restaurants, McDonald’s had great purchasing power, which allowed it to cut costs. The restaurants needed to buy fewer than forty items in total to make their nine products, unlike a coffee shop which needed to purchase hundreds of items for its far more extensive menu. \nThey had essentially reinvented the restaurant and proved the economics of fast-food simplicity. In addition, there were subsidiary benefits: 1. Usefulness High-quality food. As Ray Kroc said, “The simplicity of the procedure allowed the McDonald’s to concentrate on quality in every step, and that was the trick.” Consistency and reliability -- an identical product time after time 2. Art Spiffy uniforms for sharp employees The Golden Arches Cleanliness and visible hygiene in the store The McDonald’s name and “M” branding 3. Ease of use Fast service No tipping \nKroc negotiated a deal with the brothers whereby he would franchise the new outlets, and in 1961, he bought the whole company for $2.7 million (about $21 million in today’s money). \nThen he set about turning McDonald’s into a big chain. He created a universal product of high quality, and produced a uniform system that allowed no variation, making it sufficiently simple to be franchised to thousands of entrepreneurs while still retaining absolute control and consistency. He developed a proprietary system that would deliver consistency for both customers and franchisees: Consistent menu -- no variants allowed -- and the same methods to attain the same food quality Sparkling clean toilets, restaurants and parking lots. Cleanliness was one of the four principles that Kroc stressed, along with quality, service and value. No pay telephones, jukeboxes or vending machines of any kind Founding the “Hamburger University” for franchisee and staff training Offering franchisees a simple product by providing them with a suitable ready site and financing Keeping the economics favorable, with a narrow product line, and helping the best suppliers to serve a large number of McDonald’s outlets and lower their costs, for example through bulk packaging and allowing them to deliver more items per stop \nIt’s clear that Kroc realized that the main purpose of his systems was to deliver a good product at an exceptionally low price. The bigger the scale of the operation, while allowing no variation in product and procedure, the lower the price. And the lower the price, the greater the customer satisfaction, sales, profits and value of the company. Kroc kept the price of McDonald’s hamburgers at 15 cents for nineteen years -- until 1967, when inflation brought about by President Johnson’s Great Society and the Vietnam War forced an increase. He authorized the increase to 18 cents reluctantly: “If you look at it from the customer’s point of view -- which is how I do it, because this guy is our real boss -- you see the importance of every penny.” This is the credo of every price-simplifier. \nWho created the greater value -- the McDonald brothers or Ray Kroc? It depends on your perspective. Financially, Kroc added far more. Yet, we could argue that the brothers created the product, the proposition, the brand, the pricing and indeed the system. The changes to their template since 1961 have been relatively minor. However, imitation is usually more vital than creation. Certainly, in this case, imitation created an extraordinarily valuable business with a global footprint. Ray Kroc added a simple, uniform, high-quality franchise system that cloned the McDonald’s formula to a degree that was truly mind-boggling. Key Points \n1. McDonald’s is excellent example of price-simplifying -- where subtraction and an assembly-line operation have slashed complexity and enabled costs to be halved. Could you automate an industry or service that has not yet experienced anything comparable? \n2. If you work in a service business, take heart that price-simplifying works as well in a service or retail setting as it does in manufacturing. \n3. With prices cut in half and the appropriate economic exploitation, world demand for fast-food hamburger meals has expanded to a degree that was unimaginable in 1948. Can you think of a pedestrian market today that could conceivably explode in a similar fashion if prices were at least halved through automation and co-opting customers and/or franchisees? \n4. Once again, the simplifying firm created a new, proprietary business system, with economics quite different from those of more complex restaurants. If you’re considering price-simplifying, how might you create a dramatically better economic system than whatever exists today in your market? \n5. The firm combined an exceptionally low price with greater usefulness (consistently high-quality food; play areas for children), art (especially the Golden Arches and instantly recognizable branding) and ease of use (speed). What might be the equivalent extra benefits in your industry?",

The BBC reports that the decision was upheld in July by a panel in charge of preserving the city’s history. \nBut McDonald’s says it has changed its plans to fit within the city’s guidelines, and claims it’s being discriminated against. It estimates that it will lose almost a million Euros a year for the next 18 years, and it wants Florence to pay up. \n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centres have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald’s said in a statement to the BBC. \n“We also have the right to say no,” Nardella told city council. \nThis isn’t the first time McDonald’s has had trouble opening a restaurant in Italy. Earlier this year, the Catholic church voiced its displeasure after the chain tried to open a restaurant just blocks away from the Vatican. \nAlex Hider is a writer for the E.W.

You're in luck. \nNutella fans: Rejoice. \nMcDonald’s Italy announced its latest addition to its menu yesterday: a Nutella burger filled with the sweet concoction. \nThe “Sweety con Nutella” includes two soft sweet rolls filled with the hazelnut spread, and the company describes it as “a soft sweetness you won’t be able to resist.” \nMcDonald’s Italy launched the product yesterday, posting the unusual item on Facebook. \nLast month, McDonald's Italy introduced the “Sundae Pocket” —waffles stuffed with vanilla soft serve, fudge, and hazelnuts—for those with a sweet tooth, another dessert-centric treat.",

McDonald's just announced a new kind of burger with chipotle sauce, which upsets me because I dislike chipotle sauce, and this means McDonald's will be spending slightly less time and money producing burgers I do like.Sure, all their other burgers will still be available, and there's plenty of other fast food joints out there that have good burgers I could go to as well, but McDonald's' decision to make a chipotle burger forces me to acknowledge the fact that there exist people who like things I don't, and that makes me sad. I don't mean to sound rude, I just really believe the world would be a better place if everyone did what I wanted - and only what I wanted - all the time.If you're going to respond, please remember to be respectful, as I always am.",

      "text": "McDonald's Latest Burger Is Going To Make You Queasy (Just By Looking At It) Is there no end to fast food ingenuity? No, there isn't. Owner, Howard Raucous LLC @ ChrisMatyszczyk WRITE A COMMENT You're not going to believe this one.   \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nFast food, like the rest of America, used to represent excess. \nLately, though, it's been easy to get the impression that there's a new focus toward health, wellness and even salady sanctimoniousness. \nNot, it seems, in every quarter of fast food. \nThere's still room for excess beyond those Carl's Jr. ads in which there's piles of food perched between two straining buns. \nThe latest -- and, some might conclude, the greatest -- step toward fascinating excess is a new burger released by McDonald's. \nIt's not the sort of burger that you're generally used to. Not unless you're fond of making your own bun-enclosed cathedrals of gorging. \nThis one comes in a burger box and does have something that resembles a bun. \nHowever, instead of being filled with meat it's filled with Nutella. \nShould you have avoided this concoction, it's a chocolate-hazelnut spread that is sweet and, to my palate, a touch sickly. \nStill, a few weeks ago the FDA was petitioned to consider it a spread like jam rather than a dessert topping. If the FDA agrees, then the approved serving size would be reduced. \nBut back to the McDonald's Nutella Burger. \nYou'll either be pained or delighted that this fine new joy has only been released in Italy as part of the McCafé menu. \nYes, it's an entirely new category: the dessert burger. \nMcDonald's doesn't actually call it the Nutella Burger. Instead, it's called the QuarterNutPounder. \nI'm sorry. That's not quite right. It's called the Sweety With Nutella. Apparently, the bun is baked with the Nutella already in there, to give it that crusty, beefy look. \nYou can imagine, of course, that there is already a sugar-high over this new menu item. \nOn Instagram , people are proudly displaying their unboxing images. There are even mouth-watering videos . \nI can see you already making arrangements to fly to Italy just to experience this newest wonder of fast food. \nHoney, we can take in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the canals of Venice and the Coliseum Of Choco-Hazelnut. \nThe thing to ask yourself, however, is this: Can the Nutella Burger possibly be more exciting than McDonald's chocolate-drizzled fries that are already available in Japan ?   12, 2016 Advertisement",

      "text": "What goes on inside McDonald’s kitchens in the UAE? We go behind the scenes to find out how McDonald’s UAE works. Emiratis warned to stay clear of Donald Trump protests in US \nIt is the fast food chain known for supersize meals, questionable nutritional content and burgers that look exactly the same – at every single store across the globe. \nMcDonald’s has been seeking to overcome that stereotype in recent years, with the introduction of ‘healthy options’ for diners of all ages. And now it is inviting the public behind the scenes and into the kitchens as part of attempts to shake off the negative image. \nWe were among the first in the UAE to get the chance to see what lies beyond the Golden Arches. Behind the neon signs and backlit boards lies a fascinating and highly regimented operation to ensure that food is never spoiled, never off and never varies from the picture the customer sees. \nIt also involves a remarkable operation to source food locally – much to our surprise. Here we go behind the scenes to examine just how McDonald’s UAE works. \n\nLOCALLY SOURCED \nFayez Ismail is hugely enthusiastic about McDonald’s. In fact, he began his career 18 years ago in the chain’s first UAE store mastering the French fry. Now he’s in charge of operations for the country’s 143 stores. He ensures that milk from Kuwait goes into the coffees, the sauces from Egypt are squirted onto the buns, Saudi cheese makes it into the burgers and lettuce comes from the Delmonte farms outside Dubai. In fact, a large portion of McDonald’s produce is sourced locally. Ismail says: “In McDonald’s we like to order our food from nearby markets. We don’t like to go overseas or very far to get our product. The sauces are from Egypt, the milk from Kuwait and the lettuce and tomatoes are from Delmonte farms in UAE.” So enthusiastic is Ismail, he says he, and in fact a large amount of the staff eat McDonald’s daily. “Me, I eat McDonald’s every day – for 18 years. The crew here, they eat two meals a day from McDonald’s,” he says assuredly. \nSLICK OPERATION \nSo in-house, the company is passionate, and now McDonald’s is inviting the public in to see all the happenings with the Open Door programme. UAE residents can book a tour of the McDonald’s kitchens, and see the process behind how their burgers, French fries and drinks are made. Interestingly, the company disposes of used vegetable oils through a sustainable company – that converts the oil to biodiesel, which incidentally, the McDonald’s delivery trucks are then run on. Ismail points this out on the tour – showing us the large oil drums full of used vegetable oil. Walking through the back rooms and the kitchen, it’s astounding how regulated every component of McDonald’s is. Charts on the wall depict the specific order burgers are meant to be stacked: the order of sauce onto the bun, under the cheese, above the patty with military precision. Charts are hung throughout the kitchen, managers are expected to check every temperature of every food area several times per day. Surprisingly, the beef patties (which are 100 per cent beef) are cooked in a mere 38 seconds. When asked how this happens so fast, Ismail demonstrates the standardised grill, it heats to 155F (68C) immediately, and the double-sided grill quickly cooks the thin patty through. As for the French fries, they are disposed of every seven minutes – which some may feel is wasteful, however, Ismail explains, is to ensure freshness. He says: “We don’t keep them any longer than seven minutes – that’s why sometimes customers have to wait for fresh fries. “People might get frustrated, but it’s to ensure the product is quality.” \n‘PINK GOOP’ \nAs someone who is health-conscious, and a vegetarian, I have always been wary of McDonald’s. Opting for it on the rare occasion, I approached the experience with a fair amount of scepticism. I’ve seen the videos, read the reports on the pesticides, the food that doesn’t decompose and seen the videos of the pink goop they say is the McDonald’s chicken nuggets. Questioning Ismail, I ask about the reports online of McDonald’s food not decomposing even after six months and the video showing ‘pink goop’ that is reported to be McDonald’s chicken. He responds: “What is on the internet is on the internet. We have buns from local certified suppliers – you saw it yourself.” He says the sheer numbers of clientele is what matters, the fast-food giant doesn’t give to rumours. “The number of customers coming here everyday proves we have a good reputation,” he says. “It’s only happening on the websites or when people are exaggerating, or saying something out of context. If people don’t trust our quality or they don’t like us, they’ll never come in these numbers.” \ncaitlyn@7days.ae",

Fortunately, you won't only be left to call or drive around in search of it this time around as the company has put out an official free McRib locator smartphone app .\n\nUnfortunately for Android users, currently it's only available for iOS off of the iTunes store. You can find it here .\n\nBeyond helping to find the McRib near you, the app also lets you send your friends directions to find the McRib.\n\nPrices vary with location but you can expect to find the McRib for around $3 to $4 at participating locations, while supplies last.\n\nPhoto via McDonald's.

      "text": "Would you eat a McDonald's Nutella burger? 1:46 PM, Nov 13, 2016   \nMcDonald's customers in Italy are in for a real treat - Nutella burgers. Late last week, McDonald's announced that it is combining the hazelnut cocoa spread with its signature buns at its Italian locations. \nWould you consider the results \"delicious?\" \n\"A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist,\" McDonald's promotion said. \"Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center.\" \nWhile the Nutella burgers are not available in North America yet, the sandwich has generated a fair amount of buzz online. McDonald's post announcing the new sandwich garnered 90,000 shares on Facebook. \nSandwiches are not the only way Nutella can be consumed. It can also be used on waffles, donuts, brownies, cakes, apples, ice cream and more. \nMcDonald's Sweety con Nutella item might be one of McDonald's healthier items at just 256 calories.

      "text": "share Dear McDonald's, please bring this to the USA! \nMcDonald's Italy has announced the latest menu item, a ' Sweety con Nutella'.... AKA a Nutella burger! Right now it's only available on Italy's McCafe's menu. \n\n    \nThe treat is served in a clamshell box, just like an actual burger, according to Brand Eating . The 'burger' is actually just a glob of hazelnut spread between two bread buns. The top bun has a brown strip baked around the edge to make it look like an actual burger patty! Even though this Nutella burger is only available in Italy, it's going viral all over the internet! \nWould you try it?",

Late last week, McDonald's announced that it is combining the hazelnut cocoa spread with its signature buns at its Italian locations. \nWould you consider the results \"delicious?\" \n\"A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist,\" McDonald's promotion said. \"Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center.\" \nWhile the Nutella burgers are not available in North America yet, the sandwich has generated a fair amount of buzz online. McDonald's post announcing the new sandwich garnered 90,000 shares on Facebook. \nSandwiches are not the only way Nutella can be consumed. It can also be used on waffles, donuts, brownies, cakes, apples, ice cream and more. \nMcDonald's Sweety con Nutella item might be one of McDonald's healthier items at just 256 calories.

      "text": "Close HONS \nThis cover image released by Dutton shows, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" by Lisa Napoli. (Dutton via AP) AP New book explores supersized philanthropy of Joan Kroc By ANN LEVIN Associated Press Updated ( … ) HONS \nThis cover image released by Dutton shows, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" by Lisa Napoli. (Dutton via AP) \n\"Ray & Joan\" (Dutton), by Lisa Napoli \nIn 2012, journalist Lisa Napoli did a story about a peace monument in Santa Monica, California, that had fallen into disrepair. She soon learned the identity of the anonymous donor who had paid for it years before: Joan Kroc, heir to the McDonald's hamburger fortune. Curiosity piqued, Napoli went looking for a biography of the philanthropist, only to discover that none existed. So she decided to tell the story herself. \nThe result is \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" and as the title suggests, it's less about the impetuous, strong-willed woman whom some called St. Joan of the Arches than it is about her passionate and tempestuous relationship with the brash, driven entrepreneur behind one of the world's most successful brands. \nBoth were remarkable individuals, but given the limited options available to women of her generation, it's unlikely that Joan would have left as big a mark had she not married Ray. For him, it was love at first sight from the moment he first set eyes on her playing the organ at a fancy supper club in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nBoth were married, and it would take another dozen years — and a second marriage and divorce for him — before they finally got hitched. When they did, things didn't get easier. She filed for divorce over his drinking and violent temper. They ended up reconciling, and she channeled her discontent — and her considerable energy — into funding programs to treat alcoholism and much more. \nAs long as Ray, a staunch conservative, was alive, Joan mostly kept her politics to herself. After his death in 1984, she began to openly support a variety of liberal and humanitarian causes: the Democratic Party, nuclear disarmament and AIDS research, to name just a few. When she died in 2003, the Salvation Army and National Public Radio were her biggest beneficiaries. \nNapoli tells their story in a brisk, efficient fashion, often sacrificing psychological complexity for melodrama. (About her new life as a socialite: \"Joan found it all so boring she wanted to cry.\") She's also prone to sweeping generalizations (\"Levity was in short supply for the class of 1945\") and cliched language, noting on two occasions that Ray had ketchup in his blood. \nStill, it's a fascinating story, and it arrives at an auspicious moment. In January, the Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters. \n___ \nThis story corrects that Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters in January not December.

(Dutton via AP) \n\"Ray & Joan\" (Dutton), by Lisa Napoli \nIn 2012, journalist Lisa Napoli did a story about a peace monument in Santa Monica, California, that had fallen into disrepair. She soon learned the identity of the anonymous donor who had paid for it years before: Joan Kroc, heir to the McDonald's hamburger fortune. Curiosity piqued, Napoli went looking for a biography of the philanthropist, only to discover that none existed. So she decided to tell the story herself. \nThe result is \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" and as the title suggests, it's less about the impetuous, strong-willed woman whom some called St. Joan of the Arches than it is about her passionate and tempestuous relationship with the brash, driven entrepreneur behind one of the world's most successful brands. \nBoth were remarkable individuals, but given the limited options available to women of her generation, it's unlikely that Joan would have left as big a mark had she not married Ray. For him, it was love at first sight from the moment he first set eyes on her playing the organ at a fancy supper club in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nBoth were married, and it would take another dozen years — and a second marriage and divorce for him — before they finally got hitched. When they did, things didn't get easier. She filed for divorce over his drinking and violent temper. They ended up reconciling, and she channeled her discontent — and her considerable energy — into funding programs to treat alcoholism and much more. \nAs long as Ray, a staunch conservative, was alive, Joan mostly kept her politics to herself. After his death in 1984, she began to openly support a variety of liberal and humanitarian causes: the Democratic Party, nuclear disarmament and AIDS research, to name just a few. When she died in 2003, the Salvation Army and National Public Radio were her biggest beneficiaries. \nNapoli tells their story in a brisk, efficient fashion, often sacrificing psychological complexity for melodrama. (About her new life as a socialite: \"Joan found it all so boring she wanted to cry.\") She's also prone to sweeping generalizations (\"Levity was in short supply for the class of 1945\") and cliched language, noting on two occasions that Ray had ketchup in his blood. \nStill, it's a fascinating story, and it arrives at an auspicious moment. In January, the Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters. \n___ \nThis story corrects that Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters in January not December.

      "text": "0 View Caption Hide Caption \nPalm Beach County and Treasure Coast area McDonald’s restaurants are among the first in the nation to offer the chain’s latest creations — larger and smaller versions of the Big Mac. \nStarting this week, local McDonald’s franchises will be offering the Grand Mac and Mac Jr. The two new items will be available for a limited time on McDonald’s Florida menu in advance of a national rollout in early 2017, the company said. \nThe two are twists on the original Big Mac which boasts two 100 percent all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions on a sesame seed bun. \nThe Grand Mac is made with two 100 percent pure beef patties for a total of one-third pound with two slices of American cheese and special sauce served on a larger sesame seed bun with lettuce, onions and pickles. \nThe Mac Jr. is a single-layer Big Mac that’s easier to eat on the go. \n“The Big Mac is a legend and a great-tasting burger with hints of pickle relish, mustard, garlic and onions,” said McDonald’s Chef Mike Haracz. “We listened to our customers who told us they wanted different ways to enjoy the one-of-a-kind Big Mac taste. The classic combination of ingredients remains timeless and customers around the world continue to enjoy its signature taste.” \n",

(Dutton via AP) AP New book explores supersized philanthropy of Joan Kroc By ANN LEVIN Associated Press Updated 0 HONS \nThis cover image released by Dutton shows, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" by Lisa Napoli. (Dutton via AP) \n\"Ray & Joan\" (Dutton), by Lisa Napoli \nIn 2012, journalist Lisa Napoli did a story about a peace monument in Santa Monica, California, that had fallen into disrepair. She soon learned the identity of the anonymous donor who had paid for it years before: Joan Kroc, heir to the McDonald's hamburger fortune. Curiosity piqued, Napoli went looking for a biography of the philanthropist, only to discover that none existed. So she decided to tell the story herself. \nThe result is \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" and as the title suggests, it's less about the impetuous, strong-willed woman whom some called St. Joan of the Arches than it is about her passionate and tempestuous relationship with the brash, driven entrepreneur behind one of the world's most successful brands. \nBoth were remarkable individuals, but given the limited options available to women of her generation, it's unlikely that Joan would have left as big a mark had she not married Ray. For him, it was love at first sight from the moment he first set eyes on her playing the organ at a fancy supper club in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nBoth were married, and it would take another dozen years — and a second marriage and divorce for him — before they finally got hitched. When they did, things didn't get easier. She filed for divorce over his drinking and violent temper. They ended up reconciling, and she channeled her discontent — and her considerable energy — into funding programs to treat alcoholism and much more. \nAs long as Ray, a staunch conservative, was alive, Joan mostly kept her politics to herself. After his death in 1984, she began to openly support a variety of liberal and humanitarian causes: the Democratic Party, nuclear disarmament and AIDS research, to name just a few. When she died in 2003, the Salvation Army and National Public Radio were her biggest beneficiaries. Looking for fun? Get recommendations sent to your inbox Sign Up!

(About her new life as a socialite: \"Joan found it all so boring she wanted to cry.\") She's also prone to sweeping generalizations (\"Levity was in short supply for the class of 1945\") and cliched language, noting on two occasions that Ray had ketchup in his blood. \nStill, it's a fascinating story, and it arrives at an auspicious moment. In January, the Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters. \n___ \nThis story corrects that Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters in January not December.

(Dutton via AP) AP New book explores supersized philanthropy of Joan Kroc By ANN LEVIN Associated Press Updated 0 HONS \nThis cover image released by Dutton shows, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" by Lisa Napoli. (Dutton via AP) \n\"Ray & Joan\" (Dutton), by Lisa Napoli \nIn 2012, journalist Lisa Napoli did a story about a peace monument in Santa Monica, California, that had fallen into disrepair. She soon learned the identity of the anonymous donor who had paid for it years before: Joan Kroc, heir to the McDonald's hamburger fortune. Curiosity piqued, Napoli went looking for a biography of the philanthropist, only to discover that none existed. So she decided to tell the story herself. \nThe result is \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" and as the title suggests, it's less about the impetuous, strong-willed woman whom some called St. Joan of the Arches than it is about her passionate and tempestuous relationship with the brash, driven entrepreneur behind one of the world's most successful brands. \nBoth were remarkable individuals, but given the limited options available to women of her generation, it's unlikely that Joan would have left as big a mark had she not married Ray. For him, it was love at first sight from the moment he first set eyes on her playing the organ at a fancy supper club in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nBoth were married, and it would take another dozen years — and a second marriage and divorce for him — before they finally got hitched. When they did, things didn't get easier. She filed for divorce over his drinking and violent temper. They ended up reconciling, and she channeled her discontent — and her considerable energy — into funding programs to treat alcoholism and much more. \nAs long as Ray, a staunch conservative, was alive, Joan mostly kept her politics to herself. After his death in 1984, she began to openly support a variety of liberal and humanitarian causes: the Democratic Party, nuclear disarmament and AIDS research, to name just a few. When she died in 2003, the Salvation Army and National Public Radio were her biggest beneficiaries.",

      "text": "Have you ever entered a McDonald’s fast-food establishment and found it difficult to breathe? Not a panic attack, not claustrophobia, not an overwhelming affront to your sensibilities – no, just plain asphyxiation. Here’s the skinny: the ghost of Ray Kroc had been visiting, making sure the joint was shipshape. And Ray – in the tradition of the high-octane salesmen of the mid-20th century – would suck all the oxygen out of any room he occupied.\nJournalist Lisa Napoli’s Ray & Joan is remarkable, first of all, in its placid waters. If two people could ignite a conflagration, it was Ray and Joan Kroc, they who had the final word in the first iteration – and much abiding – of McDonald’s. McDonald’s is one of those single-name institutions up there with Nero, Napoleon, and Charo. This is a playful, even waggish work of biography, carrying its research lightly, yet never missing a beat or frivolous or judgmental. It feels like a careful grave rubbing, catching the nicks, fadings, and fine lines – gold and bronze chalk against a dark background.\n\"Ray & Joan\" is a biography in three parts: Ray, Joan, and McDonald’s. They move about in their intimate orbits, but they also spend significant time alone. A full-length biography of any of the three might be too much to swallow, overstuffed with junk you don’t want (like those flaccid pickles on the burgers); as a trio, they have the energy to complete their leg of the relay.\nRecommended: Famous opening lines: Take our literature quiz The genesis of McDonald’s, and its first stumbling steps, is a fortuitous intersection of business acumen and the progress of American history. Napoli gives the business story room to move, while keeping it neatly framed. The brothers McDonald (yes, it’s true) left Manchester, N.H., to seek their fortune out West. After a few flops, they hit on food service, opening “an octagonal open-air food stand and cut a deal with Sunkist to buy fallen fruit.” The “Airdrome,” named after the nearby public flying field in parched Monrovia, Calif., had a ready market for their fresh orange juice and hot dogs in the thrill riders, as well as the traffic from Route 66. The move to San Bernardino and the opening of the McDonalds’ “Barbeque,” proved even more lucrative.\nTest your knowledge Famous opening lines: Take our literature quiz Yes, the era of road expansion and a car in every garage, when it wasn’t out road tripping on 22¢-a-gallon gasoline, when speedy service was the name of the game. They read the winds of change correctly. They would put Fordism into action in their burger, fries, and shake place; McDonald’s was Levittown on a bun. The use of paper products added zip to the grab-and-go cultural (and the blossoming of roadside litter), plus paper was sanitary (if disposed of properly); the flu epidemic was not long forgotten. This was the unfolding of the zeitgeist, and McDonald’s was making its mark during the 1930s and 1940s into a serious dent by the 1950s.\nNapoli writes of the McDonald’s (then under the nom de commencement “Speedee’s”) 1948 liftoff: “Four months in, a miraculous turnaround occurred, for no particular reason. Cabbies came, then construction workers, then kids, and, soon, lines of hungry customers.” No reason? The hamburgers were 15¢, the shakes a treat, the fries to die for.\nThen a successful paper-cup salesman from Chicago made the McDonald’s scene. Napoli draws Ray Kroc honestly without making you loathe him outright – a minor miracle. Kroc had a voice like a gas explosion. He was rude and imperious. He treated people as things that only influenced the bottom line. He was a boor, a peacock, and a mean drunk (Pass the Early Times! You call that a shot?!). He also knew what people wanted to eat, especially when he surrounded himself with smart advisors, and even more especially when he came under the protective wing of “the Twelve Apostles,” a dozen institutional investors who supplied Kroc with the $2.7 million he needed to buy out Dick and Maurice McDonald, and their last name.\nBefore the McDonald boys left, a template had been drawn. There was the red-and-white-tiled workplace, and destiny’s numinous signifier: the neon-trimmed golden arches, “the building itself now a functional sign.” Kroc knew about food and appearance. He could make an Idaho fry (don’t forget the lard), a decent milkshake during WWII sugar rationing (ever hear of corn syrup?), a clean, well-lit place, and knew to hire all-male workers (no distractions). The franchises fell into orderly fashion. Then Kroc bought the land out from under them. One might have owned a McDonald’s franchise, but it sat squarely, rent-wise, in the McDonald corporate fiefdom. That was where the chief would make his millions and billions, that and taking McDonald’s stock public – “unfathomable abundance, a spigot that could not be shut off.” Still can’t.\nJoan was a very different kettle of fish. Ray’s public relations team told him that a little philanthropy went a long way. Joan truly wanted to give back. She had always been a hardworking woman, her youth not destitute but this side of hardscrabble. She and her first husband threw themselves into their McDonald’s franchise. As she made her way into Ray’s arms and up the corporate ladder, she became known as the “vice president for equilibrium,” to keep the warring top bananas from peeling one another.\nWhen Ray finally went to whatever his rewards, Joan took to philanthropy with avidity, writes Napoli. Joan liked her baubles – the 42-carat pear-shaped yellow diamond necklace, the 22-carat diamond ring, the “dark blue gray diamond; pink diamonds, colorless ones, yellow, too” – and “she gambled like, well, like a woman once ranked forty-ninth richest in the world.”\nFoundations gave her the vapors; she would rather write a check. Anonymously. She gave to noble causes and to her fancies. First she gave to the fight against alcoholism, to children with cancer, to towns experiencing natural disasters, to zoos and theaters and relay runs, “Grandmothers for Peace,” peace initiatives, AIDS research, hospices, child-abuse prevention, national public radio, opera and special Olympics, animal shelters, soup kitchens, the Crazy Horse Foundation. She also liked the Salvation Army, a lot.\nWhen she died she had a couple billion more to offload. Peace studies and the Ronald McDonald House got plenty, and NPR has every reason to call her an angel. But the Salvation Army (“She admired their resolve, their lifestyle choices [that is, they weren’t alcoholic barbarians like Ray], and their dedication, even if formal religion wasn’t her cup of tea”) found itself on the receiving end of $1,500,000,000.00.\n“Joan was a wildly unpredictable study in extremes.” Yes, fortunately. She gave over $10,000,000.00 to AIDS research. Resolve and dedication, all good; unpredictable, even better.",

      "text": "De'Aaron Fox was in no hurry. He could see what he needed. Sure, he was at the McDonald's All-American Game in Chicago. Sure, he was the most heralded member of an incoming Kentucky freshman class that he himself referred to as a \"superteam.\"\nBut he could see what he needed to do.      \n\"I'm going to have to put on weight,\" he told Bleacher Report. \"That's the biggest difference between high school and college basketball.\"\nHe sounded patient, measured about it. This was going to be a process. Development takes time, after all. It's about staying patient. Taking baby steps. One step after another, making progress one year after...\nHA!\nOf course it's not. Maybe it was once, but nobody in basketball thinks like that anymore.\nFox's plan for his maturation was to take care of it all in seventeen months, or roughly 510 days. So much for patient . And he's already well into the process. He started well before he enrolled at Kentucky.\nHe changed his diet in the middle of his senior year in high school. \"I don't eat McDonald's anymore. Not anything too greasy,\" he said (apparently forgetting who was sponsoring the game he was playing in).",

      "text": "McDonald’s Corp.’s Sriracha Big Mac might have the millennial appeal the fast-food giant has been missing.\nMcDonald’s MCD, -0.48% announced Monday that it is testing the Sriracha Big Mac in 126 Ohio restaurants through Dec. 31. Sriracha is a spicy sauce found in many dishes across Southeast Asia.\nMcDonald’s is also testing Sriracha Big Mac sauce, which can be used for dipping McNuggets and French fries, or added to customize other items on the menu.\nMcDonald’s will gather feedback about the sandwich to decide whether to take it nationwide.\nThe Sriracha Big Mac is a “fresh take on a classic American sandwich,” according to a statement from Scott Nickell, the Central Ohio Co-op president, who said it’s a way to add the “heat and zing that consumers have grown to love from Sriracha.”\nSee also: The restaurant recession has arrived\nMcDonald's Struggling to Win Burger Battle (1:53) McDonald's is struggling to restore the appeal of the Big Mac and its other burgers, as competitors pull in customers with gourmet, made-to-order hamburgers. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains.\nChilies in many forms have been popping up on menus of all kinds, including a chile mocha that was introduced at Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.98% in September. In homes across the country, one might also find Sriracha popcorn and potato chips , or a jar of Sriracha, which can be used for making mayos, aiolis and more.\nSriracha isn’t just popular among the eating population, but, more specifically, it’s popular among millennials, who are a driving force behind the spread of the new flavor, Pat Cobe, senior editor of menu analysis at Technomic, a research and consulting firm, told MarketWatch.\nSee also: Starbucks embraces the chili trend with its latest seasonal drink\nRead also: This is what happens when fast-food restaurants go ‘local’\nMillennials have not exactly been flocking to McDonald’s, according to a memo that was passed around among operators earlier this year. Only one in five millennials have tried a Big Mac, according to the memo, which said the sandwich “has gotten less relevant.” A “sensory” panel was reportedly helping the fast-food chain focus on flavor.\nSee also: McDonald’s problem: Just one in five millennials has tried a Big Mac\nMcDonald’s has hosted a “Spice It Up” event in Canada, which featured chicken and Angus beef sandwiches with Sriracha sauce, Chief Executive Stephen Easterbrook told analysts on the third-quarter earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\nIn the latest quarter, McDonald’s attributed better-than-expected earnings results to the continuing popularity of its all-day breakfast and the introduction of a Chicken McNuggets recipe that eliminates artificial preservatives.\nSee also: If you don’t have a Taco Bell nearby, you probably will soon\nIn the spring, McDonald’s tested a bigger Big Mac, the Grand Mac, and a smaller Mac Jr., which was meant to be “easier to eat on the go.”\nMcDonald’s shares are down 0.5% in Tuesday trading, and down 0.7% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% is up 6.2% for the year to date, and the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.21% s up 8.3% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Trump Addresses Supporters After Stunning Victory Donald Trump's Priorities in First 100 Days Buffett just taught investors a valuable lesson ... again",

      "text": "close more Lisa Napoli, author of \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away.\" (Courtesy Preston Wiles) Ray Kroc took McDonald's restaurants from a small franchising operation to a global brand. His wife Joan left over $1 billion to various charitable organizations. Their story is now being told in a new book. Author Lisa Napoli ( @lisanapoli ) joins Here & Now 's Jeremy Hobson to talk about \" Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave it All Away .\" Book Excerpt: 'Ray & Joan' The cover of \"Ray & Joan.\" (Courtesy Dutton) By Lisa Napoli Even before she married Ray Kroc, Joan learned it was possible to outsource bad news. When she agreed to Ray’s proposal the second time—six years after first accepting and reneging—Ray had his lawyer break it to his then-wife that he wanted a divorce. Ray was notorious for having his trusted secretary fire employees for the slightest infraction, like wearing what he deemed an inappropriate hat or drinking the wrong cocktail. (Manhattans, he thought, were for sissies. Inevitably, the next day, in the hazy aftermath of the heated moment, he’d wonder why the person hadn’t shown up for work. After he died in 1984, leaving her heir to a fortune greater than one person could reasonably spend in a hundred lifetimes, Joan followed Ray’s example. Having decided she no longer wanted her former son‑in‑law to serve as her proxy on the board of that “chauvinistic corporation” McDonald’s, she sent her Gulfstream jet to Chicago to pick up her chief advisor and bring him to her home in San Diego for a chat, then dispatched him back to company headquarters in suburban Chicago to relay her wishes—despite the fact that the ex‑son‑in‑law lived just up the street from her. Feeling betrayed by a once-beloved cook who deigned to ask for a modest raise after years of service, she turned to another member of her personal staff to dismiss him. Now, in June 2003, faced with the harsh reality that she was dying, Joan requested her personal physician break the difficult news to her immediate family. It was early summer in southern California, a gloomy gray blotting the morning skies. Leaves on the eight hundred trees in and around Joan’s meticulously manicured thirteen-acre estate, Montagna de la Paloma—built on land owned long ago by the earliest movie stars— feathered softly in a light breeze. The fragrant scent of blooming roses sweetened the dry desert air. She’d humored her head gardener, who’d pleaded for the go‑ahead to plant hundreds of the thorny bushes. He liked having a ready source of cut flowers. With the door to the family room closed and Joan nowhere in sight, the doctor held up a scan of the matriarch’s brain, riddled with cancer. “This is the saddest day of my life,” he said solemnly, explaining the nuances of this particular menace, a glioblastoma that had been slowly impeding Joan’s vision, her speech, her balance. The diagnosis clicked into focus what the family had been observing for a while. Linda, Joan’s only child, and Linda’s four children, all women now, felt something had been off in the typically buoyant seventy-four-year-old’s step. In March, she had radiated joy at the gala opening of one of her pet projects, surprising the crowd as she took to the stage with the hired entertainment for the night, Tony Bennett. And yet, to those who knew her, there was something not quite right. At this point, the doctor revealed, the cancer would begin to grow at warp speed, wending its way through her brain, impacting every bit of her function, with the terrible, inevitable outcome: Joan had three to nine months to live. A moment of silence pierced the room as the sad information soaked in, after which a few of the girls began to sob. The others froze in shock. Only after she was sure the message had been relayed did Joan hobble in, masking her fractured gait as best she could. She had always been a blur of motion and cigarette smoke, action and forward momentum. Joan vibrated with life so intensely, it was impossible for anyone in her orbit to imagine a day when she wouldn’t be present. So game, so intrepid, so opinionated and tough, Joan was a wildly unpredictable study in extremes. She’d hop into her jet—her prized possession—as casually as if it were a convertible, off to Vegas to gamble for sixteen hours straight, winning or losing a million bucks; or rouse her great-grandson for a trip to the convenience store for a hot dog in the middle of the night. Yet she was just as likely to feast on a simple salad for dinner and retire at seven p.m. after phoning to find help for some itinerant soul she’d discovered in the parking lot of her neighborhood McDonald’s. Publicly, she’d appear meticulously put together in stylish Givenchy or elegant St. John, perfumed with a spicy hint of Yves Saint Laurent’s Opium, her hair so neatly coiffed it wouldn’t move in a strong breeze. Many mornings after waking, she might whisk down the hill, hair wrapped in a turban to mask the impact of a night of sleep, so she could grab a Diet Coke (for her) and a Big Mac (for the lucky pooch who got to ride along). Occasionally, she’d forget her purse and the kind cashier, who had no idea who she was, would wave her through; other times, she’d proffer a hundred-dollar tip. Even her collection of a half dozen dogs exemplified her lopsided nature. She had a thing for strays, among them a three-legged creature. She’d drive her staff bonkers by crossing the border to Tijuana, dognapping some mangy critter from a sad, destitute existence on the streets, whisking it back in the trunk of her Mercedes to a luxurious life of filet mignon. Others in her collection were prissy purebred Cavalier King Charles spaniels with pedigrees worthy of the royalty they were bred to serve. She’d fallen in love with a particularly cute one named Ralph she’d seen on a website, and sent her plane to transport both the doting breeder and the dog from Ohio. When the critters passed away, they were laid to rest with reverence in a pet cemetery on her grounds. Halloween would never be the same without Joan dressed up in costume, gaily dispensing Snickers bars to the trick‑or‑treaters traipsing around her tony neighborhood, Fairbanks Ranch, one of the wealthiest in the nation, where armed guards at the entrance gate added a layer of protection to Joan’s already impenetrable life. On the day her family learned the news, she was as resolute as ever. “I don’t want any tears,” she said, waving her hands, facing her heartbroken family. “I’ve had a great life. Let’s make the most of the last days I have.” She intended to fully live those few weeks and months, not die them. The next morning, she kept her appointment to grab breakfast at McDonald’s with one of her granddaughters and her great-grandson, pausing for just a moment when they arrived home, with the boy safely out of the car, to allow the young woman to cry. There was much work to be done. With the help of the coexecutors of her estate, Dick Starmann, a former McDonald’s executive, and Nancy Trestick, a woman who’d risen through the ranks in her secretarial pool, Joan set about attacking the business of dying with the same chaotic zeal with which she’d lived, working through the details of her last wishes as if she were making the guest list for a party. Before she breathed her last, she’d throw a party for herself, too. All tallied—this property; her Gulfstream IV jet, decorated in her chosen mauvy pinks and as lush as a Ritz-Carlton; jewels fit for the royalty of several kingdoms; $100 million in a wide-ranging art collection of serene impressionist florals, majestic Renoirs, comely nudes, and Rockwell Americana; and the seemingly endless pools of cash and investments—Joan had about $3 billion at her disposal. Three billion dollars—a fortune amassed because of a roadside hamburger stand started six decades ago by two hard‑up brothers she’d never met, a hundred long, dusty miles north of where she now sat. Joan, who arrived on this earth the year before the Great Depression gripped and paralyzed the nation; whose father struggled without work for seven years, and ran the numbers for the neighborhood; whose mother sold coffee beans door‑to‑door to help the family survive. There were challenges besides money. Joan had long been at odds with her mother, though time and age had mellowed the fierce battles of her youth. Scars from her early days had never healed; she carried a pain that never abated. She’d hint at it at odd moments, usually with people she didn’t know well, and then tuck the secret back away. Adulthood hadn’t tamped the trials. When Joan’s own daughter, Linda, so sweet and blond and all of five years old, claimed the fifty-dollar first prize for her rendition of the cheerful song “Oh, You Beautiful Doll!” on the live local TV contest Toby Prin’s Talent Hunt, the winnings allowed the family to pay that month’s rent. Another person might have been happy—even eager—to shelve the struggles of the past and fully inhabit the splendor of her current life. But Joan never felt entitled to simply revel in the fast-food fortune. The unfathomable sum she had at her disposal, at her complete discretion and control, enveloped her with awe. She was forever amused and amazed by it, as if it were a living, breathing organism she’d been entrusted to nurture and tend. If Ray hadn’t met and made the deal with those brothers . . . If she hadn’t been playing the organ that night he walked into the dining room . . . If her boss at the supper club hadn’t hired Joan’s first husband, Rollie, to manage the McDonald’s franchise he bought . . . If, then, if, then—where might life have taken her? Had she stayed with Rollie all these years, life wouldn’t necessarily have been bad. But it would hardly have been as big. She would never have befriended and supported some of the great thinkers of her time: a former president; a mystic priest; a children’s TV star; a crusading journalist who’d discovered, he believed, the secret to healing pain. She never would have experienced the joys and challenges of presiding over a major league baseball team! Of all the experiences a poor midwestern girl could only have imagined, her giving had been her greatest gift—to herself. The pleasure and thrill of helping faceless strangers. She wasn’t deluded enough to think she could fix the world’s problems, but she had loved making a tiny dent where she could. Excerpted from the book RAY & JOAN by Lisa Napoli.

      "text": "McDonald’s Latest Initiative Is Adventurous (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | November 15, 2016 — 3:11 PM EST \nWith competition from fast-casual restaurants mounting, competition from other quick-service restaurants still existing, and more people eating at home due to food price deflation and lower prices at grocery stores, McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ) must come up with creative ideas in order to drive consumers to its restaurants. \nThe latest initiative is the McRib Finder App, which helps you find the nearest McRib based on your location. You can also invite a friend and send a friend McRib stickers. If you don’t have an iPhone or iPad, then you can’t use the McRib Finder App, but you can use the McRibLocator.com website. \nThe McRib is not available at most locations, and this promotion will only run through December 31. There are many huge fans of the McRib, and when there is low supply of a wanted item, demand is likely to be high. If you don’t believe some people take this seriously, the following message was recently posted on the McRib Locator Blog: \n“While we haven’t seen much activity out West, we are optimistic somewhere will get it. Earlier rumors were that part of California would get a chance to grab a McRib, so we await to see if this comes to fruition. We also received an earlier rumor that the McRib will not be back in Florida until March.” \nOf course, the real goal here for McDonald’s is to drive excitement around the brand. The more people communicate about this initiative on social media (and in real life), the more it helps McDonald’s. This initiative might be reminiscent of Where’s Waldo, but in more modern terms, McDonald’s might be taking a page out of the Pokémon Go playbook. Instead of \"find and catch,\" the mission will be to \"search and destroy.\" \nMCD has appreciated 6.12% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.29%.",

(Photo: usatoday.com) \nMcDonald’s is revamping its menu with a Nutella burger. \nYup, you read that correctly. Unfortunately the decadent sandwiches are only available in Italy. \nDubbed the “Sweety con Nutella,” the new sandwich features Nutella spread between two hamburger buns and comes in a cardboard box similar to the hamburger containers. \nMcDonald’s Italy posted a photo of the new treat on Facebook Thursday. The post has been shared almost 100,000 times. \n“A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist. Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center,” McDonald’s Italy said in the caption. \nUSA TODAY reached out to McDonald's for comment on whether the Nutella burgers will make their way across the pond.

      "text": "This cover image released by Dutton shows, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald’s Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" by Lisa Napoli. (Dutton via AP) More \"Ray & Joan\" (Dutton), by Lisa Napoli\nIn 2012, journalist Lisa Napoli did a story about a peace monument in Santa Monica, California, that had fallen into disrepair. She soon learned the identity of the anonymous donor who had paid for it years before: Joan Kroc, heir to the McDonald's hamburger fortune. Curiosity piqued, Napoli went looking for a biography of the philanthropist, only to discover that none existed. So she decided to tell the story herself.\nThe result is \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away,\" and as the title suggests, it's less about the impetuous, strong-willed woman whom some called St. Joan of the Arches than it is about her passionate and tempestuous relationship with the brash, driven entrepreneur behind one of the world's most successful brands.\nBoth were remarkable individuals, but given the limited options available to women of her generation, it's unlikely that Joan would have left as big a mark had she not married Ray. For him, it was love at first sight from the moment he first set eyes on her playing the organ at a fancy supper club in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nBoth were married, and it would take another dozen years — and a second marriage and divorce for him — before they finally got hitched. When they did, things didn't get easier. She filed for divorce over his drinking and violent temper. They ended up reconciling, and she channeled her discontent — and her considerable energy — into funding programs to treat alcoholism and much more.\nAs long as Ray, a staunch conservative, was alive, Joan mostly kept her politics to herself. After his death in 1984, she began to openly support a variety of liberal and humanitarian causes: the Democratic Party, nuclear disarmament and AIDS research, to name just a few. When she died in 2003, the Salvation Army and National Public Radio were her biggest beneficiaries.\nNapoli tells their story in a brisk, efficient fashion, often sacrificing psychological complexity for melodrama. (About her new life as a socialite: \"Joan found it all so boring she wanted to cry.\") She's also prone to sweeping generalizations (\"Levity was in short supply for the class of 1945\") and cliched language, noting on two occasions that Ray had ketchup in his blood.\nStill, it's a fascinating story, and it arrives at an auspicious moment. In January, the Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters.\n___\nThis story corrects that Ray Kroc biopic, \"The Founder,\" starring Michael Keaton, opens in theaters in January not December.",

      "text": "McDonald's is a ubiquitous part of the American landscape. Its thousands of locations, from busy urban corners to isolated rural off-ramps, serve up burgers, fries and shakes to hundreds of millions of people a year. The company has provided countless workers entry-level (or all-too-permanent) jobs in the fast-food economy, and enriched generations of franchise holders.\nNo one got richer off standardized fast food than Ray Kroc, the man who bought out the McDonald brothers and \"changed the way the world ate.\" Well, one person got richer than Ray: his third wife, Joan Kroc, who outlived him by almost two decades before she discovered she had terminal cancer.\nAs she neared death, she had \"about $3 billion at her disposal,\" and she left the vast majority of this money to charities rather than to her descendants.\nRELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR \nThis opening nugget, beginning with the end of the story, provides a quick bite of what is to come in Lisa Napoli's new dual biography, \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away.\"\nHow could a woman give so much away rather than hoarding it to perpetuate a family dynasty?\nThe backstory is necessary to make the meaning of Joan Kroc's final philanthropy clear, if it can be done at all. Napoli retells the more-or-less familiar tale of how Ray Kroc, traveling salesman of paper cups and milkshake contraptions, bluffed and bullied, conned and connived McDonald's into an American staple.\nWatch Michael Keaton play McDonald's pioneer in 'The Founder' trailer Tracy Swartz Ray Kroc, a milkshake machine distributor who grew up in Oak Park, began building the McDonald's empire through persistence.\n\"McDonald's can be the new American church, and it ain't just open on Sundays, boys,\" Michael Keaton, playing Kroc, says in the new trailer for the upcoming movie \"The Founder.\"\n... Ray Kroc, a milkshake machine distributor who grew up in Oak Park, began building the McDonald's empire through persistence.\n\"McDonald's can be the new American church, and it ain't just open on Sundays, boys,\" Michael Keaton, playing Kroc, says in the new trailer for the upcoming movie \"The Founder.\"\n... (Tracy Swartz) Napoli's narrative skills are outstanding. She depicts Ray and Joan in vivid detail and with deep sympathy, something that's especially difficult given how neither Kroc was an especially appealing person. Besides his ruthlessness in business, when drunk on his signature Early Times, Ray could be an abusive drunkard, and Joan was overly fond of the bottle herself. Each of them seemed to prefer to delegate deeply personal messages to underlings: While on a luxury cruise with McDonald's franchisees, Ray had his lawyers inform his second wife that he'd be divorcing her to marry Joan. Joan had her doctor deliver the news that she was terminally ill to her extended family.\nOne of the strengths of Napoli's narrative is the depiction of people in the Kroc orbit, from early business partners to the men (and one woman) who helped take McDonald's public.\nIn retelling the tale, Napoli makes it perfectly clear that any depiction of Ray Kroc as an inevitable rags-to-riches hero is mistaken. Ray Kroc became filthy rich in no small part because of the advice, and power, of people whom he fought. He opposed the move to take McDonald's public, which made his, and Joan's, fortune immense. After investors bought into Kroc's business, both Ray and Joan could write multimillion-dollar checks at will, whether to buy the San Diego Padres or fund an alcoholism treatment center. Napoli describes the $12 million check Ray wrote to buy the Padres as \"a rounding error in his fortune.\"\nBefore those riches flowed, it was quite the struggle. Historically, his idea was in the right place at the right time. Napoli writes, \"eating meals outside the home became not just socially acceptable but a sign of carefree affluence\" in the Eisenhower-era boom. Suburbs, good roads and affordable cars (all in one way or another subsidized directly or indirectly by American government policies such as the GI Bill of Rights) made roadside restaurants profitable. Kroc emphasized value and speed, and \"quick plus cheap equaled the backbone of the new American dream.\"\nBut that dream was a nightmare for some, who associated roadside burger stands with sexual misbehavior and juvenile delinquency.\nKroc eliminated female employees altogether, preferring to hire male military veterans who were used to following orders and acting in a regimented way. (Napoli is excellent on the corporate misogyny of McDonald's: In the early years, only the wives of franchisees could work at a store, and then only in the back of the house, a role Joan filled with her first husband.) But even with the illicit sex angle off the table for McDonald's, \"burger stands\" still were disreputable.\nSo, McDonald's charity began. Early franchisees engaged in charitable giving not out of the goodness of their hearts, but as \"calculated benevolence\" to overcome local \"dissent\" as part of an \"ongoing campaign to infiltrate the communities where they set up shop.\" Franchisees sponsored high school sports, and responded to local floods or fires by feeding first responders and displaced people, and otherwise acted as good citizens.\nAmerican mobility also came into play, changing the tastes of customers McDonald's targeted. Car owners on cross-country family road trips saw standardized national brands as trustworthy (even if they opposed them in their own home towns). The \"public began to put stock in the cachet of a recognizable brand, trumping the unreliable unknown of a local merchant,\" a reality visible on any interstate highway to this day.\nOnce McDonald's was the king of the burger landscape, and Ray and Joan Kroc didn't need to worry about their riches, they began the second wave of McDonald's charitable giving. After Ray's death, as Napoli writes, Joan was free to give as she saw fit.\nAnd her charitable giving was idiosyncratic to say the least. She was a news junkie, poring over the papers, with cable news stations always on the TVs in her vast mansion. Any cause that hit her emotionally — from alcoholism treatment centers to anti-nuclear proliferation peace activists — could see millions of dollars suddenly appear. She often insisted on anonymity, such as when she donated $50,000 to flood relief efforts in Rapid City, S.D., in 1972. Joan's ex-husband had opened the first McDonald's franchise in this town, which Joan nicknamed \"Wretched City,\" before leaving it to marry Ray.\nIn an appendix, Napoli lists all of the charities that received bequests in the years after Joan's death, from $500 to San Diego Grandmothers for Peace to $1.5 billion to the Salvation Army.\nThe book would have been better, however, had it focused more deeply on Joan. Napoli brings her to life, but primarily on a surface level and mostly in the last part of the book. Her eccentricities and generosity alike are recounted, but not fully analyzed. Why, for instance, was she so obsessed with anonymity? It might have been a reaction to Ray's corporate giving, which was clearly focused on making McDonald's seem something it wasn't (virtuous, good for children). Joan's instinctive and sympathetic handling of the San Ysidro massacre, — the 1984 mass shooting in a San Diego McDonald's — get special and deserved attention, but too much of the book simply tells the story rather than analyzing the deeper meaning of Joan Kroc's remarkable generosity.\nBill Savage is a freelance writer whose latest book is an annotated edition of George Ade's \"The Old-Time Saloon.\" \n'Ray & Joan'\nBy Lisa Napoli, Dutton, 353 pages, $27\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Literature McDonald's",

      "text": "Summary \nMcDonald's is revamping the Big Mac for the first time since it's introduction almost 50 years ago. \nYear-over-year, tore-owned sales have decline despite menu changes, but franchise-owned revenues are up 5%. \nThe company will benefit from the proposed tax and regulatory costs of the incoming executive administration. \nMCD has reacted more slowly to the \"Trump effect\" than have most other U.S. Equities. \nA new long position on MCD isn't a sure thing, but with their dividend growth history and upcoming legislation, McDonald's has many growth prospects. Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions on a sesame seed bun - that's summed up McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) Big Mac sandwich since the sandwich was first introduced in 1967. It's been nearly 50 years since Americans fell in love with the Big Mac and it hasn't changed since; But, after the success of McDonald's all-day breakfast menu, the chain has decided to introduce the Big Mac's big brother, the Grand Mac, as well as a little sister, the Mac Jr.. The recipe has remained the same and the original Big Mac is still on the menu, so there's no reason to panic. There is, however, reason to keep an eye on MCD. The global fast-food giant has just begun introducing a Sriracha hot sauce version of the Big Mac in Columbus, Ohio. Central Ohio Co-op president Scott Nickell, has commented on the chain's first-ever attempt to swap an ingredient on the Big Mac: \"Offering the addition of Sriracha to our Big Mac Special Sauce was a fun way for our culinary innovations team to think outside the box and continue to answer the call of our customers who are always looking for the next great innovation in food experience and taste\". The new hot sauce will also be added as a dipping sauce for McNuggets and French fries. All Day Breakfast Success Is Fueling Creative Menu Change The Big Mac is synonymous with fast food and McDonald's is taking a chance on reinventing it. A couple of years ago, nobody would have thought McDonald's would consider it but, because McDonald's last quarter earnings were boosted because of the all-day breakfast menu, the chain seems to be more open to taking risks with what has historically been their highly traditional approach to fast food. In September, the chain introduced an expanded version of its all-day breakfast menu. During its last earnings conference call, the company has stated that U.S. sales figures, which outgrew projected U.S. sales growth by .1% (1.3% vs 1.2% expected) and international sales growth by 1.5% (3.3% vs 1.8%), were \"supported by All Day Breakfast, everyday value under the McPick 2 platform and the introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives.\" The company also added that changes to the brand's menu is fueled by a consumer-centric attitude. \"We are putting the customer at the center of everything we do and are directing our resources towards those innovations and investments that will strengthen our ability to deliver a better McDonald's experience over time\". Click to enlarge Changes to McDonald's Flagship Brand Can Go Either Way While the growth in breakfast sales has boosted the company's bottom line, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has remained focused on simplifying the brand's menu and offering transparency about food production and preparation - an issue that has, in part, harmed consumer sentiments regarding McDonald's and fueled growth of healthier fast food alternatives such as Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ). Of course, the company will wait for results of the test run before deciding whether or not to pull the new sandwich or introduce it into new market; However, investors do have some reasons to remain skeptical. Diluting a key brand figure such as the Big Mac is risky. Because the Big Mac hasn't changed in almost 50 years, the new line has garnered attention, not all of which has been positive. In many ways, the company is pissing in the wind attempting to regain some traction after year-over-year sales by company-owned restaurants fell 7% despite a 5% increase in revenues from franchised restaurants. Operating income rose 5% year over year while income before provision for income taxes rose a much more modest 1% with income tax provisions increasing 11% in the same time period. Click to enlarge A Trump Administration Will Help Boost Revenues and Net Income MCD has been on a roller coaster ride in 2016. After initial success of the all-day breakfast menu around Q3 2015, shares rose from roughly $95 to $127 by July of 2016 but have since tapered. Year-to-date the stock has returned 2.53% from its starting price of $114.95 which is more or less where it sits at the time this article is being written. Despite that, good news is on the horizon. While it remains to be seen what tax and regulatory proposals would look like under a President-Elect Trump, it's safe to say the administration will seek to drastically cut corporate taxes, income taxes and regulations and would likely oppose sharp increases to the federal minimum wage which is currently $7.25 per hour. All of that is good news for McDonald's. The corporation itself will likely see a reduced tax burden along with its employees who stand to benefit from Trump's proposed 13% federal income tax cut to those making below $75,000 a year. The company's U.S.-based processing and distribution plants will likely see reductions to their regulatory costs as well and the uncertainty regarding possible sharp increases in labor costs are going to be largely mitigated. Investors have been so focused on Trump's impact on the financial, health care, industrial and tech industries that MCD has only this week begun to benefit from the \"Trump effect\" - multiple days of post record highs - that we've seen in U.S. equities markets. The Bottom Line McDonald's is a strong brand. Shares of MCD have recently had their valuations decline and there is uncertainty regarding the risks the brand is making to its flagship sandwich, the Big Mac. Those concerns are warranted. Company-owned store sales are down and the menu has seen constant changes over the last couple of years as the company tries to fend off a possible decline due to an increase in healthier options. Despite all that, it appears there will be solid upside for McDonald's in 2017 and 2018 resulting from legislation. Both the corporation and the vast majority of its employees will likely see their income taxes cut. Production, ecological and food prep regulations may ease on the fast food giant, and wages will likely not increase dramatically across the board nationwide, although many States and municipalities are set to increase minimum wage. MCD is a coin toss at this point. A lot is riding on the success of the new line of Big Macs. What we know for sure is the company is no longer as resistant to dramatic changes in their menu as they were yesteryear and tax and regulatory burdens will likely decrease over the next 4 years for the company. Whether or not that warrants a buy is up to debate, but if you already own MCD, there are reasons to believe the opportunity to grow the bottom line will be there in 2017-2018, one way or another.

      "text": "Chicago's Parade, The McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, Returns to Downtown Chicago & Around The Country Thursday Morning, November 24! WGN America Broadcasts Parade Coast to Coast CHICAGO, IL,   McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, a high-quality, family event attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators, celebrates 83 years of Chicago holiday tradition. Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST). Originally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago. Chicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot.

      "text": "Share on Reddit \nWILL Donald Trump remake school lunches into his fast-food favourites of burgers and fried chicken when he’s president? \nChildren grumbling about healthier school meal rules championed by first lady Michelle Obama may have reason to cheer Mr Trump’s election as the billionaire businessman is a proud patron of KFC and McDonald’s while promising to curb federal regulations. \nThe Obama administration has made healthier, safer and better labelled food a priority in the past eight years, significantly raising the profile of food policy and sometimes drawing the ire of Republicans, farmers and the food industry. \nThe first lady made reducing childhood obesity one of her signature issues through her “Let’s Move” campaign. \nIn addition to the healthier school meal rules, the administration ushered a sweeping food safety law through Congress, pushed through several new food labelling regulations, started to phase out trans fats, added calorie labels to menus and suggested new limits on sodium in packaged foods. The White House has also fended off efforts in the Republican Congress to trim the nation’s food stamp program. \n“Food advocates are already nostalgic for the Obama era and will be playing defence for the next four years,” says Sam Kass, a former White House senior adviser on nutrition and personal chef for the Obamas.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016 \nMAKING SCHOOL MEALS GREAT AGAIN \nMr Trump himself hasn’t weighed in on school meal regulations. But Republicans, school nutrition directors and some in the food industry have baulked at parts of the administration’s rules that set stricter fat, sugar and sodium limits, among other standards, on foods in the lunch line and beyond. \nWhile many students and schools have now gotten used to the healthier foods, some still complain that the standards are costly and difficult to meet. \n“I would be very surprised if we don’t see some major changes on the school lunch program” and some other food issues, said Republican Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Agriculture Department spending. \nMr Aderholt, who sits on Mr Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, says the Obama administration’s approach was “activist driven” and people who voted for Mr Trump are looking for a more commonsense approach. \nLegislation is pending in both the House and Senate to revise some of the standards, and will likely be considered again next year. USDA could also make some changes on its own. \nOne of many names that have been floated as a possible agriculture secretary is Sid Miller, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner who repealed a state ban on deep fryers and soda machines at schools. \nMr Miller recently got in trouble when he used a profanity on Twitter to describe Democrat Hillary Clinton; he blamed a staffer and the tweet was deleted.

Picture: AP Photo/Evan Vucci Source: AP \nTHE FOOD POLICE \nIn September, the Trump campaign pitched rolling back food safety regulations in a fact sheet, arguing they are burdensome to farmers and criticising increased inspections of food manufacturing facilities as “overkill.” \nThe sheet referred to the “food police” at the Food and Drug Administration. The campaign later deleted the proposal from its website. \nCongress passed new food safety regulations in 2010, a year after a salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut company killed nine people. Michael Taylor, former FDA deputy commissioner for foods who oversaw the food safety rules, says it wouldn’t be popular with consumers to roll them back. I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2012 \n“Consumers are only getting more focused on safety, health and wellness,” Mr Taylor says. \nMr Trump himself is a self-professed germaphobe who prefers eating at fast-food restaurants because he believes they have higher food safety standards. \nCongressional Republicans have been examining food stamps since the program’s cost grew to almost $80 billion annually after the recession. Participation and costs have dipped since its 2013 high, but conservatives have suggested tightening eligibility standards or increasing work requirements. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has for years championed an overhaul to the program. Democrats in the Senate have consistently objected to any changes, and will still wield influence. But they won’t have the backing of a Democratic White House. A photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 26, 2016 at 2:29pm PDT \nOTHER FOOD POLICY \nMany other laws are either already in place or close to it, including a revised “nutrition facts” panel on the back of food packages, with a new line breaking out added sugars, a labelling law for genetically modified foods and calorie labelling on restaurant and supermarket menus. \nIn many cases, the rules are a result of compromise with industry. \nMr Kass says that pulling back may just create more cost and uncertainty for businesses. “Unwinding things is really hard, especially when most of them have been implemented and industry has moved on,” Mr Kass says. \nHe predicts most of the regulations will stay, but that there will be little additional progress. Ongoing administration efforts to reduce sodium in food and antibiotics in meat could be casualties. \nMargo Wootan, a lobbyist on nutrition issues for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says advocates will continue to be aggressive at the state and local levels, hoping change will bubble up. \n“The public is more interested than ever in nutrition and will continue to press companies,” she says.

      "text": "November 16,   Chicago's Parade, The McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, Returns to Downtown Chicago & Around The Country Thursday Morning, November 24! WGN America Broadcasts Parade Coast to Coast CHICAGO, IL, November 16,   McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, a high-quality, family event attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators, celebrates 83 years of Chicago holiday tradition. Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST). Originally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago. Chicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot. This year's lineup also includes over 100 diverse and remarkable groups plus Honorary Grand Marshal Ronald McDonald, Chicago's favorite fun-loving bird and Parade mascot, Teddy Turkey, and an appearance by Santa Claus. 2016 Parade Participants Performances The Parade opens with a bang: the ever-popular Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey returns to present Out of this World, the 146th production of \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" Other staged performances kicking off the Parade include Broadway in Chicago's FINDING NEVERLAND and STOMP, NBC's America's Got Talent finalist, Laura Bretan and semi-finalist, Musicality.

      "text": "WGN America Broadcasts Parade Coast to Coast\nCHICAGO, IL, November 16, McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, a high-quality, family event attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators, celebrates 83 years of Chicago holiday tradition. Loveable character balloons, top marching bands from across the country, festive floats, cultural groups, theatrical performances, equestrian groups, and celebrity guests, plus over a thousand dedicated volunteers, all marching through the Loop, make the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade an annual celebration for the whole family. For those not in Chicago, the parade is nationally broadcast, live, on WGN America. The 2016 McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade takes place LIVE on State Street between Congress Parkway and Randolph Street in downtown Chicago on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 24 from 8 to 11 a.m. (CST).\nOriginally called the Christmas Caravan in the 1930s, the Parade was created in 1934 to help lift the spirits of residents suffering through the Great Depression. Since then, it has developed into a full-scale spectacle that celebrates the holiday season. What once started out as an attempt to boost Chicago's economy has evolved into a cherished holiday tradition for Chicagoans and Americans alike. Over sixteen different countries will share their enriched traditions with Chicago's Parade this Thanksgiving morning. The sights on State Street give the audience a chance to travel the world and embrace other traditions, all without leaving downtown Chicago.\nChicago-born Matt Walsh of HBO's Veep will serve as the Grand Marshal of this year's Parade. Walsh will be joined by comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco, Emma Kenney from Showtime's Shameless and Dante Brown from Fox's new Lethal Weapon. Returning to the parade will be Northbrook's own Yuri Sardarov from the TV hit series Chicago Fire and chef, restauranteur, and Top Chef host/judge Graham Elliot.\nThis year's lineup also includes over 100 diverse and remarkable groups plus Honorary Grand Marshal Ronald McDonald, Chicago's favorite fun-loving bird and Parade mascot, Teddy Turkey, and an appearance by Santa Claus.\n2016 Parade Participants\nPerformances\nThe Parade opens with a bang: the ever-popular Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey returns to present Out of this World, the 146th production of \"The Greatest Show on Earth.\" Other staged performances kicking off the Parade include Broadway in Chicago's FINDING NEVERLAND and STOMP, NBC's America's Got Talent finalist, Laura Bretan and semi-finalist, Musicality.

These and other featured musical marchers join Chicagoland favorites, including Waukegan High School Marching Band, Kelly High School Marching Band, Marist High School Marching Band, Lake Zurich High School Marching Band and Michigan City High School Marching Band.\nEquestrian\nThis year the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade brings 12 different equestrian ensembles to State Street, including the Medieval Times Dinner &Tournament, Culver Friesian Mounted Color Guard, Mid America Cowgirls Rodeo Drill Team, American Sidesaddle Association, Red Hats & Purple Chaps, the adorable Bertrand's Miniature Horses and more.\nFloats\nThirteen colorful floats will delight spectators this Thanksgiving.

      "text": "\nMcDonald’s Introduces Nutella Burger In Italy Would you try a Nutella burger?\nAccording to Fortune reports, McDonald’s has introduced a sweet yet savory treat to their menu. The “Sweety con Nutella” burger is a hazelnut hamburger introduced in Italy that comes meatless but served in the iconic burger box. \nCalled “Sweety con Nutella,” the chocolatey “burger” doesn’t actually come with meat—instead, it’s a spread of Nutella between two hamburger buns. The item is served, however, in the chain’s traditional hamburger box, according to Eater. Unfortunately, only Italy’s Nutella lovers can test the item as it’s part of the country’s McCafe menu. \n\nYuck or yummy?!?\nTwitter \n",

      "text": "Man spreads kindness by handing out money to McDonald’s workers Posted 1:34 pm, November 16, 2016, by Web Staff Email \nFORT WORTH, Texas — Workers at a McDonald’s in Texas received an amazing gift when a man stepped up to the cash register and gave $100 to each employee. \nThe man, who is said to be a regular at the restaurant, stopped in and wanted to do something nice to cheer up a woman he knew there. \n“There was a young lady at McDonald’s, who’s a regular there and goes and has coffee, and she happened to be crying and it just broke his heart,” said Lisa Davila, according to KTVT . “So he went over and he asked her what was going on and she was going through some tough times,” \nDavila, who didn’t want to share the man’s identity, said he was her boss and that he was also going through a rough time after he was diagnosed with cancer. \nThe man left enough money for the 33 employees on staff — whether they were working or not. \n“You could tell it blessed their day,” Davila said. “They didn’t come in there thinking that was going to happen that day.. and that was the best part about it.” 32.755488 -97.330766 ",

      "text": "McDonald's Is Stuck on the Wrong Side of the River November 16, 2016, 06:35:00 PM EDT By Asit Sharma, Motley Fool \nImage source: Getty Images. \nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) under CEO Steve Easterbrook has a pretty clear idea of what it wants to be when it grows up. The gradual phasing out of antibiotics, preservatives, and high-fructose corn syrup in its products, the packaging and digitization initiatives designed to contemporize the brand, and the renewed attention to metrics such as speed, quality, and order accuracy -- all such actions are intended to remake the company into an exciting destination on a par with fast-casual restaurants. \nTo the oft-stated dream of becoming a \"modern, progressive burger company,\" Easterbrook has lately added a new goal: to \"reassert McDonald's as the global leader of the IEO [informal eating out] industry.\" \nSuch a vision has its financial counterpart in comparable sales that trend consistently higher, quarter after quarter, based both on pricing power and improving guest counts. For investors, looking across turbulent waters of competition and changing consumer tastes, comps that rise predictably represent the green riverbank on the other side of the river that McDonald's is trying to reach. \nThe only problem with this lovely picture is that guest counts in the U.S. have been declining for years, pressuring the very comps they should support. Internally, at least, executives admit that this is not a problem that can be overlooked . \nAnd so far, the materials at hand to construct a bridge to rising comps seem ill-suited for the task. The company has \"all-day breakfast,\" which launched last year's turnaround, though its effect is fading. McDonald's also has use of its \"McPick 2\" value menu, which enjoys higher price points than the company's old dollar-based value offerings. \nNeither of these should be thought of as a permanent lever for traffic. McPick 2 in particular, while fulfilling a segment of market demand, ultimately won't boost franchisee margins or draw in new customers, and it hinders the company's efforts to burnish its image. \nIn truth, McDonald's may be stuck on the wrong side of the river for a while. It may be years before the company can achieve enough ingredient evolution to convince customers they're getting an equivalent product to, let's say, a Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) burger, and to persuade them to happily fork over $6 to $7 for the equivalent McDonald's sandwich. \nMcDonald's Sriracha Signature Burger, a precursor to the Sriracha Big Mac that hits test markets in Columbus, Ohio, this week. Image source: McDonald's Corporation. \nAnd there's danger in trying too hard to imitate the strategies of smaller competitors such as Shake Shack, specifically their supple use of limited-time offers (LTOs). It's probably tempting, but so far McDonald's has avoided pushing out successive waves of higher-priced, premium LTOs to compete with fast-casual chains, as customer perception hasn't yet caught up to company ambition. \nInstead, the organization's current approach to menu innovation, while not optimal, entails less risk. McDonald's appears to be trying to raise guest counts by dressing up core items on a limited-time basis. It's a practice that Restaurant Brands International 's(NYSE: QSR) Burger King excels at. Witness the bizarre merger of Burger King's core-menu Whopper sandwich with a burrito this past summer, the \"Whopperito.\" \nPerhaps not as daringly, this week McDonald's announced the testing of the \"Sriracha Big Mac\" LTO, which comes on the heels of two Big Mac LTOs set to run nationally next year, the Grand Mac and The Mac Jr. This bridging strategy toward higher guest counts is at least consistent with the company's focus on raising core item sales -- a prime component of its original turnaround plan. \nFor some time to come, McDonald's will have to work within a tight set of constraints, and not just the ones I've mentioned. As I've written on several occasions, McDonald's appears to have chosen to purposefully take on debt to return massive amounts of money to shareholders. It's finally on pace to complete its three-year, $30 billion shareholder return program by the end of 2016. \nAdding debt and sending the check directly to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases prevents an activist shareholder from swooping in and using balance-sheet resources to restructure the company. But as a result, there's barely any credible leverage left, as McDonald's sits with a credit rating just above junk status. Earlier this month, it received another downgrade on its long-term debt from Fitch Ratings, to \"BBB,\" which is considered investment grade, but by the slightest of margins. \nIn essence, McDonald's doesn't have huge amounts of capital left to partner up with franchisees on a multi-year store upgrade, or entertain acquisitions as it has in the past. Menu innovation remains the single item that could most help the company construct its bridge to higher traffic and rising comps. And it's a relatively cheap way to drive sales. At some point, the company will have to introduce new, successful core items that insert a truth beneath all the rebranding efforts. Until then, McDonald's may remain stuck on the wrong side of the river. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than McDonald's Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and McDonald's wasn't one of them!

      "text": "McDonald's Is Stuck on the Wrong Side of the River newsfeedback@fool.com (Asit Sharma) 9 min ago Image source: Getty Images. \nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) under CEO Steve Easterbrook has a pretty clear idea of what it wants to be when it grows up. The gradual phasing out of antibiotics, preservatives, and high-fructose corn syrup in its products, the packaging and digitization initiatives designed to contemporize the brand, and the renewed attention to metrics such as speed, quality, and order accuracy -- all such actions are intended to remake the company into an exciting destination on a par with fast-casual restaurants. \nTo the oft-stated dream of becoming a \"modern, progressive burger company,\" Easterbrook has lately added a new goal: to \"reassert McDonald's as the global leader of the IEO [informal eating out] industry.\" \nSuch a vision has its financial counterpart in comparable sales that trend consistently higher, quarter after quarter, based both on pricing power and improving guest counts. For investors, looking across turbulent waters of competition and changing consumer tastes, comps that rise predictably represent the green riverbank on the other side of the river that McDonald's is trying to reach. \nThe only problem with this lovely picture is that guest counts in the U.S. have been declining for years, pressuring the very comps they should support. Internally, at least, executives admit that this is not a problem that can be overlooked . \nAnd so far, the materials at hand to construct a bridge to rising comps seem ill-suited for the task. The company has \"all-day breakfast,\" which launched last year's turnaround, though its effect is fading. McDonald's also has use of its \"McPick 2\" value menu, which enjoys higher price points than the company's old dollar-based value offerings. \nNeither of these should be thought of as a permanent lever for traffic. McPick 2 in particular, while fulfilling a segment of market demand, ultimately won't boost franchisee margins or draw in new customers, and it hinders the company's efforts to burnish its image. \nIn truth, McDonald's may be stuck on the wrong side of the river for a while. It may be years before the company can achieve enough ingredient evolution to convince customers they're getting an equivalent product to, let's say, a Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) burger, and to persuade them to happily fork over $6 to $7 for the equivalent McDonald's sandwich. McDonald's Sriracha Signature Burger, a precursor to the Sriracha Big Mac that hits test markets in Columbus, Ohio, this week. Image source: McDonald's Corporation. \nAnd there's danger in trying too hard to imitate the strategies of smaller competitors such as Shake Shack, specifically their supple use of limited-time offers (LTOs). It's probably tempting, but so far McDonald's has avoided pushing out successive waves of higher-priced, premium LTOs to compete with fast-casual chains, as customer perception hasn't yet caught up to company ambition. \nInstead, the organization's current approach to menu innovation, while not optimal, entails less risk. McDonald's appears to be trying to raise guest counts by dressing up core items on a limited-time basis. It's a practice that Restaurant Brands International 's (NYSE: QSR) Burger King excels at. Witness the bizarre merger of Burger King's core-menu Whopper sandwich with a burrito this past summer, the \"Whopperito.\" \nPerhaps not as daringly, this week McDonald's announced the testing of the \"Sriracha Big Mac\" LTO, which comes on the heels of two Big Mac LTOs set to run nationally next year, the Grand Mac and The Mac Jr. This bridging strategy toward higher guest counts is at least consistent with the company's focus on raising core item sales -- a prime component of its original turnaround plan. \nFor some time to come, McDonald's will have to work within a tight set of constraints, and not just the ones I've mentioned. As I've written on several occasions, McDonald's appears to have chosen to purposefully take on debt to return massive amounts of money to shareholders. It's finally on pace to complete its three-year, $30 billion shareholder return program by the end of 2016. \nAdding debt and sending the check directly to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases prevents an activist shareholder from swooping in and using balance-sheet resources to restructure the company. But as a result, there's barely any credible leverage left, as McDonald's sits with a credit rating just above junk status. Earlier this month, it received another downgrade on its long-term debt from Fitch Ratings, to \"BBB,\" which is considered investment grade, but by the slightest of margins. \nIn essence, McDonald's doesn't have huge amounts of capital left to partner up with franchisees on a multi-year store upgrade, or entertain acquisitions as it has in the past. Menu innovation remains the single item that could most help the company construct its bridge to higher traffic and rising comps. And it's a relatively cheap way to drive sales. At some point, the company will have to introduce new, successful core items that insert a truth beneath all the rebranding efforts. Until then, McDonald's may remain stuck on the wrong side of the river. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than McDonald's \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

      "text": "One of a Kind Opportunity: Call for Volunteers to Help Make the 83rd McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade a Monumental Success! Over 1,300 volunteers needed for one of Chicago's oldest holiday traditions CHICAGO, IL,   The Chicago Festival Association is now recruiting volunteers to assist during the 83rd McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade, which marches up State Street from Congress to Randolph Thursday, November 24, 2016, 8 - 11 am (CST). Volunteers are an essential part of bringing this FREE family-friendly event to downtown Chicago, to hundreds of thousands of on-street spectators, and to the millions watching at home. The parade is broadcast, in its entirety, live for three hours on WGN 9 Chicago and nationally on WGN America. There are many opportunities available for individuals (12 years of age and older), families and groups to participate in this magical event, including the following roles: - BANNER CARRIER - Smile and wave!

      "text": "The World Is Ending. McDonald's Is Changing The Big Mac Recipe It's come to this. Really. Owner, Howard Raucous LLC @ ChrisMatyszczyk WRITE A COMMENT Will you still be loving it? CREDIT:   \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nIt's come to this. \nNot content with preventing people from driving their own cars or creating their own emojis, the march of time has taken one more step into the dark beyond. \nI'm not even sure how to say it. \nAlright, if you read the headline, you'll already have a clue. Here goes. \nMcDonald's has decided to mess with the Big Mac recipe. \nThis is like some bearded, e-cigarette smoking chef making French Fries out of quinoa. \nThis is like the Dallas Cowboys moving to Toronto. \nThis is like Americans having to drive on the left. \nOnce you begin breathing again, you'll be wondering what McDonald's is doing to one of the great pillars of American society. \nI'll give you a clue. The new Big Mac is called the Sriracha Big Mac . Yes, it's a Big Mac made with a so-called Sriracha Mac sauce. \nMcDonald's describes it as \"a fresh take on a classic American sandwich, infusing the great taste of our iconic cheeseburgers with the heat and zing that consumers have grown to love from Sriracha.\" \nDo you need heat and zing from your Big Mac? Or are you merely happy when it oozes excess all down your chin and makes you proud to be an American? \nThe Big Mac first struck our shores in 1967. McDonald's has never messed with it like this. The Big Mac has always been there to make a mess all over you. \nIt's always been there as something upon which you could rely, when everyone you believe in has deserted you. \nSuddenly, you're heading for a Big Mac attack. \nI should mention that this is just an experiment that's taking place in 126 restaurants in Central Ohio. Your standard Big Mac will still be available. \nThese, though, are slippery slopes. \nIf they start squirting sriracha into our Big Macs, what next? Foie-gras in our Whoppers? \nMcDonald's management describe the Sriracha Big Mac as an \"on-trend flavor.\" \nBut McDonald's was never about trends. It was about golden arches, scary clowns and strange people in the restrooms. It was about personal iniquity and glorious ubiquity. It was the proudest, guiltiest pleasure in the world. \nIt was, most of all, about a Mac that was bigger than anyone else's. \nOur president-elect is a big supporter of fast food. Will he now step in to decry this foreign influence? Will he ask questions about whether the Sriracha is made in the USA? \nI fear an outcry. \nActually, I quite look forward to one.   16, 2016 Advertisement",

      "text": "Wegner School had a great time during McTeacher's Night on November 16th at the McDonald's in West Chicago. The Wegner McTeacher's Night was a fun way to bring the teachers together and have the opportunity to meet the parents of students and members of the community, The money raised is being used towards PTO miscellaneous items.\nTeachers and staff members from the school worked jobs such as greeting guests, the front counter, the drive-thru, and serving ice cream. The Wegner Chorus was on site singing a few songs and kept the energy going strong. The children were excited by the Special Appearance made by Ronald McDonald.\nSpecial thank you goes out to Krisann Castro, Kindergarten Teacher, for coordinating the entire event. McTeacher Night was courtesy of the West Chicago McDonald's owner/operator, The Lardas Family. For more information about events provided by the West Chicago McDonald's contact their Community Relations Director Julie Travers at julie.travers@comcast.net\n  West Chicago Wheaton Submitted Content",

Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 11:50 PM, November 17, 2016 \nA McDonald's Corp <MCD.N> shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. \nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. \nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\" \nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\" \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms <SAFM.O> and Yum Brands Inc <YUM.N> with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

      "text": "McDonald's and Omnicom Launch New Dedicated Agency BBDO's Brian Nienhaus named CEO By Patrick Coffee November 17, 2016, 3:12 PM EST Advertising & Branding The Unlimited team: Brian Nienhaus, Chip Knicker, Graceann Bennett, Jon Ellis and Linda Poe. We Are Unlimited Following months of speculation, Omnicom and McDonald's announced the launch of their new dedicated unit We Are Unlimited today in Chicago. The shop will go by Unlimited and serve only the fast food giant, with former BBDO New York senior director Brian Nienhaus acting as CEO and reporting directly to Wendy Clark, the DDB North America chief executive who led the McDonald's pitch. \"Brian's experience leading integrated teams that span digital, social, sponsorships and traditional advertising working across multiple Omnicom sister agencies, many of whom are part of Unlimited, has uniquely qualified him to take the reins as CEO of this agency,\" said Clark in a statement. Clark and McDonald's CMO Deborah Wahl referred to the unit as an \" agency of the present \" at Advertising Week in 2016, in referring to what they claim to be an unprecedented degree of integration. To that point, Unlimited includes \"embedded\" teams from such disparate organizations as The Marketing Store, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Adobe and The New York Times' T Brand Studio in an attempt to more effectively coordinate all of the chain's massive marketing efforts. \"Whether it's a social post, an anthemic film or in-restaurant messaging, we are confident that analytically inspired, creatively driven thinking and work from Unlimited will help shape McDonald's marketing in completely new ways to break new ground and fuel increased business impact,\" said Wohl. McDonald's consolidated its marketing business with Omnicom in August following a four-plus month review, thereby ending a 35-year relationship with Publicis and Leo Burnett Chicago. The review initially included all three of the industry's largest holding companies, but WPP dropped out in May , allegedly in response to contractual agreements that would have the winning unit operate at cost until reaching unspecified revenue goals. McDonald's never commented on what some in the industry called \"unheard of\" demands. In addition to Nienhaus, several other agency veterans will assume leadership positions at Unlimited. John Hansa, who led the McDonald's creative work at Leo Burnett, will be executive creative director; Jon Ellis of DDB (who also worked on the McD's account there) will be chief production officer; former Element79 controller Linda Poe joins Unlimited as chief financial officer; veteran strategist Graceann Bennett will serve as chief strategy officer; Chip Knicker, who managed ecommerce for Accenture North America, will be chief digital officer; The Marketing Store's former svp, account director Ursula Ostrom will serve as svp and group director. Nienhaus said, \"I'm incredibly honored to assume a leadership role in changing the way agencies deliver client solutions. To do so in partnership with McDonald's, one of the world's most iconic brands, and the stellar team we've brought together, is both exciting and humbling.\" He promised that the agency, which will employ approximately 200 \"brand practitioners\" in its new Chicago headquarters, will be fully staffed by the time operations officially begin on January 1, 2017. McDonald's spent approximately $820 million on measured media in 2015 according to Kantar Media. Get the Advertising & Branding  ",

      "text": "By Lisa Baertlein\nSlideshow McDonald's investor renews push for antibiotic reduction in all meat Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon\n(Reuters) - A McDonald's Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants.\nThe group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald's announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States.\nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting.\nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\"\nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\"\nSister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process.\n\"I said we will be back,\" Mika said in a phone interview. \"We want them to set goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.\"\nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Andrew Hay)",

Photo courtesy of Reuters/Leonhard Foeger By Josephine McKenna, Religion News Service Posted: # Comments Site of proposed McDonald’s outlet near St. Peter’s Square in Rome. RNS photo by Josephine McKenna \nVATICAN CITY — Several senior cardinals in Rome apparently are furious about plans to open a new McDonald’s restaurant in the shadow of St. Peter’s Basilica, and have reportedly asked Pope Francis to stop the expansion from going ahead. \nBut that’s not the only charge of cultural heresy invading the Vatican’s sacred precincts: Questions are also being raised after the Holy See gave approval for the Hard Rock Cafe chain to open a store on Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s. \nThe Hard Rock Cafe is set to replace a long-standing religious bookstore; the site is currently being renovated and a panel in the window confirms Hard Rock will be the new tenant. \nHamish Dodds, the CEO of Hard Rock, was quoted in the Italian daily La Repubblica as saying the store would only be selling T-shirts and musical memorabilia. Advertisement \nIn the wake of Italy’s economic crisis, such changes are becoming commonplace around the Vatican as banks and bookshops have been replaced by more bars, restaurants and stores filled with tourist souvenirs. \nBut the advent of a McDonald’s seemed to be especially galling. \nItalian Cardinal Elio Sgreccia was the first to publicly sound the alarm, saying the proposal to open an outlet of the global fast-food chain below a Vatican-owned building where several cardinals live was a “controversial, perverse decision.” \nIn an interview published over the weekend in La Repubblica, Sgreccia said the proposal was “not at all respectful of the architectural and urban traditions” of a destination — just a block from St. Peter’s Square — that draws thousands of pilgrims and tourists a day from around the world. \nHe also said serving burgers and fries in the neighborhood was unacceptable because McDonald’s cuisine breached Italian taste. \n“It’s a commercial decision that ignores the culinary traditions of the Roman restaurant industry,” said Sgreccia, 88, who is president emeritus of the Vatican’s Academy for Life, which leads the church’s fight against abortion and euthanasia. \nOne angry cardinal has even written a letter to the pope urging him to intervene against the decision despite the fact that it would reportedly bring 30,000 euros ($33,000) a month in revenue to the Vatican, La Repubblica said. \nSgreccia does not live in the building but was apparently speaking on behalf of some of the seven cardinals who live above the 5,800-square-foot site, which is being rented out by the authority that manages the Holy See’s real estate. The authority goes by the acronym APSA. \nThe retired cardinal said the space should be used to help the needy in keeping with the pope’s desire to create a “church for the poor.” \nSources told the Italian news agency ANSA that the cardinals who live in the building were further angered after receiving letters from APSA advising them that they would be required to contribute to renovation work to accommodate the new tenant. \nBut Cardinal Domenico Calcagno, head of ASPA, denied the claim about the contributions and told La Repubblica he was “not going to back down” because the deal was legally valid. \n“I don’t see the scandal,” he said. \nStaff from Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm that represents McDonald’s in Italy, did not respond to several requests from RNS for comment. \nThe cardinals may not be alone in their protests. \nLocal merchants and residents in the historic Borgo district next to the Vatican have also joined the fight against the proposed fast-food restaurant, describing it as “a serious assault” that does not enhance the artistic and cultural value of the quarter. \nRepresentatives from Rome’s City Council are also taking formal steps to block the McDonald’s from going ahead, at least in the short-term, according to Italian media. \nThe first McDonald’s opened in Rome near the Spanish Steps in the heart of the Eternal City’s historic center in 1986 despite vocal protests. \nThere was a similar outcry in Florence earlier this year when McDonald’s sought to open next to the Renaissance city’s landmark cathedral, known as the Duomo.",

The new McDonald's is sleek, muted and modern. \nMcDonald's revealed on Thursday that its U.S. restaurants will be getting a major upgrade. As part of the company's efforts to become a \"modern and progressive burger company,\" McDonald's is adding self-service ordering kiosks, craft burgers and table service to its stores. \nRelated: 10 Ways McDonald’s Is Changing Its Menu \n\"For the best part of our 60 years we've asked customers to fit around our business model,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said. \"Now customers are more demanding and we are looking to adapt our business.\" \nMcDonald's \"experience of the future\" is currently available in about 500 of the company's 14,000 U.S. restaurants and will expand in the coming years. Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle will be the next markets to adopt McDonald's new technology and services. \nEasterbrook noted that McDonald's is focused on how customers order, what they order, how they pay and how they want to be served. The restaurants will allow for self-service kiosk ordering and counter accessibility. Customers can pay with cash, credit, debit, Apple pay and Android pay and will soon be able to order through the company's mobile service. \n\"The counter is a barrier,\" Easterbrook said. \nRelated: Americans Buy Nearly 1,500 McDonald's Burgers a Minute \nMcDonald's employees will now spend more time in the front of the restaurant, delivering food directly to the tables and offering traditional dining hospitality. \n\"We are investing in technology and people,\" Chris Kempczinski, incoming U.S. president of McDonald's, said. \"We want to personalize and elevate the experience for consumers in the U.S.\" \nIn addition, the company will be adding new craft burgers and chicken to its menu. The Big Mac will now come in two additional sizes, Grand and Jr., as previously announced and innovative items like a pico de gallo burger with guacamole will be joining the menu board. \nEasterbrook noted that increased customization is a key facet of building a \"better McDonald's.\" Using the self-service kiosks, customers can choose from preselected items or create their own. \nFor Easterbrook, a Quarter-Pounder with cheese, sans pickles is the ideal order. \n\"Our ambition is to accelerate on our momentum,\" he said. \nThis article originally appeared on CNBC .

Advertisement \nIn the wake of Italys economic crisis, such changes are becoming commonplace around the Vatican as banks and bookshops have been replaced by more bars, restaurants and stores filled with tourist souvenirs. \nBut the advent of a McDonalds seemed to be especially galling. \nItalian Cardinal Elio Sgreccia was the first to publicly sound the alarm, saying the proposal to open an outlet of the global fast-food chain below a Vatican-owned building where several cardinals live was a controversial, perverse decision. \nIn an interview published over the weekend in La Repubblica, Sgreccia said the proposal was not at all respectful of the architectural and urban traditions of a destination  just a block from St. Peters Square  that draws thousands of pilgrims and tourists a day from around the world. \nHe also said serving burgers and fries in the neighborhood was unacceptable because McDonalds cuisine breached Italian taste. \nIts a commercial decision that ignores the culinary traditions of the Roman restaurant industry, said Sgreccia, 88, who is president emeritus of the Vaticans Academy for Life, which leads the churchs fight against abortion and euthanasia. \nOne angry cardinal has even written a letter to the pope urging him to intervene against the decision despite the fact that it would reportedly bring 30,000 euros ($33,000) a month in revenue to the Vatican, La Repubblica said. \nSgreccia does not live in the building but was apparently speaking on behalf of some of the seven cardinals who live above the 5,800-square-foot site, which is being rented out by the authority that manages the Holy Sees real estate.

(Richard Drew/AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Thursday, November 17, 2016, 6:37 PM \nMcDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrates an order kiosk, with cashier Esmirna DeLeon, during a presentation at a McDonald's restaurant in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. (Richard Drew/AP) \nDespite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" \nHe noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. McDonald's Executive Chef Dan Coudreaut checks an outgoing order in the kitchen at a McDonald's restaurant, during a presentation in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, Thursday. (Richard Drew/AP) \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nMcDonald’s may add Happy Meals to its all-day breakfast menu \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Tags:",

Photo courtesy of Reuters/Leonhard Foeger By Josephine McKenna, Religion News Service Posted: # Comments Site of proposed McDonald’s outlet near St. Peter’s Square in Rome. RNS photo by Josephine McKenna \nVATICAN CITY — Several senior cardinals in Rome apparently are furious about plans to open a new McDonald’s restaurant in the shadow of St. Peter’s Basilica, and have reportedly asked Pope Francis to stop the expansion from going ahead. \nBut that’s not the only charge of cultural heresy invading the Vatican’s sacred precincts: Questions are also being raised after the Holy See gave approval for the Hard Rock Cafe chain to open a store on Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s. \nThe Hard Rock Cafe is set to replace a long-standing religious bookstore; the site is currently being renovated and a panel in the window confirms Hard Rock will be the new tenant. \nHamish Dodds, the CEO of Hard Rock, was quoted in the Italian daily La Repubblica as saying the store would only be selling T-shirts and musical memorabilia. Advertisement \nIn the wake of Italy’s economic crisis, such changes are becoming commonplace around the Vatican as banks and bookshops have been replaced by more bars, restaurants and stores filled with tourist souvenirs. \nBut the advent of a McDonald’s seemed to be especially galling. \nItalian Cardinal Elio Sgreccia was the first to publicly sound the alarm, saying the proposal to open an outlet of the global fast-food chain below a Vatican-owned building where several cardinals live was a “controversial, perverse decision.” \nIn an interview published over the weekend in La Repubblica, Sgreccia said the proposal was “not at all respectful of the architectural and urban traditions” of a destination — just a block from St. Peter’s Square — that draws thousands of pilgrims and tourists a day from around the world. \nHe also said serving burgers and fries in the neighborhood was unacceptable because McDonald’s cuisine breached Italian taste. \n“It’s a commercial decision that ignores the culinary traditions of the Roman restaurant industry,” said Sgreccia, 88, who is president emeritus of the Vatican’s Academy for Life, which leads the church’s fight against abortion and euthanasia. \nOne angry cardinal has even written a letter to the pope urging him to intervene against the decision despite the fact that it would reportedly bring 30,000 euros ($33,000) a month in revenue to the Vatican, La Repubblica said. \nSgreccia does not live in the building but was apparently speaking on behalf of some of the seven cardinals who live above the 5,800-square-foot site, which is being rented out by the authority that manages the Holy See’s real estate. The authority goes by the acronym APSA. \nThe retired cardinal said the space should be used to help the needy in keeping with the pope’s desire to create a “church for the poor.” \nSources told the Italian news agency ANSA that the cardinals who live in the building were further angered after receiving letters from APSA advising them that they would be required to contribute to renovation work to accommodate the new tenant. \nBut Cardinal Domenico Calcagno, head of ASPA, denied the claim about the contributions and told La Repubblica he was “not going to back down” because the deal was legally valid. \n“I don’t see the scandal,” he said. \nStaff from Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm that represents McDonald’s in Italy, did not respond to several requests from RNS for comment. \nThe cardinals may not be alone in their protests. \nLocal merchants and residents in the historic Borgo district next to the Vatican have also joined the fight against the proposed fast-food restaurant, describing it as “a serious assault” that does not enhance the artistic and cultural value of the quarter. \nRepresentatives from Rome’s City Council are also taking formal steps to block the McDonald’s from going ahead, at least in the short-term, according to Italian media. \nThe first McDonald’s opened in Rome near the Spanish Steps in the heart of the Eternal City’s historic center in 1986 despite vocal protests. \nThere was a similar outcry in Florence earlier this year when McDonald’s sought to open next to the Renaissance city’s landmark cathedral, known as the Duomo.",

      "text": ". NEW YORK \nMcDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. ©2016 by The Associated Press.

Volunteers are an essential part of bringing this FREE family-friendly event to downtown Chicago, to hundreds of thousands of on-street spectators, and to the millions watching at home.\nThe parade is broadcast, in its entirety, live for three hours on WGN 9 Chicago and nationally on WGN America.\nThere are many opportunities available for individuals (12 years of age and older), families and groups to participate in this magical event, including the following roles:\n- BANNER CARRIER - Smile and wave! Volunteers lead the way along the parade route while carrying banners for each organization represented. Volunteers will walk between 1 and 3 miles on parade day.\n- MERCHANDISE/STREET TEAM - Volunteers can join the Merchandise Team and be the first to see everyone's smiling faces as they pass out goodies to the crowd, sell souvenirs and assist in distributing parade surveys. They also reward fellow parade volunteers as they pass out Volunteer Gift Bags at the end of the parade.\n- POO CREW - Volunteers who join the equestrian waste removal squad receive the loudest cheers on the route! Always a crowd favorite, Poo Crew teams will be assigned to majestic equestrian units to keep the parade route sparkling they work together to remove animal waste. Great for groups and families to do together. Costumes are always welcomed!\n- TECH CREW - The behind-the-scenes heroes! The Tech Crew volunteers help set up and tear down the parade route, including VIP area, bleacher seating, dasher wall and much more. By making the parade route ready for the hundreds of thousands of street-side spectators and millions of viewers at home, they set the stage (literally!) for a memorable event.\n- UNIT LIAISONS - Unit Liaison volunteers are responsible for specific groups of performers and escorting them through the entire parade route.

      "text": "McDonald’s bets on faster food with digital ordering and table service By John Glenday - 18 November 2016 09:24am McDonald’s bets on faster food with digital ordering and table service \nMcDonald’s is shaking up all 14,000 of its American restaurants with a faster food service that will allow customers to order their burgers, shakes and fries from a digital touch-screen instead of queuing for service. \nAfter the order is processed, food will be delivered to the consumer's table. \nThe shake-up was ordered by chief executive Steve Easterbrook who demonstrated the new system in New York by walking up to a freshly installed digital screen to make an order, once paid for customers can take their seat with a digital location pinger so staff can staff can unite the order with its owner. \nEasterbrook said: “Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer. We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them.” \nTechnophobes will still have the option to queue the traditional way but it is hoped that the solution will keep customers coming back for more by giving them a comfy seat whilst they await their food. \nDrive-through customers, who account for up to 70% of the company's sales, will be unaffected by the move. \nThe hi-tech system is already available in 2,600 McDonald’s restaurants worldwide - principally Australia, Britain and Canada where around a quarter of transactions now occur on in-store screens.",

      "text": "  10:56 am By drew.dixon@jacksonville.com McDonald’s introduces digital kiosks at eight First Coast area restaurants \nThis McDonald’s at 3552 Blanding Blvd. in Jacksonville is one of eight restaurants on the First Coast that began offering digital kiosks for automated ordering by customers Friday. (Florida Times-Union/Bruce Lipsky) \nTechnology and customer service merged Friday at eight McDonald’s fast food restaurants on the First Coast. \nAnd while the changes are designed to make it easier for customers to order their food, the move also poses a threat of reducing the workforce. \nAs part of a broader transformation at restaurants nationwide, McDonald’s officials announced in a prepared statement Friday that the restaurants are offering new digital kiosks within the restaurants that allow customers to self-order their food and pay the tab at the kiosks. Customers can still order at counters. Customers can also use Apple or Android pay mobile applications on mobile devices. \nAfter the order is placed from the kiosk, the food is delivered to the table of the customer by McDonald’s employees, or customers can pick up their order at the service counter. \nEventually there will be 69 McDonald’s restaurants that will be equipped with the digital upgrades in 2017. \nThe eight First Coast area McDonald’s restaurants that are currently offering the kiosks include: \n• 103 Tuscan Way, St. Augustine. \n• 10135 San Jose Blvd. \n• 1896 S. 8th St., Fernandina Beach. \n• 8570 Argyle Forest Blvd. \n• 435 Atlantic Blvd. in Atlantic Beach. \n• 51 S. 3rd St. in Jacksonville Beach. \n• 909 Dunn Ave. \nCandace Moody, vice president of communications of the workforce development organization CareerSource Northeast Florida, said digital kiosks at restaurants aren’t new. Restaurants such as Chili’s and Panera Bread already offer them. \nWhile McDonald’s may be the biggest fast food chain to implement them, digital kiosks are a growing trend that will eliminate many jobs, Moody said. \n“The online version or kiosk can give a lot more information than a human can, especially with a young worker, a teenager,” Moody said. \n“I do think it’s a disturbing trend for the service industry with young people finding jobs because there’s going to be fewer and fewer of them as technology takes over. But that’s a trend in everything,” Moody said. \nAs minimum wages increase, businesses will continue to seek ways to minimize hourly costs for workers, Moody said. \nIn Florida, for instance, the minimum wage has increased to $8.05 per hour under a state law that provides for cost-of-living increases. That accounts for the state minimum wage being more than the national minimum of $7.25 per hour. \nMoody said Florida’s minimum wage is about to increase to $8.10 per hour on Jan. 1 due to another cost of living adjustment. \n“The workforce that’s employed in the service industry has a lot of turnover and requires a lot of training and oversight,” she said. “It’s one of those things that technology is more reliable and less expensive in the long run.” \nBut reductions in human service at restaurants was already underway well before the incursion of digital kiosks. Moody said most fast food restaurants already have self-service drink fountains, which are designed to reduce the number of worker hours spent on pouring drinks; and customers bus their own tables. \nMoody said the demand for increased minimum wages sounds attractive. But the because of the impact on entry level jobs, increasing wages could be counterproductive. \nPersonal injury attorney John Morgan announced this week that he is considering a run for Florida governor in 2018. The Orlando Democrat and architect of the legalization of the medical marijuana referendum that was approved by voters said one of his main platforms would be to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 per hour. \nMoody said such a pledge could certainly attract many voters. But she said boosting minimum pay that high during a time when technology is threatening the workforce could cost even more jobs. \n“That sounds really noble, but what it’s going to do is accelerate the pace of this technology taking over actual jobs,” Moody said. “I think that’s counterproductive and I’ve never been a fan of raising and raising the minimum wage because what it does is drive companies to look for other solutions other than entry-level labor.” \nDrew Dixon: (904)359-4098.",

      "text": "Wegner School had a great time during McTeacher's Night on November 16th at the McDonald's in West Chicago. The Wegner McTeacher's Night was a fun way to bring the teachers together and have the opportunity to meet the parents of students and members of the community, The money raised is being used towards PTO miscellaneous items.\nTeachers and staff members from the school worked jobs such as greeting guests, the front counter, the drive-thru, and serving ice cream. The Wegner Chorus was on site singing a few songs and kept the energy going strong. The children were excited by the Special Appearance made by Ronald McDonald.\nSpecial thank you goes out to Krisann Castro, Kindergarten Teacher, for coordinating the entire event. McTeacher's Night was courtesy of the West Chicago McDonald's owner/operator, The Lardas Family.

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nWhen a new technology or social media “hot thing” emerges, chances are about 100 percent that the guys in the sales department are going to find a way to use it to sell more tires/shampoo/waffle irons/whatever. Take Twitter, for example. Slap a #hashtag on it, and you’re off to the races. Virtual Reality (VR) is still in its infancy stages — the typical goggles don’t quite lend themselves to walking down the street while looking cool (exhibit 1: Google Glass). But McDonald’s, the biggest burger slinger on the planet, has found a way to incorporate the burgeoning VR platform into its advertising pitches.\nAndroid Headlines notes if you have Google Cardboard or a similar device like Gear VR, HTC Vive, and Daydream View, this 360-degree video will plop you down at one of Mickey D’s new high-tech “Just For You” restaurants that are now showing up in markets like Florida, California, and New York after an overseas roll out. You get a VR view of a new ordering kiosk and can check out a modern dining room that is far removed from what you used to get in the old white buildings with the red stripes.\nMore: Let your friends curate your restaurant bucket list with Truffle\nThere’s a key concept here that is worth considering, though; one that every emerging technology to consider. Is the McDonald’s audience going to embrace this type of approach? The NBA is jumping in with both sneakers , for one. Sure, it’s a fun thing to fiddle with, but is there going to be any type of mass appeal use for VR?\nMcDonald’s is a major mass appeal business, with thousands of stores all around the world. While the younger techy demographic that has grown up on Facebook may find this approach fascinating, the older folks that grew up with Ronald McDonald is more likely to shirk it off. Time will tell if this becomes a viable concept, but for now, it’s fun to take a peek into the McDonald’s of the future that is here, now.\nGreat deal!

McDonald’s history is not a good one, and fast food restaurants already are known to have a lot of mystery ingredients, but this tops the list. Previously we brought you a report that detailed disturbing audio admissions by a man that claimed McDonald’s uses human meat as a filler in their 100% beef hamburgers and the fact that McDonald’s has been accused of using worm meat fillers. Now, inspectors have allegedly found human meat and horse meat in the freezer’s of an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory. Human meat was also recovered in several trucks that were on their way to deliver the patties to the fast food restaurants. According to various reports, authorities have inspected factories and restaurants across the country and have found human meat in 90% of the locations. Horse meat was found in 65% of the locations. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler reporters, “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible”. Cannibalism has gone back tens of thousands of years and is still present today. In 2013 a North Korean man was executed for killing his children for food. Today there are a few tribes that still believe in eating human flesh as a cultural practice. Here in America, people have obsessed about eating human meat such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish. We have labeled them mentally ill. To be in denial that this type of thing does not happen, would be foolish. Now the customers of McDonald’s fast food restaurants want answers! How long have they been using this human meat? Where did they get the children from? Were they already dead when brought into the factories? Authorities hope to have all of these questions answered as they thoroughly investigate all facilities. Get healthy fast by avoiding these fast food restaurants all together....",

      "text": "The Fight for 15 movement is promising its largest and “most disruptive” day of action yet. McDonald’s workers and supporters rallying outside a Chicago McDonald’s in 2015. CREDIT: AP Photo/M. Spencer Green The Fight for 15 campaign, which has orchestrated an escalating series of strikes and protests among low-wage workers demanding higher pay and the right to unionize, announced on Monday that it will stage its biggest day of action yet on November 29.\nOrganizers from the campaign are promising the “largest, most disruptive protest” in the movement’s four-year history. The day will include strikes by thousands of fast food workers in more than 340 cities across the country, a strike by hundreds of workers at Chicago O’Hare airport, and civil disobedience at McDonald’s and 20 of the nation’s largest airports.\nThose risking arrest will include fast food employees, airport workers, childcare and home care providers, and university graduate students.\nOlivia Pac, who works as a wheelchair attendant and guard on jet bridges at Chicago’s O’Hare airport, will be going on strike for the first time in her life. Although she lives at home with her parents, Pac says she often “barely [has] enough to pay the bills,” particularly while trying to help chip in after her father lost his job in a factory.\n“We’re not asking for a lot. We do hard jobs.” “We’re not asking for a lot. We do hard jobs,” she said on a call with the media. She noted that her job, which is “difficult and both physically and mentally demanding,” has at times required her to stand in negative 30 degree weather or endure cuts and bruises dealing with heavy equipment. “But every day I go home and I don’t know if I’ve earned enough to get by,” she said.\nLiAnne Flakes is a childcare provider in Tampa, Florida who will risk arrest in acts of civil disobedience for the first time in her life. “This is a big deal for me and something I’ve never done before,” she said. “I am going to take this step because too many parents don’t have access to childcare and too many teachers are struggling to pay the bills.”\nFlakes gets paid $12.50 an hour to watch eight children, a sum that has left her frequently struggling to pay rent, going without healthy food, and unable to afford a car.\nShe worked to help elect candidates she supported during the campaign, but, she said, “I’m not stopping just because the election is over.”\nThe workers preparing to protest are vowing not just to call on corporations to raise pay and allow employees to unionize, but also to call on elected officials to support the same rights and a host of other issues. They’ll be demanding no deportations of undocumented immigrants, an end to police violence against black people, and the protection of health care coverage. “We will be using unrelenting opposition to combat these things,” promised Terrance Wise, a McDonald’s worker in Kansas City, Missouri.\nThe day of action on November 29 will coincide with the four-year anniversary of the launch of the Fight for 15 movement, when fast food workers in New York City went on a one-day strike to demand a $15 minimum wage. Since then, the protests have spread across the entire country and resulted in victories in a number of cities that raised their wage floors to $15 an hour as well as two states .\nThousands of low-wage workers will strike for higher pay and anti-racist policies was originally published in ThinkProgress on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

It is estimated that more than 30,000 cups of coffee will be served by WestJet to customers in signature cups. \nThe first brewed McCafe coffee was offered on Monday on Flight 659 that flew from Toronto to Calgary. By December 1, the airline expects that McCafe will be served hot across its fleet of Boeing 737NG and 767NG. In future McDonald's will serve coffee on WestJet Encore flights also. \nCanadians have a special love for coffee and the annual average volume per person is 152 liters, much more than 115 liters for an American. \nGregg Saretsky, WestJet President and CEO said, \"We are delighted to bring a new way to cafÃ© on board WestJet and know that our 21 million guests per year will enjoy the taste of a complimentary McCafÃ© Premium Roast Coffee wherever they are flying. The collaboration between our two caring brands is a perfect pairing, as McCafÃ©'s values are reflected in WestJet's commitment to offer an unmatched guest experience.\" \n ",

      "text": "McDonald's trying to cater to 'health nuts' with new options ... but they aren't biting \nMonday, November 21, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: McDonalds , antibiotic-free meat , healthy eating (NaturalNews) As the healthy eating and whole foods movements storm across the nation, certain large scale fast food retailers are struggling to keep customers waiting in line. McDonald's, for instance, has been trying to win over more food-savvy consumers with \"healthier\" offerings such as antibiotic-free chicken, kale salad and wholewheat muffins.McDonald's is not alone in this new endeavor. Panera Bread Co. and Chipotle are rather expected retailers aboard the \"healthier options\" train; Panera, for instance, has offered antibiotic-free meat for over a decade. But there are quite a few others that are a bit more surprising. Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Papa Johns for instance, have all made promises related to improving the quality of their food or providing better options for those of us who are concerned about what is in our food .Fast food chains around the country are spending millions of dollars to create menus that are free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other undesirable ingredients . But will they actually draw in more health-minded customers? So far, it's hard to tell. Many consumers are unconcerned with what is in their food, so the food giants' efforts are of little value to them. Others remain unimpressed with the fast food industry's attempts at luring in more customers. In an interview with Bloomberg , a consumer named Erica Kelley told writer Leslie Patton that McDonald's new menu did little to lure her into the Golden Arches. \"It's just a gimmick. I still think it's gross,\" Ms. Kelley said of McDonald's recently added items, such as their antibiotic-free crispy chicken sandwich.While the industry is learning that customers who value their health and the quality of their food are hard to sway, diet experts say that these new, revamped menu options may not even be that great for you. After all, it's still fast food, and it's still loaded with calories, salt, added sugars and added fat.As Michael Moss, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and author of the best-selling book, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us , points out, exchanging high-fructose corn syrup for sugar is not exactly a huge step forward. Moss does believe that they are doing some great things, though. He notes, \"McDonald's has done some amazing stuff over the years, in recent years, in improving the quality of the meat, and meat from animals that are well treated. I really love that about them.\"Moss expects that as the demand for affordable, healthy food grows, the availability of such choices will also continue to expand. He says that in many ways, McDonald's is very much a leader in the fast food industry, and that other retailers will likely continue to follow their lead.McDonald's Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told analysts that Chicken McNugget sales had risen 10 percent in just two months, after a single announcement that the crowd-favorite was going clean. The company has even declared that all of its poultry is now going to be free of antibiotics that are considered important for human medicine. Of course, that description is not quite what many of us are looking for – but is still an improvement.Not all ventures into a healthier marketplace have been met with success. McDonald's reports that its salads – which were, at one time, heavily promoted – make up a meager 2 to 3 percent of its sales.This is not really all that surprising though. In general, people do not eat fast food with the expectation of it being something healthy. As W. Douglas Evans, professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, points out, most fast food diners are not health-conscious. \"Most of the people at McDonald's aren't there to get a salad,\" he noted dutifully.As \"fast-casual\" restaurants such as Panera Bread continue to boom, it is no surprise that McDonald's and their ilk have been forced to respond in some way. But not all retailers are responding in the same way. Burger King, for example, has doubled down on their indulgent and excessive offerings. Nothing paints that picture more clearly than their Whopperito – which features all the trappings of a traditional Whopper doused in queso sauce and then rolled into a burrito. In September, Cheetos-flavored chicken fries were also introduced. Customers appear to be enjoying the new menu items that eschew the trend of healthier food.At this point, it seems that what the future will hold for the fast food industry is truly anyone's guess.
