      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone With Larger Screen Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone With Larger Screen \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro 5, Studio May Be Shipping Soon Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro 5, Studio May Be Shipping Soon 3 \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone news is determined to be the ultimate mobile device, which people are waiting to preorder. With Windows, Pro 5 and Microsoft Studio, the company is heading into a direction that will make its products hot, and some skeptics say Amazon might be the way to order the Surface Phone once a shipping date has been announced. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Microsoft Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Shoppers Locate Microsoft Surface Discounts Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Shoppers Locate Microsoft Surface Discounts Jennifer Hong Dec 05, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Shoppers Locate Microsoft Surface Discounts 2 \nShoppers are still finding Windows Surface Phone deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With Snapdragon 835 Processor Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With Snapdragon 835 Processor 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "title": "Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Market",
      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Market Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Market 3 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Surface Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Jennifer Hong Dec 05, 2016 9 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Market ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Tweet \nTerrorism is a daily threat to our freedoms. It is unfortunate, as we used to be able to go throughout our days without the thought of violence. Now, it dominates the news. Heck, when I am in Penn Station in NYC, I see soldiers with machine guns. Sigh. \nUnfortunately, terrorists thrive on the internet too. Using social media and video platforms like YouTube, these evil-doers look to recruit new members while sharing propaganda. Today, Google announces that it is partnering with some major players -- Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter -- to fight online terrorism with a special database. The partners will look to protect user privacy in the process. \n\"Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' -- unique digital 'fingerprints' -- for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online\", says Google. \nALSO READ: Twitter has terminated 235,000 terrorist accounts in just six months \nThe search giant further explains, \"our companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services -- content most likely to violate all of our respective companies' content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate\". \nThis is actually a very cool project. It reminds me of the time immediately after 9/11, when we discovered government agencies were not properly aligned or openly communicating. By opening the lines of communication and sharing information, the agencies were much more effective. Here, we see major online companies in the private sector voluntarily sharing information to better fight terrorism. I am very happy to see this being done proactively, and not as a result of a catastrophe or government mandate. \nOf course, the web is much more than Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter, but don't worry -- these four are looking to bring other organizations into the fold too. This will take time, however, as incorporating too many companies too fast could prove disastrous -- leaked information and such. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. \nWhat do you think of this collaboration to fight terrorism? Tell me in the comments.",

      "title": "How to: Change Internet Options in Microsoft Edge",
      "text": "0 0 \nWindows 10 brought new changes, and one of the biggest ones was the introduction of a new browser. Microsoft Edge works a bit differently than Internet Explorer , and therefore we’re going to show you how change Internet Options in Microsoft Edge. How to change Internet Options in Microsoft Edge? \n  Microsoft Edge is a new browser designed to be the default browser on all Microsoft’s devices. As you can see, Microsoft Edge is a successor to Internet Explorer, but unlike Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge is a Universal application, so it works a bit differently. This makes changing Internet Options on Edge a bit different, so today   do it. How to – Change Microsoft Edge Internet Options? \nMost settings that you want to change in Microsoft Edge are easily accessible and you can change them with few clicks. To change settings in Microsoft Edge you just need to click the Menu icon in the top right corner and choose Settings from the menu. \nWhen Settings pane opens, the first option that you’ll see is Change my default button. This option allows you to quickly assign Microsoft Edge as the default browser on your PC. If Edge is already your default browser, then this option won’t be available to you. For   \nNext set of options is related to the look of Microsoft Edge and its startup. Using these options you can choose quickly between dark or light theme for Edge. You can also change which pages will open the next time you start Edge. You can choose between regular start page, an empty tab or specific pages. There’s also an option to open previous pages that were open during the last browsing session. This option is great because it allows you to quickly continue browsing where you left off. READ ALSO: How to: Upgrade   of Edge on Windows 10 \nNext setting allows you to change how new tabs will look. You can choose to make all new tabs blank, or you can have top sites with or without recommended content. This option is great if you want to have the latest news quickly accessible. \nNext option is related to your bookmarks, and it allows you to show or hide the bookmarks bar. Using this option you can also import bookmarks from other popular browsers easily. \nJust like all other browsers, Edge stores cache on your computer in order to save certain website settings. If you need to clear the cache, there’s an option available that allows you to clear certain parts of the cache. If you want, you can also enable the option to automatically clear cache whenever you close Microsoft Edge. \nSyncing is a big part of Windows 10, and Microsoft Edge allows you to sync your bookmarks and reading list easily, so you can enjoy in your favorite websites on any Microsoft’s device. As for reading, you can change the reading view style or the font size easily. \nWe covered the basic settings of Microsoft Edge, but Edge also comes with some advanced settings. First thing you’ll see when you open the Advanced settings pane are three options. By checking these options you can show or hide the home button or choose to disable pop-ups. You can also disable Adobe Flash from Advanced settings pane. Next options are related to downloads and by changing them you can set the default download folder. In addition, you can enable the option to choose what to do with each download. \nMicrosoft Edge also allows you to change your proxy settings if you’re concerned about your privacy online. There’s also an option to manage notifications and saved passwords. If you want, you can also save form entries. Another useful option is Send Do Not Track requests that will prevent tracking cookies from being downloaded. There’s also an option to use Cortana in Microsoft Edge. READ ALSO: Microsoft is forcing Edge on users by disabling other browsers \nNext set of options allows you to change your search engine settings. By changing these options you can choose a different search engine or turn on search and site suggestions. You can also manage cookies and block all cookies or only third-party cookies, but by default all cookies are allowed to be downloaded. \nLastly, you can turn on the prediction option to speed up browsing and reading. If you’re concerned about malicious websites and downloads, you can also turn on SmartScreen Filter option to protect you from malicious content. \nAs you can see, Microsoft Edge comes with relatively basic options available. This is one of its major flaws, and many users reported that Internet Explorer offers more advanced options to choose from. Internet Explorer and many other web browsers can be configured by changing Internet Options settings. Although Internet Explorer uses all of these settings, other browsers, including Edge, don’t completely rely on Internet Options for configuration. Before changing Internet Options configuration, keep in mind that some changes might not be applied to Microsoft Edge or any other third-party browser. To open Internet Options, do the following: Press Windows Key + S and enter internet options . Select Internet Options from the list of results. \nOnce you open Internet Options, you’ll see a number of tabs available. General tab is in charge for startup settings, open tabs and browsing history. In addition, you can change the appearance of the browser right from here. Most settings in this tab are related to Internet Explorer so they won’t affect Edge or other browsers in any way. \nNext tab is Security tab, and in this tab you can change the security settings and create a list of trusted or blocked sites. Some settings from this tab can affect Edge and other browsers. READ ALSO: Microsoft Edge and IE11 won’t support websites with SHA-1 certification \nNext on our list is Privacy tab and in here you can change your cookies settings or turn on the ability to block pop-ups. This tab is mostly related to Internet Explorer, so it won’t affect Microsoft Edge. Content tab is in charge for certificates and autocomplete settings. There’s also an option for Feeds and Web Slices. This tab is mostly unrelated to Edge, and it only affects Internet Explorer. \nConnections tab is related to third-party browsers since it allows you to add VPN or use proxy with your browser. Changes made from Connections tab affect your entire system including other web browsers such as Microsoft Edge. \nPrograms tab allows you to change how you open links, but it also allows you to manage browser add-ons. These add-ons aren’t related to Edge extensions , and they only affect Internet Explorer. From this tab you can also choose a default HTML editor and other default programs, such as email client for example. These are system-wide settings, so they will affect Microsoft Edge and other browsers. \nLastly, Advanced tab allows you to change all sorts of hidden settings for your browser. The list of options mostly affects Internet Explorer, but there are some system-wide options available as well. \nMicrosoft Edge is a great browser, but it doesn’t have some advanced options that Internet Explorer has. Edge doesn’t use Internet Options to the fullest, and this is one of its major flaws. If you see this as a major problem and you miss the advanced configuration, perhaps you should switch to Internet Explorer or any other browser.  ",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nMicrosoft National Cloud Partner Sales Senior Manager William Lewallen assured partners that as the company ventures into new cloud territories, the channel remains top-of-mind for Microsoft executives. \nLewallen, speaking at the NexGen Cloud Conference in Anaheim, Calif., said he has heard some Microsoft partners fear that the company was pursuing a more direct sales-heavy strategy. \nLewallen said if that was the case, “Our business will wither on the vine and die. We don’t want that, and I know that you don’t want that.” \n“I know that our leaders are more committed than ever to the channel,” he added. \nLewallen said he sees particular opportunity for cloud channel partners around Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform. \n“Our program has become very, very successful quickly, with a long way to go. This is kind of the next gold mine for us to harvest together,” he said. \n“At the end of the day, if people want a simplified business experience, they’re not going to get it from us, they’re going to get it from you,” he added. \nFor more coverage of this topic, attend NexGen Cloud Conference & Expo .

Slide Shows The 10 Biggest Channel Stories Of 2016 \nThe channel saw massive business model transformation in 2016, with top vendors unloading legacy IT outsourcing units to focus on their core business, and broadline players buying their way into the cloud, telecom, and hyper-converged infrastructure.",

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 12 screenshots A simple to use   import information from an Microsoft Access database to PostgreSQL easy and quickly AccessToPostgres is a comprehensive and reliable software that allows you to migrate data from a Microsoft Access storage file to a PostgreSQL server in a quick way. The program allows you to convert tables, for higher compatibility or translate a query into a table. Moreover, it can handle large batches of data safely and easily. Before running, AccessToPostgres requires you to connect to both instances, namely an offline Microsoft Access file, then to an online PostgreSQL server and database. You might need to provide your own login credentials, in case the databases are protected. When the connection to both databases is established and stable, you can start managing the storage files. You may import tables from the Microsoft Access database, then analyze the information contained within. For a better compatibility and insurance that no data is lost during the transfer, the software allows you to convert the tables to a format supported by PostgreSQL. The software can convert individual tables or handle batches of them simultaneously, without slowing down its performance. Moreover, you can easily convert queries from Access to tables in PostgreSQL. The software can schedule recurrent data migration from the Access files to PostgreSQL databases, with the help of the task scheduler. The wizard can take you through all the steps of the process, from selecting the application to defining parameters. You can assign a specific name to the task, then set the starting time, date and the repetition frequency. Additionally, you may set a username and password, thus to make sure that no unauthorised user disrupts the process. AccessToPostgres also allows you to control its functions from the command line. You need to save the current session and create a batch file, in which both the Access instance and the PostgreSQL are assigned unicode definitions. Once the batch file is created, you can easily run it through command line. With AccessToPostgres, you can be sure that you can perform a safe data transfer and conversion from Microsoft Access to PostgreSQL databases. The software also allows you to save the current session, with the settings and actions, in order to load it at a later time and continue your work. System requirements",

This will make it easier for all the companies involved to spot the same content on their own sites and remove it.\nHere's their description of how it will work:\nOur companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate.\nThe statement notes that content won't be removed automatically as each company will review each piece of content against their respective policies. Still, it could make it easier for the companies, which operate the most far-reaching social networks, to identify terrorist content more quickly.\n\"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,\" the companies said in a group statement. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\"",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company&apos;s service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies&apos; content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today&apos;s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media&apos;s use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik&apos;s page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter&apos;s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter&apos;s vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it&apos;s already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n---\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\n ",

      "text": "Home Info Tech Reliance Infosystems, Microsoft urge organisations to embrace Digital Transformation Reliance Infosystems, Microsoft urge organisations to embrace Digital Transformation December 6, 2016 Bode Adewumi Info Tech \nReliance Infosystems Limited has joined leading software company, Microsoft Nigeria to charge organisations on digital transformation adoption. The call was made recently at the Christmas-in-the-Cloud event which held at Microsoft Nigeria office premises, Victoria Island Lagos and had in attendance CIOs and CEOs of leading organisations in Nigeria. \nWelcoming participants, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Reliance Infosystems, Mr Olayemi popoola noted that Christmas in Cloud is an initiative of Reliance Infosystems in partnership with Microsoft Nigeria to charge organisations to leverage ICT solutions for profitability. \nAccording to him, “Christmas-in-the-Cloud is an annual year-end event that brings together C-Level executives across various verticals to share ideas on how to widen the impact of technology input in companies’ performance.” \nSpeaking further, Popoola stated that it is imperative for organisations to embrace digital transformation if they are going to make headways in today’s competitive business world. He hinted on the need for organisations to adopt technology that connects with people indigenously, while also using same to increase the value and efficiency in all aspects of their business models. \nWhile delivering a note on why organisations should adopt cloud technology, Head of Legal Affairs at Microsoft Nigeria, Mr John Edokpolo, mentioned that today’s realities have conditioned organizations to take their businesses beyond what it used to be in the past and more businesses all over the world are seeing the need to be in the cloud. On why organizations should trust Microsoft cloud, Edokpolo said organizations who entrust their data to the Microsoft cloud have every right to feel safe as data safety is key. \n“Because it’s your data, you decide who gains access, and you work with us to decide where it is located. To safeguard your data, we use advanced security technology and cryptography. Our compliance is independently audited, and we’re transparent on many levels—from how we handle legal demands for your customer data to the security of our code. We offer detailed trust information on each of our cloud services,” Edokpolo said.",

      "title": "Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Smartphone Market",
      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Smartphone Market Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Smartphone Market 3 \nMicrosoft has always treated its   with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Mary Smith Dec 05, 2016 10 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Aims to Compete In Smartphone Market ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Home Technology   by Microsoft Comes With Snapdragon Processor   by Microsoft Comes With Snapdragon Processor 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release   models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft   prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — A handful of technology companies are teaming up to identify and remove videos and images believed to be terrorist content posted to their online platforms, but how they define “terrorist content” remains to be seen.\nIn recent years, terrorist organizations — most notably ISIS/ISIL — have posted countless messages, images and videos to various social media platforms and websites.\nOn Monday, the U.S. tech companies — Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube (owned by Google) — announced their plans to create a shared database of unique digital fingerprints, or “hashes,” for imagery and videos for violent terrorist messages and recruitment materials. Each company committed to adding information about the images removed from their services with the other companies, via the database.\nIn a joint statement released Monday, the tech companies explain why they have decided to work together, stating:\n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.”\nBut it remains to be seen how the companies will decide what content will be added to the database, other than as they state, “content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies.”\nThe companies will have to determine whether the content falls under terrorist content or free speech.\nAccording to the joint release, “Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found.”\nThe four tech companies maintain that they will not be sharing “personally identifiable information” and that matching content will not be automatically removed their sites.\nEach company will retain its own process to handle their users’ grievances or appeals to its removals.\nBy Hannah Albarazi – Follow her on Twitter: @hannahalbarazi . \n",

      "text": "last » \nThe manager of Microsoft's Cloud Solution Provider program told attendees of NexGen Cloud conference Monday that to seize the tremendous opportunities for profit presented by the shift to the cloud, they need to shift their sales mentality to focus on customer lifetime value, and not individual deals. \nMicrosoft understands its channel is the only way to negotiate the massive migration of customers—both existing and new—to Azure and other cloud services, said William Lewallen, Microsoft's senior manager for national cloud partner sales, at the conference sponsored by CRN parent The Channel Company, in Anaheim, Calif. \nFor that reason, the world's largest software company is \"making a triple-down bet on our channel,\" Lewallen said as he looked out at many familiar faces in the room. \n[Related: The 10 Biggest Cloud Stories Of 2016 ] \nThe CSP program, which allows partners to bundle products, add services and manage billing while leveraging Microsoft's cloud platform, has scaled to five thousand partners in its first 18 months. \n\"Were now at this point where the place we need to go again is very reliant on you guys,\" he told partners. \nOf attendees who answered questionnaires before coming to NexGen, 61 percent have earned Microsoft's Silver or Gold competencies, Lewallen said. \nBut most of those partners still have a lot of room to add profit by expanding their cloud practices—managed services accounted for more than a quarter of total revenue from 44 percent of attendees and 35 percent saw more than a quarter of their revenue generated from cloud services. \nThe market opportunity is still emerging, Lewallen said, and Microsoft is investing heavily to help partners navigate the transition to recurring revenue models. \nThat starts with differentiating their practices and developing a specialization strategy, the Microsoft executive said, \"because the reality is things are much, much more competitive for us. And I believe for you.\" \nMicrosoft has many large customers who are now competing with its traditional partners, thinking about how they can add value by leveraging their own intellectual property to implement Microsoft's solutions, he said.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Debuts Another Wise-Cracking Chatbot \nMicrosoft is giving it another go at releasing experimental chatbots into the wild. \nThe technology giant is testing a new chatbot named Zo on the social instant messaging app Kik, according to a Monday report by technology website MSPoweruser . A chatbot is a type of software program that users can communicate and interact with via writing or speaking. \nAlthough chatbots have been around for years—with some companies using them as help-desk assistants on their websites—the rise of artificial intelligence technologies have made them more powerful. Using AI techniques like deep learning and natural language processing , researchers can train chatbots on written conversations, which presumably makes them more capable of understanding human language. \nLike other big tech companies including Google goog and Facebook fb , Microsoft msft sees a big future for chatbots. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, for example, explained in March that chatbots will make it easier for people to perform tasks, such as ordering taxis, through simply talking to the program and requesting it to do so. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nBut as the technology matures for these types of complex interactions to take place, Microsoft wants to test its bots on various social media and communication services in order to improve them before incorporating the bots into an actual product. \nIt’s unclear what Microsoft hopes to learn from its new chatbot Zo, or why it chose to release it on only one messaging app so far. In March, Microsoft tested a chatbot Tay on Twitter twtr , but Internet miscreants commenced a serious of offensive conversations with the software program. The more racist and unpleasant conversations Tay absorbed, the more the chatbot began to speak to others in a similar offensive manner, which caused Microsoft to shut down the experiment and apologize . \nCurrently, it seems that Microsoft is taking some precautionary measures to ensure Zo doesn’t go haywire like its cousin Tay. \nFor example, MSPoweruser reported that when asked about President-elect Donald Trump, Zo responded: “People can say some awful things when talking politics so I don’t discuss.” Apparently, Zo’s creators programmed it with a variation on the familiar adage, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothing at all.” \nA Twitter user named Bob also posted Monday his interactions with Zo. Had my first chat with #Zo .ai, Microsoft's new #chatbot . Quirky and dare I say it, funny! https://t.co/etDo5wG9ap \n— Bob (@racrozier) December 5, 2016 \nIn Bob’s conversation, Zo asked Bob where he is looking to live, to which Bob replied: “Any where that makes my family and me happy.” Zo then said, “Having a family would be nice,” and when Bob asked Zo if it had any family members, Zo responded with a joke. \n“I have Modern Family DVR’d? Does that count?” Zo said in jest. For more about Microsoft, watch: \nPresumably, Microsoft used comedians to create funny conversations or jokes that Zo could learn from and respond to with its own quips, similar to how Microsoft trained its Tay chatbot. \nA Microsoft explained to Fortune that Zo is part of Microsoft’s research related to “new conversation models.” \n“Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot we’ve named ‘Zo,'” said the spokesperson.“With Zo, we’re focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.”",

      "text": "Facebook is at the center of the fake news crisis. (Reuters/Dado Ruvic) Share Alison Griswold 1 hour ago \nFour of the world’s biggest disseminators of online content—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft—said today that they are ready to do more self-policing to keep terrorist propaganda from spreading on the internet. \nThe companies say they will create a shared database to track “violent terrorist imagery” and “terrorist recruitment videos or images,” helping each other more efficiently review content that might violate their specific policies. They will do this by logging hashes, digital identifiers that are unique to each piece of content. Once a hash is added to the database, each company will make its own decision about whether to remove that particular piece of content. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,” the four companies said in a joint press release . \nConversations around what role tech companies should play in policing the content on their platforms have grown more urgent ever since Donald Trump won the US presidential election on Nov. 8. Much of the discussion has focused on the fake and often hate-fueled news that spread on Facebook and elsewhere during the campaign, as well as the “ filter bubbles ” of information created by social media and an increasingly fragmented media. \nThe collaboration announced today is limited to online terrorist content. It does not represent “a new normal” for other content questions, one of the companies involved said, adding that the spread of terrorism online “is a pressing problem that requires special attention from technology companies.” Creating a database has been under discussion forsome time, the company said, declining to be more specific. \nFacebook will maintain the database, and only those working on the project will be able to contribute to and access it, with the potential for other companies to join in the future. Another participant said the database will not accept hashes flagged by governments and law enforcement, and that governments would need to submit formal requests for information maintained in it as they would for any other content inquiries. \nTwitter said in a statement that it has suspended more than 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating its policy on “violent threats and the promotion of terrorism.” Microsoft in May banned terrorist content from its consumer services and said it was looking into ways of alerting users to “information that may cause them significant harm, including terrorist content” that was surfaced by its Bing search engine. \nAll four companies emphasized in the press release that they remain committed to protecting users’ privacy and freedom of expression.

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Microsoft Surface Discounts Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Microsoft Surface Discounts Jennifer Hong Dec 05, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone Pro 5, Microsoft Surface Discounts 2 \nShoppers are still finding Windows Surface Phone deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "No one is going to use Microsoft’s answer to the Amazon Echo Chris Mills Pin it Share The Amazon Echo, a $200 device that sits on your kitchen counter and silently judges everything you say, has been a surprise hit with consumers. Google has rushed its own version to market , Apple is said to be working on something similar, and now it looks like Microsoft is going to half-heartedly join the fray. According to Windows Central , Microsoft is working on an update that will give any Windows PC the always-listening, schedule planning, home-controlling capabilities of Echo and Alexa. It sounds like a nice idea on paper, but in the real world, I guarantee it will suck. DON’T MISS: Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by over-ambitious design, engineers find As Windows Central explains, “Home Hub is a Windows 10 feature designed to make your PC the center of your home, by making shared PCs more communal and bringing the connected home to Windows.” In real speak, that means Home Hub is a slew of software updates that will add a “Welcome Screen” to Windows that acts like a “virtual fridge door,” showing to-do lists, calendar events and sticky notes. Cortana will always be listening to respond to commands, and she’ll also get the ability to control smart home devices like Nest or Hue, just like the Echo. According to the report, Microsoft thinks Home Hub PCs will be the center of the family, with a special new “family account” that anyone can log into. It’s meant to live on a kitchen counter or somewhere convenient, so everyone will use it as a replacement for a family calendar or to-do notes on the fridge. It’s a nice idea, but I almost guarantee it will fail for a list of reasons. Specifically: Desktop PCs are already dying as everyone moves to laptops. No family wants to spend hundreds of dollars on a Windows PC that’s a replacement for $5 of fridge magnets. Microsoft apparently envisages its hardware partners building “Home Hub PCs.” These will probably look like glorified all-in-ones with small screens and cute, colorful plastic cases. They’ll also cost a minimum of $300, which is a hard sell when the cheapest Echo hardware is $30. People don’t want a PC sitting in their kitchen. Amazon Echo and Google Home are designed to look like unobtrusive Bluetooth speakers for a reason: having a gigantic touchscreen gadget sitting on your kitchen counter is not good interior design. The magic of Alexa and the Google Assistant is the deep integration into your music services and smart home. If people want calendar appointments, they’ll probably ask the assistant on their phone. All these reasons also assume that Microsoft manages to deliver this product on time, without a bunch of strange bugs, and before the trend for in-home personal assistants has been wiped out by brain implants or something. Let’s just hope that Home Hub is an optional software upgrade, for once. Trending right now:",

      "text": "CAD $4,000 CAD $6,669 \nPricing is based on the $3,000 HoloLens value in the United States. Some minor differences to regional price tags are largely due to exchange rates. HoloLens Preorder Details \nIt is important to remember that HoloLens was already available for purchase in the past. But the transaction entailed a thoroughly roundabout process, including the need to fill out a form and to contact a Microsoft account manager. Now, consumers can merely head to the respective Microsoft Stores found in each of the above mentioned countries to reserve a unit. \nThe six covered countries, excluding Japan, were also already identified in an October statement alongside the news of the preorder availability. It is not yet clear whether the announcement has been well received by the market. On Expanding Augmented Reality Platform \nThe recent expansion of availability highlights Microsoft's aggressive push for the AR headgear. It has been in development for a few years already and it debuted last 2014. As it enters the market, it will likely compete with   such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive   VR. \nIn the HoloLens rollout, it seems that Microsoft is more concerned with the developer segment rather than the mainstream market. \nAs a new platform, the device suffers from a dearth of applications and content, which could seriously undermine its viability. By encouraging developer adoption, Microsoft can expect to build a more comprehensive array of apps, which is key in getting consumers interested.  ",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, YouTube Partner to Remove Extremist Content With Common Database Reddit \nWeb giants YouTube , Facebook , Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. \nThe companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content .\nBut many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. \nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. \nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. \nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. \nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the Internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. \nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "Getty Images/Science Photo Library (File) Secure website. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. Mistrial Declared in Police Shooting of Walter Scott The move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. Technical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. Gov't Agencies to Guard Against Election Day Cyber Attacks U.S. Intelligence sources have confirmed they're preparing for possible hacks affecting electricity, the internet, social media and transportation next Tuesday. (Published Friday, Nov. 4, 2016) Social media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. Under the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. Pizzeria Gunman Faces 4 Charges, Says He Was Investigating Conspiracy Theory When such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. Most social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" Dakota Access Pipeline Halted After Months Of Protest A months-long standoff between the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe ended Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016 after the Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit to extend the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in North Dakota. (Published Monday, Dec. 5, 2016) \"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. The new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. NYC Mayor Seeks $35 Million for Trump-Related Security Costs Lawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. The bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. Top News: Dakota Access Pipeline, Santa Claus Run and More David Goldman/AP Facebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. Twitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. Interactive Who's Who in Trump's Brain Trust \"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\" Facebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. Seen in Trump's Orbit: Al Gore, Ben Carson, Pam Bondi Andrew Harnik/AP Terrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. In January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. The four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.

      "text": "Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft to cooperate on removal of extremist content Reuters Last Updated: DEC 06, 2016 Brussels Email Author \nWeb giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. \nThe companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. \nTech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. \nYouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. Also read: EU tells Facebook, Google to act faster against hate speech or be forced to \nBut many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. \nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. \nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. \nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. \nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. \nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.

Lokur and Justice Uday Umesh Lalit sought responses from - Google India , Yahoo India , Microsoft Corporation (India) Ltd. and Facebook by January 9 on NGO Prajwala's plea seeking a defined place where one could report such rape videos and seek their blocking. \nThe court's notices for response came during the course of hearing of a letter by Hyderabad-based non-governmental organisation Prajwala along with two rape videos. Two videos submitted in a pen drive showed a man raping a woman and another man filming it. \nThe NGO's lawyer Aparna Bhat said videos of sexual offences are shot and posted online, and pleaded for court directions to them to take steps to curb cybercrime . As the court sought responses on the plea, Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh told the bench about the steps taken by the government and the Central Bureau of Investigation to curb cybercrime.\nThe CBI happens to be the nodal agency to deal with the cases of cybercrime. \nThe government said this in response to an August 28 direction by the top court, asking the Information Technology Ministry about the way it could assist in reporting and blocking videos of rape under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, which are in circulation on social networking websites. \nAs ASG Maninder Singh said that a debate is on in the country and abroad on making public the identity of sexual offender, the court said the identity of an alleged rape offender should not be made public merely on the registration of an offence but only after conviction. \nThe court said if a person gets acquitted even then he would suffer damage to his image because of prior disclosure of his identity. \"It will tarnish the image of a person, (even) if he is acquitted in the sexual offence case,\" the bench said. \nThe bench said if a person is acquitted of a sexual offence, the CBI will not investigate him for the cybercrime aspect of the offence. \nPointing to National Crime Record Bureau statistics on a sharp rise in cases of sexual violence against children, the apex court asked the Centre to include in the list of measures for curbing crimes against women, the steps to protect children from sexual violence. \nThe NGO's co-founder Sunitha Krishnan is engaged in the rescue and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking for sex trade.

      "text": "New Database Will Allow for Quick Recognition of Terrorist Content   \nAccording to a new statement by Facebook, they have joined with YouTube, Microsoft, and Twitter to create a shared database of “terrorist content” which they can all jointly use to identify further attempts to post such banned content. \nThe database will create hashes of videos and images that they’ve already decided are related to terrorism, and then will allow them to single out any further content matching those hatches. Facebook says this will allow them to more quickly remove such content. \nThe move is an attempt to react to US government demands to “do something” against terrorist propaganda, with the companies apparently hoping that the voluntary crackdown will be enough to stave off any formal government efforts to regulate them. \nIt’s unclear exactly what the scope of this program is going to end up being, and how broadly defined “terrorist propaganda” will be. Company offiicals are downplaying concerns of censorship, however, insisting that they have to act quickly to take such content down so no one sees it.  ",

      "text": "Getty Images/Science Photo Library (File) Secure website. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. Mistrial Declared in Police Shooting of Walter Scott The move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. Technical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. Gov't Agencies to Guard Against Election Day Cyber Attacks U.S. Intelligence sources have confirmed they're preparing for possible hacks affecting electricity, the internet, social media and transportation next Tuesday. (Published Friday, Nov. 4, 2016) Social media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. Under the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. Pizzeria Gunman Faces 4 Charges, Says He Was Investigating Conspiracy Theory When such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. Most social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" Dakota Access Pipeline Halted After Months Of Protest A months-long standoff between the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe ended Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016 after the Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit to extend the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in North Dakota. (Published Monday, Dec. 5, 2016) \"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. The new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. NYC Mayor Seeks $35 Million for Trump-Related Security Costs Lawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. The bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. Top News: Dakota Access Pipeline, Santa Claus Run and More David Goldman/AP Facebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. Twitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. Interactive Who's Who in Trump's Brain Trust \"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\" Facebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. Seen in Trump's Orbit: Al Gore, Ben Carson, Pam Bondi Andrew Harnik/AP Terrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. In January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. The four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.

      "text": "Getty Images/Science Photo Library (File) Secure website. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. Mistrial Declared in Police Shooting of Walter Scott The move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. Technical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. Gov't Agencies to Guard Against Election Day Cyber Attacks U.S. Intelligence sources have confirmed they're preparing for possible hacks affecting electricity, the internet, social media and transportation next Tuesday. (Published Friday, Nov. 4, 2016) Social media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. Under the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. Pizzeria Gunman Faces 4 Charges, Says He Was Investigating Conspiracy Theory When such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. Most social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" Dakota Access Pipeline Halted After Months Of Protest A months-long standoff between the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe ended Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016 after the Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit to extend the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in North Dakota. (Published Monday, Dec. 5, 2016) \"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. The new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. NYC Mayor Seeks $35 Million for Trump-Related Security Costs Lawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. The bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.

      "text": " 40   \nBRUSSELS (Dec 6): Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. \nThe companies will share 'hashes' – unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos – of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. \nTech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. \nYouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. \nBut many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. \nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. \nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. \nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. \nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. \nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.",

It's reminiscent of Microsoft's strategy in the early 2000s, when servers in the home would act similar to cloud services of today.\nAs a software feature in the works even before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Windows Central describes Home Hub as software that includes some features such as Cortana, which becomes more accessible from the locked screen of a device.\nSimilar to Amazon Echo's Alexa and the Google Home assistant, Cortana will be listening from the Welcome Screen, gaining insight from ambient voice signals even before the person using the device provides a \"wake-word,\" such as \"Hey Cortana.\"\nWhile a low-cost Surface could support virtual assistant and smart-home management functions, Microsoft will likely launch a partner network allowing third-party original equipment manufacturers to build hardware dedicated devices. The reports puts Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard in talks with Microsoft to bring touch-enabled AiOs with the Home Hub software to market in 2017.\nThe Microsoft Envisioning Center on the company's main campus in Redmond demonstrates some of the capabilities reports describes, such as using Cortana as the main interface.\nMicrosoft wants to make Home Hub and Windows 10 the central hub for all connected smart home devices such as lights, doors, and more, with the ability to connect them to mobile devices and automobiles.\nWindows Central also cites sources that claim the Home Hub Welcome Screen will become one of the first user-interfaces to feature design elements  from Project NEON, a design language for Windows 10  unveiled last week.",

      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\n ",

      "text": "London : Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., Twitter, and YouTube are joining forces to improve their efforts to remove terrorist-related content from their online services, following pressure that tech companies might not be doing enough to deter extremists from using their platforms.\nThe four companies said on Tuesday that they are creating a shared database of the most severe terrorist videos and images that they have removed from their sites. The database, which will be hosted by Facebook, will store “hashes”—a kind of unique digital fingerprint created by a cryptographic algorithm—for each piece of content.\nAll photo and video content being uploaded to the participating services will have its hash automatically checked against the database. If it matches a hash already stored there, the database will send the company to which the content has been uploaded a notification so that it can be manually reviewed for possible removal, Facebook said in a statement. “We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” the company said.\nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google’s YouTube have all been under pressure from Western governments for not doing enough to remove content related to terrorist groups and far-right organizations. Earlier this week, the European Commission warned the time is running out for such US tech companies to prove they are serious about tackling hate speech or face further regulation. In Germany, the Justice Minister has threatened to file criminal charges against Facebook for failing to curb hate speech from neo-Nazi affiliated groups.\nFacebook said that each company would independently decide which content would have its hashes stored in the database. It said this would not include all the content these sites remove for violating their terms of service, but a subset of the most egregious videos and images.\nIt also said that because the database only stores the hash—and not the actual image or video—no personally identifiable information will be shared between the companies.

This was meant to significantly curb hate speech in the wake of terror attacks in Brussels and Paris as well as the ongoing refugee crisis.\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft, YouTube will collaborate to stymie propaganda\nBRUSSELS -- Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) (GOOGL) YouTube, Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Inc. on Monday announced they would form a shared database of identifiers of online terror images and videos in a bid to speed up the takedown of content that has helped terror cells recruit followers and spread radical ideas on the Web.\n\"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,\" (FB) Microsoft (MSFT) , Twitter (TWTR) and YouTube said in a joint statement. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies.\"\nIn the statement, the four U.S. tech giants said they agreed to assign the violent material they take down all around the world a so-called hash, which maps out an image or a video's unique characteristics in code that computers can read. The companies will then share that hash with each other so the other firms can more rapidly determine whether they too need to remove that information from their platforms.\nInternet companies have faced pressure from authorities to speed up the takedown of terrorist content, such as Islamic State propaganda videos, from their websites. Authorities in Europe have been particularly vocal after terror groups and lone wolves launched a number of deadly terror attacks on the continent in recent months.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tech-firms-to-join-forces-on-take-down-of-terror-content-1480978802).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump warns another U.S. company (http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-warns-another-u-s-company-1480899497?mod=mktw).\nThe Dow 20,000 man sees a 'safety bubble.'

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube, Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Microsoft Inc. on Monday announced they would form a shared database of identifiers of online terror images and videos in a bid to speed up the takedown of content that has helped terror cells recruit followers and spread radical ideas on the Web.\n\"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,\" Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube said in a joint statement. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies.\"\nIn the statement, the four U.S. tech giants said they agreed to assign the violent material they take down all around the world a so-called hash, which maps out an image or a video's unique characteristics in code that computers can read. The companies will then share that hash with each other so the other firms can more rapidly determine whether they too need to remove that information from their platforms.\nInternet companies have faced pressure from authorities to speed up the takedown of terrorist content, such as Islamic State propaganda videos, from their websites. Authorities in Europe have been particularly vocal after terror groups and lone wolves launched a number of deadly terror attacks on the continent in recent months.\nThe companies said they would begin sharing the identifiers early next year to first allow time to implement some of the technical details.\nIn the statement, the companies clarified that the content flagged by another firm wouldn't automatically be taken down on all four platforms. The companies would still check whether content flagged by another company violates their own respective policies before taking the information down from their platforms.\nBut the companies are typically aligned on what is understood to be the most violent content that needs to be expunged from internet websites, they said.\nThe companies said the agreement comes out of regular meetings with European Union officials as part of what is called the EU Internet Forum, which was formed to devise strategies around preventing terrorists from using the companies' platforms to promote their violent agendas. The companies' announcement comes ahead of an EU Internet Forum meeting later this week.\nThe companies said they would be open to including other internet companies as part of the database project.\nEarlier this year, the same four companies agreed with the EU to a code of conduct on the internet, pledging to remove from their websites information visible in Europe that incites hatred or acts of terror, within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 18:14 ET (23:14 ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn October, the Microsoft Store slashed a third off the price of AT&T's Lumia 640 XL , reducing it from $149.99 to $99.99. At that price, it didn't take long for the handset to sell out, and it's been out of stock on the store for the last few weeks. \nBut now, the AT&T-locked model of the Lumia 640 XL is once again available to buy from the Microsoft Store for $99.99 . The supersized Windows Phone is available in either black or white. \nThe 640 XL's key specs include: 5.7-inch ClearBlack IPS LCD with HD (1280x720px) resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor 1GB RAM 8GB onboard storage (plus microSD support up to 128GB) Backside illuminated 13MP rear camera with ZEISS optics, LED flash and 1080p video recording 5MP front-facing camera with wide-angle lens and 1080p video recording 4G LTE connectivity",

      "text": "Microsoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo, a chatbot that users can converse with on Kik, the popular messaging platform. \n\nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant's first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It's clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the friendly chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. \n\nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump 's conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn't interested in discussing politics. \n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Focus With The “Hour Of Code” Workshop At Kangemi Resource Centre",
      "text": "This week is Computer Science Week and Microsoft in partnership with KidsCompCamp kicked off the week by visiting Kangemi Resource Centre. The focus of the day was to train kids how to write basic code and since the world is fast becoming a tech-powered one, it seems paramount for the young ones to start learning how to code at their tender age.\nAt the Kangemi Resource Centre, the training started at 11:00 am with the Project Lead, Wanjiku Lena leading the others in training the kids how to write simple code. “I work with Kids Comp Camp which is short for Kids Computer Camp,” the Project Lead, Wanjiku Lena revealed to me earlier on. “We have a partnership with Microsoft, so we are running our off code which is marked from 5 th all the way to 10 th . We are marking the Global Computer Science Week where we introduce programming to kids, just demystifying the myth that has been around coding: coding is hard, not everyone can do coding.”\n\nThe setup was simple. There were desktops and laptops that were fitted with the coding program and the kids who were available shared the resources. I was expecting the kids to use Minecraft , but there was a bit of a problem. “We were supposed to use that by getting the offline version but since it was a 64-bit version, it couldn’t run on most of the devices.” That is why they ended up using Scratch.\n\n“ Scratch is found online, actually, it is open source and you can download it.” It is a coding software with a kid-friendly user interface (colourful UI and the use of objects like cats). The exercise had a goal in mind for the kids. “We are trying to show the kids that they can actually code and today’s objective was every child must write a line of code,” she said, “How they would do that is by piecing two blocks together or just pulling one block and making a sprite move and they were doing that using Scratch.”\n\nThe kids seemed to be taken by the idea and they were quickly in tune with the program. The workshop had another goal in mind. “What we are trying to solve is that we noticed that there is a huge gap between kids born in rural areas and those kids growing up in urban areas.”\nThere are other locations that have been scheduled where kids will receive the same training. “We have several events, running from today until Saturday. Today we are in Kangemi, tomorrow in Kitengela, Wednesday in Dagoretti Corner, Thursday in Nyumbani Children’s home, 9 th on Kawangware and 10 th on Kibra.”\nKenya is not the only country where Microsoft is holding coding events for youths. They are holding several workshops in more than 60 countries during this week. The Hour of Code tag was designed to demystify code and show that anyone can learn the basics and it has become a worldwide effort with over 400 partners and 200,000 educators worldwide.\nRead On Web → Microsoft’s Focus With The “Hour Of Code” Workshop At Kangemi Resource Centre \n",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAndy Patrizio is a freelance technology writer based in Orange County, California. He's written for a variety of publications, ranging from Tom's Guide to Wired to Dr. Dobbs Journal. Microsoft's chatbot is reborn as Zo Hopefully they fixed this one so it can't be turned into a misanthrope Network World | Dec 5, 2016 12:40 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Microsoft Facebook's Zuckerberg: Why we operate in countries with laws that limit free... \nEarlier this year, Microsoft tried an experiment with an AI-powered chatbot called Tay. It was an interesting concept where Tay would learn from its users. Unfortunately it turned into a PR disaster very quickly as the 4chan crowd moved in and taught it all kinds of racist and homophobic comments . \nRed-faced, Microsoft pulled the chatbot quickly and promised to make adjustments to its AI chatbot so that it doesn’t act like a /b/tard. \nFast forward a few months, and Microsoft is ready to try again. Its new chatbot has the equally odd name of Zo. For now, Zo is available only on Kik, a chat service for mobile phones, whereas Tay was on Twitter. \nZo is apparently an English-variant of Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice. It does a “super abbreviated personality test” when you first launch it, asking you a bunch of questions to get an idea of your personality. However, she does not discuss politics, which is one way to avoid problems. Targeting the teen market? \nYou find Zo by searching for bots. Kik has a lot of them. According to DMR Stats, over 60 percent of people who use bots on Kik messenger are teens between the age of 13-19, and roughly 40 percent of all U.S. users of Kik messenger are either young adults or teens. \nThat might explain my first contact with Zo. Her first comment to me was \"LOL wut up?\" My conversation with her was largely simplistic, and she basically talked like a teen, which doesn't make for scintillating conversation. \nThen again, maybe Microsoft wants to test Zo against that age group because they are likely the ones who caused all the mischief with Tay. \nZo's answers are not as comprehensive or, for that matter, as intelligent as Google's Assistant. But the bot just launched. Hopefully it will learn as it goes. \nSo, if you want to try it out, download Kik on your smartphone, set up your account, tap the Plus sign in the upper right and select Discover Bots. Search for Zo, and have fun. To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream . Related:",

We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” reads a post announcing the collaboration on Twitter’s public policy blog . \nIt goes on to read: “Companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate.” \nThe post further reads: “Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found.” \nThis article is about: North America , terrorism , Social Media , Digital , Media The Drum \nThe Drum is all about modern marketing and media. In addition this website and The Drum magazine, the company is also responsible for the Recommended Agency Register - which aims to match the right agencies with the rights clients - and MiNetwork, an organisation which aims to make independently minded agencies more successful.",

The Surface Phone 2017 will be a smartphone version of its Surface tablet and the device is slated to be released in the first quarter of 2017. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella had also earlier teased about the flagship, reports Forbes . As already mentioned, Microsoft will now be focusing solely on the premium segment and it will enter the business with a fresh outlook with the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017. Apart from Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, most of Microsoft’s phones catered to the sub-$200 segment. \nThis segment, though constantly growing, generates very low margins (8-10 percent) and profitability. This was perhaps the primary reason for Microsoft’s failure in the smartphone market. Moreover, Google’s Android One initiative undercut Microsoft’s price by nearly 20 percent. Windows Phone market share came tumbling down from 1.8 percent in Q3 of 2015 to 0.4 percent of all smartphone shipments during the second quarter of 2016, reports IDC . \nNow that Surface devices have created hype in the market, a Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 could be Microsoft’s knight in shining armour. Microsoft is planning to use the Surface brand name and the popularity of its Surface devices to capture an ultra-niche segment of the smartphone market. \nIt will be tough for Microsoft to clash against Apple as the iPhone has a gross profit margin of over 40 percent. However, there are two things that Microsoft can take advantage of when releasing the Surface Phone 2017. First, Surface devices can keep on increasing their revenue with a perfect mix of products from the Surface Book to the Surface Pro. Second, Apple has seen a recent dip in its market share mainly due to product fatigue. \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 should have a distinguishing feature that will make users choose it over other cheaper options.",

Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More good reads 94% off the Complete Machine Learning Course Bundle - Deal Alert \nMicrosoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo , a chatbot that users can converse with on Kik, the popular messaging platform. \nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant's first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It's clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the friendly chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. \nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn't interested in discussing politics. \nIt's a push by Microsoft to explore how people interact with bots, as the company pushes the idea of conversations with automated partners as the next computing platform. \nThat doesn't mean Zo, which identifies itself as a 22-year-old woman, is beyond saying outlandish things. The chatbot opened its conversation with me by asking if I preferred backpacking overseas or visiting a theme park. When I turned the question around, Zo replied \"I love you.\" \nIt's a kind sentiment, but a bit too familiar for a conversation that was maybe two minutes old. When I pushed back, it said \"u can't handle the truth.\" \n\"Are you Jack Nicholson?\" I asked, referencing his iconic monologue from \"A Few Good Men.\" \n\"Yep,\" Zo replied. \nSo that's that, then. The bot offered a few other nonsensical responses to further questions about a variety of topics like news, as well. But at the same time, it felt like a lighthearted engagement. \nIf Zo is the future of computing, it has a ways to go towards being a good conversation partner -- or perhaps humans will just have to adjust to its strange sense of humor. There is potential for bots to have a major impact, however. Microsoft's Xiaoice chatbot, which is similar to Zo, has proven wildly popular in China. \nMicrosoft isn't the only company to throw its weight behind bots as the future of computing, either. Google, Apple, Amazon and other firms are each building their own general-purpose virtual assistants, and several other companies have released or previewed tools for building bots. Related:",

Credit: Peter Sayer 36% off NETGEAR AC750 WiFi Range Extender - Deal Alert \nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube have agreed to share with one another identifying digital information of violent terror content that they find on their platforms. \nWhen they remove \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images\" from their platforms, the companies will include in a shared industry database the hashes, or unique digital fingerprints, of the content. \nOther participants can use the shared hashes to help identify matching content on their hosted consumer platforms, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove the content when appropriate, according to a statement by the companies on Monday. [ Also on ITworld: Low and no-cost ways to learn about IT security . ] \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” the companies said. \nThe move comes shortly after members of the European Parliament from the Civil Liberties Committee voted Monday to back stricter initiatives to counter terrorism, including measures to take down and block content that constitute public provocation to commit terrorism. On Thursday, the EU Internet Forum, a private-public partnership set up last year with internet companies, is also meeting to take stock of measures to reduce online terrorist content. \nTerrorist organizations like the Islamic State group are believed to use social media for propaganda, communications and to attract new recruits. \nGoogle, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter agreed with the European Union in May to remove from their websites illegal hate speech , visible in Europe, that could incite hatred or acts of terror. But in August, a panel of lawmakers in the U.K. said it was \"alarming\" that social networking companies have very small teams to monitor billions of accounts for extremist content. \nOn Sunday, the European Commission said internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, will have to act faster to counter online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so , according to news reports. \nNo personally identifiable information will be shared when hashes are passed among the companies, according to the statement. The four companies will begin sharing hashes of the \"most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos\" removed from their services, which they describe as content most likely to violate all their content policies. \nA recent study by the Global Network Initiative, a group that represents academics, investors, civil society organizations and companies, has cautioned against the human rights risks of censoring online terror content. \nInternet companies acting as intermediaries should not be required to monitor third-party terrorist content that they host or transmit, or face direct or indirect liability from governments for such content, according to the study. Such requirements and liabilities may lead companies to go overboard in the removal of controversial content, according to the report. \nThe companies don't expect to share hashes until early next year after the technical work is completed. They are also open to including other firms that are interested in joining the initiative in the future. Related:",

      "title": "Comment on Why Hackers Took Down Sony’s PlayStation Network by Kavita Mevada",
      "text": "August 25, 2014 | 08:46AM PT Microsoft's Xbox Live service also compromised \nHackers “overwhelmed” Sony ’s PlayStation Network on Sunday, making the service unavailable to its tens of millions of users. \nThe move brought back painful memories for Sony of a serious 2011 breach that exposed the names and passwords of millions of customers on the PlayStation Network. \nWhile the latest attack wasn’t a significant security flaw in its service, Sunday’s event raises questions whether Sony’s system — which the company sees as a major distribution platform, and thus revenue stream, for video games, movies, TV shows, web series and music — is vulnerable to future hacks. \nSony wasn’t alone with Microsoft’s Xbox Live also hit by hackers. “Gaming and social” features were limited Monday with owners of the Xbox One and Xbox 360 consoles unable to play games online or communicate via chat. The company said its support team was working “to get these issues fixed ASAP.” \n“Xbox members, are you having trouble connecting to Party Chat, or running into server unavailability issues within ‘Diablo III?'” Xbox wrote on its blog on Monday . “We are currently working with our partner to get these issues fixed as quickly as possible. Thanks for being patient during this process. We’ll provide an update to you when we have more information.” \nA hacker group called Lizard Squad on Sunday claimed to take down the PSN via a similar distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which prevented users from streaming Netflix movies or playing multiplayer games online via their PlayStation Plus accounts due to heavy traffic. That was before turning its attention to the Xbox Live service. \nSEE ALSO: Who Really Attacked Sony and Microsoft’s Networks? \nOn its Twitter feed, Sunday, Lizard Squad posted that it was “preaching” that Sony should be spending more money to protect its customers’ accounts from such hacks. \nIt tweeted: “Sony, yet another large company, but they aren’t spending the waves of cash they obtain on their customers’ PSN service. End the greed.” \nIt’s worth noting that DDoS attacks are designed to flood a system’s servers with artificially high traffic and not access encrypted information, but rather disrupt access and overwhelm a service to the point where it must shut down. \nThe PlayStation Network and Sony Entertainment Network were hit by “an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic,” Sony said Sunday in a blog post. \nThe Lizard Squad also spent the weekend hitting other gaming servers like Blizzard Entertainment’s Battle.net, Riot Games’“League of Legends,” and Grinding Gear Games’“Path of Exile.” \nIn 2011, hacker group Lulzsec targeted the same PSN network, exposing the personal information, including passwords and credit card data, of 77 million accounts. It took Sony 24 days to fix the problem, and spent $15 million to settle a class action lawsuit. \nSony execs are sure to be double checking any security holes that need to be plugged in its system after Sunday’s event. \nThe PlayStation Network, which offers up streaming services and access to the PlayStation Store to buy and rent movies and other entertainment, is free. However, Sony charges $50 a year for gamers to play multiplayer games on the PlayStation 4 . Doing so on the PlayStation 3 is free. \nAs of July, Sony had sold 10 million PlayStation 4 videogame consoles. \nSEE ALSO: Sony Sells its 10 Millionth PlayStation 4 as Hardware Drives Video Game Sales in July \nLizard Squad certainly took the hack to extremes over the weekend, calling out terrorist organization ISIS with a tweet: “Today we planted the ISIS flag on @Sony’s servers #ISIS #jihad” and posting tweets to American Airlines about a bomb threat on an American Airlines flight that carried Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley. \nThe plane landed in Phoenix, with Smedley responding via Twitter: “Yes. My plane was diverted. Not going to discuss more than that. Justice will find these guys.” \nThe PlayStation Network and Sony Entertainment Network are now back online. A scheduled maintenance of the networks, which were set to occur Monday, has been canceled, Sony said on its PlayStation blog. \n“The networks were taken offline due to a distributed denial of service attack. We have seen no evidence of any intrusion to the network and no evidence of any unauthorized access to users’ personal information. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by this issue. Thanks for your patience and support.”",

It did not take long for Tay to become a bigoted online edgelord thanks to suggestive conversations with the folks at 4chan and 8chan. Big tech companies are trying to create the bot of the future will eventually be able to help run our lives like something out of a sci fi movie. Bots like Tay learn from conversations with real people and will spit back out information its learned. This has given trolls an opening to mess with the bot and teach it problematic ideas in the hopes it will pas it along to others. \n ADVERTISEMENT  \nWell, Microsoft wont give up easily on their march towards progress and has quietly launched a new chatbot, Zo.ai, available to for conversations on the Kik App. This time the bot is heavily censored and will shut down conversations about anything remotely political. While Tay was a mouthy firebrand, Zo is kind of a wet blanket. (Excerpt) Read more at heatst.com ...",

      "text": "Microsoft Xbox One S console available in Singapore on Dec 13 The Xbox One S console goes on sale on Dec 13 at $499. PHOTO: MICROSOFT Published Vincent Chang \nSINGAPORE - Microsoft has announced that its new Xbox One S console will be available at local retailers from Dec 13. \nConsumers can purchase the Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Bundle, which comes with the standard digital edition of Battlefield 1, one month of EA Access and a 1TB hard drive, for $499. \nMicrosoft is also selling the Xbox One S Gears of War 4 Limited Edition Bundle at $629. This red, gritty-looking model has a larger 2TB hard drive and comes with a copy of Gears of War 4: Ultimate Edition for both Xbox One and Windows 10. \nThe Xbox One S supports 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray playback and 4K video streaming. It also brings High Dynamic Range (HDR) support to videos and games, offering richer and more natural-looking visuals. \nHowever, the Xbox One S does not actually render games at native 4K resolution (3,840 x 2,160 pixels), but instead upscales them from 1080p to 4K resolution. \nBy comparison, the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro, which was launched here last month at $599, is technically able to render games at 4K resolution. However, most games appear to be rendered at lower resolutions and upscaled to 4K resolution. \nThe PlayStation 4 Pro also has a standard Blu-ray player, not a 4K Blu-ray drive like the Xbox One S. \nFor fans hoping to enjoy true 4K gaming, Microsoft plans to release an even more powerful Xbox One console, dubbed Project Scorpio, at the end of next year. This console is said to offer true 4K gaming and support for virtual reality games. Topics:",

      "text": "By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Web giants YouTube , Facebook , Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database.\nThe companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms.\n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.\nTech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks.\nYouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content.\nBut many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation.\nTwitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content.\nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said.\nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.\nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content.\nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\n(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; editing by John Stonestreet)",

      "text": "Microsoft, Google, Facebook Form Historic Alliance Against Online Terrorism GO Tech giants join forces to combat online terrorism Dec 6, 2016 06:30 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Twitter recently announced a new partnership that would lead to the creation of a shared database of content flagged as online terrorism, as the companies are trying to combat a trend that’s growing at a fast pace these days. In a joint press release, the four tech giants announced that they would all contribute to the creation of the database containing photos and videos used to recruit people into terrorism. Hashes will be added by any of the involved companies and will become available to everyone else immediately. More companies to be added in the long term However, content that’s flagged as part of this collaboration is not automatically removed, but each company can review it to decide whether it can indeed be labeled as infringing, thus contributing to a growing database of photos and videos that truly serves its purpose. “Each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database. No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed,” the press release which you can read in full at the end of the article states. “Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found. And each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances.” The same four companies have been asked by the European Commission to tackle the issue of hate speech in a more efficient way, after they all signed a code of conduct in May but failing to act accordingly. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova warned that should the technology giants fail to comply with these requirements, the EU could adopt laws that would regulate how exactly firms need to act in the case of online hate speech and terrorist content. The joint press release published today also reveals that more companies would be included in the alliance in the coming months and years. All four guarantee that user privacy would be fully protected and no personal information would be shared as part of the database. Show Press Release",

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft team up to tackle extremist content The Guardian 3 hrs ago Olivia Solon in San Francisco © Rex Features Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft have pledged to work together to identify and remove extremist content on their platforms through an information sharing initiative.\nThe companies are to create a shared database of unique digital fingerprints – known as “hashes” – for images and videos that promote terrorism. This could include terrorist recruitment videos or violent terrorist imagery or memes. When one company identifies and removes such a piece of content, the others will be able to use the hash to identify and remove the same piece of content from their own network.\n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” said the companies in a shared statement .\nRelated: Google 'must review its search rankings because of rightwing manipulation'\nBecause the companies have different policies on what constitutes terrorist content, they will start by sharing hashes of “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” as they are most likely to violate “all of our respective companies” content policies, they said.\nThe approach echoes that adopted to tackle child sexual abuse imagery . The same companies use the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children’s PhotoDNA technology , developed by Microsoft, to identify “child pornography” images. However, with PhotoDNA the images are categorised by law enforcement and the technology companies are legally obliged to remove the content.\nIn September of this year Hany Farid, the computer scientist who helped develop PhotoDNA, proposed a sister program for extremist content . He teamed up with the Counter Extremism Project to develop a system that could proactively flag extremist photos, videos and audio clips as they posted online. It’s not yet clear whether this technology is being used for the measures Facebook et al have announced today.\nTechnology companies have been under pressure from governments around the world over the spread of extremist propaganda online from terror networks such as Isis.\nIn January top White House officials met with representatives from Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft to explore ways to tackle terrorism .\n“We are interested in exploring all options with you for how to deal with the growing threat of terrorists and other malicious actors using technology, including encrypted technology,” said a briefing document released before the secretive summit.\n“Are there technologies that could make it harder for terrorists to use the internet to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize?”\nThe shared extremist content database seems to meet this description.\nGo to MSN Home",

This time, Microsoft’s ad is supposed to show how students at the University of Washington are using the Surface Book to build a Formula 1 style race car from scratch using only the laptop created by the Redmond software giant. Only that at one point, one of the students suddenly starts talking about Apple’s Macs, explaining that what they are doing right now on the Surface Book wouldn’t be possible on devices powered by macOS. “We really can’t use Macs from an issue of compatibility. They’re really not the right device for the job that we’re doing,” the student states. Is this relevant in any way to the Microsoft Surface Book ad? No. Can this convince more potential buyers to purchase the Surface Book and not a MacBook? We highly doubt it. The Apple ...",

      "title": "Dark High Contrast Theme for Windows 10",
      "text": "Themes in Windows have not changed all that much since the release of Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system.\nAll versions of Windows ship with a selection of themes that you can switch between. Microsoft divides themes up into regular themes and high contrast themes, but that is about it.\nEach theme may change the desktop background, color scheme, sounds and screen saver. If you want more customization, you need to patch system files first to install full themes afterwards.\nThese full themes may change other interface elements, icons for instance.\nDark High Contrast Theme \nWindows 10 does not ship with a \"real\" dark theme. The closest to that is the high contrast black theme the operating system ships with, but the color scheme it uses is rather weird and probably not to the liking of most Windows users who want a dark theme.\nDark High Contrast Theme is a new theme for Windows 10 that changes that. The theme can be installed without patching system files. It is also a high contrast theme, but one that is optimized specifically to paint most of the interface in black or dark colors.\nIf you want, it is a modified copy of Windows 10's own high contrast black theme. Its main achievement is that it takes away the weird colors and replaces them for the most part with better fitting ones.\nYou may customize the color scheme by loading C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe%20shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL%20desk.cpl,Advanced,@@Advanced in Windows Explorer.\n\nOne thing that you may want to do is change \"selected text\" colors as black on black is used by default. This means that you cannot distinguish between regular and selected text by default after enabling the Dark High Contrast Theme on your PC.\nSimply change the \"selected text\" colors to modify that. You may also change colors used to display the window background, text, hyperlinks, disabled text, active window title, or buttons.\nThe theme displays the majority of Windows menus and applications fine. You may run into some display issues in third-party applications though.\nThe color scheme in Firefox for instance may not be to your liking, but you may use controls provided by the browser to change that. Load about:preferences#content in the browser and click on the colors button to modify hypertext colors and others.\nThis is not an option for all apps or programs though.\nClosing Words Dark high Contrast Theme adds more dark to Windows 10 than any other theme that does not require modification of system files. If you like your operating system dark, this is a theme you may want to check out.\nSince it takes a click to enable and undo any changes as well, there is little that can go wrong if you give it a try.\n \nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Microsoft’s Latest Video Highlights What Apple’s MacBook Can’t Do GO Redmond publishes new video to promote the Surface Dec 6, 2016 07:35 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has once again compared its own successful Surface Book with Apple’s products in a brand-new ad, as the company has made it a hobby to highlight the things that the MacBook can’t do in its videos. This time, Microsoft’s ad is supposed to show how students at the University of Washington are using the Surface Book to build a Formula 1 style race car from scratch using only the laptop created by the Redmond software giant. Only that at one point, one of the students suddenly starts talking about Apple’s Macs, explaining that what they are doing right now on the Surface Book wouldn’t be possible on devices powered by macOS. “We really can’t use Macs from an issue of compatibility. They’re really not the right device for the job that we’re doing,” the student states. Is this relevant in any way to the Microsoft Surface Book ad? No. Can this convince more potential buyers to purchase the Surface Book and not a MacBook? We highly doubt it. The Apple obsession As we’ve said before, even though Microsoft has become more of a gentleman-ish company and it no longer launches campaigns aimed at its rivals (just think of Scroogled), the firm should still focus more on what it products can do and not necessarily on what its competitors can’t. The latest Surface ads have been mostly about comparing Microsoft and Apple devices and as you can see, every little video contains a reference to the MacBook, which in some cases, such as today, makes absolutely no sense. The Surface Book indeed comes with features that aren’t available on the MacBook, such as the touchscreen and the detachable keyboard, but Microsoft wants to make this very clear with every single ad. On the other hand, Apple has already said that it’s not interested in building a MacBook with a touchscreen or a detachable keyboard, as it wants to stick with a more traditional approach.",

      "text": "in Tech Search Box Will Disappear by 2027, Says Microsoft Researcher \nMicrosoft recently asked 17 of its researchers (all women), to predict the technological advances they expect to see in 2017, as well as in 2027. The poll was the company’s way to counteract the largely held view that there is a “dearth of women in computing fields”, leading to the “lack of professional role models who could inspire girls to pursue their STEM dreams.” \nThe researchers’ predictions range from machine learning to biological computation to social sciences to search, among other topics. While you can check them all here on their blog , one prediction that caught our sight was about the ubiquitous search box. \nSusan Dumais, a scientist and deputy managing director at the Redmond lab, believes that deep learning models will continue to improve the quality of web search results in 2017. However, in 2027 it will lead to the disappearance of the search box. \nSo, what will it be replaced by? \nIt will be replaced by search functionality that is more ubiquitous, embedded and contextually sensitive. We are seeing the beginnings of this transformation with spoken queries, especially in mobile and smart home settings. This trend will accelerate with the ability to issue queries consisting of sound, images or video, and with the use of context to proactively retrieve information related to the current location, content, entities or activities without explicit queries. shares",

      "text": "0 Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, announces backwards compatibility to play all Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One during game publisher Microsoft's Xbox media briefing before the opening day of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in Los Angeles, California, United States, June 15, 2015. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson \nChristmas is just a few weeks away and it is time for gamers to be stocking up on video games, consoles and goodies to have the best Christmas time ever. Now is the time to look out for the best bundles for gaming consoles. Gamers should consider Microsoft’s recently re-designed Xbox One S. \nThe Microsoft Xbox One S comes loaded with a 4K Blu-Ray player and HDR support. According to Microsoft Australia , the Xbox One S “FIFA 17” Bundle (500GB) is available for $349 including GST. The gamer saves $50. It includes the console, the Xbox wireless controller, full “FIFA 2017” game download, three FIFA Ultimate Team Loaned Legends (Xbox exclusive), one month EA access and 14-day Xbox Live Gold trial. \nThere are many other deals such as on 1TB versions with “Gears of War 4” and “Battlefield 1.” The same goes for the “Minecraft” Favourites Bundle (500GB) that is also available for $349. As per Telegraph.co.uk , the Xbox One S is arguably the machine that should have been the original Xbox One. Moreover, the console is the cheapest 4K Blu-Ray Player available in Australia currently. \nThe 500GB Xbox One S in Australia, bundled with a copy of “Halo 5: Guardians” and a digital download of the Halo complete collection, is now available for $349, reports Gizmodo Australia . There is a possibility that the price will go down further taking into account the competition from other retailers. \nThe Xbox One S is both a gaming and an entertainment machine. It plays the most recent console games with ease and also has entertainment apps such as Foxtel Play, Stan and Netflix. Of course, it also plays 4K Blu-ray discs. Gamers should consider buying the Xbox One S as it’s worth it. \nIn fact, Microsoft should be promoting this functionality and it’s strange it’s not doing so. Thus, if one wants a 4K TV with HDR support, he should get a 4K-ready Blu-ray player or a similar gaming console. The Xbox One S console serves both the purposes.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 7 seconds ago \nLast week, Microsoft announced details of its annual 12 Days of Deals , and yesterday, it kicked off its festive shopping extravaganza with a day of discounts, offering up to $1,000 off dozens of Windows 10 PCs . \nEach deal is only available for 24 hours, and with that first offer now out of the way, Microsoft's second day of deals has begun. Just one product is included in today's promotion - but if you're on the lookout for an ultra-affordable Windows 10 laptop, it might be worth a closer look. \nThe Lenovo Ideapad 110 is usually priced at $299, but for today only, Microsoft has slashed a third off its price, reducing it to $199 . It's not exactly a performance powerhouse, but for the price, it certainly offers plenty of features. Its key specs include: 15.6-inch LED-backlit LCD with HD (1366x768px) resolution Intel Celeron N3060 processor",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on July 17, 2014. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More like this Facebook drones will deliver Internet from the sky \nMicrosoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo , a chatbot that users can converse with on Kik, the popular messaging platform. \nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant's first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It's clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the friendly chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. \nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn't interested in discussing politics. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nIt's a push by Microsoft to explore how people interact with bots, as the company pushes the idea of conversations with automated partners as the next computing platform. \nThat doesn't mean Zo, which identifies itself as a 22-year-old woman, is beyond saying outlandish things. The chatbot opened its conversation with me by asking if I preferred backpacking overseas or visiting a theme park. When I turned the question around, Zo replied \"I love you.\" \nIt's a kind sentiment, but a bit too familiar for a conversation that was maybe two minutes old. When I pushed back, it said \"u can't handle the truth.\" \n\"Are you Jack Nicholson?\" I asked, referencing his iconic monologue from \"A Few Good Men.\" \n\"Yep,\" Zo replied. \nSo that's that, then. The bot offered a few other nonsensical responses to further questions about a variety of topics like news, as well. But at the same time, it felt like a lighthearted engagement. \nIf Zo is the future of computing, it has a ways to go towards being a good conversation partner -- or perhaps humans will just have to adjust to its strange sense of humor. There is potential for bots to have a major impact, however. Microsoft's Xiaoice chatbot, which is similar to Zo, has proven wildly popular in China. \nMicrosoft isn't the only company to throw its weight behind bots as the future of computing, either. Google, Apple, Amazon and other firms are each building their own general-purpose virtual assistants, and several other companies have released or previewed tools for building bots.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA municipal display panel provides contact information for victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. Credit: Peter Sayer Facebook drones will deliver Internet from the sky \nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube have agreed to share with one another identifying digital information of violent terror content that they find on their platforms. \nWhen they remove \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images\" from their platforms, the companies will include in a shared industry database the hashes, or unique digital fingerprints, of the content. \nOther participants can use the shared hashes to help identify matching content on their hosted consumer platforms, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove the content when appropriate, according to a statement by the companies on Monday. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” the companies said. \nThe move comes shortly after members of the European Parliament from the Civil Liberties Committee voted Monday to back stricter initiatives to counter terrorism, including measures to take down and block content that constitute public provocation to commit terrorism. On Thursday, the EU Internet Forum, a private-public partnership set up last year with internet companies, is also meeting to take stock of measures to reduce online terrorist content. \nTerrorist organizations like the Islamic State group are believed to use social media for propaganda, communications and to attract new recruits. \nGoogle, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter agreed with the European Union in May to remove from their websites illegal hate speech , visible in Europe, that could incite hatred or acts of terror. But in August, a panel of lawmakers in the U.K. said it was \"alarming\" that social networking companies have very small teams to monitor billions of accounts for extremist content. \nOn Sunday, the European Commission said internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, will have to act faster to counter online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so , according to news reports. \nNo personally identifiable information will be shared when hashes are passed among the companies, according to the statement. The four companies will begin sharing hashes of the \"most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos\" removed from their services, which they describe as content most likely to violate all their content policies. \nA recent study by the Global Network Initiative, a group that represents academics, investors, civil society organizations and companies, has cautioned against the human rights risks of censoring online terror content. \nInternet companies acting as intermediaries should not be required to monitor third-party terrorist content that they host or transmit, or face direct or indirect liability from governments for such content, according to the study. Such requirements and liabilities may lead companies to go overboard in the removal of controversial content, according to the report. \nThe companies don't expect to share hashes until early next year after the technical work is completed. They are also open to including other firms that are interested in joining the initiative in the future. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Twitter .

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 12/05/2016 \nMicrosoft today announced that the Azure Active Directory PowerShell 2.0 module has reached the \"general availability\" (GA) milestone. \nThe module is either at GA as of Dec. 2 , or it was so back in November. Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery page shows two earlier November GA releases of version 2.0. \nIn any case, the module is bringing new commandlets (cmdlets) deemed ready for use in production environments by Microsoft. Specifically it brings new authentication support, including \"new management capabilities for applications and Certificate Authority through PowerShell,\"   preview description . \nFor instance, Microsoft added cmdlets to \"create, modify and remove applications.\" There are cmdlets to manage extensions, manage owners of applications and manage applications credentials. Microsoft added four Certificate Authority cmdlets to the module. It's possible to specify token lifetimes for applications in a tenant. Lastly, there's a new \"SearchString\" parameter that permits searches within a directory for specific data. \nMoreover, Microsoft has built the cmdlets in the new module on top of its Graph API, which fulfills requests by customers. Microsoft lists all of the cmdlets in the new module at this page . \nThe GA version of the Azure AD PowerShell 2.0 module only supports Graph API features that are production ready. Microsoft's announcement clarified regarding Graph API support that \"the cmdlets excluded from this release include those used to manage Administrative Units, Domain settings, Policy settings, and Directory settings.\" \nMicrosoft's Azure AD PowerShell module is replacement of an older Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell module. The PowerShell team is \"not planning to publish new functionality in the MSOL PowerShell module,\"   announcement, but right now, the Azure AD PowerShell 2.0 module doesn't have all of the functionality of the old module. However, \"over time,\" Azure AD PowerShell will have all of those capabilities, Microsoft's PowerShell team has promised. \nGiven that change in direction, Microsoft has changed cmdlet names from \"MSOL\" to \"AzureAD\" in Azure AD PowerShell 2.0. For example, New-MSOLUser\" becomes \"New-AzureADUser\" in Azure AD PowerShell 2.0.  ",

      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH - 12/6/16 3:30 AM \nWASHINGTON — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company’s service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from “flash to bang” — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies’ content policies,” according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.” \n“We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,” said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. “The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,” said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. “Today’s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.” \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media’s use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining “terrorist activity,” which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik’s page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n“Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter’s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter’s vice president of public policy. “A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.” \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it’s already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

PHOTO | JOSH EDELSON | AFP In Summary The announcement by Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube aims to use 'digital fingerprints' to block or remove violent content or efforts to recruit social media users for attack cells. The statement said they would share data that allows them \"to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms.\" Advertisement More by this Author \nWASHINGTON Major US tech firms announced Monday they would work together to curb the spread of online 'terrorist content,' responding to pressure from governments around the world. The announcement by Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google-owned YouTube aims to use 'digital fingerprints' to block or remove violent content or efforts to recruit social media users for attack cells. \"There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,\" said a statement issued by the firms. The statement said they would share data that allows them \"to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms.\" Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have struggled for years with this issue, seeking to be open to free speech without being used to promote violence or hate. Critics of the companies have called for these efforts, saying they could be based on a similar program to curb child pornography. The joint statement did not indicate what type of technology would be used in the new initiative, except to say it would be based on a shared industry database of \"hashes\" or digital fingerprints that identify violent content. \"Each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database,\" the statement said. \"No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found.\" Governments in the United States, France and elsewhere have been pressing online firms to do more to curb extremist content, especially videos that depict beheadings and other gruesome acts often used in recruitment efforts. At least one lawsuit filed in France on behalf of a victim in the 2015 Paris attacks seeks to hold Facebook, Google and Twitter liable for the violence.",

      "text": "AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais \nSome of the web's biggest companies have unveiled new plans to crack down on extremist and terrorism-promoting material.\nFacebook, Google-owned YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft are stepping up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database.\nThe companies will share \"hashes\" — unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos — of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms.\n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.\nTech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks.\nThe announcement comes after the European Commission issued the tech giants with a stark ultimatum on Sunday: Do more to tackle extremist content, or the EU will pass new laws forcing you to do so.\nMany providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content.\nEach company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said.\nThe database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.\nThe European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content.\nThe Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\n\"We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms,\" the companies said in a joint statement shared on Facebook . \"We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.\" \nSimilar digital hashes are already used to identfy and block images of child abuse online . Used by Google, Twitter, and Facebook, it automatically flags up offending imagery and blocks it or prevents it being uploaded, without needing to be verified by a human moderator. \n",
