      "text": "Black Friday deals kick off early this year. With special Alexa only deals, Amazon kicks off the first 'voice shopping weekend' exclusively for owners of Alexa enabled devices. More Subscribe on YouTube\nVoice shopping weekend\nAmazon Alexa users are getting an early crack at Black Friday deals with Amazon’s first ‘voice shopping weekend’. That’s right, Amazon is simplifying the burdensome task of opening a web browser and clicking on their deals site. Now you can simply ask, “Alexa, what are your deals?” And she’ll read off the deals for the day. These are special ‘Alexa only’ deals this weekend, meaning people who don’t have an Alexa enabled device can’t get em. However everyone, Alexa owner or not, can get a glimpse of the deals by clicking on Amazon’s site. Today it looks like you can get 23%off a Star Wars BB-8 droid, and a whopping 79% off Garth Brooks’ ultimate hits CD. Happy shopping everyone!\nTesla Energy\nIt’s a done deal, Tesla is buying SolarCity. An overwhelming 85% of Tesla shareholders backed the acquisition which will cost Tesla approximately $2 billion. This clears the path for Elon Musk’s plans for an integrated energy company, encompassing solar roofing, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Musk will continue as CEO of the combined company, SolarCity’s operations and staff will merge with Tesla, and the SolarCity brand will become “Tesla Energy.”\nThe merger paves the way for Tesla to produce its new solar roof, which is essentially roofing shingles made of solar cells. Musk says because of the merger, the Tesla smart roof could potentially cost less than what he calls a regular old dumb roof.\nAirbnb Trips\nFinally this week, Airbnb announced plans to expand its reach beyond just short-term rentals, with sights set on becoming a full-on travel agency. With a new initiative it calls Airbnb Trips, it will be offering complete travel experiences that include things like a surfing trip in Malibu or an eating adventure in Paris. Available in 12 cities now including Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Tokyo, and San Francisco, the trips range from a few days to only a few hours and can include all sorts of different activities. Instead of using Airbnb for one service, their hopes are users will start thinking of the company as a go-to for all their travel needs.\nAlexa-exclusive Black Friday deals from Amazon available through Monday What can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house Amazon’s Alexa blazes onto a tablet for the first time with the revamped Fire HD 8",

      "text": "Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) managed to pull ahead Friday, despite the broader markets retracting. The online retailing behemoth advanced on talk that its Amazon Prime Video is planning an international expansion, while Apple edged ahead after disclosing plans to offer a fix its iPhone 6 Plus screens. Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) , however, lost ground after its closely watched shareholder vote to merge with SolarCity ( SCTY ) .\nAmazon.com, in a heated battle with rival Netflix ( NFLX ) , is reportedly interested in expanding its Amazon Prime Video service by enlarging the international markets that it serves. The online retailing behemoth currently operates its Prime video service in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, however, it is looking at launching the service in 200 other countries and territories in the near future.\nAmazon Prime Video, which operates as a stand-alone business in the U.S., costs $8.99 per month, a tad less than Netflix's $9.99 tab.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also beefing up for the crazy Cyber Monday, looking to also capture more online shoppers. The company launched a 20% discount to its Prime service annual membership, which offers such perks as free two-day shipping. The company's one-day discount lowers the annual membership to $79 from $99, with the discount expiring at midnight tonight.\nBoth moves helped spur its shares higher, with Amazon closing up 0.50 to $760.16.",

Photo: Bob Owen, Staff / San Antonio Express-News Image 44 of 44 A look inside Amazon before Black Friday, Cyber Monday 1 / 44 Back to Gallery Two of the busiest places to work running up to the holiday shopping season are at Amazon fulfillment and sort centers.\nThese facilities around the world are responsible for organizing, processing and shipping the more than a billion packages that people buy from Amazon each year. And in the days leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, in the United States, these centers often look like someone went and kicked a giant anthill.\nAmazon leases or owns approximately 71,655 square feet of warehouse space in North America for its various centers, according its 2015 annual report.\nThere are three such centers in or near the San Antonio area. On the West Side at 1410 S. Callaghan Road is one of three of Amazon sort centers in Texas. While Schertz and San Marcos are each home to an Amazon fulfillment center.\nRELATED: Texas adds 13,700 jobs in October\nAnd not unlike out of the final scenes from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" those huge Amazon warehouses are gorged with merchandise as workers rush to fulfill duties during the company's busiest time of year.\nAccording to a news release, on Cyber Monday alone in 2015 Amazon sellers received orders for more than 23 million items.\nThe annual report notes that 33 percent of Amazon's annual revenue is recorded during its fourth quarter.\nTo prepare for this huge uptick in seasonal orders Amazon created 3,500 seasonal associate roles for the San Antonio-Austin corridor, said Ashley Robinson, communications manager for Amazon Operations. Nationally the company hired more than 120,000 seasonal associates.\n\"And we're still hiring!\" She said Friday. Robinson said Amazon centers run shifts 20-hours-a-day, Monday through Sunday, during the holiday shopping season.\nThose wanting to inquire about working for Amazon this season can visit https://amazon.force.com.\n So as you prepare to consume with the rest of America next week, take a look at the inside of one of those fulfillment centers and see where your toys, electronics, clothes and jewelry await you to click \"place your order.\"",

      "text": "The latest Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Amazon Prime ad was heart-warming stuff. Was it merely a promotional one or was it meant to take a dig at President-elect Donald Trump?\nReading between the lines, news outlets have given their spin of the tale. The ad is seen as the latest salvo fired in the exchanges between Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos and Trump.\nThe Ad The ad features a priest and an imam, a person who leads prayers in a mosque, both friends. The latter visits the former at his residence. After exchanging pleasantries and having a cordial and warm chat over tea, they take leave of each other, only to realize that both are plagued with issues related to their knees.\nAfter bidding goodbye, each, unknown to the other, orders knee braces for the other, by placing orders on Amazon Prime via a smartphone. Both receive the braces, smile to themselves and were seen kneeling/prostrating at ease without pain, while discharging their religious duties.\nAmazon Seeking To Build Bridges Against Divisive Political Backdrop? The ad stands out when weighed against the divisive theme of Trump's election campaign. In his campaign speeches, Trump had called for a total and complete shutdown of borders to Muslims, with the rhetoric only growing louder following the San Bernardino shootings.\nBezos Lauds His Ad Team In a tweet, Bezos expressed his love for the ad and commended his ad team for the ad.\nTrump-Bezos Barbs It is no secret that Trump and Bezos share a frosty relation. Trump was visibly agitated by the stance the Washington Post, owned by Bezos, took against him during his campaign. In retaliation, Trump cried foul over the newspaper wielding undue clout with Washington politicians, who overlooked tax issues and anti-trust concerns at the newspaper as well as Amazon.\nFor his part, Bezos was openly critical of Trump and even said that he is open to sending Trump to the space through his aerospace company Blue Origin. The Amazon chief termed the way Trump ran his Presidential campaign as an erosion of democracy.\nHowever, once the Trump's election was confirmed, Bezos sent out a reconciliatory tweet, congratulating him, which was seen by many as an about-face. Amazon shares are down 9 percent since November 8 and the patching up was seen by many as a way to save Amazon from further scrutiny by the new administration.\nBridging The Gap Or Taking A Jibe Against this backdrop, the ad is seen as re-opening old wounds, as the mutual dislike simmers on as an undercurrent. It doesn't look like the two are ready to bury the hatchet anytime soon in the interest of working together. However, a contrarian look at the ad also suggests that the two persons in the ad with two distinctly differing religious beliefs are reflective of Trump and Bezos. The cordiality among the two in the ad suggests that people can still be nice to each other and care for each other despite the differences. The parallels between the two throughout the ad, from their attire to their stances to their religious duties, further solidify that similarities can be found in the most unlikely of places.\nAfter declining for four straight sessions since November 8, Amazon shares were up 0.90 percent at $763.32.\nImage Credit: By DoD photo by Senior Master Sgt.

      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) is reportedly getting ready to significantly expand its streaming video service, sources told the Wall Street Journal , upping the pressure on video streaming giant Netflix ( NFLX ) .\nAmazon Prime Video, which is currently only available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, will soon be moving into about 200 other countries and territories, the sources said.\nThe Seattle e-commerce company is already in the midst of launching the video streaming program in India after having made Amazon Prime Video a standalone service in the U.S. this past April for $8.99 per month, $1 less than Netflix's standard plan. Previously it had only been available as part of an Amazon Prime membership, which offers free two-day shipping on items in the U.S. for $99 a year or $9.99 a month.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports, but Jeremy Clarkson, star of Amazon's new \"The Grand Tour\" automotive comedy show, seemed to confirm the rumors on Wednesday over Twitter ( TWTR ) .\nSo. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 Clarkson said in another tweet that \"The Grand Tour\" will be available for streaming in countries outside of Amazon's current locations \"in a couple of weeks.\" It's not clear if Clarkson meant that all of Amazon's video offerings will be available, or just \"The Grand Tour,\" however.\nAmazon is held in the Growth Seeker portfolio.

Because cost-wise for me it looks like increasing significantly the cost of each instances by adding 6 different EBS volumes for those partitions... \nThanks for your knowledge sharing.",

      "text": "If there is one lesson to be learned in 2016, it is that white men in media have a free pass to fail upward with impunity. Corey Lewandowski assaulted a reporter and got a job at CNN; Roger Ailes sexually harassed women at Fox News for decades and got a position as a senior strategist for Donald Trump’s campaign. And our president-elect himself… well. It appears that we have a truly extraordinary capacity for forgiveness.\nFor Jeremy Clarkson , who physically and verbally assaulted a BBC producer and was subsequently let go from the massively popular show “Top Gear,” forgiveness comes in the form of a lush upgrade: “ The Grand Tour ,” from Amazon Studios , which preserves nearly everything about the BBC show’s gearhead enthusiasm, international adventuring, and swaggering masculinity.\nThe first episode places them in America, which gives Clarkson and his perpetual costars Richard Hammond and James May plenty of opportunities to quarrel good-naturedly about the relative merits of the U.K. and the U.S. with their fiercely patriotic audience. (To their credit, the audience has absolutely no patience for Clarkson’s declaration that the Royal Air Force is a finer institution than the U.S. Air Force, leading to a staged but funny bit where the trio has to hide behind their table as the audience chants “U! S! A!”) Their desert studio is extravagant and beautiful, furnished like a conqueror’s bivouac with leather camp chairs, vintage luggage, and Oriental rugs. (The giant traveling tent, as they call it, will be touring the world with the hosts — Johannesburg, Scotland, Dubai.) And the cinematography is remarkable; “The Grand Tour” is filmed in 4K, or Ultra HD, making for wide shots of shiny cars drifting effortlessly over terrain or tarmac that are positively bursting with color and movement.\nBut at least at first, much of “The Grand Tour” is devoted to reveling in the fruits of bad behavior. Clarkson first appears in the pilot leaving London surrounded by controversy, demonstrated through snippets of news reports and interviews played in the background as he solemnly steps into a black cab. He flies to LAX, where he picks up a blue Mustang Rocket in the airport’s parking lot, and as he starts driving east, he’s joined by Hammond and May, in red and white Rockets of their own.\nThe music turns from somber to upbeat, a cover of “I Can See Clearly Now,” as the three cars meet up and pass with a whole convoy of bizarre and fascinating vehicles, arrayed in a formation not unlike the war party in “Mad Max: Fury Road.” They come to the stage where the band is playing, labeled with a big “BURNING VAN” banner; a formation of fighter jets sweeps overhead in the endlessly blue sky. If it started as a dark night of the soul, it ends a victory lap. Hammond introduces Clarkson with, “He’s basically a shaved ape in a shirt.” Clarkson picks it up with his first line to the camera in the whole show: “It’s very unlikely I’m going to be fired now, because we’re on the Internet. Which means I could pleasure a horse.”\nWhen it comes to the cars, “The Grand Tour” delivers gearhead porn in spades, fondling steering wheels and gearshifts with expert grace. Clarkson, Hammond, and May’s love for machinery — and what human machinery indicates, which is adventure and expansiveness — is still present, pure, and appealing, even with the shift in networks and formats.\nBut “The Grand Tour” doesn’t just sell cars, or the love of cars. It is also a celebration of the car — the pinnacle of human ingenuity, as far as this show is concerned — as a tool used to flatten, mold, and indeed, dominate the world. “The Grand Tour,” like the trio’s “Top Gear,” spans the world and crosses all available terrains. In the montage teasing the rest of this season, there are a not-insignificant number of explosions, and at least one instance where machine-gun fire strafes the sides of the drivers’ cars.\n“The Grand Tour” is about a certain interpretation of strength — one that interprets logic or sensitivity as just advanced iterations of weakness, subordinate to the power and fire of machines and might. Its ethos is also wrapped up in Clarkson’s glee at having escaped punishment, and in his mockery of the Prius and the bicycle for not being devoted to consuming fossil fuels as quickly and loudly as possible. The show is an embodiment of the self-righteousness of wrongheadedness. One is reminded of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide To the Galaxy’s” Ford Prefect, an alien who tried to pass on Earth by taking a name from what he thought was the dominant species.\nRead More Literature isn’t far from Clarkson’s mind, either. While complaining about the “boring” feel of a rather nice-looking white Porsche, he says to Hammond: “It was like being stuck in a Victorian women’s novel.”\nThere is something to marvel at in this sentence. It cannot be questioned without belying that by doing so, you care — about women, about novels, about Victoriana, all of which are just about feelings, while cars are about doings . Though this is beside the point, I doubt that Clarkson has ever read a tempestuous Gothic novel, which of course would imply a female audience anyway; novels began as a female art form. Or is he here to say that a Victorian novel written by a man would be less boring? (Students slogging through “Oliver Twist” might disagree.)\nNo, the important thing in the sentence is that Clarkson can use it to make someone feel bad — bad, or hurt, or at least provoked. It is just a method of establishing strength. What matters is the engine on the road — speed and strength traversing the world — and awing those who cannot afford it with expensive cars and exotic locales. Never mind that the more “The Grand Tour’s” drivers drive, the less exotic world there is left to drive through; never mind that on the other side of remaking the world is the responsibility of taking stewardship over it.\nRelated stories\nJeremy Clarkson Talks 'The Grand Tour,' 'Top Gear' Controversies and Working for Amazon\nAmazon's 'The Grand Tour' Leaves 'Top Gear' in the Dust, British TV Critics Say\nAmazon Gives Quiet Launch to Prime Video in Australia\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

You won’t be required to actually watch the show to get it, but you do have to be a new member and sign up before 11:59 p.m. PT . \nThe price in your cart will still show $99, but the promotional discount will be applied once you check out.

      "text": "'The Grand Tour,' Amazon's New Take on 'Top Gear,' Is Already Getting Rave Reviews Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May reunite—and this time, they're on Amazon Prime. by Michael Rodio Follow \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are back on the road—and car fanatics are rejoicing. \nThe \"Holy Trinity,\" as they sarcastically refer to themselves, have reunited for another adventure on The Grand Tour , a revamped version of Top Gear that hits all the right notes of the original (supercars, absurd stunts, crotchety British men making fun of each other) with a few key upgrades (jaw-dropping 4K Ultra High Definition video, a studio that goes on the road with them). \nThe show's official description: \"A show about adventure, excitement and friendship... as long as you accept that the people you call friends are also the ones you find extremely annoying. Sometimes it's even a show about cars.\" \nThis time, however, they've departed their longtime home at the BBC and found a new place to park themselves: Amazon Prime, the Everything Store's in-house production studio. As of its launch on November 18, The Grand Tour is only available to Prime subscribers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan—which led to some frustration from fans in the rest of the world —but it will be available worldwide in December, according to Amazon. As part of the show's release, Amazon also announced that it'll be offering discounted Prime subscriptions ($79, instead of the usual $99, for the first year) on Friday only. \nAnd if the early reviews are any indication, The Grand Tour is poised to become one of Amazon's highest-regarded hits (and smartest investments) in years. \"If The Grand Tour is basically Top Gear with a nitros boost of Amazon finances , the difference is immediately apparent—it’s a stunningly beautiful show, shot in vibrant 4K that captures every swirl of dust and gleam of chrome,\" wrote Ben Travis in London's Evening Standard . The Guardian remarked that it \" leaves the BBC in the dust .\" Hell, even the BBC mustered the emotion to publish a relatively positive review , with editor Will Gompertz writing that the \" Mad Max meets Easy Rider \" show seems almost too big for TV, even if \"it feels uncomfortably hubristic.\" (Most English review ever , guys.) \nIt's also been an emotional homecoming for fans and the hosts. Clarkson, who departed bitterly from the beloved BBC original, tweeted that he was \"relieved\" and \"grateful\" that the show had been received so well. May echoed those sentiments: Genuinely relieved and grateful today. Huge thanks to everyone who has sent messages. \n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 18, 2016 Thank you to everyone who's been kind about our new car drama. We're flattered. And relieved. \n— James May (@MrJamesMay) November 18, 2016 \nOne of their notable supporters? Comedian (and fellow Brit) Craig Ferguson: I'm not too proud to admit that I cried at the opening sequence of @thegrandtour . They're back. A morsel of joy in these troubled times. \n— Craig Ferguson (@CraigyFerg) November 18, 2016 \nHe's not the only one. In one review on the Amazon Prime page that we found particularly illustrative, a viewer wrote: \"Have you ever bought something like low-fat cheese, thinking 'yeah, this should still hit the spot,' only to be disappointed by a mouth full of sawdust and play-doh? That was basically BBC's new 'Top Gear.' Well, get ready for the full, melty, artery-clogging, took-four-cows-and-eight-years, extra sharp English cheddar of automotive television.\" (And for the record, lads, full-fat dairy is perfectly okay in moderation .) \nSo whether you're a car guy or a Monty Python superfan, a longtime Top Gear devotee or a complete newcomer, consider adding this one to your \"watching\" queue—just make sure you save it for when you're done with your gym routine, or you might never leave the couch. \nThe Grand Tour , debuting with November 18 in the U.S., airs Fridays on Amazon Prime.

      "text": "E-mail \nFor the past year, Netflix has been the only globally available streaming service, but that’s something that could change very soon as sources tell that Amazon in on the verge of a global Prime rollout. That is great news for everyone that want access to the broadest possible library across all providers in a legal way. \nAmazon Prime Video is currently only available in five countries, the US, UK, Germany, Austria, and Japan – and India is coming soon. The addition of Amazon Prime for another 200 markets is something I’m sure both customers and Amazon would like and that might happen this December. A great time to make the move as many people will opt into the Prime membership while ordering their Christmas presents online. \nThere is one catch to the deal and that is that only one show has been confirmed for the global audience yet and that is the Grand Tour which is the remake of the popular motor show Top Gear. While it is the only confirmed title, I’m sure that Amazon will launch its Prime service with more than just one show for the global audience. \nThe Grand Tour itself, which Amazon reportedly paid $250 million, became available in current Prime Video markets yesterday, and will go global from December, according to a tweet from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and a YouTube video from the stars of the show.",

      "text": "amazon alexa exclusive holiday shopping deals alexafamily feat More As one of the tech world’s original disrupters, from book sales to online shopping, e-readers, tablets, and voice-assist smart home devices, Amazon has just added a new disruptive twist.\nAmazon just gave Alexa a superpower. Now through Monday, November 21, 2016, Amazon Prime members can get special deals daily when they order via voice-shopping with Alexa, the company announced . In addition, customers who purchase an Alexa deal that costs more than $10 will receive a $5 Amazon gift card through Cyber Monday. Alexa-exclusive deals will continue through December.\nThis strategy is a “threefer” for Amazon. It wants people to shop on Amazon, become Amazon Prime members, and order by voice-shopping using the company’s voice assistant Alexa with an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Amazon Fire HD tablet, or Amazon Fire TV.\nMore: Save $20 on an Amazon Prime membership by joining on Friday\nShoppers can also win in three different ways (or four ways if you count the gift cards). On Friday, November 18, 2016, Amazon Prime membership is $20 off ($79 annual fee instead of $99). With Alexa voice-shopping, you can get special deals, updated daily. And an Amazon Tap (one of the Alexa-enabled devices) is on sale as an Alexa-only deal for $80 (regularly $130), a $50 savings.\nOther Alexa-only deals include a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV for $120, and $15 off a Philip Hue LED starter kit, which also happens to work with Alexa ($55, regularly $70). There are also a wide variety of everyday products with Alexa-only specials.\nYou can learn about each day’s exclusive Alexa deals by asking, “Alexa, what are your deals?” Alexa will present two deals, in each case asking if you want to buy it. If you’d rather see all of each days voice-shopping deals, you can visit the Amazon Alexa Deals page.\nWhile Alexa-only exclusive deals kick off this weekend through Monday, Amazon will have other deals every day during November and December, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The $5 gift cards for Alexa deals that cost $10 or more will be available only through Cyber Monday, November 28.\nAmazon Prime members who shop with Alexa must also have “1-click” shopping enabled. Prime customers can shop for any Prime-eligible items with Alexa. Just say, “Alexa, order product ‘whatever,'” and Alexa will find and describe a Prime-eligible product. All you have to do when she asks if you want to order the product is say, “yes” and your order will be entered.\nSee Alexa-Exclusive Deals Here\nAmazon’s Black Friday starts early with Alexa ‘voice shopping weekend’ Amazon is having a 1-day sale on the Echo, $40 off What can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house",

Reuters Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it has teamed up with US internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon. It will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.",

      "text": "Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nVoice shopping weekend \nAmazon Alexa users are getting an early crack at Black Friday deals with Amazon’s first ‘voice shopping weekend’. That’s right, Amazon is simplifying the burdensome task of opening a web browser and clicking on their deals site. Now you can simply ask, “Alexa, what are your deals?” And she’ll read off the deals for the day. These are special ‘Alexa only’ deals this weekend, meaning people who don’t have an Alexa enabled device can’t get em. However everyone, Alexa owner or not, can get a glimpse of the deals by clicking on Amazon’s site. Today it looks like you can get 23%off a Star Wars BB-8 droid, and a whopping 79% off Garth Brooks’ ultimate hits CD. Happy shopping everyone! \nTesla Energy \nIt’s a done deal, Tesla is buying SolarCity. An overwhelming 85% of Tesla shareholders backed the acquisition which will cost Tesla approximately $2 billion. This clears the path for Elon Musk’s plans for an integrated energy company, encompassing solar roofing, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Musk will continue as CEO of the combined company, SolarCity’s operations and staff will merge with Tesla, and the SolarCity brand will become “Tesla Energy.” The merger paves the way for Tesla to produce its new solar roof, which is essentially roofing shingles made of solar cells. Musk says because of the merger, the Tesla smart roof could potentially cost less than what he calls a regular old dumb roof. \nAirbnb Trips \nFinally this week, Airbnb announced plans to expand its reach beyond just short-term rentals, with sights set on becoming a full-on travel agency. With a new initiative it calls Airbnb Trips, it will be offering complete travel experiences that include things like a surfing trip in Malibu or an eating adventure in Paris. Available in 12 cities now including Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Tokyo, and San Francisco, the trips range from a few days to only a few hours and can include all sorts of different activities. Instead of using Airbnb for one service, their hopes are users will start thinking of the company as a go-to for all their travel needs. ",

      "text": "amazon alexa att wireless control integration More Amazon’s Alexa assistant can do a lot. It can play music, answer questions, call a cab, and help manage your calendar. Starting Friday, it can also send out text messages for AT&T mobile customers .\nAlexa uses skills to help users do a number of things. Companies can access the Alexa Skills Kit to create their very own skill to allow consumers to interact with paired devices using only the power of speech.\nMore: Can we talk? Mobile users enjoy voice assistance but want more accuracy\nAT&T is the first to create a skill to utilize Alexa for texting. Customers can use the Alexa app to save up to 10 contacts at a time and then use their voice to dictate and send SMS messages to those people. Users must input their contacts before using the skill as Alexa connects with their app, not the user’s contact list. In addition, Alexa-enabled devices like the Amazon Echo ($149) and the Dot Echo ($49) will be available from AT&T both online and in retail stores.\nWhile it is not clear exactly how the texting will work and whether Alexa will repeat your message back to you before sending it, AT&T has already including a stipulation in its fine print that any miscommunications are the fault of Alexa and Amazon. So if your text message comes out garbled, you cannot blame AT&T. For this reason, it is perhaps best to save Alexa messaging for short and simple texts and use your thumbs to type out the important ones.\nThis skill can be used on any Alexa-enabled device such as the Echo or the Echo Dot. The skill is only available for AT&T users, but it is a preview of what Alexa could be capable in the future as a virtual assistant. Hopefully, other mobile carriers will step up and create their own skills soon.\nConvenience and versatility at your command with Echo and Logitech Harmony Hub Amazon’s Alexa is on board to help you fact-check all the major politicians Amazon’s $50 Echo Dot promises same functionality at a fraction of the size",

      "text": "Amazon Prime free trial, watch The Grand Tour 19th November 2016 by Tim Leave A Comment \nFor two weeks Amazon are running their Black Friday sales. It’s a relatively new ‘tradition’ here in the UK and Europe but it’s been a major thing in the US for ages, as it gives those stocking up on Christmas gifts the chance to nab them for a bargain. \n\nUntil yesterday Amazon were doing a reduced offer to join Prime but unfortunately I missed that due to being airborne for the last few days. I did, however, notice their rather interesting 30 day free trial of Amazon Prime. \nAs with most free trials these days, it is set up to automatically bill you at the end of the trial, so if you are dead set on NOT using it afterward you should cancel your subscription immediately after joining. You will still benefit from the 30 days of trial with no risk of being charged afterwards. In which case you should order as many items as you can and use the free 1-day delivery until your heart’s content. \nA compelling reason to sign up for most British TV enthusiasts may be eager to see is the return of the inimitable Jeremy Clarkson, whose contract with Top Gear lapsed due to a ‘fracas’ with one of its producers. As Richard Hammond and James May also left, they went to Amazon to start their new series The Grand Tour . Since there is a new episode out every Friday, if you time your subscription carefully you can get 5 new episodes plus all the pre-released ones. Share this:",

      "text": "Fiat Chrysler teams with internet giant Amazon to sell cars online  43   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (FCHA.MI) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon (AMZN.O) to start selling cars online offering an additional discount, according to Reuters. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. Related links:",

The Yanomami are also under pressure from cattle ranchers on the fringes of their rainforest territory.\nPolice said they would accompany Funai to the area, probably next week, and that the killings occurred at the start of the month but had only been confirmed now.\n\"We don't know the motive for the conflict because the tribespeople from the village where the deaths occurred told us by radio that they will not explain what happened until we personally go there,\" Junior Hekuari, chairman of the Yanomami association, told G1 news site.",

      "text": "Amazon is the US’s largest online retailer, and there aren’t many things on this big blue sphere that you can’t buy through an Amazon checkout. Automobiles, for a long while, were one of the site’s few blind spots, but not anymore.\nReuters reports that the online shopping behemoth has struck a landmark deal with Fiat Chrysler to sell three different models via the web, and for a pretty significant discount over what a dealership charges. The cars, which will initially only be available to Amazon shoppers in Italy, are the 500, 500L, and Panda — the best selling car in Italy as a whole.\nMUST SEE: ‘The Grand Tour’ recap: So, uh, ‘Top Gear’ is back\nBuying a car from Amazon might sound like a ridiculously risky maneuver, so Chrysler is going to sweeten the pot in a big way; the company plans to enhance some of its existing promotional pricing but up to one-third for those shopping on Amazon.\nThe cost savings is a boon for the would-be car buyer, but it makes sense for the manufacturer as well. After all, if a car shopper is buying the vehicle online, there’s no haggling and less upfront cost for the company. A customer buying online doesn’t waste an hour or more of a sales rep’s time, there’s no commission to be paid, and no wear and tear as a test driver kicks the wheels and floors the gas pedal.\nStill, dealerships haven’t been entirely removed from the equation: Amazon buyers will be contacted shortly after their purchase and directed to an authorized dealer to sign off on the paperwork and actually pick up the vehicle. There is expected to be a delay of less than two weeks between ordering and pick-up.\nTrending right now:\n10 hidden iPhone tricks Apple never told you about All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon Release date for Pokemon Go Generation 2 might have just leaked See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "  \n(Twitter/Goliath) \"Goliath\" has become Amazon's \"top binged\" initial season within 10 days, and viewers are confident that a season renewal will be announced soon. \nAmazon announced that \"Goliath\" is the \"top binged first season\" during its 10-day run, which is believed to increase the chance of the series to be renewed for at least another season. \nHow shares fare in the ratings game has become one of the basis for either a renewal or a cancellation. However, streaming networks, such as Amazon, do not show such and it is unknown what they base the show's popularity on. \nThe first season of \"Goliath\" was praised by viewers and critics alike and an announcement for a second season is highly anticipated. According to reports , Amazon said, \"Goliath\" has become \"the top binged first season of a US-produced Amazon original series ever over its first ten days.\" Although the network has not shared what the basis of the ranking is, it confirmed that it means no other American-made Amazon series had a higher completion rate in ten days. \nIt would be safe to say that the network is pleased with the show's performance and a season renewal announcement may be made soon. \"Goliath\" follows the story of lawyer Billy McBride, who is seeking for redemption by taking on a difficult case. Billy is portrayed by actor Bob Thornton,who has been praised for his portrayal as well. Advertisement \nIn an interview with Amazon , Thornton revealed he has wanted to portray that kind of character for a long time. He described Billy as a nonconventional guy whose journey parallels with his own life. He said, \"I've always been kind of not really a part of Hollywood. I'm also getting older in a world that's very different than it was when I came into this business. So I'm trying to figure out my position in it and the future, and I'm not the type to give up either.\" \nThe first season ended with a conclusion and, should a \"Goliath\" season 2 be ordered, viewers expect a new situation and more new characters.

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with \"branch banker interactions\" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

Now things could get a lot tougher for Amazon.\nAmazon will almost certainly enjoy its biggest ever day on Black Friday next week.\nQuote: s in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN\n▲ 760.16 +3.76 +0.50% Graham Holdings Co GHC\n▲ 479.20 +1.75 +0.37% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT\n▼ 68.54 -0.65 -0.94% The discount shopping event will help the American online retailer to continue its run of 22 years of unbroken and dramatic sales growth since it was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. It is now valued at more than $375 billion, making it one of the biggest companies in the world.\nHowever, despite the predicted spending spree on Black Friday, the rise of Amazon and Bezos now face arguably their biggest challenge yet: Donald Trump.\nThroughout the U.S. presidential election campaign, Trump made disparaging comments about Amazon and Bezos , prompting a war of words that looks altogether more serious in the wake of the billionaire tycoon’s victory over Hillary Clinton.\nThe battle started last December with a series of seemingly unprompted tweets from Trump. “The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no-profit company, Amazon,” Trump wrote. “If Amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The Washington Post scam is saving it!”\nThe Washington Post is owned through Bezos’s personal investment firm, rather than Amazon, and Trump did not provide any explanation for his allegation. Amazon’s tax policy is controversial and is already well-known around the world , including in Europe, where it agreed favourable tax arrangements with Luxembourg. Its profit margins are also notoriously thin. In 2015, Amazon recorded sales of $107 billion but net profits of just $596 million, a margin of barely 0.5%.\nBezos responded to Trump’s tweets in a light-hearted manner, threatening to send him to space with his Blue Origin rocket business. “Finally trashed by Donald Trump,” he said. “Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket #sendDonaldtospace.”\nHowever, the battle took a more sinister turn for Amazon when Trump addressed a campaign rally in Texas two months later. “Believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems, they are going to have such problems,” Trump said of Amazon and Bezos.\nThe Republican presidential candidate then told Fox News that Amazon is “getting away with murder tax-wise” and has a “huge antitrust problem because he’s [Bezos] controlling so much”.\nTrump’s criticism of Bezos and Amazon appears to be at least partly connected to his frustration at the Washington Post conducting investigations into his business dealings and questioning his suitability to be president. At the Texas event where he criticised Amazon, Trump also referred to “purposely negative and horrible and false articles” about him.\nBezos eventually hit back , accusing Trump of comments that “aren’t appropriate” for a president and which “erodes our democracy around the edges”.\nHowever, the Amazon boss was forced to change his tone when the result of the presidential election was confirmed. “Congratulations to Donald Trump,” he wrote on Twitter. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.”\nRelated : Martin Baron: 'We took Donald Trump seriously from the beginning'\nShares in Amazon dropped by almost 10% in the five days after Trump’s election, more than other technology companies such as Google and Apple.\nIt is unclear what action Trump could take against Amazon, with the president-elect not expanding upon his threats with specific policies.\nDespite its size, Amazon still accounts for a relatively small proportion of the retail market, meaning Trump’s claims about a huge antitrust problem are dubious. Its global sales in 2015 of $107bn were dwarfed by Walmart’s $482bn. In the UK it accounts for roughly 1.8% of sales, although it is the market leader in physical entertainment, where it accounts for 20.4% of sales.\nHowever, the new president could choose to examine Amazon’s control of its delivery drivers, its relationship with small businesses who sell products through its website, or Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post.\nNeil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino, said: “The main threats have been over tax and antitrust. The antitrust point is something he could try and pursue, but it would not be in his power to pronounce Amazon guilty and it is very doubtful that any other government agency would do so.\n“On the retail side there is no antitrust case to answer as Amazon does not exert dominant control over any one area of the market. On the point about Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post, this isn’t an antitrust case as it is an entirely different business sector to the retail operation.\n“The tax threats are largely hollow. Amazon does pay corporate tax, but its tax payments are limited because it is not the most profitable of companies. The same holds true for the Washington Post. Sales tax is not a matter for the federal government so Trump has no power over that area of taxation.”\n© Provided by Guardian News Trump gives a campaign speech However, Trump undoubtedly has the power to hurt Amazon. The company’s latest annual report, published before Trump’s victory, warns of the threat to its financial performance from “laws and policies of the US and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes”. If Trump pursues a protectionist trade policy with tariffs on imports and exports then Amazon’s business model – which relies on moving goods quickly from warehouses in one country to customers in another and selling them at a low price – will be under pressure.\nUltimately, becoming an enemy of the most powerful man in the world is unhelpful for the company. Reports claim that Amazon has hired a veteran Washington lobbyist, Seth Bloom, to represent it on antitrust matters.\n“Having an occupant of the White House who is unfriendly towards your business is not a comfortable position,” Saunders added. “Inevitably it means Amazon will need to keep looking over its shoulder, which is an annoying distraction from the day-to-day business.”\nTrump vs. Bezos\nThe war of words between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, has been fought across social media and at campaign events in the runup to the presidential election. Here are the key tweets and comments:\nJeff Bezos\nEmail to employee who had raised concerns about Trump’s election: “We’re a company of builders whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view are critical to helping us invent on behalf of all our customer. But it’s not only that diversity and inclusion are good for our business. It’s more fundamental than that — it’s simply right. These are enduring values for us and nothing will change that.”\nSpeaking at conference in October about criticism from Trump: “He’s not just going after the media , but threatening retribution to people who scrutinize him. He’s also saying he may not give a graceful concession speech if he loses the election. That erodes our democracy around the edges. He’s also saying he might lock up his opponent . These aren’t appropriate behaviors.”\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \">\nFinally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 \">\nDonald Trump\nInterview to Fox News in May : “Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He’s using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed. He thinks I’ll go after him for antitrust. Because he’s got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing. The whole system is rigged, whether it’s Hillary [Clinton] or whether its Bezos.”\nThe @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon .\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \">\nCampaign event in Texas in February: “I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he uses the Washington Post to have political influence and I got to tell you, we have a different country than we used to have. He owns Amazon, he wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That’s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems, they are going to have such problems\nIf @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \">\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "We all knew that The Grand Tour , Amazon’s car show hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, was going to have some similarities with old Top Gear . But last night’s premiere really did confirm that it’s really just Top Gear with a more international location, the same jokes, and a whole lot more money.\nDON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon\nOn the surface, enough things are different to Top Gear to satisfy the BBC’s lawyers. The show doesn’t have one fixed studio location; rather, it has a big tent, which it moves around from location to location every week. The first place it visits is a California desert, though, which is about as different to Top Gear ‘s studio on a rainy airfield in England as you can imagine.\nThe first episode opened more or less as you’d imagine: a short intro film in which Clarkson is shown running, tail between legs, from his old job at the BBC. It segues neatly into all the presenters getting on stage in front of adoring fans, and then it’s mostly business as usual. Three men sitting in chairs cracking jokes, occasionally interspersed with car films.\nFor the first episode, The Grand Tour seems to go out of its way to emphasize that it’s going to be the best motoring show on the planet, not just a sitcom with a bunch of middle-age men. The team lined up a three-way battle between the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and the Ferrari LaFerrari. It’s a real battle for the ages, and the presenters dedicated pretty much the entire episode to thrashing all three cars around a track.\nIt’s a far cry from what Top Gear was doing shortly before Clarkson had left. There was a lack of gratuitous stunts in these films, and it stays much closer to the motoring-show roots. The end result is a show that’s not quite serious, still like crack to car enthusiasts, and good enough to convince me to sign up for a Prime membership. Well played, Amazon.\nTrending right now:\nAll the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon This is how Apple gets Netflix on its new TV app New MacBook Pro ad places Apple’s laptop among some of history’s greatest inventions See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

Amazon Music is a great Mac OS X application designed to streamline the entire process and provide a much more user friendly experience: you can manage and play both your local and your Amazon Cloud music library via a stylish and organized user interface. Easy to install and maneuver audio player for the Amazon music collection To start using the Amazon Music application, all you have to do is launch the installer included in the archive and provide your Amazon account credentials when prompted. Keep in mind that, to have access to the Amazon Cloud music service, your credit card information is required. The best part is that Amazon Music does not deal only with the music stored in the Amazon Cloud: the app will automatically detect and import all the tracks that are stored on your Mac. This way, you can easily access your entire music collection by using the same utility. Packs basic but very effective playback and management tools that will help you enjoy your music Amazon Music allows you to quickly sort the tracks included in your library by taking into account the artist, album, song name, or genre. At the same time, you can also visualize and create new playlists.

Of course, Amazon Music also comes with a built-in audio player that has basic functions: play / pause, skip to the next / previous track, adjust the volume level, repeat, and shuffle. User friendly desktop solution for accessing your music collection and purchasing new track via the Amazon store Amazon Music not only allows you to download previously purchased music and integrate it within your local library, but also enables you to purchase new songs by making use of the same stylish and intuitive environment.

Now things could get a lot tougher for Amazon.\nAmazon will almost certainly enjoy its biggest ever day on Black Friday next week.\nThe discount shopping event will help the American online retailer to continue its run of 22 years of unbroken and dramatic sales growth since it was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. It is now valued at more than $375 billion, making it one of the biggest companies in the world.\nHowever, despite the predicted spending spree on Black Friday, the rise of Amazon and Bezos now face arguably their biggest challenge yet: Donald Trump.\nThroughout the U.S. presidential election campaign, Trump made disparaging comments about Amazon and Bezos , prompting a war of words that looks altogether more serious in the wake of the billionaire tycoon’s victory over Hillary Clinton.\nThe battle started last December with a series of seemingly unprompted tweets from Trump. “The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no-profit company, Amazon,” Trump wrote. “If Amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The Washington Post scam is saving it!”\nThe Washington Post is owned through Bezos’s personal investment firm, rather than Amazon, and Trump did not provide any explanation for his allegation. Amazon’s tax policy is controversial and is already well-known around the world , including in Europe, where it agreed favourable tax arrangements with Luxembourg. Its profit margins are also notoriously thin. In 2015, Amazon recorded sales of $107 billion but net profits of just $596 million, a margin of barely 0.5%.\nBezos responded to Trump’s tweets in a light-hearted manner, threatening to send him to space with his Blue Origin rocket business. “Finally trashed by Donald Trump,” he said. “Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket #sendDonaldtospace.”\nHowever, the battle took a more sinister turn for Amazon when Trump addressed a campaign rally in Texas two months later. “Believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems, they are going to have such problems,” Trump said of Amazon and Bezos.\nThe Republican presidential candidate then told Fox News that Amazon is “getting away with murder tax-wise” and has a “huge antitrust problem because he’s [Bezos] controlling so much”.\nTrump’s criticism of Bezos and Amazon appears to be at least partly connected to his frustration at the Washington Post conducting investigations into his business dealings and questioning his suitability to be president. At the Texas event where he criticised Amazon, Trump also referred to “purposely negative and horrible and false articles” about him.\nBezos eventually hit back , accusing Trump of comments that “aren’t appropriate” for a president and which “erodes our democracy around the edges”.\nHowever, the Amazon boss was forced to change his tone when the result of the presidential election was confirmed. “Congratulations to Donald Trump,” he wrote on Twitter. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.”\nRelated : Martin Baron: 'We took Donald Trump seriously from the beginning'\nShares in Amazon dropped by almost 10% in the five days after Trump’s election, more than other technology companies such as Google and Apple.\nIt is unclear what action Trump could take against Amazon, with the president-elect not expanding upon his threats with specific policies.\nDespite its size, Amazon still accounts for a relatively small proportion of the retail market, meaning Trump’s claims about a huge antitrust problem are dubious. Its global sales in 2015 of $107bn were dwarfed by Walmart’s $482bn. In the UK it accounts for roughly 1.8% of sales, although it is the market leader in physical entertainment, where it accounts for 20.4% of sales.\nHowever, the new president could choose to examine Amazon’s control of its delivery drivers, its relationship with small businesses who sell products through its website, or Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post.\nNeil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino, said: “The main threats have been over tax and antitrust. The antitrust point is something he could try and pursue, but it would not be in his power to pronounce Amazon guilty and it is very doubtful that any other government agency would do so.\n“On the retail side there is no antitrust case to answer as Amazon does not exert dominant control over any one area of the market. On the point about Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post, this isn’t an antitrust case as it is an entirely different business sector to the retail operation.\n“The tax threats are largely hollow. Amazon does pay corporate tax, but its tax payments are limited because it is not the most profitable of companies. The same holds true for the Washington Post. Sales tax is not a matter for the federal government so Trump has no power over that area of taxation.”\n© Provided by Guardian News Trump gives a campaign speech However, Trump undoubtedly has the power to hurt Amazon. The company’s latest annual report, published before Trump’s victory, warns of the threat to its financial performance from “laws and policies of the US and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes”. If Trump pursues a protectionist trade policy with tariffs on imports and exports then Amazon’s business model – which relies on moving goods quickly from warehouses in one country to customers in another and selling them at a low price – will be under pressure.\nUltimately, becoming an enemy of the most powerful man in the world is unhelpful for the company. Reports claim that Amazon has hired a veteran Washington lobbyist, Seth Bloom, to represent it on antitrust matters.\n“Having an occupant of the White House who is unfriendly towards your business is not a comfortable position,” Saunders added. “Inevitably it means Amazon will need to keep looking over its shoulder, which is an annoying distraction from the day-to-day business.”\nTrump vs. Bezos\nThe war of words between Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos, the boss of Amazon, has been fought across social media and at campaign events in the runup to the presidential election. Here are the key tweets and comments:\nJeff Bezos\nEmail to employee who had raised concerns about Trump’s election: “We’re a company of builders whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view are critical to helping us invent on behalf of all our customer. But it’s not only that diversity and inclusion are good for our business. It’s more fundamental than that — it’s simply right. These are enduring values for us and nothing will change that.”\nSpeaking at conference in October about criticism from Trump: “He’s not just going after the media , but threatening retribution to people who scrutinize him. He’s also saying he may not give a graceful concession speech if he loses the election. That erodes our democracy around the edges. He’s also saying he might lock up his opponent . These aren’t appropriate behaviors.”\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \">\nFinally trashed by @realDonaldTrump . Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) December 7, 2015 \">\nDonald Trump\nInterview to Fox News in May : “Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He’s using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed. He thinks I’ll go after him for antitrust. Because he’s got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing. The whole system is rigged, whether it’s Hillary [Clinton] or whether its Bezos.”\nThe @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon .\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \">\nCampaign event in Texas in February: “I have respect for Jeff Bezos, but he uses the Washington Post to have political influence and I got to tell you, we have a different country than we used to have. He owns Amazon, he wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That’s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems, they are going to have such problems\nIf @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \">\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Share Collection of four comedies following the Griswold family's vacations. In 'National Lampoon's Vacation' (1983), the West Coast Wally World theme park is the Griswold's holiday destination, and they intend to drive there cross-country all the way from their Chicago home. Father Clark (Chevy Chase) has planned the trip down to its last detail, but the trouble begins as soon as they hit the road. In 'National Lampoon's European Vacation' (1985), the family win a holiday to Europe. Contrary to their expectations, however, it is not a luxurious, all-expenses-paid kind of trip, but rather a cut-price, economy deal which takes them to some of the Old World's seedier locations. Of course, it's not long before they are caught up in all manner of misadventures. In 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' (1989), the Griswolds decide to spend the Christmas season at home. Needless to say, it is not as quiet as they had planned. Finally, in 'Vegas Vacation' (1997), the clan head for the gleaming lights of Las Vegas. Unfortunately, Clark is soon transformed into a compulsive gambler, daughter Audrey (Marisol Nichols) becomes an exotic dancer and son Rusty (Ethan Embry) begins posing as a suave high roller.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Filed Under: Amazon , Gifts , Roundups by Lil' Luna 0 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy here . I love to shop, but shopping for Christmas gifts or birthday presents can be difficult for me. My main problem is I know what I like but I don’t always know what THEY like. I’m sure you can relate. Sometimes you know a person so well that it’s not a problem at all, but that’s not always the case. I’ve had a lot of male friends and family members say it’s SO difficult to shop for their wives, and I usually tell them – give them money… or a gift card. They’d love that! Some take the advice, but others still insist on getting something . If you are one of the latter, then this post is for you. With the holidays right around the corner, many are thinking of what to get the special lady in their life. There are myriads of options, but today I’ve rounded up some of the Best Gifts for HER . The Amazon products in the list below are all items I have either bought myself or bought another female, and they’ve always loved it. I tried to keep things reasonably priced too, and although the options became fewer, there are still so many great gift ideas that any woman would love! BEST GIFTS FOR HER:",

      "text": "\nThis week on the GeekWire podcast: Amazon is ‘radically simplifying’ how it assesses the performance of its employees each year — overhauling a controversial tradition that has emerged as an emblem of the technology giant’s exacting standards and hard-charging workplace. GeekWire reporter Taylor Soper broke the story, and he joins me to talk about the implications in our weekly news roundup.\n\nPlus, new details about how BMW will compete with Uber and Lyft , a new partnership between old and new Seattle retail companies , and the answer to last week’s GeekWire Trivia Challenge, which offered a chance to win a pair of tickets to the upcoming GeekWire Gala , Dec. 7 at MOHAI in Seattle.\nListen above or download the MP3 here .

      "title": "Ross Stores' 'treasure hunt experience' is its best weapon against Amazon",
      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nThe off-price retailer is resonating with a key demographic: millennials\nComing off a third-quarter in which Ross Stores Inc. reported a same-store sales increase of 7%, Wedbush analysts say the off-price retailer's in-store experience is driving traffic through the doors and keeping Amazon.com Inc. at bay.\n\"More than half of Ross Stores' comp was driven by traffic, suggesting at least a +4% traffic increase year-over-year,\" Wedbush wrote in a Friday note. \"Given the struggles most retailers are having navigating traffic challenges, we believe this speaks to how relevant the treasure hunt experience is to the customer. We see no reason to expect any near-term impact from Amazon or other e-commerce players.\"\nWedbush rates Ross (ROST) stock outperform and raised the price target to $71 from $67.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/bG130k2AmEt)\nRoss reported sales of $3.09 billion for the quarter, up from $2.78 billion last year and ahead of the $2.96 billion FactSet consensus. Earnings per share were 62 cents, up from 53 cents and ahead of the 56-cent FactSet consensus.\nRoss shares are up 4.4% in Friday trading.\nSee also:Ross Stores raises outlook as profit tops target (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ross-stores-raises-outlook-as-profit-tops-targets-2016-11-17)\nSee also: Wal-Mart could give Amazon a run for its money this holiday season (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-could-give-amazon-a-run-for-its-money-this-holiday-season-2016-11-17)\nCowen & Company analysts walked away from a meeting at the company headquarters this summer believing Ross is Amazon-resistant (AMZN) due to the moderate prices of Ross' goods, the off-price retailer's lower-income demographic and the aforementioned \"treasure hunt experience\" as well. Moreover, Ross has millennial appeal.\nAfter the earnings, Cowen said Ross is its \"top pick\" in the sector.\n\"We are encouraged to see the third quarter comp beat driven by traffic and basket increases, with strength broadly seen across geographies,\" Cowen analysts wrote in a note published Thursday.\nCowen rates Ross shares outperform and raised its stock price target to $74 from $67.\nAnalysts at Stifel aren't quite as bullish about Ross, favoring competitor TJX Cos. (TJX) for three reasons: TJX dominates the off-price market, it has greater growth prospects and a higher dividend yield.\nSee also:Online retailers tighten vice grip on department stores (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-retailers-tighten-vice-grip-on-department-stores-2016-11-15)\n(http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-retailers-tighten-vice-grip-on-department-stores-2016-11-15)\n(https://w.graphiq.com/w/3r0GUz81vzn)\n\"We reiterate our hold rating [on Ross shares] as we believe that the anticipated success of the entry into new markets and the continued improvement of Ross Stores and dd's despite [the anniversary of] peak margins is nearly fully reflected in the share price,\" Stifel wrote in a Thursday note.\nDd's Discounts is a moderately-priced chain of 172 stores located across 15 states.\nStifel raised Ross' price target to $68 from $60.\nSee also:TJX beats but holiday outlook falls short (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tjx-beats-but-holiday-outlook-falls-short-2016-11-15)\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets believe Ross has momentum, \"driven by a continuing increase in traffic, with share gains from mid-tier department stores, improving merchandising at key categories including home with better buying and opportunistic use of packaway, and a new store maturation curve which should alone add low-single-digit percent to comps,\" analysts said in a Thursday note.\nPackaway seasonal merchandise is stored by off-price retailers to sell at a later time.\nRBC rates Ross shares sector perform and raised their price target to $68 from $65.\nRoss shares are up 27.1% for the year so far. the S&P 500 index is up 6.7% for the same period.\n-Tonya Garcia; 19-16 0654ET\n ",

He just chose to give a sarcastic response instead of just answering or ignoring your question. The short answer to your question is yes to both. Amazon is already running some so called Black Friday (more like Black November) sales (which aren't really sales at all), will run more so called sales as Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach, then, on both days, run a lot of pseudo sales with some real bargains sprinkled between. Most of the so called sales are for products that have had the prices quietly increased recently, then will be advertised as being reduced from those inflated prices.

Amazon isn't the only retailer doing that, btw; they pretty much all are. It's not sarcasm, and I did help him. I even went further and helped show him how easy it is to find such info in the future. Above and beyond if you ask me. Quote: Originally Posted by Welliam ok thanks I also reported him for his childish replay !! Wow I gave you a direct link to the actual source that gave you every answer you asked for, and I'm childish because I used a LMGTFY. All I implied was that it was easy to find. I did answer your questions and gave you a link to it, and also showed you how you could find the answer yourself in the future. But whatever. Report people for helping you in your thread asking for help. I'll be adding you to my iggy list so I won't make the mistake of helping you again in the future.

      "title": "Amazon’s Alexa Learns How To Send Text Messages From Echo To AT&T Customers",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Saturday, November 19, 2016 Amazon’s Alexa Learns How To Send Text Messages From Echo To AT&T Customers Before too long it might be easier and quicker to list the things Amazon's digital assistant can't do rather than all the things it can . Case in point, Alexa just learned yet another trick, one of many of as of late. This newest trick, or \"skill\" as Amazon likes to call them, is the ability to transmit text messages. The caveat is that you have to be an AT&T subscriber to use the feature. AT&T is in full braggadocios mode at being the first and so far only wireless carrier to offer this skill. Using it, AT&T subscribers can summon Alexa to dutifully transcribe their voice message into a text message and fire it off from their mobile number to someone on their contacts list.\"Amazon Echo is ahead of the curve in terms of voice recognition technology and functionality,\" said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president, Device and Network Services Marketing. \"AT&T is the first carrier to bring this unique skill to a product already known for innovation. We’re always working to bring simple solutions for our customers to stay in touch. In the tradition of NumberSync, another solution that was introduced at AT&T first, the Send Message Skill gives our customers another easy and convenient way to communicate.\"The pitch from AT&T is that this will come in handy when you're in a hurry otherwise busy with your hands. Perhaps you're washing the dishes or elbows deep in a mess as you're changing a baby's diaper. In those cases, you could summon Alexa to send a text message asking your significant other to pick up Thai food for dinner on the way home or to grab another bag of diapers from Walmart.AT&T says you can add up to ten frequent contacts to the skill, though it's not clear if you can send messages to all of them as a group or only individually.",

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson Talks 'The Grand Tour,' 'Top Gear' Controversies and Working for Amazon Updated: November 18, 2016 — 8:10 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Daniel Holloway \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Jeremy Clarkson was with James May and Richard Hammond in Victorville, Calif., in September shooting the first episode of their new Amazon series, \"The Grand Tour.\" The segment features Clarkson, May, and Hammond each behind the wheel of a Ford Mustang, leading a pack of cars across the desert to the foot of a stage where a raucous, massive crowd awaits. The three aging Brits, who together look like the Google image-search results for \"older dad,\" receive a greeting normally afforded rock stars. \n\"Everybody was saying welcome back,\" Clarkson says. \"That was genuinely touching. I and Hammond did well up properly.\" \nRelated TV Review: Jeremy Clarkson's 'The Grand Tour' on Amazon \n\"It is nice to be liked,\" May says. \n\"It's unusual for us to be liked,\" Clarkson says. \nNot that unusual. For 12 years, Clarkson, May, and Hammond hosted \"Top Gear,\" the BBC automotive show that was ostensibly about cars, but in reality was about three guys -- sometimes talking about cars, sometimes not, sometimes driving cars, sometimes not. The series was consistently BBC Two's highest rated and in 2012 became the most widely watched nonfiction television program in the world, distributed in 212 countries and territories. With Clarkson, May, and Hammond, \"Top Gear\" was the definition of a global television hit. \n\"The Grand Tour,\" which premiered at midnight, is a version of that show with a bigger budget and a road-trip element thrown in. Each episode features Clarkson and company in a different location around the world, with studio segments filmed under a massive tent in front of a live, local audience. The vibe that made \"Top Gear\" a phenomenon is present and strong. For Amazon, \"The Grand Tour\" represents a potentially smart bet as it attempts to broaden its original-series effort's international appeal. \nRelated Amazon to Stream 'The Grand Tour' in 200 Countries \nBut it's not risk-free. \nClarkson left \"Top Gear\" under a cloud, forced out after punching one of the show's producers. Hammond and May resigned alongside him. The incident was the last in a long string of controversies, including charges of casual racism by the hosts directed at Asians and Mexicans. In 2014, a clip from an un-aired segment surfaced showing Clarkson appearing to say the word \"n---\" when reciting a nursery rhyme. Clarkson, in an apology, claimed that he muttered over the word, but did not speak it. (He stuck by that claim when asked by Variety about the clip, saying, \"We never said that\"). \nWhen Amazon Studios chief Roy Price appeared at the Television Critics Association last year, shortly after signing Clarkson, Hammond, and May to a deal for a new show, he fielded tough questions about their hiring. But Clarkson assures that his new boss has nothing to worry about. \n\"The truth is, if we were as bad as we were made out to be, as awful as we were made out to be, it wouldn't have been the popular show that it was around the world,\" Clarkson says. \"That's the truth of it. And Amazon wouldn't have employed us to come onto their platform. It was a good show, and it was a fun show, and it was a family show.\" \n\"The Grand Tour,\" according to Clarkson, will also be a family show, one in which a good deal of the fun comes from watching the hosts do jack-- things behind the wheel, while plenty more of it comes from watching them take the piss out of themselves, the audience, and each other. These are the essential ingredients that made \"Top Gear\" successful. But will fans missing Clarkson-Hammond-May \"Top Gear\" be satisfied with something that is the same, but different? \n\"The way I would describe it, and it worries me slightly, is that for 12 years, people went to their favorite restaurant on Sunday and had a cottage pie,\" Clarkson says. \"They loved it. It was comfort food. This is a shepherd's pie. It's still great comfort food, but it's slightly different.\" \nThat's because, of course, the show can't be a simple continuation of \"Top Gear,\" which has continued on BBC Two (albeit to ratings that are only a fraction of those drawn by the Clarkson-Hammond-May version). That means no Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, no Cool Wall -- none of the particular segments that made \"Top Gear\" \"Top Gear.\" \nThe result is something akin to Conan O'Brien leaving his Masturbating Bear behind at NBC. It's sad that there's no more bear, but Conan is still Conan. \n\"It's still us,\" Clarkson says. \"We still fall over and catch fire and laugh at each other. But the studio stuff is different. It looks different. It feels different.\" \nDifferent in a way likely to appeal to the Clarkson's fanbase. \n\"If we'd started with this show 12 years ago, everybody I think would have been very happy as well.\" Published: November 18, 2016 — 7:33 PM EST | Updated: November 18, 2016 — 8:10 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "TV Review: Jeremy Clarkson's 'The Grand Tour' on Amazon Updated: November 18, 2016 — 6:25 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Sonia Saraiya \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - If there is one lesson to be learned in 2016, it is that white men in media have a free pass to fail upward with impunity. Corey Lewandowski assaulted a reporter and got a job at CNN; Roger Ailes sexually harassed women at Fox News for decades and got a position as a senior strategist for Donald Trump's campaign. And our president-elect himself... well. It appears that we have a truly extraordinary capacity for forgiveness. \nFor Jeremy Clarkson, who physically and verbally assaulted a BBC producer and was subsequently let go from the massively popular show \"Top Gear,\" forgiveness comes in the form of a lush upgrade: \"The Grand Tour,\" from Amazon Studios, which preserves nearly everything about the BBC show's gearhead enthusiasm, international adventuring, and swaggering masculinity. \nThe first episode places them in America, which gives Clarkson and his perpetual costars Richard Hammond and James May plenty of opportunities to quarrel good-naturedly about the relative merits of the U.K. and the U.S. with their fiercely patriotic audience. (To their credit, the audience has absolutely no patience for Clarkson's declaration that the Royal Air Force is a finer institution than the U.S. Air Force, leading to a staged but funny bit where the trio has to hide behind their table as the audience chants \"U! S! A!\") Their desert studio is extravagant and beautiful, furnished like a conqueror's bivouac with leather camp chairs, vintage luggage, and Oriental rugs. (The giant traveling tent, as they call it, will be touring the world with the hosts -- Johannesburg, Scotland, Dubai.) And the cinematography is remarkable; \"The Grand Tour\" is filmed in 4K, or Ultra HD, making for wide shots of shiny cars drifting effortlessly over terrain or tarmac that are positively bursting with color and movement. \nBut at least at first, much of \"The Grand Tour\" is devoted to reveling in the fruits of bad behavior. Clarkson first appears in the pilot leaving London surrounded by controversy, demonstrated through snippets of news reports and interviews played in the background as he solemnly steps into a black cab. He flies to LAX, where he picks up a blue Mustang Rocket in the airport's parking lot, and as he starts driving east, he's joined by Hammond and May, in red and white Rockets of their own. \nThe music turns from somber to upbeat, a cover of \"I Can See Clearly Now,\" as the three cars meet up and pass with a whole convoy of bizarre and fascinating vehicles, arrayed in a formation not unlike the war party in \"Mad Max: Fury Road.\" They come to the stage where the band is playing, labeled with a big \"BURNING VAN\" banner; a formation of fighter jets sweeps overhead in the endlessly blue sky. If it started as a dark night of the soul, it ends a victory lap. Hammond introduces Clarkson with, \"He's basically a shaved ape in a shirt.\" Clarkson picks it up with his first line to the camera in the whole show: \"It's very unlikely I'm going to be fired now, because we're on the Internet. Which means I could pleasure a horse.\" \nWhen it comes to the cars, \"The Grand Tour\" delivers gearhead porn in spades, fondling steering wheels and gearshifts with expert grace. Clarkson, Hammond, and May's love for machinery -- and what human machinery indicates, which is adventure and expansiveness -- is still present, pure, and appealing, even with the shift in networks and formats. \nBut \"The Grand Tour\" doesn't just sell cars, or the love of cars. It is also a celebration of the car -- the pinnacle of human ingenuity, as far as this show is concerned -- as a tool used to flatten, mold, and indeed, dominate the world. \"The Grand Tour,\" like the trio's \"Top Gear,\" spans the world and crosses all available terrains. In the montage teasing the rest of this season, there are a not-insignificant number of explosions, and at least one instance where machine-gun fire strafes the sides of the drivers' cars. \n\"The Grand Tour\" is about a certain interpretation of strength -- one that interprets logic or sensitivity as just advanced iterations of weakness, subordinate to the power and fire of machines and might. Its ethos is also wrapped up in Clarkson's glee at having escaped punishment, and in his mockery of the Prius and the bicycle for not being devoted to consuming fossil fuels as quickly and loudly as possible. The show is an embodiment of the self-righteousness of wrongheadedness. One is reminded of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy's\" Ford Prefect, an alien who tried to pass on Earth by taking a name from what he thought was the dominant species. \nLiterature isn't far from Clarkson's mind, either. While complaining about the \"boring\" feel of a rather nice-looking white Porsche, he says to Hammond: \"It was like being stuck in a Victorian women's novel.\" \nThere is something to marvel at in this sentence. It cannot be questioned without belying that by doing so, you care -- about women, about novels, about Victoriana, all of which are just about feelings, while cars are about doings. Though this is beside the point, I doubt that Clarkson has ever read a tempestuous Gothic novel, which of course would imply a female audience anyway; novels began as a female art form. Or is he here to say that a Victorian novel written by a man would be less boring? (Students slogging through \"Oliver Twist\" might disagree.) \nNo, the important thing in the sentence is that Clarkson can use it to make someone feel bad -- bad, or hurt, or at least provoked. It is just a method of establishing strength. What matters is the engine on the road -- speed and strength traversing the world -- and awing those who cannot afford it with expensive cars and exotic locales. Never mind that the more \"The Grand Tour's\" drivers drive, the less exotic world there is left to drive through; never mind that on the other side of remaking the world is the responsibility of taking stewardship over it.
