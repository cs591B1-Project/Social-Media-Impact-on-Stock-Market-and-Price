      "text": "/ Home / News / Technology In the 11th hour, Toyota decided to get its act together in terms of electric vehicle development. But before the first-ever production model from the newly-formed EV Business Planning Department hits dealership lots, the Japanese manufacturer found the time to improve the powertrains of its TNGA vehicle platform. As governments clamp down automakers with ever-stringent laws regarding emissions and fuel economy, Toyota turned this downer into an opportunity. In this regard, the manufacturer developed all-new or improved engines, transmissions, and hybrid systems with a single purpose in mind: to reduce CO2 emissions by 15 percent by 2021 in markets that include the U.S. First up, there’s a new 2.5-liter direct injection engine in the offing. The Dynamic Force Engine is, at heart, an improvement of the so-called 2AR-FXE found in the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid. Adapted for the TNGA architecture, the Atkinson-cycle powerplant boasts a thermal efficiency of 41 percent in hybrid vehicle applications. It’s a given, then, that the upcoming 2018 Toyota Camry is gunning for more than 40 mpg combined in Hybrid attire. Next up, Toyota is proud to announce two automatic transmissions: the Direct Shift-8AT and Direct Shift-10AT. The one with the fewer gears is already available in the V6-powered 2017 Toyota Highlander , whereas the 10-speeder is currently employed by the 2017 Lexus LC 500h . In both cases, Toyota’s engineers took the measures to heighten efficiency and refinement. It should be noted that the 10-ratio transmission is meant for rear-wheel-drive applications, which include the fifth-generation Lexus LS sedan. Inspired by the technologies imbued in the fourth-generation Prius , Toyota enhanced the hybrid system for 2.5-liter engines. Dubbed Multistage THS II and developed for RWD vehicles, the powertrain will find its way in future plug-in hybrid models. Joined by a large-capacity lithium-ion battery, Toyota is adamant EV mode is good for a range of “60 kilometers (37 miles) or more.” More detailed information on these newities is available in the release found under the adjacent press briefing video. On that note, the Japanese manufacturer promises to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, 10 versions of four transmissions, and 10 versions of six hybrid systems by 2021.",

      "title": "Toyota engine line-up to undergo major revisions by 2021",
      "text": "Toyota has been working on introducing a new range of engines in its upcoming vehicle line-up. The new cars based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform will now feature new engines and transmissions. This is in line with Toyota’s endeavour for making their cars more efficient and fun to drive.\nToyota intends to deploy these new powertrain units in the upcoming range of vehicles, starting in 2017. The upcoming Camry will be one of the first car to receive these new engine options when it arrives in India.\nWithin the next five years to the end of 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the aforementioned 2.5-liter engine, 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission (CVT), and 10 versions of six hybrid systems. By the end of 2021, Toyota aims to have the new powertrain units feature in 60 per cent or more of Toyota and Lexus-brand vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China. The same will follow suit in India as well.\nToyota has named this new line of engines as “Dynamic Force Engines”. These engines will be based on the TNGA platform. The engine in question is a 2.5-liter direct-injection, inline four-cylinder petrol unit. Toyota says the engine is worked upon to have a greater thermal efficiency, consequently putting out higher output due to reduced energy losses. The Japanese manufacturer claims the new line-up of 2.5-litre engine has the best thermal efficiency of 40 per cent in conventional form and 41 per cent in the Hybrid powertrain.\nThis new line of engines will be mated to all-new transmission systems. Two new automatic transmissions – an eight-speed and a 10-speed direct-shift gearboxes are developed to minimise the energy losses as well. With new manufacturing methods and materials, the gearboxes have fewer clutch torque losses than current gearboxes, along with being compact and lighter, says Toyota.\nThen there is the new Toyota Hybrid System II (THS-II) which is already seen in the fourth-generation Prius but is now enhanced as well to accommodate the new 2.5-litre engines. This system is also developed for rear-wheel-drive vehicles called the Multistage THS II. The hybrid vehicles PHVs powertrain are worked upon as well, with a new dual-mode drive system. This allows the electric motor to provide direct driving, which was hitherto used only as a generator. A large capacity lithium-ion battery is also employed to increase the range to around 60km.",

      "text": "Print \nToyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards. \nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making cars “greener” as global auto makers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years. \nToyota is also stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars, in a shift from an earlier strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles. \n“We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,” Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota’s powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing. \nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 per cent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform. \nBy 2021, at least 60 per cent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China will feature new components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the auto maker said. \nToyota’s hybrid push comes as regulators require auto makers to produce more electric cars, while hybrid technology, introduced in the Toyota Prius nearly 20 years ago, is increasingly considered as conventional technology. \nBut Mizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles. \n“The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,” he said. \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars. \nThe automaker, which sells around 10 million vehicles a year, has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 per cent by 2050. \nTowards this end, Mizushima said that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 per cent of Toyota’s global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 per cent now.",

      "text": "Toyota wraps up Vios Cup Season 3 Answered prayers for 2016 overall champ Allan Uy A- Previous Next Confettis rain on winners at the closing ceremonies of the Vios Cup Season 3 races held at the Clark International Speedway. \n\nPhotos by Bong Boado \nIt looks like Toyota Quezon Avenue’s Allan Uy’s prayers were answered when he was crowned this year’s Toyota Vios Cup (Season 3) over-all champion for the Super Sporting Class division. \nJust before the final round, Uy blew his engine on Round 3 at the Clark International Speedway so he didn’t get any points for Race 5 and 6. \nHowever, this veteran race driver’s determination and strategies paid off after staging a comeback in the season’s finale which was also held at the Clark International Speedway when he won in Race 7 and finishing seventh in Race 8. \nAside from racing, Uy is a creative talent when it comes to custom painting racing helmets. He always puts “To God be the Glory” on his helmet. He said he always asks his friends to pray not only for him but for the safety of all race participants at the start of each race. \nEarning a total of 48 points in the final leg, he ended the season with a total of 111 points to bag the elusive Super Sporting Class title. \n“It has been a rough but fruitful journey this season. Being part of the Vios Cup ever since it started two years ago has been a humbling experience. Going through tough struggles made me stronger and rewarded me with nothing but the best this year,” said Uy. \nThe jubilant champion made sure he thanked God on stage for his triumphant comeback and intimated that this has been a really tough journey for him. \nToyota Alabang’s Estefano Rivera was awarded the overall first runner-up with 103 points while Basti Escalante of the Obengers team bagged the second runner-up title with 90 points. This was Escalante’s best season so far. \nActor and veteran race driver Dominic Ochoa of Toyota Quezon Avenue took home fourth overall with 83 points, and Daniel Miranda from Obengers got fifth overall with 82 points. Allan Uy receives his award from Toyota executives. \nIn the Bridgestone Sporting Class division, foreigner Steve Bicknell of Toyota San Fernando took the crown with 112 points over Gerard Loy of Toyota Dagupan with 108.5 points and Miko Maristela of Toyota Quezon Avenue with 105 points. Sean Velasco of Toyota Cebu had 90 points and emerged fourth while Sam YG got fifth place with 79 points. \nIn the Rota Promotional Class, Kiko Dysico of Toyota Cabanatuan took the title with 109 points over Marc Martinez of Marcars with 98.5 points who emerged as the runner-up while Aira Medrano of Toyota Alabang took the third spot. Medrano was awarded third even if she and Oliver Matias of Toyota San Fernando both got 98 points. \nMedrano had more podium finishes for the season so she was awarded third over Matias who took fourth place. \nOscar Suarez of Toyota Cebu landed fifth place with 80 points. \nIt was also a jubilant evening for TV celebrity Jinno Rufino who bagged the Rota Celebrity Class division over Fabio Ide who awarded runner-up and Jericho Rosales who was placed third overall. \nThis season also saw other celebrity drivers Joyce Pring, Jasmine Curtis Smith, Derek Ramsay, and Arci Muñoz rise up to the challenge on the track, which promises an even more exciting season next year for this division. From left, Steve Bicknell, Allan Uy, Jinno Rufino, and Kiko Dysico \nToyota Motor Philippines’ (TMP) president Satoru Suzuki who also drove in this season said he was elated about the outcome as “the Vios Cup Season 3 proved to be nothing short of the first two seasons and success is starting to be a tradition for TMP’s flagship program.” \nThe Toyota Vios Cup organizers also acknowledged the support of its various sponsors that made this epic one-make race possible through the years, namely Bridgestone, ROTA, Motul, Toyota Racing Development Denso, AVT, Brembo, OMP, and TuasonRacing.com.

      "text": "Driver enjoyment, fuel efficiency and lower emissions are targeted for Toyota's next-generation powertrains, due in 2017\n\nToyota has revealed improvements to its engine range to fit with its TNGA (Toyota New Global Architecture) underpinnings.\n\nHigh amongst the list of prioritised changes is a focus upon driver engagement and enjoyment, in addition to better fuel economy by up to 20%, up to 15% lower emissions of at least 15 per cent, and 10% more power. Toyota aims to introduce the range from 2017 onwards.\n\nThis efficiency is partly due to Toyota’s measures employed to lighten the engines, and ensure that they give cars they're used in a low centre of gravity. The manufacturer claims that the new raft of engines could “change how Toyota cars drive”.\n\n*Read our review of the new Toyota Prius here*\n\nIncluded in this new raft of engines is a new, 2.5-litre direct-injection inline four-cylinder petrol engine, part of a range which Toyota calls ‘Dynamic Force Engines’, which use high-speed combustion and other efficiency-based technologies.\n\nLower friction has also been designed into moving parts for greater fuel efficiency; Toyota claims efficiency ratings of 40% and 41% for the petrol and petrol hybrid versions of this engine respectively. It will not be offered as a diesel.\n\nThe hybrid will be an improved system, using the logic applied to the powertrain of the new Prius. The brand also claims that this system is now also suitable for rear-wheel drive cars. The plug-in hybrid powertrain is also tweaked to give more power by allowing the previously generative electric motor to power the wheels too. The lithium ion battery has also been tweaked, to increase its electric-only driving range up to 37 miles.\n\nOn top of the new engine line-up is a duo of automatic transmissions; eight and ten-speed direct-shift units, which are also designed to experience low levels of friction, and are smaller lighter than equivalents, Toyota claims. For the ten-speed, ‘among the world’s quickest’ shift speeds contribute to a smooth drive, and is designed to be flexible and as suited to urban driving as it is motorway cruising.\n\n*Read our review of the Toyota C-HR here*\n\nToyota’s drivetrain offensive carries it into 2021, by which time 17 variations of its nine-engine lineup will have been introduced, as well as six hybrid systems presented in ten versions.\n\nTen gearboxes, including a new CVT, will also make their respective debuts. The first of these will be on a new model being launched in 2017. Although not confirmed, this is likely to be the new Lexus LS, which is one of the oldest cars in the Toyota and Lexus range.\n\nThis comes as Toyota shifts its internal focus to one of long-range electric vehicles with the appointment of Akio Toyoda, CEO and grandson of Toyota’s founder, at the helm of its EV strategy. Toyota is rejigging its hybrid structure, and within five years will increase its hybrid workforce by 30% within the next five years.",

      "text": "Be part of something big Toyota 2017 Powertrain Introductions Hide press release Show press release \nToyota Develops TNGA-based Powertrain Units for Smooth, Responsive, 'As Desired' Driving \nNew Engines and Transmissions and Improved Hybrid Systems Also Reduce Fuel Consumption and CO2 \nEmissions Fundamental vehicle performance thoroughly reviewed in pursuit of better driving performance and better environmental performance. Under \"Direct & Smooth\" developmental theme, challenge taken up to \"change how Toyota cars drive\". \nNew powertrain units to feature in 60 percent or more of vehicles sold annually in Japan, United States, Europe and China in 2021, reducing CO2 emissions in those markets by 15 percent or more*1. \nDecember 06, 2016Toyota City, Japan, December 6, 2016 -- Toyota Motor Corporation, in pursuit of superb driving and environmental performance, and based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) structural reform for making ever-better cars, has developed advanced engines and transmissions and further evolved its hybrid systems. Toyota intends to deploy these new powertrain units in a rapidly broadening range of vehicle models, starting in 2017.Using TNGA, Toyota has been changing the automobile from its very structure, lowering hood heights, lowering the center of gravity and implementing other innovations to improve driving performance. To enhance fundamental vehicle performance in terms of running, turning and stopping, it initiated a comprehensive review centered on vehicle platforms and is now, since the release of the fourth-generation Prius in 2015, expanding the use of new platforms throughout its product lineup. At the same time, it has been developing new powertrain units, which form the core of an automobile, that significantly improve both driving and environmental performance. \nToyota's newly developed powertrain units are light and compact and have a low-center of gravity. In-depth reconsideration of fundamental vehicle performance has resulted in engines with high-speed combustion and in highly efficient multi-geared transmissions. Furthermore, to standardize the basic structure of these new units, modular design (unified design) was used, building a foundation for the future making of \"well-built cars.\" \nWhile it was a given that the new powertrain units would be designed to have a high level of environmental performance, development focused on achieving driving performance that would \"change how Toyota cars drive\", under the theme \"Direct & Smooth.\" \nFor Toyota, the starting point of making cars is \"fun to drive\"?the feeling of joy that comes when behind the wheel. Toyota aims to make cars with driving performance that responds to the will of the driver and are, at the same time, highly fuel efficient, among having other environment-friendly attributes. The new powertrain units announced today, in themselves, provide approximately 10 percent better power performance*2 and approximately 20 percent better fuel economy. Combining the new powertrain units with the overall evolution of the vehicle body, including aerodynamics, weight reduction and others, can open the way to even greater power performance and fuel economy.New 2.5-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline EngineToyota has named its new line of internal-combustion power plants \"Dynamic Force Engines\". To bring out the new engines' potential to the fullest, their basic structure was completely rethought using TNGA, and their overall structure and configuration were wholly innovated to achieve high-level driving and environmental performance. Work will continue to make the new engines even more advanced. \nThe new engines employ high-speed combustion technology and a variable control system. They also achieve greater thermal efficiency, resulting in high output, due to a reduction in energy losses associated with, among others, exhaust and cooling systems and the movement of mechanical parts. Their lineup includes a 2.5-liter engine that has one of the world's best thermal efficiencies*3?40 percent when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41 percent when used in hybrid vehicles (HVs). This new, thoroughly reconsidered and greatly evolved engine features numerous new technologies, such as technologies for minute control that make it highly responsive and allow it to generate ample torque at all speeds.New 8-speed and 10-speed Automatic Transmissions (Direct Shift-8AT & Direct Shift-10AT)Toyota has developed two new automatic transmissions?the 8-speed Direct Shift-8AT and the 10-speed Direct shift-10AT. For both, various measures were taken to minimize energy loss and heighten transmission efficiency. Gear tooth surfaces were processed using a new technique for a lower coefficient of friction when the gears engage, and the configuration of the friction material used inside the clutch was optimized to reduce clutch torque loss by approximately 50 percent during rotation (compared to a conventional 6-speed transmission). These and other efforts resulted in achieving one of the world's best transmission efficiencies*3. The new automatic transmissions are more compact and lighter than comparative conventional transmissions, lowering a vehicle's fuel requirements. And their lower center of gravity results in both improved straight-driving stability and better cornering stability. \nFurthermore, widened gears and a newly developed high-performance compact torque convertor combine for a broader gear lockup range. The resulting quick and smooth response to accelerator pedal operation creates an \"as desired\" direct driving feel. \nIn the case of the Direct Shift-10AT, even though the number of gears has been increased to 10 (compared to eight gears in the case of the Direct Shift-8AT), the use of close-ratio gears optimizes the range of use of each gear, particularly in the low-to-mid speed range. The resulting smooth gear changes, which are among the world's quickest*3, create a rhythmical and comfortable sensation that is suitable for a premium rear-wheel-drive vehicle. \nThrough such measures, fundamental vehicle performance in practical driving situations ranging from driving around town to driving on the highway has been improved to a degree that drivers can distinctly experience. Smooth response to accelerator pedal operation enables \"as desired\" vehicle departure and, in overtaking maneuvers, it allows lag-free and rhythmical acceleration that meets driver expectations, even in cases of sudden and heavy accelerator pedal use.Advancement of Toyota Hybrid System II (THS-II)Applying size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies used in the fourth-generation Prius, Toyota has enhanced its hybrid system for 2.5-liter engines and developed the new, high-performance Multistage THS II for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. \nTHS II for 2.5-liter engines excels in both power and fuel-economy performance due to the synergistic effect of size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies coupled with the high thermal efficiency and output of a new TNGA-based engine. \nMultistage THS II gives hybrid vehicles an all-new driving image with its start-from-stop acceleration performance and abundant direct feel. In addition to improving system efficiency at high speeds, intermittent use of the engine at high speeds has also been made possible, further improving high-speed fuel economy. \nThe system for plugin hybrid vehicles (PHVs) has also been enhanced. A new dual-mode drive system allows the electric motor, which was hitherto used only as a generator, to provide direct driving power, resulting in powerful driving, even when in EV mode. Further enhancing the system for PHVs is a large-capacity lithium-ion battery that largely increases the EV-mode cruising range to 60 kilometers or more*4.Roll-out of New Powertrain UnitsThrough TNGA-based car-making, efficiencies have been achieved in the development of the base technologies of the new powertrain units, along with improvements in quality, making possible the concerted release of affordable, high-quality products. This will lead to Toyota being able to quickly provide its customers with ever-better cars and to further promote widespread use of environment-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. \nWithin the five years to the end of 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the 2.5-liter engine announced today, 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission, and 10 versions of six hybrid systems. \nIn this way, through TNGA-based modular development, Toyota will roll out numerous types of new powertrain units within a short timeframe, successively introducing them in various vehicle models, starting with the launch of a new-model vehicle in 2017. \nBy the end of 2021, Toyota aims to have the new powertrain units feature in 60 percent or more of Toyota-brand and Lexus-brand vehicles sold annually in Japan, the United States, Europe and China. Toyota forecasts that Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold that year in those markets will account for a CO2 reduction in those markets of 15 percent or more, counting the fuel-efficiency-improvement contributions made by the new powertrain units alone.Review and Strengthening of Development Structure of Powertrain CompanyToyota intends to review and strengthen the development structure of its in-house Powertrain Company. Conventional engine-powered vehicles account for the vast majority of vehicles currently on the market, and HVs and PHVs, the advance of which is expected to continue, also have internal-combustion engines. In addition to promoting development of engines and transmissions, which are seen to remain mainstay for some time to come, toward the coming electrification of vehicles, Toyota is accelerating its development of hybrid technologies (electrification technologies), such as those used in electric motors, batteries and power control units (PCUs). \nSharing technologies to raise the collective ability of the Toyota GroupToyota has long conducted research and development of key technologies and systems based on its stance to \"acquire through in-house creation\". The accumulation of knowledge, know-how and experience is what allows Toyota to turn failure into improvements. This approach has been the backbone of Toyota research and development and is viewed as why Toyota was able to develop a practical hybrid system, launch the \"Prius\"?the world's first mass-production HV, and develop and be quick to market with the \"Mirai\" fuel cell vehicle (FCV). \nHowever, Toyota realizes that it would be difficult to heighten the pace of development and commercialization of electrification technologies for further reducing CO2 emissions if Toyota addressed such as it has done until now, relying only on its own resources. Toyota will continue to carefully select that which it deems necessary to \"acquire through in-house creation\". But, from now on, it will also promote the sharing of technologies within the Toyota Group and increase the number of fields covered by joint research. It will strengthen joint development that uses cross-group obeya (project rooms with displays for sharing and reviewing goals, policies, timelines, progress and problems, etc.), efficiently use group resources to quickly establish advanced technologies and aim for increases in three areas: in the collective ability of the Toyota Group, in the speeding of development and in the scale of proliferation and expansion of environmental technologies.Strengthening the development structure for hybrid technologies, which are core technologies for electrificationKey hybrid technologies, such as those found in electric motors, batteries and PCUs, are also key technologies used in vehicles that are powered by electricity, such as PHVs, FCVs and EVs. For the electrification of vehicles, to greatly accelerate the development of hybrid technologies, which Toyota positions as the core technologies of environmental technology development, Toyota plans to increase its number of hybrid technology-development personnel. Specifically, it plans to reorganize its development structure starting in 2017 and increase its number of people involved in hybrid technology development by approximately 30 percent within the five years to the end of 2021. Beyond then, as well, it plans to further strengthen its human resources for hybrid technology development as needed. \nTo contribute to the preservation of Earth's environment, Toyota is aiming to reduce new-vehicle CO2 emissions by 90 percent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2050. Based on its principle policy of conserving energy, which is the cornerstone of its development of environment-friendly technologies, by furthering the evolution of engines and transmissions and by promoting widespread use of HVs and PHVs, Toyota is endeavoring to improve fuel efficiency as a means of reducing CO2 emissions. And with a view to the future and an eye on limiting the consumption of fossil fuels centered on petroleum, to respond to the diversification of energy sources, Toyota is advancing its development of zero-emission vehicles, such as FCVs, which use hydrogen, and EVs. \nTo further reduce CO2 emissions, Toyota is continuing its development of environmental technologies and its commercialization of environment-friendly vehicles from the perspective that environmental contributions cannot be achieved without widespread use of environment-friendly vehicles. \nGoing forward, through TNGA-based ever-better car-making, to accelerate the commercialization of ever-better cars that are both fun to drive and that contribute to Earth's environment and to accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions, Toyota will strengthen its undertakings by rallying the collective ability of the Toyota Group. \nTo download presentations and video, go to:http://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/detail/14391907/ \n*1 Comparison of average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles actually sold in 2015 in Japan, United States, Europe and China and average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles planned to be sold in 2021 in Japan, United States, Europe and China, including vehicles equipped with newly developed powertrain unitsEstimated CO2-reduction contribution made only by newly developed powertrain units based on certified data in each country or region \n*2 In terms of time needed for a gasoline-powered vehicle to accelerate from 0 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and for a hybrid vehicle to accelerate from 40km/h to 70km/h \n*3 As of November 2016, according to Toyota survey \n*4 Developmental target value (in the JC08 test cycle); measured by Toyota \nToyota's Approach to Developing Environmental Technologies \nReducing CO2 Emissions through Sure and Steady Steps and Widespread ApplicationAs fuel consumption regulations continue to strengthen in various countries, and as many automobile manufacturers advance their commercialization of electric-powered vehicles, such as plug-in hybrids (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs), Toyota is working to further evolve conventional fossil-fuel-powered engines and transmissions. The reason: To steadily promote reduction in CO2emissions. \nIn 1997, Toyota launched sales of the \"Prius\" as the world's first mass-production hybrid vehicle (HV). Now, nearly 20 years later, hybrid vehicles have gradually grown in use, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe. But, on a global scale, they have yet to become widespread. The widespread use of PHVs and EVs, which have already been introduced, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe, is expected to take time. The vast majority of cars in use or on the market are conventional engine-powered vehicles that consume large amounts of fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, and they will continue to emit large volumes of CO2, as from before. \nIt is expected that it will take quite some time for the proliferation of vehicles that use electricity?some of which emit very little CO2 and some of which have no emissions at all?to make headway and for their effect on reducing CO2 emissions to become apparent. Therefore, to be able to stop the advance of global warming, finding other ways of reducing CO2 emissions, which are thought to play a role in the rise of global temperatures, is an urgent issue. \nFor the time being, the vast majority of cars in use or on the market will remain to be conventional engine-powered vehicles, and HVs and PHVs, the use of which is expected to increase, also have internal-combustion engines. As such, considering that fossil fuels will continue to serve as automotive fuel for some time to come, improving the environmental performance of engines and transmissions can promote a measureable reduction in CO2 emissions that is proportional with an increase in the number of vehicles. \nToyota believes that developing conventional powertrain technologies is a sure, steady, realistic and effective means of reducing CO2 emissions.Further Reducing CO2 Emissions through Fuel DiversificationBeyond the reduction of CO2 emissions through the widespread use of HVs and PHVs is the need to achieve zero CO2 emissions. The widespread use of zero-emission vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and EVs, is a must. The only way to achieve such is to use non-fossil-fuel hydrogen and electricity as automotive power sources and to develop powertrain technologies for vehicle electrification, such as fuel cell systems, motors and batteries, and power control units. \nToyota believes that hydrogen and electricity are important alternatives to fossil fuels for use in automobiles. As such, it intends to advance its development and commercialization of zero-emission FCVs and EVs, which emit no CO2 during driving and are effective in making large contributions to the environment. \nTaking into consideration the energy situation and fuel infrastructure in various countries and regions, as well as consumer preferences and other factors in the market environment, Toyota is endeavoring to promote the widespread use of FCVs and EVs, while considering the appropriate roles for each, and is aiming for even greater reductions in CO2 emissions. \nHowever, the road to fuel diversification is not an easy one. Such cannot be achieved by automobiles alone. Essential is the existence of a supply infrastructure (fuel infrastructure) for new fuels that can allow peace of mind in the use of automobiles that run on new types of fuel. For energy companies, that means new investment. Support by governments and municipalities is also indispensable. \nAlso necessary is the understanding of society and our customers and their acceptance of new fuels. This is because new fuels are different in many ways?such as in terms of fueling locations, fueling times, fueling methods and fuel costs?from fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel, with which we are familiar after so many years of use. New fuels could also mean fueling that is not as convenient as that in the case of the cars our customers are using today. This means that \"diversification\" must apply to not only fuels but to customer values, as well. \nThis is especially true when it comes to FCVs, which use hydrogen?a fuel with which people rarely come in contact in daily life. Because hydrogen can be produced from various primary energy sources, beyond its environmental benefits, it is seen as an important energy resource that will be used in the future as a way to heighten energy security. FCVs, which use electricity created through a chemical reaction involving hydrogen and which can be driven without emitting CO2, have high potential as a form of \"the ultimate eco-car\". Toyota has been developing FCVs for more than 20 years. But issues still exist. These include understanding of hydrogen on the part of society and our customers and the availability of hydrogen stations. Much time is still required for the widespread use of FCVs and the realization of a hydrogen society. \nAware of such, Toyota was quick to initiate an FCV commercialization project, resulting in the launch of the \"Mirai\" FCV in Japan in 2014, followed by sales in the United States and Europe. Toyota has taken up the challenge. \nThis is just the beginning of what Toyota sees as a long-running challenge to make a hydrogen society a matter of fact and to make FCVs everyday vehicles.Toyota, while promoting efforts to conserve energy, intends to accelerate its response to fuel diversification and to work as one with the entire Toyota Group to achieve greater reductions in CO2 emissions.

      "text": "IBC publishes its list of the top 10 stolen vehicles for 2016. Photo: Toyota Canada Print \nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) today unveiled its annual list of the ten vehicles most frequently stolen in Quebec. Once again, luxury sport utility vehicles (SUVs) are the first choice among criminals. \nWith the exception of BMW's 335xi–which is considered a luxury car—IBC's Top 10 clearly demonstrates that for thieves, the appeal of sport utility vehicles shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, all the cars that fell into their clutches in 2015 were SUVs. \nIf overall rates for auto theft are continuing to decline in Quebec, they remain a costly problem for insurers. Between 2013 and 2015, for example, the frequency of thefts dropped by 25%, but the average cost for these types of claims actually rose by 15%, from $15,428 to $17,755. \"Today's thefts are different from what they were several years ago. Thieves no longer 'borrow' cars to go for a spin; they are now acting as part of organized networks, and vehicles are often stolen for resale abroad,\" says Anne Morin, Supervisor, Communications and Public Affairs at the Insurance Bureau of Canada. \nIn addition to the export market, the vehicles are stolen for resale locally to people who are unaware that they are in fact victims of fraud. The vehicles are also dismantled and sold for parts or used to commit other crimes. \nThe top 10 in Quebec This year, the ten most frequently stolen vehicles in Quebec were:1. TOYOTA 4RUNNER 4P 2015 TRUCK/VAN2. TOYOTA 4RUNNER 4P 2014 TRUCK/VAN3. LEXUS RX350 4P 2013 TRUCK/VAN4. LEXUS RX350 4P 2015 TRUCK/VAN5. TOYOTA FJ CRUISER 4P 2011 TRUCK/VAN6. INFINITI QX60 4P 2015 TRUCK/VAN7. BMW 335xi 2P 20088. TOYOTA 4RUNNER 4P 2013 TRUCK/VAN9. LEXUS RX350 4P 2014 TRUCK/VAN10. LEXUS IS 300 4P 2002 \nPreventing Auto Theft The IBC's Top 10 indicates that, in Quebec, nine out of ten stolen vehicles were built after 2007—in other words, after the installation of anti-theft devices became mandatory under the law. Although these systems discourage some thieves, they are not infallible. So it is important to be vigilant and take certain precautions to discourage thieves from targeting your vehicle. \nProtect your vehicle by following these tips: • Never leave the engine running while the vehicle is unattended.• Park in a well-lit area.• After parking, always shut the windows and lock the doors.• Place valuables and any packages in the trunk out of sight.• Park your vehicle in your garage overnight.• Do not leave personal documents in the glove compartment.• Take the registration and proof of insurance with you when leaving the car.

      "text": "Toyota to expand development of gasoline-hybrid tech to cut emissions December 6, 2016 - 17:53   Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday, December 6 it will expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards, Reuters reports. \nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making cars \"greener\" as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years. \nToyota is also stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars, in a shift from an earlier strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles. \n\"We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,\" Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing. \nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform. \nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China will feature new components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said. \nToyota's hybrid push comes as regulators require automakers to produce more electric cars, while hybrid technology, introduced in the Toyota Prius nearly 20 years ago, is increasingly considered as conventional technology. \nBut Mizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles. \n\"The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,\" he said. \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars. \nThe automaker, which sells around 10 million vehicles a year, has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050. \nTowards this end, Mizushima said that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.

      "text": "Toyota Prius Kenstyle Body Kit Is Pure Aero Awesomeness / Home / News / Tuning Owning a Toyota Prius is so much more than making an eco statement. For most people in Japan, it's also about buying the most popular car in the country and making it your own. It's what Scion wanted to be , only without the fake marketing and stupid indie concerts. Speaking of Scion, I vague remember that K enstyle body kits were indirectly introduced into the US back in 2008 on the boxy xB. The tuning industry has leaped ahead since then, and I can honestly say the Prius looks ten times better than a Scion. Multiple versions of the Kenstyle body kit are available for this 4th generation hybrid vehicle. But this one is the most advanced and we love it, especially from the back. Starting at the front, we notice that the bumper is an add-on for the factory one, covering an area from about the top of the air intake and stretching a couple of inches below where the spoiler should have ended. The Prius also gets two additional LED strips and a grille insert. Of course, this wouldn't be a proper Japanese tuning project without side skirts that imitate race cars. They're beefy at the back, and together with the stickers on the doors, they take you back to an era when neons were used instead of LEDs. Kenstyle also offers a variety of different wheels, these being 19s with thin 215/35R19 rubber. Oh, and they installed a 35mm offset for this demo car. But the rear view is where all the magic happens. You've got a difuser in white, a black grille and a wing on top of the trunk. We bet that when you hit 88mph, a portal to 1999 opens up. Or is that 88mpg, considering this is a Prius? The chances of seeing such a body kit anywhere outside of Japan are pretty low. That's because a 5-piece package that includes the front spoiler, side skirts, rear spoiler, hood and rear wing can cost å316,000 or around $2,800. That's before paint, installation and any other trinkets you might need. Toyota Prius 2016 Toyota Prius toyota tuning Prius tuning Toyota pic of the day",

      "title": "Single Owner 5-Speed w/ 72K Miles: 1991 Toyota Previa",
      "text": "December 6, 2016 — Japanese / Under $20k | 14 Comments Single Owner 5-Speed w/ 72K Miles: 1991 Toyota Previa \nThis 1991 Toyota Previa is a rare 5-speed manual van that’s been with the elderly owner since new. Further described as always garaged and accident-free with 72k miles, it retains original paint and a well-kept interior, and is further claimed to run and drive perfectly. Find it here on Craigslist in Oakland, California for $3,950. Special thanks to BaT reader Jim Y. for this submission. \nPhotos are blurry cellphone snaps and do the van no favors, but the seller describes the car in such a way to suggest that it’s much better looking in person. Short of the Espace-based Renault Avantime luxury coupe (and not including commercial vehicle-based vans like VW buses and the like), these are arguably the best looking minivans ever built, and even as we approach the design’s 30th birthday (it was originally penned in 1987), it remains remarkably modern. \nThe van is said to have always been garaged when not driven, and to retain its original paint as well. Factory wheel covers and lots of fender gap might not please everyone, but that’s how they were when new. We might consider a mild drop and a cool set of aftermarket wheels, but it’d probably be best kept fully stock. \nThe interior is said to look like that of a three year-old vehicle, and upholstery for seven does look nice front and back. Unfortunately the dash isn’t shown without the carpeted cover in place, and there’s no word on electrical functionality either. \nNo engine bay shots are provided, but it isn’t easy to photograph–accessed via a small door behind the front seats, the van’s 2.4 liter four is placed mid-ship and canted over nearly 90 degrees. Note the higher trimline factory alloy wheels shown above–a nice set from the junkyard could be a nice swap here. Related Stories",

      "text": "Toyota to Release a Myriad of Powertrain Options Across the Board New engines and trasmissions, they've got them all. Concept Cars Japanese Cars \nBetween 2017 and 2021, Toyota plans to bring the heat by adding a host of new powertrain options. The company's movement will introduce a variety of engine and transmission choices, aiming to increase average fuel economy as well as efficiency throughout the range. Each addition will make for better performance, efficiency, and livability. \nThe hunt for more gears continues as Toyota's future transmissions will include 8 and 10 speed selections. They are being designed to reduce energy loss, therefore raising the overall efficiency in regards to kinetics and heat. Smaller and lighter construction will lower the center of gravity, further improving the cars' cornering capabilities. To capitalize on performance, the company plans to introduce a gearbox that mates up with a rear-wheel drivetrain named the Direct Shift 10-AT. Toyota states that these new transmissions will be \"among the world's quickest\", promising a strong focus for both enthusiasts and normal consumers. This, along with an innovative gear tooth design, makes for an especially smart piece of equipment. \n\nAs far as engines go, expect to see much of the same economical themes carry over from years past. Intelligent design will translate to higher engine oputputs, satisfying every need. A fresh, direct injection 2.5L I4 will be composed, keeping Toyota's gasoline-only options viable for years to come.This powerplant will follow a similar trend by reducing heat loss significantly, making it a well-rounded package. Although Toyota won't skip development efforts on this one, their main focus seems to be on continued hybrid advancements. \nThis is the real story here. The company's already award winning hybrid program is set to be improved upon once again, giving them a real edge over their competitors. A modern layout of hybrid tech and rear-wheel drive vows to provide exceptional fuel economy at interstate speeds, making future models well-balanced in terms of fuel economy throughout the rev-range. Thermal efficiency is also said to jump 41 percent in the forthcoming hybrid models. Expect to see an extended use of EV mode, providing instant torque even in cases of spirited driving. This is a significant change as the hybrid system not only acts as a generator, but also a viable power source for performance. These are the things that the automotive community should be excited about -- manufacturer innovation for the sake of dynamic vehicle improvement. \nWe will begin to see these changes popping up in production models sometime in 2017. This will be the start of a rather large development program, instituting several different versions of each new powertrain option. Toyota aims to really set the pace in each category, and this seems to be a great way to do so.",

      "text": "Toyota has confirmed plans for a second generation of the 197bhp rear-wheel-drive sports car; soft-top version of the current generation is unlikely\n\nToyota has confirmed that the GT86 sports car will continue into a second generation, with a likely onsale date of 2018-2019.\n\n“The GT86 is at the stage where it’s being decided on the next one,” Toyota Europe boss Karl Schlicht revealed. “Then a chief engineer will be assigned and away we go.”\n\nThe 197bhp rear-wheeldrive GT86 has carved out a niche as a fun driver’s car, but like most sports models, its strong early sales have subsequently subsided.\n\n“The GT86 will carry on,” said Schlicht. “The car serves a big purpose. We are not getting out of that business . Sporty cars go through their phases. It’s our intention to continue with that car.”\n\nContinued co-operation with Subaru also looks likely but is as yet unconfirmed.\n\n“Will it be with Subaru?” said Schlicht. “I don’t know. But for the concept to carry on, with the low engine, we’d have to do that. There are a lot of reasons to continue with Subaru.”\n\nA key engineering feature of the GT86 is its low-slung Subaru flat four engine, which keeps the centre of gravity low for better handling.\n\nSchlicht also suggested that a soft-top version of the GT86 was unlikely. “We wouldn’t do it on the current model,” he said. “That doesn’t mean dealers wouldn’t like one, but there are so many other priorities that I don’t think we’ve got spare capacity for that.”\n\nThe new GT86 will sit below the reborn Supra in Toyota’s sports car line-up. The bigger coupé is currently in development with BMW, whose version will replace the Z4 roadster.\n\n“That co-operation is going well,” said Schlicht. “It’s on track. It’s being done in Europe. Our version is a different car from BMW’s.”",

Toyota estimates this will result in providing 10-percent better power performance and 20-percent better fuel economy. \nThe new 2.5-liter direct-injection, inline 4-cylinder gasoline engine dubbed Dynamic Force Engines provide greater thermal efficiency with 40-percent when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41-percent in hybrid vehicles, which results to a high output. \nMeanwhile, the new 8-speed and 10-speed automatic transmissions minimize energy loss and heighten transmission efficiency. It is also more compact and lighter than conventional transmissions, lowering a vehicle's fuel requirements. With its lower center of gravity, it enhances straight-driving stability as well as cornering stability. \nIn addition, it is also equipped with widened gears and a newly developed high-performance compact torque convertor, which provide a broader gear lockup range. The direct shift 10-speed gearbox also enables a lag-free and and rhythmical acceleration meeting the driver expectations. \nThe revamped hybrid system II 2.5-liter engine, on the other hand, excels in both power and fuel-economy performance. It provides hybrid vehicles an all new driving image with its start-from-stop acceleration performance. It has better fuel economy at highway speeds. \nIn addition, the dual-mode system for plugin hybrid vehicles (PHVs) has also been improved, now providing direct driving power. PHVs also get a large-capacity lithium-ion battery, which increases the EV-mode range of up to 60 kilometers or more. \nBy 2021, Toyota aims to reveal 17 versions of nine engines, 10 versions of four transmissions and 10 versions of six hybrid systems. Also, by the end of 2021, the company expects to produce the new powertrain units in at least 60-percent of Toyota-brand and Lexus-brand vehicles sold annually in Japan. \nThe automaker also said that starting next year, Toyota is planning to release the new powertrain units in a rapidly broadening range of vehicle models.

      "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global-emissions standards.\nThe announcement today was the latest by the automaker aimed at making greener cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the U.S. and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.\nIn addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.\nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.\n\"We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,\" Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing.\nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.\nMizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles.\n\"The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,\" he said.\nEV unit \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.\nToyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.\nTo this end, Mizushima told reporters that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.\nWhile Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take \"quite some time\" for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure.",

      "text": "Toyota Announces New Powertrains, Doubles Down on Hybrids New 8-speed and 10-speed transmissions are coming New 8-speed and 10-speed transmissions are coming Share this article in: Free Price Quote From a Local Dealer View Special Offers No Obligation, Fast & Simple Free New Car Quote Change Car   \nToyota is on a massive development spree and will introduce a wide variety of new powertrain components starting in 2017 and continuing through 2021. Along with a new 2.5-liter inline-four engine, the automaker is introducing new 8-speed and 10-speed transmissions and improved hybrid systems. \nToyota is creating new engines with improved thermal efficiency, reducing energy losses and allowing for a high output. A new 2.5-liter direct-injection inline four-cylinder engine, made to align with the Toyota New Global Architecture , has a thermal efficiency of 40 percent inside gasoline vehicles and 41 percent in hybrid vehicles. \nNew 8-speed and 10-speed transmissions are also on the way. Lighter and more compact than similar transmissions, the new units reduce energy losses and feature a lower center of gravity for improved straight-line and cornering stability. A new technique used on gear tooth surfaces makes for a lower coefficient of friction when the gears engage. The Direct Shift-10AT, suited for a premium rear-drive vehicle, uses close-ratio gears to improve the range of each gear, particularly in low-to-middling speeds, for smooth gear changes. Toyota claims the gear changes in this unit are “among the world’s quickest.” Toyota’s new 10-speed \nAlthough Toyota made big improvements on the new Prius , it’s reviving its hybrid and plug-in hybrid technology once again. Toyota’s new hybrid system for rear-wheel-drive vehicles promises improved fuel economy at high speeds, allowing for intermittent use of the engine at such speeds. For plug-ins, a new dual-mode drive system allows the electric motor to not simply act as a generator but instead provide direct driving power, which Toyota says should permit spirited driving even in EV mode. Also, plug-ins will get a large-capacity lithium-ion battery with an EV-mode cruising range of about 37 miles or more. \nHere’s an idea of just how much Toyota is looking to alter its lineup. By 2021, Toyota will introduce 17 versions of nine engines, 10 versions of six new hybrid systems, and 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatics and a new kind of CVT. At that time, 60 percent or more of Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold annually in Japan, U.S., Europe, and China are projected to include the new powertrain components. The new powertrain bits in these models will account for a C02 reduction of 15 percent, the automaker estimates. \nWe’ll begin seeing the powertrain bits on a new-model vehicle in 2017, Toyota says. Next year, Toyota will also start increasing its hybrid tech development staff by about 30 percent through the end of 2021. \nSource: Toyota",

      "text": "2019 Toyota 86 / GT86 Confirmed Once Again, Convertible Not Viable / Home / News / Car Profile When Toyota and Subaru announced that they’re joining forces to develop a boxer-engined sports car, the fan base was thrilled with the news. Introduced in 2011, facelifted for the 2017 model year, and nearing the end of production, the 86, GT86, and Subaru BRZ alike are set to be refreshed from the ground up. The second-generation Hachi-Roku was first confirmed by Toyota of Europe executive VP Karl Schlicht. “ It’s down the road,” he said in an interview from October 2014. Two years later, the higher-up reaffirmed that “the GT86 will carry on.” Speaking to Autocar , Mr. Schlicht let it slip that “there are a lot of reasons to continue with Subaru,” including the low-slung boxer plant. Albeit a bit down on torque and asthmatic in terms of how the 2.0-liter engine delivers that torque, keeping the center of gravity low is a must if Toyota and Subaru want the next-gen breed to handle at least as fine as the current models do. Extremely heartening news for the purists among us, alright. It’s also heartening that Toyota’s reborn Supra “is a different car from BMW’s.\" Because the next-gen Supra is expected to come in coupe and convertible/targa top flavors, Toyota has no interest in chopping the roof off the second generation of the GT86. “There are so many other priorities that I don’t think we’ve got spare capacity for that,” the man said on the subject. Anticipated as a 2017 vehicle for the 2018 model year, the Supra will be followed by the all-new Toyota 86 / GT86 / Subaru BRZ in 2018 for the 2019 model year. Keep those fingers crossed for skinny tires and natural aspiration, along with a good old manual box and crisp handling for carving corners. If it were your hard-earned money, would you buy a Mazda MX-5 Miata right now or wait for Toyota and Subaru to show us the new kids on the block?",

      "text": "Toyota Updates Yaris, Auris, Verso And Avensis For 2017 | By Share Toyota has subtly updated its Yaris, Auris, Verso and Avensis models for the 2017 model year in Europe with some styling tweaks, technology improvements and additional features. Starting with the 2017 Yaris , it will be available with a new Tokyo Red paint color in monotone and bi-tone versions. The latter will contrast the red with metallic black finishes to the roof, A-pillars, door mirrors, the leading edge of the hood and the upper front wing. Moving to the 2017 Auris, it also includes the same Tokyo Red option and comes with new 17-inch alloy wheels and sports seats with black alcantara upholstery. Other updates for 2017 include the Toyota Safety Sense package as standard. This adds a pre-collision warning system, lane departure alert, automatic high beams and road sign assist. The Verso MPV has new upholstery throughout the interior combined with red contrast stitching and, once again, Tokyo Red paint, while a set of 17-inch wheels have also been added to the options list. Last but not least is the updated Avensis , which (you guessed it) receives the same red paint - oh, and 18-inch wheels. European customers will be able to get their hands on the updated Toyota models starting this month. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "The Nature of It All Published December 7, 2016 \nToyota’s ( No. 34 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list) next chapter in hybrid technology is a win for Hispanic consumers as the Hispanic Motor Press Awards recognized the all-new Prius Prime as one of the Best Cars of 2017. \nKristin Bemowski, Vehicle Marketing and Communications Specialist at Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., accepted the award on behalf of Toyota and Hispanic Motor Press Jury Director Ricardo Rodriguez-Long presented Bemowski with the honor. \n“Toyota is committed to telling the hybrid story to Hispanic consumers and making a long-lasting environmental impact,” said Bemowski. “We are so humbled by this accolade in Prius Prime’s first year and recognize the value in building the safest, most reliable vehicles on the road for our community.” \nThe jury for the 7 th annual Hispanic Motor Press Awards was made up of 19 Hispanic journalists who frequently cover the automotive industry. The vehicles are assessed for how well they match the needs of the Hispanic consumer, with a vetting process that includes test drives, market availability and affordability. They also factored in the design, comfort, safety, performance, functionality, accessory content, driver satisfaction, consumer final cost and overall value. \n“The automobile is changing and environmental concerns are in front of us every day,” said Rodriguez-Long. “Minimizing fossil fuel is one area that young Hispanics are embracing. Recyclable materials, powertrain efficiency and connectivity are a must in today’s vehicles. The Prius Prime is the best example of the evolution of the automobile and we highly recommend this hybrid for the family.” \nThe 2017 Prius Prime combines an electrifying design with an even more capable electric powertrain than the previous-generation model. With a class-leading total drive range EPA-estimated 640 miles and EPA-estimated range of up to 25 miles up to 84 mph in EV mode, Prius Prime’s goal is to meet the daily commuter distance of more than half of U.S. drivers. Exclusive suspension tuning gives the Prime an enhanced planted stance through curves. All Prius models are built around Toyota’s New Global Architecture (TNGA) and feature double-wishbone independent rear suspension. This suspension can be found on the best sport sedans and works the same wonders for handling and ride quality in a super-efficient hybrid, too. Share this:",

      "title": "2013 Toyota RAV4",
      "text": "Compare Prices \nI go back and forth about which compact crossover SUV to recommend to my friends, family and readers. Lately, I've been leaning toward the Honda CR-V , especially since its 2012 makeover. But the Toyota RAV4 has never been far out of the running. Now, Toyota has revised the compact crossover for 2013, with a new body, powertrain and interior. The 2013 Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD arrives with a base price of $28,410 ($32,394 as tested), a 3-year/36,000-mile basic warranty, a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty and EPA fuel economy estimates of 22 mpg city/29 mpg highway. Let’s drive. \nFirst Glance \nRAV4 came out of the gate quickly as a 1995 model, capturing the cute vote as the SUV for people who hated SUVs. The second generation cemented RAV4's reputation as a solid performer during the years 2001 to 2005. The third generation RAV4 may have lingered a bit too long, from 2006 to 2012, still stuck in \"cute-ute\" mode with its tailgate-mounted spare tire long after the competition abandoned any pretense of off-road mojo. \nThe new fourth generation RAV4 comes to ring with a few big exterior revisions that put it right back in contention. First and foremost, the spare tire (now a temporary donut) has been relocated to a hidden space, beneath the cargo load floor like a grown-up car. And the right-side hinged side-swinging rear door has been replaced with a lightweight tailgate that is hinged at the top. I've been knocking the RAV4 for its side-swinging tailgate since day one -- mostly because it opened from the wrong side to be useful for American driving conditions. The new liftgate solves this problem, allowing the RAV4 to be loaded from the right side curb at long last. The top-of-the-line Limited model even includes a power liftgate as standard equipment. \nToyota didn't stop there. RAV4's exterior has been completely redesigned, with a sleeker roofline, bolder character lines, and a unified front fascia that links the expressive headlights with the grille and Toyota logo. My top trim Limited model came with standard 18\" alloy wheels, which looked great inside the bulging fender wells. Headlight and taillight design cues tie RAV4 in with the rest of the Toyota SUV lineup now, which is a good thing. Black lower rocker panel covers, bumpers, front and rear fascia promote the illusion that RAV4 has more ground clearance than it actually does (a modest 6.3\", down from 7.5\" for the third generation RAV4). \nOverall, the new RAV4 is attractive and very contemporary. It does blend in to the crowd a little bit, I have to admit. This is not ground breaking design, but it is solid design. \nIn the Driver's Seat \nLet's start with the good, which is very very good. Toyota made a big step forward in material selection, fit and finish on the dash and interior of the new RAV4. Touchpoints are soft and pleasant. The shapes and asymmetrical flourishes of the dashboard are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. I love the new HVAC vent that is integrated into the top of the center stack, providing great airflow without forcing the 6.1\" touchscreen to slide further down in the stack. My test vehicle's driver's seat got eight-way power, including adjustable lumbar support, which greatly improved comfort. Despite a few inches lower roofline, there's still plenty of passenger room in the second row. The ridiculously tight optional third row seat has been discontinued as an option for 2013, a wise decision that will keep kids out of chiropractic treatments. RAV4 still has plenty of cargo space, with 38.4 cubic feet behind the second row opening up to 73.4 cubic feet with the second row folded. \nNow to the bad. In the midday sun, it was impossible to use the touchscreen to access the Toyota Entune system. No matter how I tried to shade the screen, I could not see the map in the Navigation app. I couldn't read the audio settings. After dark, the screen was fine. But during the day, it was pretty much useless. \nWhich is a shame, because my RAV4 Limited was equipped with a lot of technology that runs through that screen, including Bluetooth communication and streaming audio, Toyota Entune, a backup camera and vehicle information systems. My test vehicle also had a very handy blind spot monitor with rear cross traffic alert, a system that I've come to depend upon in several luxury SUVs lately. \nOn the Road \nThe V6 RAV4 is no more, probably forever. We're left with just one engine choice for 2013, a 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine tuned to produce 176 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque. Luckily, there's a new 6-speed automatic transmission (no manual available) that delivers better fuel efficiency than before and better performance feel. More transmission gears (the old 4-cylinder used to be connected to a 4-speed automatic) means that the engine spends more time in the heart of its power curve, and so it sounds less thrashy and labored when you put the whip to it. I can't say that I won't miss the V6, but the improved fuel economy and everyday drivability is welcome. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available for all trim levels for an additional $1,400. \nRAV4's handling has been sharpened in this new generation as well. The front MacPherson strut/rear double-wishbone suspension setup is the same, but the rear stabilizer bar has been slightly beefed-up. Lower ground clearance means a lower center of gravity, and those two small changes have benefitted the RAV4 with less body roll through the curves, and more overall stability. On occasion, I found the suspension to be a little too stiff, as sharp highway joints delivered a jolt to the body that many other vehicles would absorb and dissipate. In general, RAV4 was a pleasure to drive, on a par with the best of the competition. \nJourney's End \nSo, has RAV4 worked its way back into my heart with this new generation? I think so. Toyota has made some very smart decisions, allowing RAV4 to mature and get more sophisticated, without allowing it to get stodgy in any way. The new transmission is great, and perfectly matched to the small efficient engine. The new RAV4 is better in nearly every way than the old RAV4: Better looks, greater efficiency, better interior features, better handling and better packaging. The sweet spot for me would probably be the mid-level XLE with front-wheel drive, which starts at $24,290 -- a very competitive price for a nicely equipped vehicle. \nI'd still have to look long and hard at the competition before I bought a RAV4. The Honda CR-V is the best-selling SUV in America, for good reason. The Subaru XV Crosstrek and Mazda CX-5 are also fresh rivals. The Chevrolet Equinox / GMC Terrain , the Hyundai Tucson / Kia Sportage and the Nissan Rogue also have their virtues. \nUltimately, it may come down to brand loyalty when you go to buy your next compact crossover. Are you a Toyota person, or a Honda loyalist? I'm a Toyota guy, totally biased by my love affair with Moose, my 1994 Toyota 4Runner. But brand loyalty might not trump that troublesome touchscreen display, no matter how much I like the new transmission. For now, I'm going to continue to recommend that people drive both the RAV4 and the CR-V before deciding on a new compact crossover SUV, and trust their gut feelings to make a decision between the two. It's that close.",

According to chief executive of Toyota Ireland, Steve Tormey, “We are honored that Toyota Europe has chosen Dublin for the launch of YUKÕ and are very excited about the promise YUKÕ holds for addressing some of the key mobility issues in large metropolitan areas such as Dublin. We want to democratize our technology by providing customers access to the latest high tech hybrid vehicles.” The company says that it was prompted to launch the program to allow individuals who don’t want to own a vehicle to get behind the wheel of a Toyota and, if it proves popular, will be expanded with more vehicles across a large number of European cities. In Forli, Italy, YUKÕ users will enjoy free access to traffic restricted areas of the city and paying parking areas. The city’s mayor hopes this will be the first step in making the region more accessible while meeting health, quality of life and environmental needs. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Toyota Confirms Second-Gen GT 86 Will Launch In 2019 | By Share Toyota’s return to the sports coupe segment with the GT 86 has been a successful one, and the company is already planning its successor. Karl Schlicht, the automaker’s European division boss, told Autocar that the second-generation is most definitely a go, probably for a late 2018 or, most likely, 2019 launch.“The GT86 will carry on”, Schlicht said. “The car serves a big purpose. We are not getting out of that business. Sporty cars go through their phases. It’s our intention to continue with that car.” Right now, he revealed, the second-generation “is at the stage where it’s been decided on. Then a chief engineer will be assigned and away we go”. The current coupe was co-developed with Subaru, which markets it under the BRZ moniker. Schlicht was non-committal on whether the next GT 86, or plain 86 as it is named in some markets, will also be a joint effort. “Will it be with Subaru? I don’t know. But for the concept to carry on, with the low engine, we’d have to do that. There are a lot of reasons to continue with Subaru.” The boxer engine was key to the GT 86 achieving a low center of gravity that benefitted its driving dynamics, and with Mazda, which Toyota is said to have considered before teaming up with Subaru, declaring the rotary dead and buried , rekindling the Subaru partnership seems like the logical thing to do.

Related Media Purdue, Toyota Collaborate on EV Cooling Tech \nToyota releases photos of its new range of powertrains to complement its Toyota New Global Architecture platform. \nDeployment of the new engines and transmissions claiming “significant improvements in driving and environmental performance” will begin with ’17-model vehicles. \nImprovements claimed are low center of gravity, high-speed combustion and efficient, multi-gear transmissions, while modular designs create standardized structures to establish a foundation for the future manufacturing of “well-built cars.” \nToyota says the new engines and transmissions achieve about 10% more power and 20% better fuel economy. Newcomers: A 2.5L direct-injection inline 4-cyl. gasoline engine. A member of what has been dubbed the Dynamic Force Engines range, this claims one of the world’s highest thermal efficiency levels – 40% when used in a gas-powered vehicle, 41% when used in a hybrid vehicle. It features many new technologies, including precise control to secure highly responsive performance and the generation of ample torque at all speeds. Eight- and 10-speed automatic transmissions. Toyota has developed two new automatic transmissions: the 8-speed Direct Shift-8AT and the 10-speed Direct Shift-10AT. Both use a new surface coating to achieve a lower friction coefficient when the gears engage. By optimizing the configuration of the friction material inside the clutch, clutch torque loss during rotation has been reduced about 50%, compared with a conventional 6-speed transmission. Also, wider gears combine with a new high-performance, compact torque converter to give a broader gear lock-up range. The Direct Shift-10AT claims “among the world’s quickest” changes with the use of close-ratio gears. Improved Toyota Hybrid System II (THS II). Toyota claims reduced size and weight plus loss-reduction technologies used in the fourth-generation Prius improve its hybrid system for the new 2.5L engines. The new, high-performance Multistage THS-II also is applicable to rear-drive vehicles. It claims improved system efficiency at high speeds and it makes intermittent use of the engine possible, further improving fuel economy. The system for plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) also has been enhanced with a dual-mode system that allows the electric motor, previously used only as a generator, to provide direct-drive power-boosting performance even when the vehicle is operating in all-electric EV mode. A high-capacity lithium-ion battery brings further benefits, helping increase the driving range in EV mode to 37 miles (60 km) or more. \nIn the five years through 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the 2.5L; 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission; and 10 versions of six hybrid systems.",

      "text": "11 mins ago by Mark Kane 0 Comments \nThe 781 Toyota Prius Prime delivered in the plug-in hybrid’s first partial month of availability in U.S. shows us that the 2nd generation of plug-in Prius is going to be a major player in the EV market – not only in America, but around the world. Toyota Prius Prime \nToyota open’s the second chapter of the PHEV’s history with a much stronger offering. \nFor 2017, the Prime is re-designed and uniquely styled to differentiate it from the standard hybrid Prius, and it can also now travel some 25 miles on electricity before the petrol engine kicks in (via a 8.8 kWh battery) – more than double the older model. \nBut even more significantly, the new Prius Prime is priced $1,000 less expensive (after the federal credit is applied) than the base hybrid Prius offering . \nThe Prime starts at $27,950 , but is eligible for a $4,500 credit, bringing the effective price down to $23,450, making the Prime the 4th least expensive plug-in offering in of the ~30 different models available heading into 2017 for the US. \nEvery indication from Toyota thus far is that the plug-in version of the Prius will be the new flag bearer for the company’s halo brand…and will ultimately take over the reins from the standard hybrid. Meaning the company won’t be happy with selling just 500, or 1,000…or even 2,000 copies a month in America. \nAnd to do that, to push the Prime to sales levels unseen by any EV before, we look for the company to promote the plug-in like no other EV has ever before – like a mainstream offering. So, look for Toyota Prius Prime ad spots to pop up during national television shows and sporting events near you. To get things started, here are three freshly released videos promoting the Prius Prime’s launch. \nFirst (above) is an introduction to the model with with a message from Chief Engineer and Project Chief Designer, while another two (below) touch on more specific aspects of the car: \nTOYOTA Prius Prime | Iconic Human-Tech The look of Prius Prime has become very advanced and emotional as a leading model of Prius family. \nTOYOTA Prius Prime | Emotional and Intelligent Eco-tech Experience “never before” Waku-doki driving with outstanding EV driving performance!",

      "text": "December 07, 2016 at 13:04 PM EST Toyota’s Continuing Litany of Safety Issues Draws Comment from Gilman Law LLP In recent years, Toyota has been at the center of a seemingly-endless string of safety problems, resulting in recalls and litigation, according to Gilman Law LLP. These controversies have included vehicles prone to unintended acceleration, an expanded recall of 5 million faulty airbags, and brake safety problems. Just last month, Toyota acknowledged dangerous corrosion problems affecting many of its Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia sport utility vehicles. Days later, the Company announced a recall for 2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \nIn recent years, Toyota has been at the center of a seemingly-endless string of safety problems, resulting in recalls and litigation, according to Gilman Law LLP. These controversies have included vehicles prone to unintended acceleration, an expanded recall of 5 million faulty airbags, and brake safety problems. Just last month, Toyota acknowledged dangerous corrosion problems affecting many of its Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia sport utility vehicles. Days later, the Company announced a recall for 2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. \n“The never-ending safety controversies affecting Toyota vehicles are bad enough on their own. However, the company’s treatment of consumers makes these issues even worse,” says Ken Gilman, founding partner at Gilman Law LLP. “For example, a $3 billion settlement recently announced by Toyota to resolve this massive corrosion problem falls far short of what is required.” \nToyota Corrosion Settlement \nOn November 9 th , 2016, Toyota announced a $3.4 billion settlement after many of its Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia sport utility vehicles were found to lack adequate rust protection, resulting in premature corrosion. While the settlement covers 1.5 million vehicles, it only applies to Toyota Tacoma trucks from model years 2005 to 2010, Tundras from 2007 to 2008 and Sequoias from 2005 to 2008. The agreement fails to compensate owners and prior owners of Tundras except for years 2007 – 2008 and no other affected years. It also fails to compensate owners for many years of affected Tacoma and Sequoia vehicles. \n“Owners should seek a review of their claims for compensation relating to corroded frames and other major corrosion issues which they have experienced,” Mr. Gilman says. “Tundra, Tacoma and Sequoia vehicles have experienced severe frame and other corrosion issues that may impact the structural integrity of the vehicles. Affected consumers are urged to seek a review of their claims.” \nRecent Toyota Recalls \nOn October 12, 2016, Toyota announced a recall for 340,000 Toyota Prius sedans due to a potentially deadly brake defect. The recall affects 92,000 2016 and 2017 models sold in the U.S. The company also acknowledged receiving reports of crashes, injuries and deaths that could be related to this issue. There is a possibility that the parking brake on the affected vehicles could become inoperative. If this occurs and the driver exits the vehicle with the transmission in a gear other than \"Park\" while the ignition is on, the vehicle could roll away, increasing the risk of a crash. \nOn November 22, 2016, Toyota recalled 744,000 Model Year 2011 – 2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. Toyota still does not have a remedy to fix the problem. \nGilman Law LLP represents the legal interests of consumers who suffered losses due to defective vehicles. If you purchased, owned, or leased a Toyota Tacoma, Tundra, Sequoia, Sienna or Prius and would like to learn more about the legal options available to you, please contact Gilman Law at (888)252-0048, or www.gilmanlawllp.com .

      "text": "Based on Toyota 's New Global Architecture (TNGA), the Japanese carmaker has announced the introduction of a new engine that would be 60 percent more fuel efficient than the current generation ones. These new engines would come into 60 percent of Toyota Group cars by 2021, starting with Japan, and later moving on to China, Asia, Europe and the United States. In addition, the company will also introduce two new transmissions, an 8-speed and 10-speed unit, which would be compatible with TNGA. The fourth generation Prius is the first mass produced car that uses this platform. At a recent event held in New Delhi, Toyota raised its concerns and efforts with state governments and other authorities to bring down emissions in cars as well as increase safety in them.\nThe new engine, which would come in the new TNGA platform cars is a 2.5 litre direct-injection inline 4-cylinder petrol engine that would be coupled to an electric motor. Since this engine will be based on the new TNGA platform, it would be able to fit in most future Toyota or Lexus products as the new platform is known for its versatility for a front, rear and all-wheel-drive cars. (Also Read: Toyota Prius: First Impressions )\nToyota is the global leader in hybrid powertrains and with the introduction of Toyota 's Hybrid System II or THS II, which is claimed to be more efficient overall, will enable the Japanese company to further extend its lead in this future mobility segment. Toyota also seems to have shifted their focus towards battery operated and hybrid vehicles over fuel-cell technology. This could be possibly due to the high cost and storage problems associated with hydrogen. The Japanese company did showcase the Mirai concept at the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show but since then has not revealed any new developments.\nThe company also plans to introduce 17 new engines in the next five years that would include the new 2.5-litre engine for TNGA cars and with the roll out of this new platform, component sharing would become easier thereby reducing the total manufacturing cost of any vehicle. Moreover, this should also lower the cost of hybrid technology due to benefits of scale.\nDespite some hybrid vehicles in India such as the Honda Accord Hybrid, Toyota Camry Hybrid and the upcoming Toyota Prius, price becomes one of the main deal-breakers. Case in point, the ex-showroom price of the Toyota Camry Hybrid is Rs 30.80 lakh and Honda Accord Hybrid is Rs 37 lakh, both ex-showroom Delhi. An additional waiver of taxes on hybrid cars by state governments would also reduce costs while making hybrid cars accessible to more potential buyers.\nCould this be the future of cars in developing countries like India? Our take is that with the rising emissions and concerns expressed by manufacturers for a greener future, the Government and related authorities like NGT should take steps in order to reduce emissions by further relieving taxes on cars with lesser carbon footprints such as hybrid and electric models.",

      "text": "Toyota RAV4 vs. Honda CR-V: Consumer Reports \nBy Brittany Perry | \nUpdated 12/07 2016 10:08AM CONSUMER REPORTS \nWhen it comes to cars, small SUV’s are big business. Over three million were sold in North America last year. \nThe original SUVs were based on trucks. Small SUVs are based on car platforms; car manufacturers took the comfort and handling of a car ride and put them in a bigger package. \nNow you have a utility vehicle you can take anywhere. \nConsumer Reports took a look at the two top-selling models -- Toyota’s RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. \nBoth are roomy, comfortable, and versatile vehicles that come from trustworthy brands. But they often appeal to different drivers. \nSome people like the RAV4 because of its roomy interior, its strong reliability, and its great fuel economy. \nThe RAV4 hybrid got an impressive 31-mpg in Consumer Reports tests. The CR-V gets 24-mpg, and Consumer Reports says it’s a good match for those who don’t want to sacrifice utility for sportiness. \nThey want something that’s engaging, that they can enjoy driving on the weekend, as well as something that’s reliable and fuel-efficient day-to-day. \nBoth SUVs rate very high for safety, but the RAV4 has a slight edge in available safety equipment. \nToyota offers a lot of active safety features like automatic emergency braking and forward-collision warning. \nThat’s available on all of the line, whereas Honda includes it only with the top two trims. \nConsumer Reports rates the Toyota RAV4 slightly above the Honda CR-V, but suggests taking a test-drive to see which works best for you. \nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

      "title": "Toyota Announces Smorgasbord of New Engines, Transmissions",
      "text": "Toyota Announces Smorgasbord of New Engines, Transmissions \nBy Kelsey Mays \n2016 Toyota Camry Cars.com photo by Angela Conners \nCARS.COM — In a move to change how its cars drive, Toyota announced wide-ranging plans to roll out new vehicle platforms and engines over the next five years. The automaker says it will offer its next generation of powertrains in at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in the U.S., Japan, Europe and China by 2021. \nRelated: GM Expands New Transmission Use for 2018 \nThe automaker said it wants to make its cars \"fun to drive\"— a seemingly tall order for mainstays like the Corolla and Camry but something Toyota has indeed done with cars like the Scion FR-S -turned- Toyota 86 coupe. The automaker said its next drivetrains will improve performance by about 10 percent and gas mileage by about 20 percent versus the current crop. Across three continents, Toyota plans a massive rollout: 17 versions of nine engines, 10 versions of four transmissions and 10 versions of six hybrid systems by the end of 2021. The first of them arrives in 2017, Toyota said, but it's unclear how many of those will come to the U.S. market. \nAmong the highlights: New Four-Cylinder Engine \nWhat changed: The next generation of Toyota's larger four-cylinder engine has the same 2.5-liter displacement as the current four-cylinder, but Toyota will add direct injection and promises \"ample torque at all speeds\" and \"one of the world's best thermal efficiencies\"— a technical term to measure how well an engine turns combusted fuel into energy output. \nWhere you might see it: The Camry and RAV4 both have port-injected 2.5-liter four-cylinder engines; both cars are likely candidates for the next 2.5-liter. \nWhy it matters: Rival automakers like Honda , Hyundai - Kia and Mazda have switched from port injection to direct injection in their mainstay engines, and the resulting benefits — more precise fuel metering to improve power and fuel efficiency — would be a welcome upgrade for Toyota shoppers. New Transmissions \nWhat changed: Toyota will develop eight- and 10-speed automatic transmissions with lower-friction components and compact packaging. The automaker promises ultra-quick gear changes with the 10-speed unit, and it separately mentioned a \"new kind of continuously variable transmission.\" \nWhere you might see it: The 2017 LC 500 coupe from its Lexus luxury division has a 10-speed automatic that Toyota says is the first of its kind in a luxury car. The automaker hinted that the 10-speed could end up in other rear-drive luxury cars, so it could show up in the next-generation LS or GS sedans. \nWhy it matters: Toyota already has eight-speed automatics in mainstream cars like the Highlander , but if the automaker replaces its six-speed automatic with the gearbox elsewhere — think Camry, RAV4 and the like — it could drive some mileage improvements. Still, we've observed in cars from Jaguar to Toyota that more gears can often hurt drivability, and fuel-efficiency gains can face diminishing returns as gear counts go ever higher. Toyota promises \"lag-free and rhythmical acceleration that meets driver expectations, even in cases of sudden and heavy accelerator pedal use,\" but the proof will be in the pudding. Next-Generation Hybrid Systems \nWhat changed: With a lot of pages taken from the fourth-generation Prius ' playbook, Toyota plans an \"enhanced\" 2.5-liter hybrid system for its mass-market hybrids and an overhauled higher-performance hybrid system for its rear-drive cars. Its plug-in-hybrid system, meanwhile, gets more power and a larger-capacity battery for EV ranges that could top 37 miles — but that's in Japan test cycles, not U.S. EPA cycles. \nWhere you might see it: The current Avalon Hybrid , Camry Hybrid , RAV4 Hybrid and several Lexus hybrids have 2.5-liter-based systems, while the Lexus GS 450h and LS 600h employ rear-drive-based hybrid systems. Toyota's overhaul could affect all of them. \nWhy it matters: The 2.5-liter system builds on Toyota's upgraded four-cylinder engine detailed above, while the automaker said its next rear-drive hybrid system enables smoother, more direct acceleration with more electric-only operation at high speeds. All of that portends better performance, increased gas mileage or both. \nSenior Consumer Affairs Editor Kelsey Mays likes quality, reliability, safety and practicality.

      "text": "The Totally New Toyota 86 Should Be Here by 2019 The Japanese automaker's sports car future looks promising. twitter.com/aaronmaxb instagram.com/aaronmaxb \nSeven years ago at the Tokyo Motor Show, the world met the Toyota FT-86 concept, the earliest result of Subaru and Toyota coming together to develop an affordable sports car. At the same show two years later, production-ready models of the Subaru BRZ and Toyota GT-86 were shown off , finally giving sports car-lovers who needed something relatively affordable an option (that wasn't another damn Mazda Miata). Now we're learning that the next generation of 86 —as it's now called —will be here by 2019, according to a new report. \nToyota is currently plotting out the arrival of the next 86. In an interview with Autocar , Toyota's European head Karl Schlict explained that the process of creating the next-generation model is just now ramping up. \n“The GT86 is at the stage where it’s being decided on the next one,” he said. “Then a chief engineer will be assigned and away we go.” \nThe 86 is an important car to Toyota enthusiasts. In America, the 205-horsepower coupe is the automaker's only rear-wheel-drive sports car, and one of the only reminders that the company has a long fun-to-drive past. \n“The GT86 will carry on,” said Schlicht. “The car serves a big purpose. We are not getting out of that business. Sporty cars go through their phases. It’s our intention to continue with that car.” \nCurrently, it is unclear whether the automaker will continue to work Subaru like it did with the current 86 and BRZ, but signs point to yes. \n“Will it be with Subaru?” said Schlicht. “I don’t know. But for the concept to carry on, with the low engine, we’d have to do that. There are a lot of reasons to continue with Subaru.” \nSchlicht also dropped a little status update on the new BMW-Toyota Supra return project. \n“That co-operation is going well,” said Schlicht. “It’s on track. It’s being done in Europe. Our version is a different car from BMW’s.” \nSounds like Toyota has a solid sports car future lined up. That's good news to us—and should be to you too, if you like fun cars.",

      "text": "Toyota is Reportedly Working on a Second Generation 86 The Toyobaru will live to see another iteration. Consumer News \nIt seems as if Toyota is going to give the 86 a second run in the near future. The current 86, formerly dubbed the Scion FRS, stirred up the sports car coals for Toyota when it was introduced in 2012. The collab project with Subaru got enthusiasts' attention with its rear wheel drive and naturally aspirated engine, but so far, it hasn't been as impressive as the masses have hoped. Will its next generation bring us the power and improvements that we've been wanting for years? \nIt was questionable if Toyota would bring the 86 back for another rendition. Sales were declining, as were consumers' reviews of the promising car. When speaking with Autocar about the 86's future, Karl Schlicht, the head of Toyota Europe stated that \"Sporty cars go through their phases ... The GT86 will carry on.\" It would be safe to expect an array of new features, but Toyota is still unclear on whether or not the 86 will see a bump in power figures. \nAs of right now, it seems that they will continue on their parternership with Subaru. This would save the company a pretty penny in development as they don't necessarily have an engine that would fit the bill for the 86's purpose. Besides that, Toyota favors the boxer engine's low center of gravity as it contributes to the all important cornerning stability that has been present in the FRS/86/BRZ since its introduction. Subaru also has higher-performance powerplants in their arsenal, like the EJ-series engine used in the WRX, that may find their way into a TRD version of the 86. \nThere are plenty of opportunities for a more powerful 86, so here's to hope. Renderings have been released depicting potential BRZ STI concepts, expecting that much of the same tech would find its home in the Toyota brother as well. The chassis is set up for higher output, and the aftermarket is so extensive that it would make for a hummdinger with the tuner buffs. Schlicht's perspective seems positive, stating that \"It's our intention to continue with that car.\" That would be hard to do without changing the car's heart as well. \nIt's unclear when the next generation 86 will be available, but Toyota has plenty of experience to pull from. The Miata's spiritual-hardtop brethern has left us wanting more, and Toyota could certainly hit it big with customers if they make the car even better. That solves the problem, doesn't it? Happy customers = higher sales! We're anxious to see what direction the automotive giant decides to go with the car's next generation.",

      "text": "2018 Toyota Supra sheds some camo to reveal more details \nToyota Europe boss is referring to the flat-four engine of the 86, developed by Subaru and providing low center of gravity for the car. It’s one of the key engineering features of the machine, and makes it deliver great driving thrills for a very low price, as we discovered during our test run of the 2017 model year . \nWe’ve heard rumors for an open-top version of the 86, but it seems this idea doesn’t have high priority among Toyota bosses, at least according to Schlicht. “We wouldn’t do it on the current model,” he commented. “That doesn’t mean dealers wouldn’t like one, but there are so many other priorities that I don’t think we’ve got spare capacity for that.” \nOne of the other priorities for Toyota is the spiritual successor of the legendary Supra. The coupe is currently under development in cooperation with BMW , whose version will serve as a replacement for the aging Z4. \n“That co-operation is going well,” Schlicht declared. “It’s on track. It’s being done in Europe. Our version is a different car from BMW’s.” Be part of something big 2017 Toyota 86: First Drive About this article",
