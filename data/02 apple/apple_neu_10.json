      "title": "iPhone 6s Unexpectedly Shuts Down? Apple Might Have a Fix!",
      "text": "Dec 3, 2016 - 11 Comments \nHas your iPhone 6s randomly shut itself off for no obvious reason? Typically this happens when the iPhone 6s still has battery power available, but the device dies and powers down anyway. If this has happened to your iPhone 6s, it may be due to a battery failure and Apple might replace it for free. \nTo determine if your iPhone 6s is eligible for the free battery replacement, you’ll need to find the devices serial number and then run it through an Apple website for the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues”, here’s what you’ll want to do: Open the “Settings” app on your iPhone and then go to “General” and to “About” to locate the Serial Number for the iPhone 6s (you can also get the iPhone serial number from iTunes) Go to https://www.apple.com/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/ and enter the serial number of the iPhone to check eligibility \nIf the iPhone 6s serial number matches the range known to contain faulty batteries, you can send your iPhone 6s into Apple for a free repair. You can also take the iPhone into an Apple Store, or to a certified reseller or repair shop for the battery replacement as well. \nApple typically has a fast turnaround for mailing in a faulty iPhone for repair, so if your serial number falls into the range it is a good idea to send in the device for the battery replacement, even if you have not yet experienced a random shutdown or the device randomly turning itself off. \nRemember, this specific program is limited to the iPhone 6s and a specific range of serial numbers. If your iPhone or iPad of any other model is exhibiting similar behavior of randomly turning off, follow this troubleshooting guide to see if you can remedy the issue on your own, and if that fails it may be a good idea to contact Apple Support.

      "text": "Apple has confirmed rumours that it is working on technology to develop self-driving cars, while car maker BMW will accelerate its shift toward autonomous and electrified vehicles by opening a self-driving test center in Germany.\nIn a letter to US transport regulators, Apple said it was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\".\n\"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,\" Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner states in the letter.\nThere have long been rumours about the firm's plans but it has not publicly confirmed them until now. The tech firm has already registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto.\nThe letter offered no details of the project, instead highlighting the \"significant societal benefits of automated vehicles\", which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year.\nToward the end of the letter, the tech giant makes a point to say that \"established manufacturers\" and \"new entrants\" should be treated equally \"to maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition\". Otherwise, newcomers may be at a disadvantage, since they would have to apply for regulatory exemptions.\nMeanwhile, German carmaker BMW said it will test about 40 vehicles with self-driving functions in Munich's inner city and then expand the project to other cities, BMW executives said on Friday.\nUber's rapid growth has prompted BMW to consider how autonomous vehicles may help them accelerate their own push into pay-per-use transport.\n\"Ride-hailing is nothing more than manual autonomous driving,\" Tony Douglas, head of strategy for BMW's mobility services said. \"Once you dispense with the driver you have a license to print money.\"\n\"Someone else spent the money to educate the market and then we came in with a cool product. We will not be the largest, but we can be the coolest,\" Douglas said.",

      "text": "Analysts Think Apple Is Too Reliant On The iPhone  58 PST \nThe iPhone is probably one of Apple’s most successful products of all time, if not the most successful. However in recent times, sales of the iPhone have been on the decline , which is to be expected given that the market is at peak saturation, plus it is possible that customers are also getting bored by the lack of “innovative” features. \nIn fact the analysts over at Oppenheimer seem to think that Apple might be too reliant on the iPhone for revenue. In a note obtained by Business Insider , Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz says, “We believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone.” \nHe also adds, “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.” If you have been following the tech news scene, you’ll realize that perhaps some of his claims might be true. There are many who have expressed their feeling that Apple is neglecting its Mac computers, products which was what brought Apple to fame in the first place. \nFor example despite unveiling a brand new design of the Mac Pro several years ago, Apple has kind of neglected it since. Users of the new MacBook Pros are also expressing that the laptop, while perfectly capable, certainly does not exude the “Pro” qualities that it used to back in the day. Are the analysts right? We suppose only time will tell, but what do you guys think? \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones . Read more about iPhone . Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple confirms working on self-driving cars IndiaToday.in Last Updated: DEC 05, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nRumours of Apple working on a self-driving car have been doing rounds for over a year now. At times it was evident that the company is keen on developing self-driving cars when it hired automotive industry engineers, however, the company never confirmed those reports.Now a five-page letter sent by Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration clearly mentions that the company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\". He also urged the regulator to not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nThe letter from Kenner is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. Also read: Will pedestrians be at ease in a world of self-driving cars \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Apple acknowledges it's working on a self-driving car Apple acknowledges it's working on a self-driving car Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + It's been rumored for quite some time now that Apple might be working on a self-driving car in an attempt to rival Tesla and Google in the field. It was then suggested that the company has scaled down its project and will only produce certain hardware to augment the driving experience.It appears that Apple still has the plan to test self-driving cars, though, so initial reports might have been correct. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Apple has stated it's “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation” and that there are “significant societal benefits” to autonomous vehicles.The letter was written by Steve Kenner, director of product integrity at Apple, and it urges the NHTSA not to impose too many limitations to self-driving car tests. According to Kenner, the more strict the rules are, the harder it would be for someone to make an automated vehicle. He believes that “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally” .The letter also focuses on data-sharing between self-driving car manufacturers. Kenner proposes that data of crashes and near-misses should be shared among companies that make autonomous cars, in order for all of them to improve. His argument is that no one company can gather as much data as all of them combined and the more data companies have, the safer their final vehicles will be.Of course, Kenner also adds that said data should only be shared if it's not user-identifiable. He states that the industry and regulators should “address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data” , in order to ensure individual users' privacy.This is the first time we get a semi-official glimpse of Apple's plans for a self-driving car, but we should definitely be on the lookout for more after this one.

Jolla says yes Monday December 5, 2016 @michaelsawh \nWith Android Wear 2.0 delays and uncertainty of what will happen to Pebble OS if Pebble gets snapped up by Fitbit , Finnish startup Jolla is playing with the idea of bringing its Sailfish operating system to the smartwatch. \nThe Linux-based, gesture-centric operating system developed by former Nokia and Intel employees has previously appeared on smartphones and tablets but didn't exactly set the world alight. As part of a case study, the team has ported its Sailfish OS to an LG Watch Urbane Android Wear watch to showcase what the platform could offer. \nRead this : Best smartwatches to buy now \nThe short video below demonstrates how you would be able to bypass any physical buttons, tapping and swiping your way through the user interface to do things like view fitness tracking activity, make a call and transfer a call from the watch to your smartphone. \nTaking technical and design inspiration from Asteroid OS , an existing open source smartwatch operating system, it also incorporates key elements of the Sailfish OS including a horizontal carousel, ambiences (essentially stylish themes) as well as accessing apps from the bottom of the screen. \nFor the prototype Jolla used Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth to pair the smartwatch to a phone to reduce the time it would take to port the OS onto an Android Wear watch. \nAs we've already mentioned, Jolla is not committing to making its Sailfish OS a fully fledged smartwatch platform just yet, but when operating systems from Apple, Samsung, Google and the rest are still very much works in progress, maybe Jolla has the potential to offer a simple yet sleek alternative. \nDo you like the look of Jolla's watch OS?

      "text": "\nI love my car. I love Apple's CarPlay. But they do not love each other. What's a technologist to do?\n\nMichael Gartenberg has covered the personal technology beat for more than two decades at places like Gartner, Jupiter Research and Altimeter Group. Most recently, he spent a few years at Apple as Sr. Director of Worldwide Product Marketing.\nMy beloved 2004 Acura TL is awesome. Its got 270 horses under the hood, a cockpit that perfectly fits my 6'4\" frame, and it's filled with state of the art technology like HD Audio and a beautiful touch screen display. Its got Bluetooth that could connect my old Motorola RAZR, a fantastic iPod mount, and cassette to a adapter for music. Yep. State of the art. For 2004. Sigh.\nI won't be replacing my car any time soon, but I wish I could get access to all the new cool stuff. I could use an Android phone where Google delivers Android Auto to their phones. It works really well. But I'm an iPhone user and, sadly, there's no CarPlay in this car. Not even a third-party head unit that's compatible with my beloved car.\nBut there is Navdy.\nHUD is out Navdy started life a Kickstarter project and it's now shipping for all. In short, it gives almost any car, going as far back as 1996, a modern heads up display — HUD. It delivers accurate mapping, controls for telephony, and messaging as well as audio controls. And it's wicked cool.\nI've been using Navdy for the last week or so. It consists of a small, transparent screen that attaches to your dashboard and is powered by the ODB port in your car (almost all cars from 1996 have one). Setting it up took me about an hour. 15 minutes for installation, 45 minutes to tweak the display.\nWhat you get for that small investment of time and money is a heads up display along the lines of what you might see for fighter pilot in a movie. Or for, you know, Tony Stark in the Iron Man armor.\nOnce Navdy kicks in, Information floats above the hood of your car. Maps, directions, messages, and audio are all there. It's controlled by a small dial that connects to your steering wheel — or by gestures. I found the steering will dial best for use, but gestures are pretty cool.\nFuture imperfect Navdy is awesome, but there are some downsides. First, it's not cheap. Second, if it's not calibrated correctly, the display can be a distraction. It's not any more distracting than a phone interface or an integrated car display, but those can be pretty distracting.\n\nStill, it's the best way I've found so far to bring my vintage car the latest in automotive technology. The company is smart and responsive when it comes to support, and the iOS (and Android) app is well designed.\nIn short, this is an awesome way for cars that can't use CarPlay to take advantage of their iPhones and make their dumb cars a lot smarter.\n",

      "text": "  \nIn my Scientific American column this month , I wrote about the public’s hysteria when Apple eliminated the headphone jack in its phones, starting with the iPhone 7. (Motorola and LeEco had also eliminated the headphone jack.) \nApple argues that sooner or later, everything goes wireless: phones (cellular), networking (WiFi), video connections (AirPlay or Chromecast), accessory connections (Bluetooth), and so on—and now it’s time for headphones to go wireless, too. Apple sells its own, rather amazing AirPods (wireless white earbuds that hook into each ear), but there are dozens of Bluetooth earbuds available, costing as little as $17. \nIn the box with the iPhone, you also get a set of wired earbuds that connect to the phone’s charging jack, plus a little two-inch adapter cable that accommodates any existing earbuds or headphones. \nSo: Does that cover it? Does that make it OK to eliminate the jack? Here’s my diary of life without one. \nDay One: Amtrak to Boston. I decide to give the AirPods a try. The white case looks like a dental-floss container, but it’s also an AirPod recharger (holds 24 hours’ worth of charge). Just opening the container’s hinged lid makes the AirPod “pair” with the phone—very slick. \nI’m listening to Facebook and YouTube videos. The AirPod sounds great. I’m perfectly content to ear only one of them, so that I can still be aware of my surroundings. I’m not listening to, you know, Mozart. \nDay Two: In my Boston hotel, I grab the phone and head downstairs to the fitness center. On my way in, I spot a bowl full of cheap earbuds, provided for the gym’s guests. Cool! I’ll plug into my phone and listen to some NPR! Oh wait—no, I won’t. I didn’t anticipate this event, so I didn’t bring the adapter. \nDay Four: After five hours of playback, the right AirPod I’ve been using is finally dead. I switch to using the left one. All the fears about having them fall out and get lost are overblown; this thing hasn’t even come close to falling out. \nDay Five: I’ve been listening to my phone through the AirPod, but now I want to switch to my Mac laptop. Without even removing the bud from my ear, I see that I can switch the AirPod’s source to the Mac with one menu click. That’s cool. \nDay Six: Flight to San Francisco. Yay—seatback TVs! Boo—they have standard headphone jacks. I can’t use the AirPods; I’m going to have to get the Apple headphone adapter cable. Which is in the overhead bin. Which I’m not allowed to open until the seatbelt light goes off. OK, I’ll just watch in silence. \nDay Seven. Home. Well, both arguments are correct. Wireless really is wonderful. It’s glorious not to have to untangle a set of earbuds, not to have the wire get caught on things. But we live in a headphone-jack world. In principle, the little adapter should solve that problem every time; in practice, it’s something you have to remember to keep and track and carry. \nSomeday, all of us will listen wirelessly. For now, we’re stuck in the transitional age. \nThis article was originally published with the title \"Life Without a Headphone Jack\" Advertisement | ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) David Pogue David Pogue is the anchor columnist for Yahoo Tech and host of several NOVA miniseries on PBS.

      "text": "The move to self-driving cars has got another boost as Apple has acknowledged for the first time that it is building its own autonomous vehicle. According to the BBC, the confirmation for the Cupertino company joining the industry came in a letter to US transport regulators In the letter, Apple says it's \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\". The company also suggested that there are \"significant societal benefits of automated vehicles\" to be realised. Although rumours that Apple is building such a machine have circulated for some time, this is the first time that Apple has said anything to really suggest it could be true – despite having registered several suggestive internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto. An Apple spokesperson said the letter was written by director of product integrity Steve Kenner because the company wants to help define best practice in the industry. The letter includes a request to not introduce too many rules on the testing of self-driving cars and proposes that companies involved in the industry should share data from crashes and near-misses to ensure better designs. However the letter also adds that privacy shouldn't be compromised by this data sharing, saying regulators should \"address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data\". Google's self-driving cars are already being tested on real roads, while Tesla and Ford are also in the process of creating vehicles with driverless technology. The vehicles can be pretty impressive when they perform like they're meant to – but the cars aren't without their problems just yet. entertainment and tech news? @digitalspy Twitter account and you're all set.",

      "text": "South Korean developers complain Apple's iOS app refund terms causing financial problems   07:55 am PT (10:55 am ET) Developers in South Korea are decrying the iOS App Store's refund policy, saying that they are spending an inordinate amount of time cracking down on customers who have claimed to need a refund for an app's purchase by minors, yet are still consuming resources. Several developers are pointing to a rash of app refunds that are causing problems economically and with fair game play, under Apple's state-ordered policy on refunding users with multiple instances of charged content, like expensive consumables. \"By analyzing all payment data and logs, we have tracked down about 300 users who are suspected of abusing App Store's refund policy,\" game developer Flint's CEO Kim Young-mo told the Korea Times . \"We pledge to root out the abusers by requesting the judicial authorities for an investigation.\" Some of the developers have requested Apple's assistance in cracking down. Apple does not provide information on people who demand refunds, and the company acts on the requests without consulting developers. Additionally, the Korea Times claims that there are profitable businesses who will file the refund process for customers, and take a percentage of the refund. \"We are regulating those who abuse the payment process and damage other users under our management policy,\" Korean developer Next Floor said. \"Unlike other application stores, Apple does not provide refund information to the game companies and we are having difficulties in promptly counteracting the problem.\" In 2014, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission ordered Apple to make changes to the iOS App Store policy to allow for post-purchase refunds. As a result, Apple now decides on a case-by-case basis if a user who requests a refund on an app or in-app purchase will get it granted. Appeals to Apple are generally processed within a week, with reports suggesting that multiple, expensive in-app purchases being weighed heavier than a simple one-time app purchase. Topics:",

      "text": "What is the Apple Car? Even Apple doesn’t know. It could take a couple more years before Apple’s direction becomes clear. share Jan Hetfleisch / Getty If Apple’s letter to federal automobile regulators clears up anything, it is that Apple has not given up on its car ambitions. But there is a danger in reading too much into each little step in the process. Just because Apple shuffled things around a couple months ago didn’t mean it was out of the car business. This letter doesn’t mean the Apple Car is now a thing. The smart read, for now, is that Apple remains interested in cars and probably will be for the foreseeable future. And that interest translates to significant investment, hiring and testing of concepts. At the same time, it hasn’t figured out just where or if it will play. Getting into a whole new business will require years of investments, explorations and adjustments. Apple is clearly in that process, though the result is far from certain. That said, here are a few things that are clear: Apple needs a next big thing. It doesn’t have to be the Apple Car, but it has to be something. Iterating on the phone, tablet and computer are find and dandy, but for Apple to justify its market capitalization it needs to enter and grab a significant share of a significant market. Apple can’t take forever to decide if the car is that thing. Even though it's a long game, many companies that are serious about creating the cars of tomorrow are making fairly big and public investments, striking deals and setting deadlines. Also, it matters when it comes to hiring and retaining the best people: Workers want to know they are building a real thing. Just the threat of Apple in the car space is probably a good thing, spurring the entire industry to move faster and smarter. recode_divider",

      "title": "Apple's New Calendar Feature Unleashes Appointment Spammers | PJ Media",
      "text": "When Apple updated their operating system to include automatic searches of your email for appointments, which are then added to your calendar, they assumed automating this process would make life a little bit easier.\nBut spammers are taking advantage of it.\nA rash of customer complaints are pouring in lately because spam emails are including false appointment information, which then show up on your Apple Calendar app as fake appointments. Examples included sales on Ray-Ban sunglasses, Ugg slippers, and financial seminars. On Calendar, they appear with a dialog box on the upper right of the screen, asking if you wish to accept or decline the appointment.\nAnnoying, but the worst part is that declining the appointment sends a notification back to the spammer -- who now knows that your email address is active, and a target for more frequent spam.\nApple has acknowledged the problem, and apologized:\nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.\nThis does not appear to be a problem that will have a simple fix. You know how difficult it is to successfully weed out spam in our email; now that problem has been ported to your calendar.\nThe calendar invitation appears as a result of a setting in your Calendar on iCloud, which syncs your Calendar, Mail, and Contacts among all of your Apple devices.\nThere are two ways to eliminate the problem : you can turn off the in-app notifications; or you can move the spam appointments to a new calendar that you create, and then delete the calendar.\nFor the first solution, go to icloud.com , sign in, and open the Calendar page. Go to the Settings icon in the lower left of the window (the gear icon), choose Preferences, then Advanced, then scroll down to Invitations. Choose the option that sends invites to your email, which deselects the in-app notification option.\nThe second approach: create a new calendar called Spam. When a spam appointment comes in, don't accept it -- just drag it to the Spam calendar.\nThis reveals how difficult it is, even for a firm with the resources of Apple, to develop features that add convenience without creating unintended consequences. As long as bad actors want to get your attention, these artificial intelligence developments can be abused.\nWhen I first was alerted to leave for an appointment by Google, I thought of how amazing it was. On its own, software found an appointment on my calendar, determined where it was, determined where I was located, checked the directions and traffic, and figured out when I needed to leave.\nBut occasionally, I have an appointment for a phone conference that contains an address of one of the attendees, and it will err in assuming the meeting is there, with the accompanying recommendations on traffic and when to leave.\nI also use Tripit, which keeps track of my travel itineraries and sends notifications of check-in times for flights. Recently, it alerted me to a flight I was not scheduled to take: it had found the flight in the body of an email misaddressed to me.\nI hate to imagine what a spammer could do with access to your travel information. With this push to intelligently decipher and automate your life, bad actors could cause more serious havoc as they also get more sophisticated.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/12/05/apples-new-calendar-feature-unleashes-appointment-spammers/",

      "text": "11 Things You Can Do with Siri on Your Mac \nAs time goes on, Apple continues to work Siri into more of its products. Its sole domain used to be the iPhone and iPad, then it found its way onto the Apple Watch and Apple TV. Now, Siri is on the Mac , and there are quite a few cool things it can do. RELATED ARTICLES 15 Things You Can Do with Siri on the Apple Watch \nSiri isn’t just available on any Mac, however—you first need to be running macOS Sierra or higher. You can enable Siri using these instructions —then it’s just a matter of launching Siri from the menu bar, from the Dock, or by pressing Option+Space on your keyboard. RELATED ARTICLE 26 Actually Useful Things You Can Do with Siri \nHere are some of the most useful things you can do with Siri on macOS. We won’t go over every conceivable thing Siri can do, but these are some of the best. Since you can use Siri on iPhone , Apple TV, and Watch, there is a good deal of overlap between all the platforms, but what follows are some of Siri’s more useful tricks. Find Folders and Files \nWant to find a group of folders or files on your hard drive? Siri can make it happen. Granted, you can do this just as well with Spotlight , but it’s pretty useful to be able to just tell your Mac to “Find Word documents created Sunday” or “Find Excel spreadsheets from last month”. \nThe beauty of using Siri to perform Finder operations is that it makes short work of otherwise tedious tasks. RELATED ARTICLE Learn How to Use OS X’s Spotlight Search Like a Champ \nFor example, you can ask Siri to open your Applications folder or to find the spreadsheet you were working on yesterday. Maybe you sent a file to a work colleague and you want to review it with them, simply ask Siri to “Show me the file I sent so-and-so” and it’s right there in front of you. No more awkward “hold on a minute while I find that file” and other delays. Pull Up Important Information About Your Mac \nHere’s a little tip that’s completely Mac-only. You can now ask Siri to tell you things about your computer. For instance, if you want to know your Mac’s serial number or what OS version you have, you only need to ask. \nSure, you could run System Report and search for the needed information, but this is much faster, and more fun. Perform Web and Image Searches \nThis one should seem simple. If it’s on the web (and what isn’t nowadays?), then Siri can search for it. \nWhat else you might wonder? Try asking sports questions such as if your favorite team won, what the score of the game was last night, or player stats (“Which quarterback has the most touchdowns?”). RELATED ARTICLE You Can Drag and Drop Siri Image Results into Other Applications on Your Mac \nYou can also find photos of just about anything. Just ask Siri to “Find photos of iPhones on the Internet” and it will display a list of the top 12 Bing images results. You can even drag those results into other applications . \nIf nothing from these results really strikes your fancy, you can click “See more images in Safari”. \nYou can also ask Siri to find you movie showtimes, show you the latest headline, see the weather in Timbuktu, or search for chocolate chip cookie recipes. Really the only limit is what you ask it. Open Websites \nYou can ask Siri to open websites. Just say, “open howtogeek.com” (what else would you open?) and that’s it. \nThis is particularly useful if you just don’t feel like opening Safari and entering in the URL, because we all have those staggering moments of laziness when we just don’t want to type. Play Music or Find Shows in iTunes \nWant to hear your favorite song by Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones? Just ask Siri to “Play some Led Zeppelin” or “Play Misty Mountain Hop.” \nYou can then control playback by telling Siri things like “Play,”“Pause,” or “Skip.” \nYou can ask Siri to play the radio, or be more specific such as “Play the dubstep station” or even let Siri know you approve (“I like this song”). \nDon’t know what’s playing? Have Siri identify it for you by asking “What song is this?” or “Who sings this song?” After you identify a song, Siri can add it to your wish list or buy it from iTunes. \nSpeaking of iTunes, Siri will let you quickly find and buy your favorite music, TV shows, and movies, so if you’re really into Hitchcock or Game of Thrones, all you need to do is ask Siri to “Find North by Northwest” or “Buy the last season of Game of Thrones.” Do Stuff with Twitter and Facebook \nSome people have no idea what’s going on, and some people are glued to their Twitter feeds all day long. For those in the latter camp, you can ask Siri to show you what’s trending. \nNow you can stay abreast of all the latest Twitter trends without even opening your Twitter client or a web browser. \nThat’s not all however. Why stop at what’s trending on Twitter? Jump into the fray yourself by updating your social media accounts with Siri. \nJust tell Siri to update Twitter or to post to Facebook (that’s about all you can do with Facebook), and it will prompt you for your words of wisdom. You will need to make sure your social media accounts are set up first. \nAlternatively, you can give Siri more direct questions and commands, like “Search Twitter for How-to Geek” or “Find tweets with the hashtag GeekLife” or simply ask it what’s going on in your town or area. Open and Search for Applications \nThis one is as easy as it sounds. If you want to open an application, just tell Siri to do it. For example, “Open Slack” or “Open iTunes”. \nIf you don’t have an application installed, Siri will helpfully offer to search the App Store for you. Read and Compose Emails \nTired of using your eyes and brain to read email? Just have Siri do it for you instead. \nThere are some variations to how Siri reads emails. If you ask it to simply read your emails (“Read my emails”), then it will go through and cover the basics: sender and subject line. You can however, ask Siri to read a message from one specific sender and it will read the whole thing. \nThis is a pretty cool trick allowing you to continue working on something else without interrupting your flow. \nAnd, if you need to dash off a quick message to your boss, you can tell Siri, “Mail Whitson about that really long Siri article” or ask it if you have “Any new email from Lowell today?” Make Reminders, Appointments, and Notes \nApple devices come with a triple productivity threat in the form of Reminders, Appointments, and Notes. \nWhy remember stuff yourself when Siri can remember it for you? Just tell Siri something like “remind me to pick up my dry cleaning tomorrow” and it will dutifully add it to the Reminders app. \nBetter still, Reminders will propagate to your other devices like iPhone and iPad, so no matter where you are or where you go, they’ll always be with you. \nThe same things goes for setting appointments. Just tell Siri something like “Create an event on Wednesday for ‘Lunch at noon with Mom'” and it will add it to your Calendar. \nAnd again, what you add on Mac will appear on your other Apple devices, so there’s no fear of missing out. \nThere’s quite a bit more you can do with Calendar, like moving or rescheduling appointments (“Move my noon meeting to 3pm”), asking for your itinerary (“What does my day look like?”), or even double-checking on specific upcoming meetings (“What’s on my calendar for Tuesday?”). \nOn the Notes side of things, it’s very easy to make little notes about things such as “Note that I paid my water bill”, or “Find my meeting notes”, or “Show my notes from November 23rd.” Notes aren’t complicated, so you should have no problem mastering them. Control OS Settings How to Control System Settings with Siri in macOS Sierra \nThe ability to control macOS with your voice is just one step closer to Star Trek. Well, maybe not that cool, but still pretty cool. There are quite a number of things you can do here, like muting your computer, turning stuff like Bluetooth off and on, dimming the screen, and more. \nYou can also open up various application settings so again, you don’t have to use the keyboard or mouse. Now, features that you’d normally have to click to access are now just a few spoken words away. Find Photos and Create Slideshows \nSiri also comes with some pretty powerful photo chops. In fact, it can do all sorts of things for you. \nFor starters, it can find photos for you such as those of kittens, dogs, people, trees, buildings, and more. It’s not foolproof, but it works pretty well regardless. Our dog search worked pretty well, save the occasional kitty here and there. \nAnother cool feature? You can create quick slideshows . \nLet’s say you want to create a quick slideshow from your recent vacation to Europe or from last summer or the past month. Easy, just tell Siri to “Create a slideshow of my photos from last summer.” Photos will open, gather together the necessary pictures, and start your slideshow. Discover Random Facts and Figures \nThis category is so vast, that it’s impossible to list everything you can possibly ask, but here are some examples: “What’s the square root of 28123?” “How far away is Pluto?” “How high is Mount Kilimanjaro?” “What’s the price of gasoline in Las Vegas?” \nThe point is, instead of always firing up your browser and Googling this stuff, you can just ask Siri! Like searching for stuff on the web, this one is only limited by what you can think to ask. \nThis isn’t all you can ask Siri and you’re encouraged to play around with it. If you want a better idea of all the things Siri on macOS can do, open it and inquire, “What can I ask you?” Siri will respond with a long list of categories that’s sure to give you some great places to start. \nApple clearly wants to make Siri a useful and functional digital assistant, not only on your iPhone, iPad, Watch and TV, but on their flagship operating system as well. \nOf course, this is perfectly logical, and it makes us wonder what took them so long. Granted, folks may not start talking to their computers overnight, but it’s nice to know they can if they want to.

      "text": "The five-page letter in no way states that Apple is interested in building its own vehicles. Kenner focuses the letter on the automated technologies and systems in the vehicles as well as the government policies. (Photo: JOSH EDELSON / AFP/Getty Images) \nApple Inc. believes self-driving vehicles have the potential to “greatly enhance the human experience” — from saving lives to providing new means of transportation.\nThe tech giant’s comments were outlined in a Nov. 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the Obama administration’s proposed self-driving guidelines that call for automakers and technology companies to voluntarily report on testing and safety of autonomous cars to federal regulators before the cars are sold to the public. It marks the first time Apple has publicly shown interest in self-driving technology.\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, wrote to NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind.\n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nThe five-page letter in no way states that Apple is interested in building its own vehicles. Kenner focuses the letter on the automated technologies and systems in the vehicles as well as the government policies.\nKenner commended federal regulators on several parts of the policy, including data sharing and ethical considerations.\nHowever, he asked federal regulators to “amend or clarify” its position on exemptions for testing internal-development vehicles on public roads. Federal regulators would allow already-established car companies to perform controlled tests of automated vehicles on public roadways, while Apple and other newcomers would have to apply for exemptions to conduct testing. Kenner asked that the playing field by leveled: “This would create a fair environment for all companies to make progress toward automated vehicles.”\nKenner also asked for “minor revisions” to the government’s safety assessment protocol: Clarifying if a company needs pre-approval by NHTSA prior to testing automated vehicles; and recommendations on streamlining the safety assessment process if changes to the technologies are made within the four-month evaluation process.\nThe letter was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. It was one of reportedly more than 1,100 letters to NHTSA on the automated vehicle guidelines. Other automotive and tech companies, including General Motors Co. and Google Inc.-parent Alphabet Inc. also submitted opinions.\nmwayland@detroitnews.com \n(313) 222-2504 \nTwitter: @MikeWayland",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Q. The problem of spam in the iCloud calendar seems to be getting worse. Is Apple officially doing anything about it? A. Apple is aware of the current wave of spam messaging showing up as iCloud calendar or photo-sharing invitations. The company released a statement on Nov. 30 that read, “We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.” Photo As a workaround for dumping junk invites without alerting the spammer, you can create a temporary iCloud calendar in iOS to use for the invitations and then delete the temporary calendar. Credit The New York Times Spam has been infiltrating email, text messages, social media and other forms of communications for decades and, as people often do on those mediums, ignoring the unwanted calendar requests is one way of dealing with the situation. But if you find the garbage invitations too annoying as you wait for Apple to isolate and block spammers from abusing its system, you can still use these workarounds. Turning off iCloud Photo Sharing in your iCloud or iOS Photos & Camera settings — at least until Apple gets the spam blockade in place — lets you avoid the photo-sharing spam. To divert invitations to your iCloud mail for easy deletion, log into your iCloud account in your web browser, select Calendar and click the gear-shaped settings icon. Select Preferences, click the Advanced tab and in the Invitations area, switch it to the email option. To dump existing calendar invitations without replying to the spammers, open the Calendar app on your iOS device. Tap Calendars at the bottom of the screen, then the Edit button in the top-left corner. In the iCloud area, select Add Calendar, name it Spam or whatever you’d like and tap Done. Return to the main calendar and select the spam invitation in the Inbox. Under the invitation name, tap Add to Calendar and then pick your new Spam calendar. Return to the main calendar screen, tap the Calendars button and then Edit again. In the iCloud list, tap Spam, scroll down to the bottom to choose Delete Calendar and then confirm your decision to zap the Spam calendar for good. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

      "text": "Read more \n\"Apple has been investing a lot in automotive technology and hiring a lot of top level talent in auto-related artificial intelligence over the past several years, though it has kept the effort secret,\" said Michael Ramsey, a research director at Gartner. \"The company's plans to come to market are still a bit murky, but it is easy to envision an Apple ecosystem in a car, built around the human-machine interface, the personal assistant (Siri), and then the logic that controls the vehicle itself.\" \nSEE: Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust \nWhile Apple has the resources to build its own car, the company's history is that of a designer, not a manufacturer, Ramsey said. If Apple does decide to build its own vehicle, it would make sense for the company to purchase a small car manufacturer, rather than attempt to build its own car company from scratch, as Tesla did. \n\"Apple has a built-in advantage because it has an ecosystem of users already and could tie a user's Apple ID to the vehicle, arranging for identification and payments for rides, loading favorite music or destinations. It's a powerful combination,\" Ramsey said. \"But building a car is incredibly expensive and time consuming, and it would be a huge financial decision for Apple to pull the trigger.\" \nIn the letter, Kenner also said that, when executed properly and in accordance with the guidelines, \"automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience—to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" Kenner wrote in closing. \nShould it begin experimenting with driverless technology, Apple would join companies including Google, Tesla, Uber, and Intel in the autonomous vehicle market —which is not a surprise, according to Bryant Walker Smith, assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina and expert in the autonomous vehicles space. \n\"Companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon want to be ubiquitous in our lives,\" Walker Smith said. \"For better or worse, driving is a big part of many people's lives, so I'm not surprised that Apple is exploring the car as another device or at least as another space. We'll likely see some interesting partnerships in the next few years as companies combine their strengths.\" The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Apple director of product integrity Steve Kenner stated that the company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation in transportation. The letter marks the first time Apple has acknowledged its much-rumored vehicle project, and also offered feedback to the government's recently proposed guidelines for autonomous vehicle technology. While Apple has a large ecosystem of users and could potentially tie a customer's user ID to a connected car, it is also a large financial and manufacturing commitment to build cars from the ground up, experts say.

      "text": "Apple has finally come out and said it: it’s interested in self-driving car technology.\nThe company’s desires to enter the automotive industry are a badly kept secret . But a letter it sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration explains that the company is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” adding that it’s “excited about the potential of automated systems in … transportation.”\nThe letter was sent in response to recently proposed government guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles. Apple seems broadly in favor of what the NHTSA has decided to lay down in its proto-rulebook, though it does raise concerns that automakers and tech companies may be treated differently by regulators when it comes to issues like testing.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook Apple doesn’t make any mention in the letter that it is developing its own car, which fits with recent reports suggesting that the company is instead concentrating its attentions on software . Apple has apparently lost hundreds of members of its automobile team, and has been focusing on developing autonomous driving systems.\nIt’s not alone. Uber has announced that it’s opening a lab dedicated to machine learning , and a large proportion of that will be focused on developing the software required to run autonomous vehicles. And other companies, such as the University of Oxford spin-off Oxbotica , are already working specifically on software.\nStill, it must feel good for Apple to gets its “secret” off its chest. Now we just need to wait and see what comes of it.\n(Read more: Regulations.gov , “ Apple’s Car Plans Are on the Ropes ,” “ U.S. Wants Makers of Driverless Cars to Prove They Are Safe ,” “ How Might Apple Manufacture a Car? ”)",

      "text": "Apple reveals work on self-driving cars By Ali Breland - 12/05/16 10:54 AM EST 0 Apple for the first time has confirmed its interest in self-driving cars, something that has long been rumored. In a letter to regulators, the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant said it is \"investing heavily\" in the new technology, though it offered no further details. ADVERTISEMENT In his letter addressed to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) head Mark Rosekind, Apple director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote that the company “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Though dated Nov. 22, it’s unclear when the letter, first reported on by The Wall Street Journal and other outlets, showed up on the NHTSA’s website. “We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement to reporters. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Apple has been rumored to be at work on an autonomous car project, dubbed Project Titan, for several years, but the company has not publicly acknowledged it. The tech behemoth commended many of NHSTA’s guidelines in their letter, but called for redactions of safety regulations in controlled tests. Apple’s letter comes amid increased attention on from the White House and lawmakers on creating a regulatory framework for autonomous cars. Last month, Rosekind testified before House Energy and Commerce Committee members about proposed self-driving car regulations. Kenner also suggested that Apple may have international ambitions with their project. In his letter, he urged that the NHTSA look abroad to collaborate on regulations with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, G7 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

      "text": "When Apple’s Bozoma Saint John took the stage at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, grooving along to “Rapper’s Delight” while demonstrating the new functions of Apple Music, the couple of thousand gathered at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium strained their necks to take in the 6-foot-1 “badass,” as Twitter declared when her name started trending. Within minutes, BuzzFeed blasted a post titled “Bozoma Saint John Is the Coolest Person to Ever Go Onstage at an Apple Event,” while The Verge proclaimed “Apple’s Bozoma Saint John Is My Hero.” Both noted the significance of the first black woman to present at an Apple event.\nTo hear Saint John, 39, describe the moment, history wasn’t on her mind. In fact, the head of global consumer marketing for iTunes and Apple Music finds the constant preface of “black” and “woman” in articles about her “annoying.” “I am one of the best at what I do,” she says, “regardless of being a woman and being black -- those are benefits!” Thinking back, the engineers stirring in their seats weren’t of much concern to her, either. “The strategy was to talk to the people outside -- those who are going to be watching in their office or on the phone, the people on social media,” she says. “They need to feel like their best girlfriend just told them about this cool new thing. It needed to feel fun because that’s what the ­experience of music is. So when no one [in the room] was really going along with the lyrics, it wasn’t scary because I could hear the roar of the crowd outside. I know they’re jamming.”\nRead more: Women In Music 2016: The 100 Most Powerful Executives\nThat Saint John was chosen to represent the streaming service, undergoing days of script doctoring and intense run-throughs under the watchful eye of Apple CEO Tim Cook , is a testament to her influence on the $596 billion tech giant. She joined the company through Beats, which Apple acquired three months after she started working there in 2014. Says Jimmy Iovine , who hired her: “She’s a force of nature. She walks it. She talks it. She knows what’s going on, whether it’s fashion, music, sports... That’s what attracted me to her. I didn’t need a technology person; I needed someone to sell a streaming service. And if she could sell me, she could sell anybody.”\nQuickly upstreamed to head up music marketing efforts, Saint John was soon stewarding such buzzy campaigns as the ad featuring Taylor Swift ’s workout wipeout to Drake and Future ’s “Jumpman” (followed six months later with a commercial showing Drake pumping iron to Swift’s “Bad Blood”), and another starring Mary J. Blige , Kerry Washington and Taraji P. Henson and directed by Ava DuVernay , which premiered on Emmys night in 2015. In the latter, the ladies played themselves, trading music notes through which consumers could be introduced to the playlist concept. The clip became a social media sensation, prompting conversations about race and gender and helping drive subscribers to Apple Music -- 17 million of them, as last reported by the company in September.\n“Talk about black girl magic,” says Saint John. “Marketers sometimes get caught in this lie that you must talk to people only in the voice that they recognize. So if you’re a 35-year-old white woman, I must speak to you as a 35-year-old white woman. And that is not true. Mary J. Blige can talk to you, and we’ve proved it. This wasn’t just about music, or even about Apple Music, it was about the greater conversation in our world. All of this divisiveness is not real. You have a bunch of girlfriends that you hang out with. You listen to music and talk about the good old days. That is a universal truth.”\nA native of Ghana who moved to Colorado Springs, Colo., at 13, Saint John has been an observer of pop culture for as long as she can remember. “I consumed it like I was getting a Ph.D. -- it was survival,” she says of her teenage years. “No one would talk to me. I was the outsider, so it was born out of necessity, to see what people were doing, thinking, saying -- anything that would give me clues as to how to behave or engage.”\nSaint John first entered the marketing and advertising world through Spike Lee’s firm, Spike DDB. It was there that her relationship with Beyoncé was forged (through a 2002 Pepsi commercial), eventually developing into a decade of collaborations that hit its apex during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, when, as head of music and entertainment marketing for Pepsi, Saint John played a key role in securing the singer for the halftime show.\nBut Saint John’s career high came with a personal low that same year, when her husband, Peter Saint John, an advertising producer, died of cancer. She relocated from New York to Los Angeles with her daughter, now 7, to join Beats. “It was a time for reinvention,” she says. “There was all kinds of trepidation and things that could go wrong, but there was no better place to be.”\nIndeed, seeing Saint John sass late-night host James Corden alongside Apple senior vp Internet software and services Eddy Cue in a September ad for Apple Music (watch below), you get the sense that this is a woman who feels at home not just in the Culver City complex that serves as Apple’s Los Angeles headquarters, but in the male-dominated culture of Silicon Valley. “Boz doesn’t get intimidated,” says Iovine. “She wants to learn. If there’s something she doesn’t know, she’ll say, ‘I don’t understand that, but this is what you want it to feel like.’ ”\nSaint John, who confesses that she’s still easily marketed to -- “I’m single-handedly responsible for keeping the nail polish business alive -- Sally Hansen owes me something,” she cracks -- considers the collective’s role as “pioneers. We’re cutting down forests and trying to look through the trees,” she says of the Apple Music executive team, which also includes Larry Jackson and Robert Kondrk (Saint John reports to head of marketing Jon Gieselman ). “We’re trying to transform something that seems complex and scary into the most exciting and inviting party you’ve ever been to, and you'd be a fool to miss out.”\nHer role in the greater Apple universe also ties into that sense of inclusion. \"This a matrix organization, and everyone depends on the other in order to make it successful,\" Saint John explains. \"It's not necessarily about who you report to but what it is that you do to contribute. And that's the way that we really look at it. Everyone has a core responsibility [and a] core strength.\"\nStill, the tech industry is behind the curve when it comes to diversity (some 71 percent of Silicon Valley is male and 60 percent white), and it’s a burden that Saint John feels she must carry personally. “When I meet with Tim Cook, I don’t say, ‘How are you making diversity happen here?’ I’m responsible for who I hire and who I partner with, be it agencies, media companies or artists,” says Saint John, who oversees some 50 staffers. “When bringing on new employees, I challenge people to look for someone who is nothing like them.”\nAnd of other powerful women in the tech industry and beyond, Saint John calls Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer , whom she has never met, \"awesome,\" telling Billboard , “No one is perfect, but hell she made it and I cheer her on.” Her description of Michelle Obama , with whom she has spent time: “Home girl is straight-up gracious and an amazing woman.\" Queen Bey, meanwhile, is her guiding light when it comes to the board room. Says Saint John with a laugh: “I walk in with my Beyoncé warrior face on.”\nWatch Bozoma Saint John talk about her move from Pepsi to Beats 1 to Apple Music: \"I run toward danger.\"",

      "text": "Apple’s risky business: Redesigning iPhone a bold move Jessica Van Sack Monday, December 05, 2016 Credit: AP (File) Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at an event to announce new products at Apple headquarters, Monday, March 21, 2016, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) comments For the first time since the Steve Jobs era, Apple is taking a big risk.\nEvidence is mounting that the next iPhone will be radically redesigned, with edge-to-edge glass that is curved, free of bezels and without any buttons — a tribute to all things minimalist and sleek.\nThe iPhone overhaul will mark a decade since Apple launched the first model. It will also for the first time feature an OLED display, catching up to competitors that have already moved to the more expensive screen, according to a leaked document from analysts at Barclays and public statements from the president of LCD-supplier Sharp.\nIronically, it may be Apple competitor Samsung, maker of the popular Galaxy series of Android phones, that is the primary supplier of Apple’s new OLED screens, meaning the company is likely to see a serious windfall from the release of a rival device. A redesigned iPhone is likely to stress Asian supply chains to new lengths, meaning Apple will be forced to ramp up screen production at several manufacturing plants at once.\nThe all-glass iPhone carries some meaning to Apple devotees. Apple’s chief design officer, Jony Ive, has for years campaigned for an iPhone that looks like a single sheet of glass. Designing the anniversary iPhone edition around Ive’s aspirations is a fitting hat-tip to the iconic contributions of Apple’s original iPhone designer. It’s also a nod to Jobs, whose spartan design sensibilities have been missed by many during the current reign of Apple CEO Tim Cook. Although Jobs seemed to stubbornly favor form over function, Cook has been more apt to break with that tradition in order to drive market share and keep up with the competition.\nApple always tests several models of iPhones before deciding which one to release, so don’t fall into the click-bait-driven, faux-news hype that Apple is testing up to 10 new models of the next iPhone. Those stories have been all over Facebook for days, and they’re dishonest. Apple has dozens of devices from dozens of projects that have never seen the light of day. Every redesigned iPhone leaves some on the cutting room floor. This next model will be no different.\nThat brings me to one interesting and farther-fetched possibility: that Apple is also testing a foldable OLED smartphone that would clip onto clothes and belts.\nIt may seem like a throwback to flip phones and BlackBerrys — and it is. It’s almost too cute. But Apple was recently granted a patent for this type of clamshell design, which would rely on a center hinge formed by carbon nanotubes.\nThe approved patent shows an all-glass body that folds like a notebook. It would be a clever anniversary idea to rethink something that is bygone but also the reason we travel with wireless phones at all times. If people are willing to buy a smartwatch, they’re likely going to take a look at a flip phone for today’s lifestyle. We’re all sick of our display screens cracking and not being able to fit our phones in our pockets anyway. At least in terms of form and convenience, feature phones had their benefits. I never had to pay $100 for a new screen on one of those.\nI have a theory about all of these leaked iPhone 8 reports, and that is that they’re a welcome distraction from some giant failures related to the iPhone 7. Remember AirPods — the weird, wireless earbuds that look like something is dangling from your ear? They were the reason the iPhone 7 didn’t include a headphone jack. We were supposed to get something better — a cord-free world of Bluetooth listening — in the form of AirPods being released in late October.\nOver a month later, and no AirPods. You can’t even pre-order them on Apple’s website. Instead of writing about the inglorious failure that is this product which resulted in inconvenienced iPhone 7 users, all people want to talk about is the anniversary edition of the iPhone, nearly a year away from being released.\nApple, you win again.",

      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple has finally come out and said it: it’s interested in self-driving car technology.\nThe company’s desires to enter the automotive industry are a badly kept secret . But a letter it sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration explains that the company is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” adding that it’s “excited about the potential of automated systems in … transportation.”\nThe letter was sent in response to recently proposed government guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles. Apple seems broadly in favor of what the NHTSA has decided to lay down in its proto-rulebook, though it does raise concerns that automakers and tech companies may be treated differently by regulators when it comes to issues like testing.\nApple doesn’t make any mention in the letter that it is developing its own car, which fits with recent reports suggesting that the company is instead concentrating its attentions on software . Apple has apparently lost hundreds of members of its automobile team, and has been focusing on developing autonomous driving systems.\nIt’s not alone. Uber has announced that it’s opening a lab dedicated to machine learning , and a large proportion of that will be focused on developing the software required to run autonomous vehicles. And other companies, such as the University of Oxford spin-off Oxbotica , are already working specifically on software.\nStill, it must feel good for Apple to gets its “secret” off its chest. Now we just need to wait and see what comes of it.\n(Read more: Regulations.gov , “ Apple’s Car Plans Are on the Ropes ,” “ U.S. Wants Makers of Driverless Cars to Prove They Are Safe ,” “ How Might Apple Manufacture a Car? ”)",

      "text": "Summary \nApple expects to generate $76 ~ $78 billion in net revenue in its first quarter of 2017. \nNet sales in 2016 declined by 8% due to fewer iPhone sales and weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. \nThere is a 96% chances of a rate hike at the Fed's Dec. 13-14 meeting. \nThe company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. \nThis article takes a macro view, particularly with interest rate hikes and the US dollar versus foreign currencies as these things will affect Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earnings on a fundamental level. This article also covers the company's financial and operational performance and forecast. \nRate hike will affect Apple's earnings. \nThere is a 95% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December 13-14 meeting, according to Reuters. The U.S. dollar has been steadily gaining ground, and an interest rate hike would force it higher still, while weakening other currencies. Apple would see a sizable foreign-currency sales hit in its earnings. The company said in its latest 10-K filing that their net sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion for 2016. This has been primarily driven by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and its YOY decrease in iPhone net sales. \nWithin a year, common currencies such as China's Yuan have fallen by about 12% against the US dollar, while the English Pound is down by about 31%. In light of an almost certain interest rate hike, Apple will likely post poor earnings due to the weakening of foreign currencies. If the company doesn't buy back its own shares, its dividends will also be negatively affected. \nRegarding foreign currency risk , the company said in its SEC filing as follows: \nChanges in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \nSource: Fxtop (notation was added by author) \nSource: Fxtop (notation was added by author) \nSource: Fxtop (notation was added by author) \nApple's reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Created by Author \nFinancial and Operational Performance and Forecast: \nShareholders' Value: Apple has been paying higher dividends year-over-year, creating shareholders' value by generating higher revenue growth. The company returned more than $47 billion to shareholders through dividends. \nClick to enlarge \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Apple Annual Report 2016 \nThe above chart shows that if you had invested $100 in 2011 it is worth about $213 in September 2016, which is about a 113% gain. \nRegarding earnings guidance, according to the Harvard Business Review : \nDo not manage earnings or provide earnings guidance. The companies that fail to embrace this first principle of shareholder value will almost certainly be unable to follow the rest. \nRevenue: From 2012 ~ 2015, Apple generated net revenue at the rate of 9% ~ 28%. \nNet Revenue by Operating Segment: Americas: net revenue decreased by 8% Greater China: net revenue decreased by 17% Europe and rest of the Asia Pacific: net revenue decreased by 1% and 10% Japan : net revenue increased by 10% \nOverall, the total revenue for 2016 has decreased by 8% from 2015's revenue . \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Apple 2016 Annual Report \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Created by Author \nShares Repurchase: Apple has been aggressively buying back its own shares from the marketplace. In the last four years, the company re-purchased $133 billion worth of shares. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Apple 2016 Annual Report \nShares re-purchases show the company believes its shares are undervalued. Because a share re-purchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it increases earnings per share and elevates the market value of the remaining shares. \nOperational efficiency: From 2012 to 2016, Apple's net income generated has been inconsistent. In 2014 and 2015, they generated net income at the rate of 7% ~ 21%, while net income decreased by 11 ~ 14% in 2013 and 2016. \nLiquidity: The company maintains a healthy cash position: about $21 billion - cash and cash equivalents. \nValuation: The company is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 13.23, $110 a share. This means that investors are willing to pay $13.23 for every dollar of earnings that Apple has. As of the third quarter, the average P/E ratio of the computer hardware industry is 13.25 , according to CSI Market. The stock is currently fairly valued. \nP/E ratio = Price per share / earnings per share \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Created by Author \n2017 Q1 Guidance: Apple expects to generate net revenue of $76 ~ 78 billion while the company generated about $76 billion in net revenue in Q1 2015. \nConclusion: \nInterest rates, the USD and exchanges rates are interlinked. As mentioned in the company's SEC filing, net sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iPhone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar . With a 95% chance of an interest rate hike this December, the USD will strengthen further while other currencies weaken and when this happens Apple will see a sizable foreign-currency sales hit in its earnings. With these macro environment factors and very intense smartphone competition, the company may not able to meet its Q1 2017 guidance of $76 to 78 billion in net revenue. \nThe chart below shows that Apple iPhone sales worldwide spiked on two occasions, Q1 2015 and Q1 2016. It is unlikely that there will be another spike in its iPhone sales in Q1 2017 as Apple and Samsung have been constantly losing their market share. Read my previous article \" smartphone prices will collapse soon .\" \nClick to enlarge \nGreater China (includes Hong Kong and Taiwan) and Europe (includes India, Middle East and Africa) remains a crucial key to Apple's profit-driving machine and its market share. The combined market share of those segments are about 46%. \nBased on my analysis, I recommend Apple as a SELL. The stock is currently trading at closer to all time high. I would stick with the basic principal of stock investment, buy low and sell high. \nHere are the ETFs with major exposure to Apple: iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: IYW ), Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLK ), Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (NYSEARCA: FTEC ), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: VGT ), iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Technology ETF (BATS: TCHF ), iShares Global Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IXN ), Recon Capital NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ: QYLD ), PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ), iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA: JKD ), iShares North American Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IGM ); First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NASDAQ: TDIV ); Vanguard Mega (NYSEARCA: MGK ); iShares Russell (NYSEARCA: IWY ); Fidelity Nasdaq (NASDAQ: ONEQ ); iShares Global (NYSEARCA: IOO ); SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPYG ); Vanguard S&P (NYSEARCA: IVW ) Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Trump’s tax holiday actually may not go to plan. How will Apple, Microsoft, and others spend their offshore money?\nA corporate share buyback and dividend binge could be on the horizon.\nChasing stocks is for chumps.\n\nThe stock market has significantly risen since President-elect Donald Trump won the Oval Office. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had another record close on Black Friday. Markets are reacting positively to pre-election promises and policies that Trump touted in almost every rally speech.\nThere's expectations that Trump will overhaul financial regulations like Dodd-Frank (clear positive for large banks), increase infrastructure spending, cut corporate taxes, and boost the nation's manufacturing sector. So what we're seeing is a number of \"Trump trades\" or bets on companies in industries projected to perform well under a Trump presidency.\nTrump wants to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15% in an effort to keep U.S. companies from leaving for countries with lower tax rates. This should be generally positive for U.S. equity markets and capital investment. The one piece of proposed legislation that interests me is the one-off repatriation tax holiday at a 10% tax rate. This will give U.S. multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) the chance to repatriate trillions of dollars in cash stockpiled overseas.\nAccording to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, there's about $2.6 trillion in profits parked overseas in tax haven subsidiaries (source: Bloomberg ).\nApple will be a real beneficiary of any tax holiday, as would Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and many other U.S. tech companies. The top 10 largest tech companies have more than half a trillion dollars overseas. Today, Apple and Microsoft's offshore cash represents 36.3% and 23.4% of their respective market values. Pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), and Merck (NYSE: MRK ) have plenty of cash overseas as well.\nThe chart below shows the top 5 U.S. companies with the most offshore cash (source: Bloomberg). Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet   )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher interest rates increase net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality.

Contributor, Macworld | Dec 5, 2016 4:25 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nA reader asks: \n“I got a used iPod touch recently, and everything seems fine except that when I attempt to log into iTunes, the previous owner’s Apple ID pops-up and it requests a password. How can I get rid of this so that I can use my own Apple ID?” \nApple’s iOS devices—including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch lineups—use a security feature called Activation Lock that’s designed to keep anyone else from using your device in case it is lost or stolen. While this is a great anti-theft feature, it can make things very difficult if a device’s former owner is intentionally rehoming it. \nIf the Find my iPhone/Find my iPod feature was enabled—which is part of the Activation Lock process—Apple stores a device’s serial number along with the Apple ID in their database. Even after a clean restore, the device will register with Apple’s database and see the feature is enabled based on the serial number of the device. An Apple store can bypass this, but they are unlikely to do so unless you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you own the device. Often, they’ll just turn you away and say they can’t do it. \nThe absolute best way to fix this is to reach out to the previous owner and have them remove the device from their Apple ID. They can do this by entering their password on the Activation Lock screen, or by accessing iCloud. Here’s what the previous owner should do if they opt for the iCloud reset: Sign in to iCloud.com Go to Find My iPhone Select “All Devices” to open a list of devices linked to their account, and select the device to be removed Click “Remove from Account” \nAfter the previous owner removes the device, then you should turn the device off and turn it back on again to set up the device as new. \nIf you cannot reach the previous owner, you may be out of luck—or, if the person you bought this device from cannot or will not do this for you, it is possible that you have bought a stolen device and are in possession of stolen property. \nThis is a good reminder to anyone who wants to pass on an old device: Make sure you follow the proper steps to avoid this dilemma. \nFor more on iOS security:",

      "title": "Apple confirms rumored interest in self-driving cars in letter to regulators",
      "text": "Apple has finally confirmed its interest in self-driving cars through a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\nThe letter, written by Apple’s director of product integrity Steven Kenner, said the company is “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation” and said there are “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles.”\nSee Also: Apple in talks with suppliers to build augmented reality glasses \nApple also called for the regulator to not introduce too many rules that would harm the emerging industry. It made particular reference to newcomers in the automotive industry being blocked from entering, something Apple does not want to happen.\n\nApple’s worst kept secret It is the first public recognition from Apple of its self-driving plans, which is great considering it may be one of the worst kept secrets in Silicon Valley. Their driverless car efforts have allegedly been on the go for more than two years according to sources close to the company.\nIn fact, their hidden efforts have attracted competitive attention. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, slammed the iPhone giant earlier this year for poaching talent from his company to work on the secretive automotive project.\nDetails of Apple’s car are still under wraps and we expect it to stay that way for a few years, as the company continues to acquire more talent, engineers , and partners. Rumors suggest that the company may take more of a software approach to the self-driving project, leaving the hardware and manufacturing to an automotive partner.\nApple may find itself far behind some of the other players in the industry, if it takes too long to launch its autonomous car. Tesla already has thousands of AutoPilot testers, Google has driven over one million miles autonomously, and most automotive companies are pushing their own programs in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.\nThe post Apple confirms rumored interest in self-driving cars in letter to regulators appeared first on ReadWrite .\n",

By Michael Birnbaum October 31 Follow @michaelbirnbaum \nBRUSSELS — In a year of surging anger about the modern globalized economy, one woman may be the best equipped to defuse tensions — and she does her work from a sprawling bureaucratic office building in the heart of Brussels. \nMore than almost anyone else in the 500-million-person league that is the European Union, Margrethe Vestager, the E.U. official in charge of competition, has the ability to shape perceptions of an institution that is under attack as never before. As angry voters take to the polls on both sides of the Atlantic amid a surging feeling that the system is rigged, the Dane’s mission is to ensure that the little guy has a chance against vast multinational companies. \nBecause the European Union is the largest economic bloc in the world, Vestager’s investigations touch powerful players across the globe. She has taken on Google and the Kremlin, and just slapped Apple with a gargantuan fine . She has McDonald’s and Facebook in her crosshairs. And she does it all while knitting toy elephants that she bestows on rivals and allies alike. [ How the E.U.’s ruling on Apple explains why Brexit happened ] \nIf she is successful, her efforts could reverberate across Europe, delivering a tough message that Brussels is able to deliver concrete benefits to citizens. But if she overreaches, she could be seen as just another unelected bureaucrat dictating terms to nations trapped within a union that increasingly is seen as causing more strife than comfort. E.U. antitrust regulators order Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in taxes plus interest to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. (Reuters) \n“The benefits of globalization do not trickle down automatically,” Vestager said in an interview in her brightly decorated office. “It takes politics to make sure that there is a benefit.” \nVestager’s highest-profile judgment came in late summer, when she announced that Apple had improperly avoided $14.2 billion in payments to Ireland based on a years-long tax deal. The company denies any wrongdoing and plans to appeal. \nThe decision has also come under heavy criticism from the Obama administration, which says that Vestager is twisting competition law and impounding tax revenue that the United States sees as its own. \nVestager “appears to be adopting an entirely new legal theory and applying it retroactively in a broad and sweeping manner,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote this year. [ U.S. raises concerns over European tax probe involving American companies ] \nAnd the Irish government worries that the ruling could upend the country’s business model, which has attracted investment in recent years by offering a low-tax, English-speaking home for businesses that want a European toehold. \nBut the announcement — timed in part to dominate the news as Europe returned from its languorous August holidays — sent a message to ordinary Europeans that powerful companies would not be able to negotiate sweetheart tax deals out of reach of normal citizens. In an era in which blockbuster international trade deals are under fire from opponents who say they neglect all but the strongest business interests, the investigation could make voters sit up and take notice. Margrethe Vestager. (Jasper Juinen) \n“Vestager has a strong will to go after these cases,” said Georgios Petropoulos, an expert on the topic at Bruegel, a Brussels-based policy think tank. “She’s not afraid of these big multinationals.” \nThe crossfire has not fazed Vestager, a veteran of political power plays in her native Denmark who helped inspire the main character in the hit TV show “Borgen,” her nation’s version of “House of Cards.” \n“If my tax rate went down from 0.05 percent to 0.005 percent, I should have felt maybe I should have had a second look at my tax bill,” Vestager said at a combative news conference in which she announced the Apple ruling. ‘Follow the rules’ \nVestager, 48, was Denmark’s deputy prime minister and economy minister before arriving in Brussels in late 2014 as the competition commissioner. She is one of 28 E.U. cardinals whose rank is approximately equal to that of a U.S. Cabinet secretary. Her office is unusually powerful inside the E.U., which typically shares regulatory responsibilities between national governments and Brussels. In the field of competition, however, E.U. regulators have unparalleled powers to enforce bloc-wide rules, meaning they can challenge nations and companies and serve as a rare example of the E.U. delivering concrete benefits to citizens. \n“Antitrust is really very special in the commission’s having important powers of decision where it doesn’t have to refer back to national governments,” said Alec Burnside, a managing partner at the Brussels office of the Cadwalader law firm, who focuses on E.U. competition issues. [ Europe’s cash grab from Apple makes corporate tax reform more urgent ] \nVestager shies away from lofty notions about saving the European Union, preferring to focus on the more concrete tasks of her portfolio. \n“It’s not in my mission to work against Euroskepticism; it’s my mission to work for fair markets,” she said. But she boils down her sometimes dry, technical work into elemental terms that connect easily with ordinary voters. “In antitrust, what is at stake is in some ways as old as Adam and Eve, because it is about greed, to get more,” she said. \n“Few people think about politics every day,” she said. “But they are in the market every day” — either by working at a job or buying vegetables at the grocery store. \nThe daughter of two Lutheran pastors, Vestager grew up in a small town in Denmark’s flatlands. She has said a defining memory of her childhood was the sound of cars rolling up the driveway at all hours of the day, as guests came to ask for help. She tried to preserve that focus on listening to others when she entered politics in her 20s. \nBut listening to others does not mean agreeing with them, and many who have tangled with her say that she is steely once she has made up her mind. On a coffee table in her Brussels office is a cast of a hand with an upraised middle finger, which was given to her by a group of Danish unions enraged by her efforts to curb unemployment benefits. She says she keeps it as a reminder that political decisions will inevitably upset some people. \nThose who have worked with her say that her style comes from her experience leading a niche pro-Europe political party, the centrist Social Liberals, in Denmark’s fragmented political system. [ A tax loophole for U.S. companies operating overseas just got tighter ] \nIn such a party, which typically focuses on a few pet issues, “your job is not to persuade the majority of the people to do something specific,” said Henrik Kjerrumgaard, one of Vestager’s advisers when she was in Danish government. “You can allow yourself to say things that make people angry. Because when someone gets angry, you know you’ve communicated with them in a pure and direct way.” \nThat no-nonsense style may be helping to shift opinions in some Euroskeptic countries — beginning with Vestager’s own. Denmark is famously skittish about handing power to Brussels, and much like Britain, it agreed to join the European Union only if it was allowed to opt out of a host of issues. \nAfter British voters made the startling decision in June to leave the European Union, many looked at Denmark as a possible next candidate for a departure. Instead, the desire to leave the European Union has decreased, according to opinion polls. \nPart of that is due to Vestager’s work, observers say. \n“A lot of people who didn’t like her while she was in Denmark like her now because they say, ‘Wow, she’s doing what people think the E.U. should do,’ ” said Elisabet Svane, a Danish political journalist who wrote a biography of Vestager. “It’s quite practical. She’s saying: ‘You’re not following the rules? Follow the rules.’ A lot of E.U. policy is out in the skies, and this is very down-to-earth.” \n“She’s doing more good for the European Union now in Denmark than if she had still been in Denmark,” Svane said.

      "title": "What Tim Cook really said about Apple Watch - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook — presumably reacting to a negative report about Apple Watch sales — fired up his email Monday to say the company is stocking shelves better than ever.\nBut that was the only significant data point provided to Reuters in his statement, dedicated to driving home the message that “Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week.” The record was not for unit sales or revenue, though, it was for “sell-through.”\n“During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history,” the CEO said.\nSell-through measures sales against how much product was shipped, a favorite of operating execs like former COO Cook. Record sell-through means Apple AAPL, -0.72% sold the highest percentage of smartwatches that were sent to stores.\nIn the rest of his statement, Cook failed to give any other confirmable figures on the product’s sales performance: “Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts” and “sales growth is off the charts,” he wrote.\nCook does sign off by predicting another Apple Watch record, of some sort.\n“As we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” Cook said.\nCatch the vagueness of that “forecast”? “Best quarter ever” could be accomplished through many different metrics — unit sales, revenue, profitability, or maybe even sell-through.\nThis type of crowing about sales while providing little to no actual sales data is typical of the tech industry. For instance, see Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, +2.57% announcement of “a record-breaking Cyber Monday with Amazon device sales,” a release that — like Amazon’s earnings reports — does not disclose actual sales of Amazon devices.\nApple’s inventory-management skills deserve praise, especially in this holiday season of production issues from GoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.41% and Fitbit Inc. FIT, -1.35% But Cook’s verbal gymnastics continue a pattern of concealing data about the only major product category to debut under his leadership .\nBecause Apple withholds its sales figures, investors must rely on third-party analysis firms like IDC, which happened to release data on the same day as Cook’s email. The IDC research showed Apple Watch shipments declining 71% year-over-year .\nApple began selling the Watch in spring of 2015, with hopes for revenue to complement the mighty iPhone. By IDC’s figures, Apple shipped 3.9 million smartwatches in the third quarter of 2015, leading into its holiday-shopping debut. Shipments were 1.1 million in the third quarter of this year, with the Series 2 watch starting to sell toward the end of that period.\nThat drastic decline in shipments would have led to a lot fewer Watches in Apple Stores. But it could help deliver a much better sell-through rate.\nApple’s stock fell 0.7% to $109.11 Monday, after the IDC report was released but before Cook’s statement was revealed Monday evening.\nThe company’s shares are up 3.7% on the year, less than the 10.3% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.24% , which includes Apple as a component, and 7.9% advance for the S&P 500. SPX, +0.58%\nMore from MarketWatch How Jill Stein's Election Recount Efforts Could Play Out Snapchat Spectacles Review: The Dos and Don’ts Amazon takes on tech’s white whale: Grocery shopping",

      "text": "When Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro lineup in October, the company made it clear that these machines are meant for so-called “creatives,” or people working in design, advertising, music, and so on. The standout feature is a new interface called the Touch Bar, a touchscreen panel that sits above the keyboard and changes functions based on what software is running at a given moment.\nThe day before Apple introduced its latest high-powered laptops, Microsoft unveiled new hardware of its own: A revamped Surface Book laptop and the new Microsoft Studio, a touchscreen desktop also designed for “creatives.”\nBoth companies’ new machines are priced at the high end of the market, further cementing the fact that they’re for professionals, not everyday users. Taken together, Apple and Microsoft’s latest computers remind me of something the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs said while introducing the iPad in 2010. Jobs believed that PCs are like trucks designed for specific uses, but the iPad and tablets in general are more like everyday cars — and that’s where the growth will be.\nAlthough I believe Apple will always make Macs, which represent about 12% of its quarterly revenue, it’s the iPad that’s more vital for Apple’s vision of computing’s future. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook was a disciple of Jobs, learning a great deal from him. We’re now seeing Cook use Jobs’ playbook more aggressively as he encourages many users to move from Macs to the iPad lineup and its mobile operating system, iOS. Apple’s desktop-and-laptop macOS software will always be important, but as Jobs believed, PCs will increasingly be tools for professionals and creatives rather than everyday computer users. .\nFor some time, many people thought Apple might merge macOS and iOS. But it seems clear to me that this will not be the case. Instead, I believe macOS will be pushed to those who need the Mac as a “truck” while iOS will evolve to become Apple’s mainstream computing software in the form of iPads. Over the last five years, Apple has developed a serious services business that now brings in upwards of $20 billion a year. While macOS contributes to some of these services earnings, I venture to guess that iOS accounts for at least 80% of that services revenue, making it even more critical to Apple’s financial future.\nFor more about Apple, watch:\nKeeping two separate operating systems makes sense for Apple, enabling the company to offer a more basic and approachable OS for mobile users, with more powerful software for pro buyers. Still, I believe both everyday consumers and business users will embrace so-called “2-in-1” computers, which can function as both a tablet and a laptop-with-keyboard. These machines offer highly versatile computing experiences, giving users better options for access to all types of apps and services. Given that, I believe iOS will be more important to Apple’s future than its desktop cousin, macOS.\nTim Bajarin is recognized as one of the leading industry consultants, analysts and futurists, covering the field of personal computers and consumer technology.

But as the scene unfolds, we realize that it's all happening on stage, instead.\nThe ad ends with the tagline: \" Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.\"\nSEE ALSO: Yeah, the iPhone 7 is boring, but who cares? I still love it.\nDo they, really? You can check out our review of the iPhone 7's camera here — the phone carries a 12-megapixel shooter with optical image stabilization, and it's definitely one of the best cameras around, especially in low-light settings (as depicted in the ad).\nAlthough not as dramatic as last month's \" Dive ,\" the new ad follows Apple's recent practice of focusing on one particular feature in its advertisements.\nThen, it was the speakers; two weeks ago it was the microphone , and now the video recording. Aptly for the holiday season, the latest batch of ads goes for the feels, and Apple's marketing folk are expert tearjerker-crafters.\nBONUS: This smart mirror is actually a giant iPhone",

      "text": "  05:07 AM EST Movie Box is the leading mobile movie streaming app for Apple and Android devices. \nMiami, FL— As one of the best free movie apps on iOS and Android, Movie Box stands above its competitors for all streaming services offered. Unlike most movie streaming providers, they give their customers the option to view movies offline as well as online. In clear high definition, movies are pushed straight to any mobile device, tablet or phone, enabling any user to enjoy their favorite film easily, for free. \nIn today’s oversaturated online market, it’s difficult to determine what is the best available app for all things streaming. Apple and Android app stores offer customers many options, but most the applicable apps don’t offer their services with consistency and quality. The bulk of the apps out there don’t give their user base the choice to watch their favorite pastime shows and movies without an internet connection, taking away from the main convenience factor of on-the-go. Without providing all avenues of convenience to customers, these apps only sever themselves from a large amount of potential users who would utilize their services. \nThis issue of oversaturation without any clear dominance in features only confuses customers further. But, unlike many companies out there they seek to address many of the problems in one inclusive app. Though, available outside the typical app store, once installation has been completed, the features offered are as plentiful as the top grossing competitor, but without the drawbacks. They make positive to include all the favorites in movies, to television, and even ensure they are accessible offline from local storage when streaming is unavailable. \nCovering all avenues, they establish their authority as a leading competitor with high definition television and movies at the convenience of any mobile device on the latest Android and iOS platforms. Exclusive films are also readily available, and they offer it up as a free service, allowing users to enjoy their favorite entertainment unimpeded from anywhere. \n“MovieBox is a completely free application that is available for iOS and Android devices. You can not only watch your favorite movie content in High Definition Quality, but also get them downloaded into your device — for offline access,” said a company spokesperson. \nThe website, https://downloadmovieboxapp.com , strives to accomplish what the competition will not, by not excluding various conveniences, because for them it’s all about the user base and fulfilling their desires for endless entertainment. This conscious effort saves customers countless hours fiddling with finding the best mobile streaming service, allowing them to sit back and relax with all the necessary features to allow unlimited immersion into entertainment. It’s this attitude that has brought people back to use their services and continues to attract new users through recommendations. \nContact Name: Movie Box",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple could be about to ditch Intel from the iPhone 8 Apple could be about to ditch Intel from the iPhone 8 Read Comments \nRoll up, roll up. It’s a new day and that means a new iPhone 8 rumour. \nOn today’s menu, we've got claims that Apple could be getting ready to drop Intel as a parts supplier for its next flagship phone. \nWhy? Well for the iPhone 7 Apple used a combination of Intel and Qualcomm supplied modems, although the Qualcomm units had to be throttled to create an even user experience as the Intel chips couldn’t keep up. \nNow, North Capital Markets’s industry analyst, Tom Sepenzis, has claimed Intel’s inability to catch up to Qualcomm is forcing Apple to rethink its partnership. \nRelated: Annoying iPhone 7 problems \n“There have been several reports over the past month that have compared the speeds associated with both the INTC and QCOM modems in their respective iPhone models, with INTC coming up short,” he wrote in a letter to investors. \n“While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices.” \nHe added: “This should give QCOM a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer.” \nWhat’s more, according to Sepenzis, Intel is some way from creating a comparable unit that it can supply for next-generation iPhone handsets. \nJust the latest in a long line of recent iPhone 8 rumours, past reports have suggested the tenth anniversary iPhone will play host to everything from a new, all-glass design to a curved form factor with improved cameras and a faster processor. \nWATCH: iPhone 7 vs 7 Plus \nWhat would you like to see on the iPhone 8?

      "text": "\nIt’s been an interesting year for Apple to say the least. The launch of the iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have proven to be successful, if not divisive products. It’s also been the year Apple dove head-first into the dongle life; a not so popular move with its costumers.\nAll of this begs the question: What direction will Apple go in 2017?\nThere are a few products we can expect to be updated. The iPhone 8 should launch in September (like every other iPhone) and iOS 11 should be announced at WWDC. But what about other new products? Is this the year we finally see a true iPad/Mac hybrid? Is this the year OLED displays make their way into the iPhone? Is the MacBook Air finally getting a Retina display?\nWe can’t be sure of these crazy predictions, but we can hope Apple makes some of them come true. Who knows, maybe Apple will surprise us all.\nTo see all of the predictions about Apple in 2017, check out the video above.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo ",

      "text": "Beck Diefenbach | Reuters Apple Inc. COO Jeff Williams discusses the Apple Watch Series 2 during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. \nApple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \n\"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. \nIDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "text": "Momoko Toyotake tries to use Apple's new iPhone 7 (R) and 7 Plus after they went on sale at the Apple Store at Tokyo's Omotesando shopping district, Japan, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Issei Kato ( Copyright Reuters 2016 ) This Is How Apple Can Make iPhones in America \nPublished December 06, 2016 Print \nWhen Donald Trump vowed to “get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country,” I remember thinking, good luck with that. It takes hundreds of thousands of workers in China to assemble 200 million iPhones a year. It seems unfathomable to think the Silicon Valley tech giant could build such an operation in the U.S. \nContinue Reading Below \nBut the more I think about it, and contrary to what many suggest, it can be done. On a strict cost per unit basis, it would not be cost or price prohibitive. But whether it will be done depends to a great extent on how much federal and state governments are willing to cough up in tax incentives to make it happen. \nAccording to IHS, a publicly traded research and analytics firm based in London, the total cost to manufacture an iPhone 7 is $224.80. IHS estimates that $219.80 of that is component costs and $5 for assembly and test. While CEO Tim Cook has scoffed at independent cost breakdowns of Apple products , IHS’s tear-down analyses are usually quite accurate, in my experience. \nSo 219.80 is fixed no matter where it’s built. Since most of the components are manufactured in Asia, there will be additional shipping and logistics costs, but those are nominal. So the question becomes one of, how much more than $5 would it cost to assemble and test an iPhone in America? \nApple has reportedly asked its two manufacturing partners to look into just that. Pegatron declined but Foxconn, which depends on Apple for more than half its business, wisely agreed. I think Cook wants to be prepared when it comes time to negotiate with the Donald on tax incentives. We’ll come back to that later. \nA Foxconn worker makes about $400 a month , so depending on where the facility is located, a low wage U.S. worker would make between four and five times that. Tack on an adder for higher taxes and insurance premiums and the incremental assembly cost would add less than $50 to the retail price of the phone, profit margin included. That is feasible, especially on a premium model. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nWhich brings us to the facility and equipment. That’s where incentives come in. Apple has $180 billion parked offshore. If it repatriates just half of that under Trump’s proposed 10% repatriation tax, that’s $9 billion in incremental tax revenue the federal government has to play with. It would make sense to use some of that to incentivize Apple to build facilities here. That would cover the cost of an iPhone plant. \nThe real elephant in the room is finding hundreds of thousands of people willing to work on an assembly line for low wages. That’s a real problem. But consider this. Trump is looking to make good on a campaign promise and Apple would benefit from the goodwill and PR. To achieve that, they don’t have to make every iPhone here. Just one model – a richly featured phone – would do the trick. \nThat would solve both the worker availability and retail price elasticity issue, since users would be more willing to pay more for a premium model. \nWhich brings us to the notion of an all American-made iPhone. That will never happen. Apple can certainly make its preference for American-made components known, but since the vast majority of its hundreds of suppliers are based in China, Taiwan and Japan and semiconductor plants cost a fortune to build, that’s a real stretch. But in time, Apple can certainly increase the percentage of American-made components in its devices. \nThe bottom line: If Trump and Cook work together, they can definitely make a Made in America iPhone happen, as early as 2019. And I suspect they will. What do you think? ",

      "text": "Apple holds talks with Govt on opening stores   6, 2016 (PTI) Apple Inc officials today met Commerce Ministry top brass amid its plans to open stores in India without initially having to source components locally. According to sources, the meeting chaired by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Ramesh Abhishek lasted for almost an hour with senior officials from Apple discussing details of the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules in single-brand retail and the company's retail expansion plans. \n\nApple officials are believed to have sought clarity on the changes in mandatory domestic sourcing norms for single brand retail brought in earlier this year. However, no official word on the meeting was received from either side. In June this year, government had relaxed FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption from local sourcing to foreign players in single-brand retail and a five-year relaxation for 'state-of-the-art' and 'cutting-edge' technology.\n\nIndia is one of the fastest growing markets for the Cupertino-based company. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, Apple's iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year. In May this year, Apple's CEO Tim Cook had visited India and met   as well as key industry leaders like Sunil Bharti Mittal and veteran banker Chanda Kocchar.\n\nApple had also announced setting up of a design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS and opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. Cook during his May visit, had discussed issues including manufacturing and setting up retail stores in the country with Modi. The FDI rules for single brand retail call for mandatory sourcing of at least 30 per cent inputs from domestic companies.",

      "text": "App developers not ready for iOS transport security requirements Many iOS apps opt out of Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) feature or deliberately weaken it Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 6, 2016 8:13 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe fingerprint reader in the Apple iPhone 5S is integrated into the home button. Credit: Martyn Williams IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nA month before Apple is expected to enforce stricter security requirements for app communications in iOS, enterprise developers don't seem ready to embrace them, a new study shows. \nThe study was performed by security firm Appthority on the most common 200 apps installed on iOS devices in enterprise environments. The researchers looked at how well these apps conform to Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) requirements. \nATS was first introduced and was enabled by default in iOS 9. It forces all apps to communicate with Internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections and ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses are used. For example, SSL version 3 is not allowed and neither is the RC4 stream cipher, due to known vulnerabilities. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nBefore ATS, app developers implemented HTTPS using third-party frameworks, but configuring SSL/TLS properly is hard so implementation errors were common. These weakened the protection that the protocol is supposed to provide against traffic snooping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. \nCurrently iOS provides a method for apps to opt out of ATS entirely or to use it only for specific connections, but Apple wants to change that. At its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June, the company announced that it will require all apps published on the App Store to turn on ATS by the end of this year. \nThe requirement won't be enforced at the OS level, but through the App Store review process. Using some of the ATS exceptions will still be possible, but developers will have to provide a \"reasonable justification\" for using them if they want their apps to be approved. \nDuring their study, the Appthority researchers found that 97 percent of the analyzed apps -- 193 out of 200 -- used exceptions and other settings that weakened the default ATS configuration. \n\"Among the top 200 iOS apps that we analyzed, 166 apps (83 percent) bypass at least some ATS requirements by setting 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' attribute to 'true' in their Info.plist files,\" the Appthority researchers said in their report. \"However, not all of them bypass ATS requirements for all network connections. For instance, a company can still support ATS requirements for network connections with its domain, while allowing ATS to bypass all other connections.\" \nAmong the apps that didn't use HTTPS for all of their connections were popular ones like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Fox News, CNN, BBC, Netflix, ESPN, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but also utility apps like Flashlight, QR code readers and games. \nWhile it could be argued that some connections don't need HTTPS because they aren't used to transfer sensitive data, the Appthority researchers found 10 applications that did send device IDs, email addresses, physical addresses, zip codes, geolocation information and even passwords or secret keys over unencrypted HTTP links. \nThere are many reasons why developers can't turn on ATS for all connections and are likely to request ATS exceptions during the app review process. For example, many apps don't talk only to their developers' servers, but also to third-party advertising, market research, analytics and image or video hosting services. The use of HTTPS on these external services are out of app developers' control. \nATS provides fine-grained exceptions like \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia,\" which can, for example, be used to allow the streaming of video or audio content over HTTP, while encrypting all other connections. \nHowever, based on Appthority's analysis, it seems that so far developers have preferred using the more generic “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” which disables ATS for all connections, when dealing with such problems. \nThe company didn't find any app that used the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia\" or the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent\" attributes to limit the scope of ATS exceptions. It hopes that Apple's new requirements will change that. \nMany apps that do use ATS disable some of its security features. For example, none of the apps analyzed by Appthority used Certificate Transparency, which is available in ATS. \nFurthermore, seven of them disabled SSL certificate validation and 46 didn't use certificate pinning. Thirty-eight apps disabled Forward Secrecy and eight apps set the allowed TLS protocol version to 1.0 or 1.1, even though the secure default in ATS is TLS 1.2. \n\"We still expect iOS apps with unencrypted data in enterprise environments, even after January 1,\" the Appthority researchers said. \"When Apple approves such apps for the App Store, there will still be the security risks associated with unencrypted data for some connections, so it’s important for enterprises to have visibility into and management of the risks related to apps with those exceptions.\"   Related:",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe fingerprint reader in the Apple iPhone 5S is integrated into the home button. Credit: Martyn Williams Samsung Galaxy Note7 iris scanner review \nA month before Apple is expected to enforce stricter security requirements for app communications in iOS, enterprise developers don't seem ready to embrace them, a new study shows. \nThe study was performed by security firm Appthority on the most common 200 apps installed on iOS devices in enterprise environments. The researchers looked at how well these apps conform to Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) requirements. \nATS was first introduced and was enabled by default in iOS 9. It forces all apps to communicate with Internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections and ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses are used. For example, SSL version 3 is not allowed and neither is the RC4 stream cipher, due to known vulnerabilities. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nBefore ATS, app developers implemented HTTPS using third-party frameworks, but configuring SSL/TLS properly is hard so implementation errors were common. These weakened the protection that the protocol is supposed to provide against traffic snooping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. \nCurrently iOS provides a method for apps to opt out of ATS entirely or to use it only for specific connections, but Apple wants to change that. At its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June, the company announced that it will require all apps published on the App Store to turn on ATS by the end of this year. \nThe requirement won't be enforced at the OS level, but through the App Store review process. Using some of the ATS exceptions will still be possible, but developers will have to provide a \"reasonable justification\" for using them if they want their apps to be approved. \nDuring their study, the Appthority researchers found that 97 percent of the analyzed apps -- 193 out of 200 -- used exceptions and other settings that weakened the default ATS configuration. \n\"Among the top 200 iOS apps that we analyzed, 166 apps (83 percent) bypass at least some ATS requirements by setting 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' attribute to 'true' in their Info.plist files,\" the Appthority researchers said in their report. \"However, not all of them bypass ATS requirements for all network connections. For instance, a company can still support ATS requirements for network connections with its domain, while allowing ATS to bypass all other connections.\" \nAmong the apps that didn't use HTTPS for all of their connections were popular ones like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Fox News, CNN, BBC, Netflix, ESPN, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but also utility apps like Flashlight, QR code readers and games. \nWhile it could be argued that some connections don't need HTTPS because they aren't used to transfer sensitive data, the Appthority researchers found 10 applications that did send device IDs, email addresses, physical addresses, zip codes, geolocation information and even passwords or secret keys over unencrypted HTTP links. \nThere are many reasons why developers can't turn on ATS for all connections and are likely to request ATS exceptions during the app review process. For example, many apps don't talk only to their developers' servers, but also to third-party advertising, market research, analytics and image or video hosting services. The use of HTTPS on these external services are out of app developers' control. \nATS provides fine-grained exceptions like \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia,\" which can, for example, be used to allow the streaming of video or audio content over HTTP, while encrypting all other connections. \nHowever, based on Appthority's analysis, it seems that so far developers have preferred using the more generic “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” which disables ATS for all connections, when dealing with such problems. \nThe company didn't find any app that used the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia\" or the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent\" attributes to limit the scope of ATS exceptions. It hopes that Apple's new requirements will change that. \nMany apps that do use ATS disable some of its security features. For example, none of the apps analyzed by Appthority used Certificate Transparency, which is available in ATS. \nFurthermore, seven of them disabled SSL certificate validation and 46 didn't use certificate pinning. Thirty-eight apps disabled Forward Secrecy and eight apps set the allowed TLS protocol version to 1.0 or 1.1, even though the secure default in ATS is TLS 1.2. \n\"We still expect iOS apps with unencrypted data in enterprise environments, even after January 1,\" the Appthority researchers said. \"When Apple approves such apps for the App Store, there will still be the security risks associated with unencrypted data for some connections, so it’s important for enterprises to have visibility into and management of the risks related to apps with those exceptions.\"  ",

      "text": "Apple to start publishing its AI research By Dan Pye ● 38 minutes ago \nApple is about to start publishing some of its artificial intelligence research findings, breaking with the company’s usually stringent privacy, Business Insider reports. A series of tweets show that Russ Salakhutd, director of AI research at Apple and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, announced the company’s policy reversal to attendees at the annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference. Apple has historically closely guarded its technological breakthroughs, forcing its employees to keep quiet in the name of protecting the company’s intellectual property while competitors like Facebook and Google allow their employees to publish their research findings in a number of fields. Apple’s secrecy has been a point of contention for years, hampering its ability to draw top talent who see publishing their work as a key component of career advancement.",

      "text": "App developers not ready for iOS transport security requirements Many iOS apps opt out of Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) feature or deliberately weaken it Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | December 6, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe fingerprint reader in the Apple iPhone 5S is integrated into the home button. Credit: Martyn Williams 16% off Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera - Deal Alert \nA month before Apple is expected to enforce stricter security requirements for app communications in iOS, enterprise developers don't seem ready to embrace them, a new study shows. \nThe study was performed by security firm Appthority on the most common 200 apps installed on iOS devices in enterprise environments. The researchers looked at how well these apps conform to Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) requirements. \nATS was first introduced and was enabled by default in iOS 9. It forces all apps to communicate with Internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections and ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses are used. For example, SSL version 3 is not allowed and neither is the RC4 stream cipher, due to known vulnerabilities. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nBefore ATS, app developers implemented HTTPS using third-party frameworks, but configuring SSL/TLS properly is hard so implementation errors were common. These weakened the protection that the protocol is supposed to provide against traffic snooping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. \nCurrently iOS provides a method for apps to opt out of ATS entirely or to use it only for specific connections, but Apple wants to change that. At its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June, the company announced that it will require all apps published on the App Store to turn on ATS by the end of this year. \nThe requirement won't be enforced at the OS level, but through the App Store review process. Using some of the ATS exceptions will still be possible, but developers will have to provide a \"reasonable justification\" for using them if they want their apps to be approved. \nDuring their study, the Appthority researchers found that 97 percent of the analyzed apps -- 193 out of 200 -- used exceptions and other settings that weakened the default ATS configuration. \n\"Among the top 200 iOS apps that we analyzed, 166 apps (83 percent) bypass at least some ATS requirements by setting 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' attribute to 'true' in their Info.plist files,\" the Appthority researchers said in their report. \"However, not all of them bypass ATS requirements for all network connections. For instance, a company can still support ATS requirements for network connections with its domain, while allowing ATS to bypass all other connections.\" \nAmong the apps that didn't use HTTPS for all of their connections were popular ones like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Fox News, CNN, BBC, Netflix, ESPN, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but also utility apps like Flashlight, QR code readers and games. \nWhile it could be argued that some connections don't need HTTPS because they aren't used to transfer sensitive data, the Appthority researchers found 10 applications that did send device IDs, email addresses, physical addresses, zip codes, geolocation information and even passwords or secret keys over unencrypted HTTP links. \nThere are many reasons why developers can't turn on ATS for all connections and are likely to request ATS exceptions during the app review process. For example, many apps don't talk only to their developers' servers, but also to third-party advertising, market research, analytics and image or video hosting services. The use of HTTPS on these external services are out of app developers' control. \nATS provides fine-grained exceptions like \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia,\" which can, for example, be used to allow the streaming of video or audio content over HTTP, while encrypting all other connections. \nHowever, based on Appthority's analysis, it seems that so far developers have preferred using the more generic “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” which disables ATS for all connections, when dealing with such problems. \nThe company didn't find any app that used the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia\" or the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent\" attributes to limit the scope of ATS exceptions. It hopes that Apple's new requirements will change that. \nMany apps that do use ATS disable some of its security features. For example, none of the apps analyzed by Appthority used Certificate Transparency, which is available in ATS. \nFurthermore, seven of them disabled SSL certificate validation and 46 didn't use certificate pinning. Thirty-eight apps disabled Forward Secrecy and eight apps set the allowed TLS protocol version to 1.0 or 1.1, even though the secure default in ATS is TLS 1.2. \n\"We still expect iOS apps with unencrypted data in enterprise environments, even after January 1,\" the Appthority researchers said. \"When Apple approves such apps for the App Store, there will still be the security risks associated with unencrypted data for some connections, so it’s important for enterprises to have visibility into and management of the risks related to apps with those exceptions.\" Related:",

      "text": "Flip \nApple says that the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is so good that it matches the video quality of the cameras used for shooting Hollywood movies. The Cupertino-based firm just released an ad emphasizing the quality of the iPhone’s camera . This concept might help parents whose kids want to see their videos matching those of the stars. Image Source: YouTube (screenshot) iPhone 7 Plus used for “Romeo and Juliet” \nApple’s latest ad follows its holiday ad called “Frankie’s Holiday,” which showed an iPhone-toting Frankenstein. This ad was a bit different as Apple’s holiday ad usually focuses on a wide array of its products, not just the iPhone. The ad, which was released on Monday, is 30 seconds long and highlights the dual-camera system introduced with the iPhone 7 Plus. The ad titled “Romeo and Juliet” plays Act II, Scene II of Shakespeare’s masterwork. \nApple’s ad depicts the most famous scene in all of theater, and that is the balcony scene, or in technical terms. Capulet’s Orchard. In the ad, a parent is seen using the zoom capability of the built-in Camera app to get a closer shot of the play. \nApple’s ad boasts good cinematography in an amateur recording , thus implying that the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera captures images of utmost quality and is the best for capturing special moments. Apple’s “Romeo and Juliet” ad is part of its commercial series named Practically Magic , which started with an ad entitled “Balloons” in September. Is Apple overclaiming? \nIn the ad, kids are shown playing the roles of Romeo and Juliet. A viewer might think about whether the ad can actually be referred to as art directed by some renowned personality. But as it turns out, the director is a mere parent who needs to record their child’s act at a school play using just a phone. \nThe ad concludes with a message from Apple saying, “Your movies look like movies .” \nHowever, CNET says, “It depends which movies you’re talking about, perhaps. Blair Witch Project ? Certainly. The Grand Budapest Hotel ? Perhaps not.” \nAccording to CNET, Apple has been into overclaiming for some time now. For example, it recently tried to convince people that the new MacBook Pro is “at the very pinnacle of world ingenuity.” CNET’s Chris Matyszczyk said his colleague Stephen Shankland tested the iPhone 7 Plus against the Google Pixel XL and concluded that the iPhone 7 Plus is inferior in still photography but better in video.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Netflix Is Now Top of the Apple App Store Food Chain \nNetflix is proving a free app can make big money on Apple’s App Store. \nThe video-streaming app, which is free for users to download but requires a subscription to its service, is now the top-grossing iPhone app in Apple’s App Store. The achievement comes about a year after Netflix announced that it would offer in-app purchases in the program, allowing users to sign up for the service or add the ability for multiple users to watch its content on the same account all from within its software. Sensor Tower, a company that offers mobile app services and analytics, says the app is also the top-grossing iPhone app in India, Mexico, and Colombia. \nApple AAPL tracks the most popular free and paid programs in its App Store based on their total number of downloads on any given day. The company’s top-grossing chart provides insight into the apps that are generating the most revenue through the marketplace. That revenue is generated through the sale of paid apps or via in-app purchases. In Netflix’s case, the company’s app is available as a free download, but comes with in-app purchases ranging from $8 a month to $12 per month, depending on the number of “screens,” or simultaneous viewers, a user might want. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nNetflix’s success is also Apple’s success: Apple takes a portion of the revenue generated from paid apps and in-app purchases. Apple typically takes 30% of revenue generated from the sale of an app or in-app content, but for subscription-based apps of an auto-renewing subscription, the company takes 70% the first year and 85% in subsequent years. It’s unknown what the revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Netflix is. \nNeither Netflix NFLX nor Apple shares how much an individual app generates in revenue through the marketplace, but Sensor Tower’s data suggests it might be significant. \nSensor Tower, which derives its data from anonymous information it collects across millions of smartphones, estimates that Netflix is generating nearly $2.9 million a week in net revenue from its iPhone app. The analytics firm estimates that Netflix’s weekly iPhone app revenue hovered at less than $50,000 in fall 2015, when the in-app purchases were rolling out to users. For more about Apple’Watch, watch: \nLooking ahead, Netflix might have some work cut out for it to stay atop the top-grossing heap. The chart is always changing and apps are constantly moving up and down the list. Just last month, for instance, Netflix was in the seventh spot for highest-grossing iPhone apps. On Nov. 14, it was in the second spot. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

      "text": "Samsung and Apple remain the two biggest players in smartphones, but the last few months has suggested there are cracks in their respective foundations. Samsung is still dealing with the fallout of its Galaxy Note 7 debacle , and Apple appears to be banking on its next iPhone being a home run.\nWhen it comes to premium smartphones, though, some analysts think Apple is in better shape. This chart from Credit Suisse shows that while Apple’s share of the high-end market — here defined as phones sold for $400 or higher — has grown as of late, Samsung’s has started to taper off.\nCredit Suisse expects the trend to continue going forward. In a note released on Tuesday, the firm says it sees the Galaxy Note 7 mess and the long-predicted “supercycle” of iPhone 8 demand being “positive drivers for the iPhone business going forward.” Meanwhile, Credit Suisse says it’s “concerned” about the spectre of the Note 7 looming over Samsung’s premium Galaxy phones in the long-term.\nAll that said, just because this is how things could play out between the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 doesn’t mean it’s how the smartphone market will unfurl as a whole. The wave of affordable Chinese phones remains a challenge to both, for one. And while Apple’s margins are still massive, many analysts think  they’ll continue to decline .\nCredit Suisse \n",

Show Caption Previous Next WASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsungin its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Apple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "App developers not ready for iOS transport security requirements Many iOS apps opt out of Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) feature or deliberately weaken it Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 6, 2016 10:18 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe fingerprint reader in the Apple iPhone 5S is integrated into the home button. Credit: Martyn Williams Security Sessions: Lessons learned from the Dyn DNS attacks \nA month before Apple is expected to enforce stricter security requirements for app communications in iOS, enterprise developers don't seem ready to embrace them, a new study shows. \nThe study was performed by security firm Appthority on the most common 200 apps installed on iOS devices in enterprise environments. The researchers looked at how well these apps conform to Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) requirements. \nATS was first introduced and was enabled by default in iOS 9. It forces all apps to communicate with Internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections and ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses are used. For example, SSL version 3 is not allowed and neither is the RC4 stream cipher, due to known vulnerabilities. \nBefore ATS, app developers implemented HTTPS using third-party frameworks, but configuring SSL/TLS properly is hard so implementation errors were common. These weakened the protection that the protocol is supposed to provide against traffic snooping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. GET YOUR DAILY SECURITY NEWS: Sign up for CSO's security newsletters \nCurrently iOS provides a method for apps to opt out of ATS entirely or to use it only for specific connections, but Apple wants to change that. At its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June, the company announced that it will require all apps published on the App Store to turn on ATS by the end of this year. \nThe requirement won't be enforced at the OS level, but through the App Store review process. Using some of the ATS exceptions will still be possible, but developers will have to provide a \"reasonable justification\" for using them if they want their apps to be approved. \nDuring their study, the Appthority researchers found that 97 percent of the analyzed apps -- 193 out of 200 -- used exceptions and other settings that weakened the default ATS configuration. \n\"Among the top 200 iOS apps that we analyzed, 166 apps (83 percent) bypass at least some ATS requirements by setting 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' attribute to 'true' in their Info.plist files,\" the Appthority researchers said in their report. \"However, not all of them bypass ATS requirements for all network connections. For instance, a company can still support ATS requirements for network connections with its domain, while allowing ATS to bypass all other connections.\" \nAmong the apps that didn't use HTTPS for all of their connections were popular ones like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Fox News, CNN, BBC, Netflix, ESPN, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but also utility apps like Flashlight, QR code readers and games. \nWhile it could be argued that some connections don't need HTTPS because they aren't used to transfer sensitive data, the Appthority researchers found 10 applications that did send device IDs, email addresses, physical addresses, zip codes, geolocation information and even passwords or secret keys over unencrypted HTTP links. \nThere are many reasons why developers can't turn on ATS for all connections and are likely to request ATS exceptions during the app review process. For example, many apps don't talk only to their developers' servers, but also to third-party advertising, market research, analytics and image or video hosting services. The use of HTTPS on these external services are out of app developers' control. \nATS provides fine-grained exceptions like \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia,\" which can, for example, be used to allow the streaming of video or audio content over HTTP, while encrypting all other connections. \nHowever, based on Appthority's analysis, it seems that so far developers have preferred using the more generic “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” which disables ATS for all connections, when dealing with such problems. \nThe company didn't find any app that used the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia\" or the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent\" attributes to limit the scope of ATS exceptions. It hopes that Apple's new requirements will change that. \nMany apps that do use ATS disable some of its security features. For example, none of the apps analyzed by Appthority used Certificate Transparency, which is available in ATS. \nFurthermore, seven of them disabled SSL certificate validation and 46 didn't use certificate pinning. Thirty-eight apps disabled Forward Secrecy and eight apps set the allowed TLS protocol version to 1.0 or 1.1, even though the secure default in ATS is TLS 1.2. \n\"We still expect iOS apps with unencrypted data in enterprise environments, even after January 1,\" the Appthority researchers said. \"When Apple approves such apps for the App Store, there will still be the security risks associated with unencrypted data for some connections, so it’s important for enterprises to have visibility into and management of the risks related to apps with those exceptions.\" To comment on this article and other CSO content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream .

      "title": "How to enable Single Sign-On for the Apple TV",
      "text": "\nIf you're running tvOS 10, you can now log in to the Single Sign-On feature — if you have the right provider. Here's how!\nApple flipped the switch on its long-awaited Single Sign-On feature for tvOS 10, but before you get too excited, a few caveats: It's only available in the United States; it's currently only available with nine cable providers; apps will still need to be updated to support Single Sign-On.\nWhat providers support Single Sign-On? \nAt present, Apple has nine providers in the U.S. available for Single Sign-On:\nCenturyLink Prism , part of CenturyLink's fiber optic offerings DirecTV , a satellite TV provider owned by AT&T Dish Network , a satellite TV subscription GTA , a cable service in Guam GVTC , a broadband provider in Texas Hawaiian Telcom , available in Hawaii Hotwire , a fiber optic cable TV subscription MetroCast , available in nine states Sling TV , a digital subscription for cord-cutters Of the nine, Sling TV is the only one that most U.S. users can sign up for immediately; otherwise, if you don't have one of these nine providers, you won't be able to use Single Sign-On just yet.\nWhat are the privacy issues in regards to Single Sign-On? In the TV Provider preferences pane, Apple offers a section called \"About TV Providers and Privacy,\" which offers users an overview of what information their TV providers will be able to see after logging in. In essence, here's what you're giving to your provider and third-party apps upon connecting them to your Apple TV:\nApps, Apple, and your provider can exchange information about your subscription account (to allow you to access various shows across apps) Your provider can share your user ID, household ID, and account zip code along with information about your subscription package Your Apple TV will store your provider name and user ID locally for authorization Much like with iOS's location permissions, when you open a new app, you'll have to OK each one to use your subscription data; if you choose not to authorize that app, it'll default to its original authentication method. How to enable Single Sign-On Open the Settings app . Go to Accounts > TV Provider . Choose your provider.\n\nClick on Sign In. Enter your username and password .\n\nHow to authorize an app with Single Sign-On \nAuthorizing an app is as simple as opening the program and selecting OK to authorize the sharing of your subscription data.\nBefore your third-party app can talk to the Single Sign-On feature, it needs an update from its developers; this is because the app currently doesn't know to look for the Single Sign-On data. With the official launch of Single Sign-On, we'll likely see apps begin to push out updates that incorporate this feature soon.\nHow to find apps that work with your subscription \nOpen the Settings app . Go to Accounts > TV Provider . Select Find More Apps . You'll then be brought to an App Store collection that highlights compatible apps with your specific subscription.\nHow to turn off Single Sign-On Open the Settings app . Go to Accounts > TV Provider . Select Sign Out . After you sign out, apps will revert to individual authentication options. Any questions? Have any questions about Single Sign-On? Let me know in the comments.\n",

      "text": "Apple Watch Sales 'Off the Charts.' Should You Buy One? Mark Spoonauer Editor in Chief Pin it Share Depending on whom you ask, smartwatch sales are struggling, or they're red-hot. Apple falls into the latter camp, according to CEO Tim Cook, who says that the company just broke a record with Apple Watch sales. Credit: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide More Credit: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide \"Sales growth is off the charts,\" Cook told Reuters in an email message. \"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" Cook's rosy picture seems to fly in the face of a report just issued by research firm IDC , which says that Apple Watch shipments declined by 70 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. Cook's comments to Reuters were in response to a query about the IDC report. MORE: Best Smartwatches - Top Picks for Android and iOS IDC claims that it's seeing a big shift in the overall wearables market, with more simple, single-purpose fitness trackers from Fitbit and others now making up a whopping 85 percent of the market. Can both companies be right? Sort of. The latest Apple Watch Series 2 and updated Series 1 didn't go on sale until mid-September, toward the end of the third quarter, and might not have had much impact on IDC's figures. Results from October through December won't show up until fourth-quarter numbers are available. Is the Apple Watch right for you? It depends on what you're looking for from a wearable device. Although it does a lot more than a simple fitness tracker, the Apple Watch Series 2 is best for those looking to get fit. It offers built-in GPS to track your runs and comes in a new swim-proof design you can easily take in the pool. Apple made some other notable improvements when moving from the Series 1 to the Series 2, including adding a faster processor, a brighter display and a beefier battery. But there simply isn't yet a killer app for the Apple Watch — or for any smartwatch. Notifications from your iPhone are helpful, and so is being able to pay with stuff with Apple Pay via your wrists, but you'll still want to use your smartphone for most tasks. MORE: 7 Ways Samsung's Gear S3 Beats the Apple Watch Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's Wearables team, cited several challenges for smartwatches in the company's report and wrote that \"we need to see more intuitive user interfaces, seamless user experiences, standalone connectivity and applications that go beyond health and fitness and into personal and professional productivity.\" The new Gear S3 from Samsung goes further than the Apple Watch buy offering optional 4G and a more stylish design, but as our own Mike Prospero wrote in his review, there simply aren't enough apps to choose from yet. The same IDC report said Samsung wearable sales — which includes more than smartwatches — were up 90 percent year-over-year. So, yes, the Apple Watch may be hot for now, but that doesn't mean it's right for you.",

      "text": "Apple released a statement Tuesday evening saying that they have received a few reports of iPhone’s unexpectedly shutting down. They say that they investigate every problem that they encounter, including analyzing the device with the issues.\nApple says as a result of this investigation that they found a small number of iPhone 6s devices that were made in September and October 2015 that had contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. Two weeks ago Apple launched a worldwide program to replace all affected batteries.\nAfter that some customers still reported their devices shutting down unexpectedly. Apple says some of these shutdowns can occur under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics. In order to gather more information Apple is including additional diagnostic capability in an iOS software update which will be available next week.\nApple says this will allow them to gather more information and help them improve these issues.\nFor more information on these issues visit the Apple website .\n ",

      "text": "You are at: Home » News » The Latest News » Samsung prevails over Apple in $399M patent appeal Samsung prevails over Apple in $399M patent appeal Tweet \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that “doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty — knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNo clarity \nObservers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed. \n“Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n“Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,” he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola’s iconic soda bottle. \nReacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, “Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute… We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” \nSamsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n‘Sigh of relief’ \nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that “large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now,” even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. \n“This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,” Black said. \nThe lower court’s interpretation of design patents, Black said, “would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products — especially in the tech sector.” \nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n“The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,” Love said. \nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents. \n“Interest in design patents spiked following Apple’s first jury verdict in 2012,” he said. \n“Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.” AFP \nAFP/CC",

Up Next Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple Photo by Mopic, Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF \nApple's AI research department is going to be breaking its long silence and start publishing papers, according to a report by Bloomberg . The tech giant's newly hired director of AI research delivered the news during his presentation at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Barcelona on Monday. \nRuslan Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon associate professor in machine learning who was hired by Apple in October, showed a slide that read, \"Can we publish? Yes. Do we engage with academia? Yes.\" This is considered an abrupt change for Apple, which previously kept all its research results in-house. \nThis could allow Apple to advance its research more quickly by engaging with other academics. Rival tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, which do allow their employees to publish their research, have caught up to and possibly even outstripped Siri. In addition, Google has made big waves this year with its AI Experiments and DeepMind research. \nIn addition to the collaboration benefits, allowing employees to publish is a good way to attract talent to the team, as publication allows researchers to share their hard work and achievements. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      "text": "Apple Admits iPhones Have A Problem {{article.article.images.featured.caption}} Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Apple Considers Google-Style Augmented Reality Glasses \nIt had to happen. In the face of overwhelming pressure from users and a stark warning from China’s Consumer Association government watchdog, has gone on record and admitted iPhone battery problems are more widespread than it initially claimed. But there’s a twist… \nPointedly choosing to post once again to its China website both in Chinese and English, Apple has released an article entitled ‘A Message from Apple about iPhone and Unexpected Shutdowns’ and confirmed: \n“We take every customer concern very seriously, including the limited number of reports of unexpected shutdown with iPhones. We also want to thank the agencies for forwarding concerns to us and their engagement with us...When we find something, we work to quickly provide our customers with a solution.” The iPhone is set for a massive redesign in 2017 (concept pictured), but first Apple has problems to solve with existing models. Image credit: Veniamin Geskin \nWhat the company says its further investigations found was “a small number of customers” that are also suffering from what I dubbed the ‘30% Bug’ - where their devices randomly shut off with around 30% of their battery life remaining. I exclusively broke this story last month after contact with disaffected customers writing on Apple’s official Support Communities website. \nThe main forum thread on this topic has now reached a remarkable 33 pages long . \nBut the twist is Apple has still not fully fronted up to the situation. Its statement does nothing to specifically state the problems extend beyond the iPhone 6S (the only model it has named to date), when multiple sources in the thread above as well as social media and even a tweet from Apple executive and ‘father of the iPod’ Tony Fadell have confirmed cases involving different models: Fadell confirms his iPhone battery problem is with a model Apple currently denies is affected. Image credit: Twitter \nIn fact reports of the 30% bug involve most iPhones released in the last 4 years - including the iPhone SE, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5S and iPhone 5 - as frequently as they mention the iPhone 6S. The good news is the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus predominantly remain unaffected, but they are currently suffering a significant problem of their own . \nWhat Happens Next? \nDespite an extremely cautious statement, Apple says it will now take a course of action which strongly suggests it knows full well that more than “a small number” (a phrase it has used 3x in its last two statements) of iPhones are experiencing problems: it will release a new version of iOS specifically to diagnose battery performance: \n“This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown. If such improvements can be made, they will be delivered in future software updates.” \nYes, Apple is going to try and fix this in software and the fact this option is even on the table is encouraging given the immense logistical effort and cost Samsung endured (potentially $17BN ) when it had to recall all Galaxy Note 7 models (a handset whose brief time on sale meant it had shipped only a tiny fraction of the units of all these iPhones). But we're clearly not at that stage yet. Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7 (pictured) has been a financial disaster for the company. Image credit: Samsung \nThat said Apple’s language - “If such improvements can be made” - does leave in the caveat that the 30% Bug could be hardware related. \nGiven Apple blames a physical problem for the iPhone 6S battery bug (officially: “a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs”) and has setup a dedicated replacement service , the hope will be the problems suffered by all these other models are different. Cynics and optimists will no doubt react differently. \nSo while a radical iPhone redesign looks certain for 2017 , it appears Apple will spend the rest of 2016 focused on something whole lot less appealing... \n___ \nFollow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+ \nMore On Forbes ",

Previously, cable-specific apps such as HBO Go and Time Warner Cable asked users to enter their cable provider when they used an app for the first time.\nThe new feature, which is currently available only in the US, can be used on CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telecom, Hotwire, MetroCast and Sling, according to an Apple support document .\nApple revealed the single sign-on feature in June and made it available in November to those with access to the tvOS 10.1 and 10.2 betas. It wasn't immediately clear when the feature might be available internationally.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInformation on how to set up the feature is available on the support document.\n ",

      "text": "Apple's AI research department is going to be breaking its long silence and start publishing papers, according to a report by Bloomberg . The tech giant's newly hired director of AI research delivered the news during his presentation at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Barcelona on Monday.\nRuslan Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon associate professor in machine learning who was hired by Apple in October, showed a slide that read, \"Can we publish? Yes. Do we engage with academia? Yes.\" This is considered an abrupt change for Apple, which previously kept all its research results in-house.\nPhoto by Mopic, Getty Images/Science Photo Library RF This could allow Apple to advance its research more quickly by engaging with other academics. Rival tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, which do allow their employees to publish their research, have caught up to and possibly even outstripped Siri. In addition, Google has made big waves this year with its AI Experiments and DeepMind research.\nIn addition to the collaboration benefits, allowing employees to publish is a good way to attract talent to the team, as publication allows researchers to share their hard work and achievements.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n ",

      "text": "For the past six months I've been in the market for a new laptop, and like a lot of people, I put off making a purchase until Apple unveiled its redesigned MacBook Pros, which were officially introduced in late October and shipped last month.\nFor those who missed the release, the new MacBook Pros come in entry-level and premium versions. Both are slimmed-down versions of their predecessors -- essentially a MacBook Pro in a MacBook Air chassis with USB-C ports instead of standard USB -- but the premium model has an integrated Touch Bar OLED strip that takes the place of the old-school function keys at the top of the keyboard.\nCNET editor Dan Ackerman gave that MacBook Pro with Touch Bar a 4.5-star rating, calling it a \"Second-screen dream machine\" and thanks to that \"smart, useful Touch Bar,\" the premium model was well worth splurging on over the standard streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro .\nEnlarge Image Apple's Touch Bar is a nice touch, but it'll cost you.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET It's a great machine. I've played around with it. I've touched the Touch Bar. I've looked at this laptop longingly, open and closed. There's only one problem: It starts at $1,800 for the 13-inch model and $2,400 for the 15-inch model, which includes a step-up Core i7 processor and more RAM (16GB) in its base model. It's also worth mentioning that the new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, sans Touch Bar, starts at $1,500 -- or $200 more than last year's MacBook Pro.\nThese high prices and some heated debate online over the utility of the Touch Bar may have raised some eyebrows, but Apple managed to put up record sales number during the launch windows.\n\"We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,\" Phil Schiller, Apple SVP, told The Independent , a UK publication, on November 2.\nNot surprising, considering that months of rumors of a pending MacBook Pro redesign left plenty of folks -- like me -- holding off on their MacBook purchases. Demand was sky-high.\n(Apple did not respond to CNET's request for follow-up comment on the MacBook Pro's pricing or demand.)\nEnlarge Image Select models of the Surface Pro 4 are frequently on sale.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET While I was tempted to bite, I didn't. I felt that if I was going to get a new MacBook Pro, I might as well get the one with the Touch Bar because if I got the standard one I thought there'd always be a little part of me that would wish I'd paid a few hundred bucks more and gotten the extra touch strip. Once you're $1,500 in the hole, you might as well go to $1,800, my reasoning went.\nBut then I thought, \"$1,800 is a lot of money, do I really need to spend that much on a laptop?\" I'm not a graphic designer. Sure, I might do a little editing of family videos, but on the whole, I'm not doing anything that would tax most current laptops -- why not get a lightweight Windows tablet PC with a full touch screen interface that costs significantly less? After all, I'm kind of in the market for an iPad, but with prices for iPads also being high, I haven't bothered to buy a new one (I use an iPad Air that was given to my wife as a gift and still works fine). So, why not combine two purchases into one?\nThen came Black Friday . Best Buy was selling the entry-level Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core m3 plus a keyboard for $600. By comparison, Apple's beautifully designed m3-powered 12-inch MacBook , which I also had my eye on, starts at $1,300.\nEnlarge Image Apple's super-svelte 12-inch MacBook is powered by an Intel Core m3 chip and starts at $1,300.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET I haven't tried the entry-level version of the Surface Pro 4, but I have tried step-up models with Core i5 and Core i7 chips. I like the Type keyboard cover well enough, although my one gripe is that the integrated touchpad isn't nearly as good as the MacBook's (using a wireless mouse or Surface Pen for navigation is my preference). I may be slightly more partial to Mac OS X, but I'm also a little bored with it, and have never had anything against Windows 10 , so it's all good.\nAm I open to another tablet PC or lightweight convertible PC (a laptop that converts into a tablet)? Microsoft's Surface Book , for example, or something from Lenovo or HP? Sure, but for the moment I've zeroed in on the Surface Pro 4. It's a mature product, on its fourth iteration with presumably a fifth-generation model coming next year, and there are deals to be had on it.\nAs part of its 12 Days of Deals sale, on Thursday, December 8, Microsoft will have the entry-level m3-powered Pro 4 on sale for $649 (with a sleeve but no a keyboard cover) and on Friday, December 16, it's offering a $200 discount on select Pro 4 models, with a free Type Cover thrown in. And I wouldn't be surprised to see post-holiday sales on select Surface Book Pro 4 models.\nI'm not sure that \" Apple just handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom ,\" as my colleague Sean Hollister wrote shortly after Apple first unveiled the new MacBook Pros. But those high prices on MacBooks have certainly opened the door to folks to look elsewhere for a more-affordable lightweight laptop that has the added appeal of doubling as a tablet.\nIf Microsoft could improve its Windows app store -- and by improve, I mean offer a wider range of cheap apps to compete with Apple's huge selection of iOS apps -- it'd be a no-brainer. However, as it stands, depending on the deal you can get, it may be a jump worth making.\n25 Tablets and e-book readers you'll want on your holiday wish list ",

      "title": "Apple Music hits 20 million subscribers by focusing on Hip-Hop",
      "text": "Written by Jim Dalrymple \nIn an interview with Billboard today, Apple’s Eddy Cue revealed that Apple Music has surpass 20 million paid subscribers. There are a few other tidbits of info in the article as well. \nAnd despite a mandate from Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge, exclusives will continue in the near future “where appropriate,” adds Cue. “They work really well for everybody concerned — they’re great for the label, they work for the artist and for us.” \nExclusives drive numbers and a subscription service is all about churning people, hopefully adding more in the top than those falling out the bottom. Apple is perfecting it. \n“We’ve always thought that hip-hop was underrepresented both in iTunes and in the streaming chart. And more people listen to hip-hop now than ever before so we’ve done a lot of work in that area.” \nI’ve said this since the launch of Apple Music, but it seems very clear now. “Music” is no longer in Apple’s DNA—hip-hop is what’s important to Apple. Again, it’s a numbers game. More people are listening to that genre than ever before, so Apple can leave the Rock/Blues/Metal acts to another service and still add subscribers using hip-hop exclusives. It’s actually refreshing to see Apple finally admit it. \nPeople like me with an existing music library that rely on the often non-working iTunes Match are no longer Apple’s market. I even opened up a second Apple Music account to see if iTunes Match would work—it didn’t. \nIn a lot of ways it makes perfect sense that Apple is building a music service that doesn’t require a music library—there’s less hassle and they don’t have to rely on services like iTunes Match to please those customers. Apple is catering to those customers very well. However, it’s a shame they don’t care about the rest of us any more. \nWhat Apple will recognize is that the people they attract with exclusives will go to the next music service that has an exclusive without blinking an eye or without any loyalty to Apple. By that time, the base of users that they’ve relied on for years will also be gone. \nAnd the churn continues. ",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple is known as one of the most secretive technology companies out there, oftentimes hiding breakthroughs and advances inside of its walls. But that attitude might soon change, albeit to a small extent, as the iPhone-maker is promising to publish some of its artificial intelligence research. \nVery recently, investors were criticizing Apple , and saying that the company’s position in the coming decade may be a lot less privileged than it currently is. That’s because smartphones, which account for a huge part of Apple’s revenues and profits, will take a backseat to technologies like AI, augmented reality, and other services where Apple is just a novice. Its closed and secretive nature was also viewed as a potential issue for the company as the fields in question often rely on open technologies, collaborations with academic institutions, and a lot of basic research done out in the open. Apple will start publishing, according to @rsalakhu at #nips2016 pic.twitter.com/I0ndKKc2vB — hardmaru (@hardmaru) December 6, 2016 \nNow Apple, at least to some extent, seems to be addressing those very concerns. The company’s AI director, Russ Salakhutdinov has unofficially announced Apple would start publishing research and engaging more with academic institutions next year. \nThe company is also likely looking to entice the research community and young engineers and scientists to work for them. It’s hard to tell devoted researchers they can’t share their advances and discoveries with their peers because they’re Apple’s trade secrets, so a softening of this stance may help Apple garner new talent in the long-term. \nSource: Twitter Via: Engadget | Siri image via Shutterstock Tags",

      "text": "Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions \nWednesday, December 07, 2016 Tweet \nSAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — Apple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the Government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. \nThe company is “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”, Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) offering Apple’s opinion about draft regulations for the sector. \n“Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realised safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,” the company’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems”, an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP . \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” \nRumours about Apple’s ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organisation called ‘Project Titan’ that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook’s comments have fuelled speculation. \nAfter a US$1-billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of “some strategic things that the companies can do together over time”. \nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project’s “reboot”. \nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalise new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n“To maximise the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” it says. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to “build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone”. \nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles — considered to be the future of the automobile — along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020.

Of course, while all this happened around us, we were busy staring down at our phones and using the many apps we downloaded in 2016. But what enslaved us to our palms the most over the past 12 months? Well, after Apple released details about the downloads from its App Store, we now have the answer. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below © Digital Spy When it came to our iPhones, it turns out Face Swap Live was the most popular paid app — meaning that the notion of seeing all your mates with your facial features didn't get old, after all. And despite recently announcing it would ditch users running older iOS software or iPhone models , messaging giant WhatsApp was the most downloaded free app of the year. Meanwhile, Apple Music's big rival Spotify rounded out 2016 as the top grossing iPhone app. It's not all about what's going on in your pocket, though. In fact, the apps being downloaded onto iPads differ greatly from its pint-sized equivalent. Drake is the King of iTunes' Best of 2016 charts While everyone is seemingly using their slate to get a better look at YouTube — the most popular free app — gaming managed to break into the top spot of the paid and top grossing sector. Continuing its domination of rush-hour commutes and Facebook notification tabs, Candy Crush Saga was announced as the top grossing app of the year, while Minecraft was crowned as the top paid download.

      "title": "Apple Joins The Motorway!",
      "text": "by Graham Pierrepoint \nThe concept of the driverless car, surprisingly, isn’t anything too new – after all, only a year ago we were discussing Google’s autonomous car catching people’s eyes in their local Palo Alto – but we could well be seeing cars without drivers hitting our roads in the next few years and a number of companies and manufacturers are more than keen to show their interest in the trend. Google, famously, are at the forefront of the race – and while some may be concerned that it’s a concept that could encourage bullying from human drivers (and that there may be underlying safety issues in general), driverless cars are very much going to be part of our future regardless of where we may stand with them.\n\nFollowing rumors that have spread via the press over the past few years, Apple have finally announced that they are to develop their own driverless cars, possibly intending to throw their hat into the ring against Google. It was confirmed in a letter from the firm’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, that Apple is currently investing in automation and that transportation is just one area in which they are keen to research the applicability of machine learning. The letter was written to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and while it gave little insight into what form future projects from Apple may take, it has instead made it clear that the firm is interested in the future of automation and that it may be technology that saves lives. \n\nEven governments are preparing themselves for a future of automated cars – it’s thought that the UK are seeking to make amendments to their highway code to allow the vehicles to take to the road legally by 2020 – meaning that we will likely be driving shoulder-to-shoulder with ghosts by the start of the next decade. It will certainly be a remarkable technological revolution to kick start the new twenties!\n\nHow exactly Apple will take on vehicle automation will remain to be seen, but suffice to say many are excited about where the firm will go with the technology – once again pitting the firm against the likes of Google in an attempt to fill the roads with robots. Perhaps in as little as five years’ time you could have your very own robot on four wheels sitting in your garage – it’s not too difficult to dream!",

According to a MacRumors report, Apple on its website has included details about third party service providers authorised by the company. So, when a user logs in to the website to search for a person or place to replace or repair some damaged part of the iPhone or Mac, the company directs him/her to third party repair options and not just its own stores. Apple will book appointments with the authorised third party as well. \nThis might appear to be a small change, but long time iPhone and iPad users will swear by the fact that Apple stores in big towns and cities have long waiting for queues, as well as waiting time can extend to as much as a week or two. Apple has authorised some shops which the company has assessed that they can work as AppleCare repair and out-of-warranty fix shop as well. These shops may not look as great, minimalist and fancy as Apple’s regular stores but since they might be able to fix your iPhone or MacBook within a day, you can be happy about it. This is also good news for Apple stores in busy areas which are unable to keep up with the increasing consumer demands and provide quicker service. \nWhat else is making news: \nWhile on the repair website, you try to find the fault with your product by using Apple’s support prompts, and you fail and click on ‘Bring in for Repair’ the website shows you every repair centres near you. The search results include the company’s own retail stores and retail locations where you may get Apple Authorized Service Centre repairs. The website also lists availability so that you can check for the place which can give you the fastest service. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo After teasing the feature at WWDC in June , Apple on Tuesday finally rolled single sign-on to iOS and tvOS users. Brace yourselves, because things are about to get very confusing. You don’t need a degree in astrophysics to understand Apple’s new feature but the company sure tries its hardest to make things complicated.\nThe feature is only support by a handful of providers right now, listed below:\nCenturyLink Prism DirecTV Dish GVTC GTA Hawaiian Telcom Hotwire MetroCast Sling That’s an incredibly limited launch lineup. Notable absentees include Comcast, VerizonFiOS, and Time Warner Cable. Apple says many more providers are expected to support the feature, so don’t switch your plan just yet. But, obviously, your options are limited right now.\nThe Cupertino company also notes that even if your provider supports single sign-on, some apps may still need to be signed in individually if they aren’t updated.\nComplicating matters even more is the fact that supported apps may differ depending on if you’re using iOS or tvOS. Below is the full list of apps that support the new feature as of Dec. 6, with more to come in the future.\nSingle sign-on is underwhelming right now Not exactly what we were hoping for. Big names such as HBO, Showtime, and WatchESPN don’t support the feature at the moment, so you’ll have to wait for an update.\nSingle sign-on is one of many exciting new features meant to beef up Apple’s TV ambitions. In an upcoming update, the company is also expected to release a new TV app , which is a one-stop-shop for accessing shows and movies from third-party video apps.\n\n\nSource : Apple \nVia : 9to5Mac ",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has said time and again that he wants to convince Apple to make iPhones in America. At least some of them. Talking to Apple CEO Tim Cook about the matter after his big win, Trump reiterated his desire to see Apple manufacture products in America . While it’s too early to actually see an iPhone made in America, there’s one more sign that such a move might actually be possible.\nTrump on Tuesday met Masayoshi Son, the head of Japan’s SoftBank Group, who later announced a commitment to invest $50 billion in America and create more than 50,000 jobs. But that’s not the only Asia-based tycoon looking to expand to the US. Foxconn, the company that manufactures the iPhone in China for Apple, is apparently in preliminary discussions to expand its US operations. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nPokemon Go just got a new update, but it’s not the exciting release you wanted 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time BlackBerry’s final smartphone will be as bad as ever, leaked images claim ",

      "text": "Apple's iTunes is usually adept at unearthing the right artwork for albums in your library. Whether you purchase an album through iTunes or rip one of your CDs into your collection, Apple's music player relies on a database called Gracenote to snag album artwork and other data.\nBut iTunes can get stumped if the album isn't in the Gracenote database. So how do you then find the right cover art for your albums? Read on for more.\nLet's say you buy an album from iTunes or you rip a CD. iTunes consults the Gracenote database to locate the correct cover art for your album. Oops, the right art isn't popping up. In that case, iTunes either applies the wrong art for your album or simply displays its own generic musical note icon instead.\n\nSo what do you do in this case?\nWell, you can right-click on an album without artwork. From the pop-up menu, click on the command that says: \"Get album artwork.\" If the artwork is accessible, iTunes will apply it to your album. If not, iTunes displays the dreaded message: \"Artwork for [album name] could not be found.\"\n\nHmm, so is it time to admit defeat? Nope. Here's your next step. You can search for the right image art online using your favorite search engine, such as Google or Bing. From there you can save a copy of the image file and then upload it into your iTunes album. Let's try it.\nFind an album that has stumped iTunes. Fire up your Web browser and launch Google or Bing. In the search field, type the full name of the album. In some cases, also include the artist's name if the album name is very generic. You'll hopefully receive the right search results in response.\n\nBut we want to narrow down the results only to images. So click on the Images category for Google or Bing. In response, you'll see a series of thumbnail images for the album's cover art.\n\nClick on one of the images to display it in a larger format. Right-click on the larger thumbnail and from the pop-up menu, click on the command to \"Save image as.\"\n\nYour browser should prompt you to save the image file in the location of your choice or it may automatically save it in your Downloads folder. Either way, save the file. Make note of the file name since it will probably be a messy mixture of alphanumeric characters. Be sure to save the file as a JPG or other common image format.\n\nNow return to iTunes, right-click on the album to which you want to apply the artwork. From the pop-up menu, click on the \"Get info\" command.\n\nAt the Info window, click on the second tab for Artwork and click on the button to \"Add Artwork.\"\n\nAt the File Explorer or Windows Explorer window, double-click on the album art image file that you just downloaded.\n\nThe image appears in the Artwork window. Click OK.\n\nThe image now displays as the cover art for the album you chose.",
