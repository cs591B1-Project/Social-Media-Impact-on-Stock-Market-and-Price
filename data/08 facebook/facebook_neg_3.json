Getty Images/EyeEm \nIf 2016 hasn't killed you yet, Facebook might. \nOn Friday afternoon, some of the social media network's users reported something awry headlining their profile pages: their own deaths. \nAmong the affected were several U.S. News employees, including associate editor Darian Somers , who found the following message headlining his profile page after logging in: \n\"We hope people who love Darian will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life. Learn more about memorialized accounts and the legacy contact setting on Facebook.\" \nLast year, Facebook unveiled the \" legacy contact \" option as a way for people to assign a person to manage their profiles posthumously. \nU.S. News has reached out to Facebook for comment. \nIn the meantime, here's what the dearly departed are saying on Twitter: in other news, Facebook's algorithm thinks that i ****died**** based on the messages i'm getting #RIPme pic.twitter.com/IfoCDumNCi — Elaine Filadelfo (@ElaineF) November 11, 2016 Life is meaningless and then we die pic.twitter.com/zFqC46uD87 — Carolyn Lasky (@carolaskyn) November 11, 2016 Facebook thinks I’m dead pic.twitter.com/rcrrGtbG7O",

      "text": "TWEET Pantsuit Nation , a private Facebook group that started as a place for a handful of Hillary Clinton supporters to share their excitement and quickly swelled to almost 3 million members, just got an Election Day treat — a message from HRC herself. The Facebook group was started shortly after the final presidential debate by Maine resident Libby Chamberlain, CNN reports, who wanted to rally Clinton supporters around Clinton's signature pantsuit-look — but it quickly became a place for people, Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, to share their reasons for supporting Clinton, their disputes with friends and relatives and their unbridled excitement for the candidate they hope will become the first female president. \nPantsuitNation just posted they're receiving 200 posts submitted EVERY MINUTE and have 18K in queue to review. On Tuesday evening, as millions of Americans were still lining up at the polls, Jenna Lowenstein , the digital director for Hillary for America, shared a message from Clinton herself — saying that she had brought the group to Clinton's attention Tuesday morning and Clinton \"wanted to say thanks directly.\" The note from Clinton began \"Dear Pantsuit Nation (have you ever heard a better name?!),\" and thanked the group's members for their support. \"Your stories and photos of family members and friends are wonderful to see, but what truly warms my heart is the thousands of comments of support and love you all send to each other,\" Clinton said in the note that Lowenstein shared. \nHillary Clinton left this note in the Pantsuit Nation FB group and now I'll truly never stop crying ? ?? https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwxPSUEWIAEfxAc.jpg:large Just an hour after it had been shared, Clinton's message to the Pantsuit Nation Facebook group had more than 40,000 likes and thousands of comments — many thanking Clinton for her candidacy and addressing her (a bit prematurely) as Madam President. No matter the outcome on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton just made her supporters in Pantsuit Nation very, very happy. Like us on Facebook: ",

Authorities in North Carolina suspect arson in more than 20 wildfires burning in a national forest. And in Kentucky, a wannabe weatherman faces an arson charge after police said he admitted starting a fire to draw attention to his Facebook selfie videos.\n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens said Friday after Johnny Mullins, 21, was jailed this week on a second-degree arson charge.\n\"He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,\" the chief said. \"He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff.\"\n\"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,\" Stephens added.\nNo arrests were announced in most of the rest of the suspicious fires, which have been torching forests in and around the southern Appalachian mountains. The relentless drought across much of the South has removed the usual humidity and sucked wells and streams dry, making the woods ripe for fire.\nTens of thousands of acres have burned, about a dozen of the largest fires remain uncontained and many people to evacuate their homes ahead of fast-moving flames.\nLaw officers in Georgia's Rabun County suspect that someone started a series of small roadside fires Wednesday that eventually merged into the much larger blazes firefighters were working to contain on Friday, said Justin Upchurch, the county's assistant fire chief.\n© The Associated Press People take photos of a wildfire burning near Lake Lure, N.C., Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. A state of emergency is in effect for 25 western North Carolina counties where active wildfires are burning, caused by the drought that began last spring. Gov. Pat McCrory said in a news release Thursday that he was declaring the state of emergency for one-quarter of North Carolina's 100 counties. (Patrick Sullivan/The Times-News via AP) The Rabun County sheriff's office urged people to be on the look-out, saying the SUV was last seen in the area of the fires. The office was more emphatic in a separate Facebook post, asking residents to spread the word \"and help us lock this criminal up!!!\"\nThe area is less than 50 miles from North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, where more than 20 wildfires that have burned more than 17,000 acres are all \"being investigated for suspected arson,\" forestry officials announced in a status update.\nThere were 14 other wildfires burning on Cherokee Nation land in North Carolina, all under investigation by local law enforcement. A fire managers' update noted that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs is seeking information about fires on Indian lands through an arson hotline.\nStates of emergency were declared in some of the affected areas to facilitate state and federal spending on the response.\nMore than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have joined the effort, said Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation management for the southern region of the U.S. Forest Service. About 40 aircraft are involved, including three large air tankers flying out of Chattanooga, Tennessee.\nThe national drought report shows 41.6 million people in parts of 15 Southern states living in drought conditions. The worst is in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, but extreme drought also is spreading into the western Carolinas. Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina all have fierce fires.\nOne of the largest blazes was spreading rapidly in the Cohutta Wilderness area just south of the Georgia-Tennessee line. Nearly 300 people are battling that fire, which already consumed about 15 square miles, the Forest Service said.\nSmoke from the fires has made North Carolina's largest city a Code Orange zone for air quality, meaning anyone with breathing problems could suffer. The Charlotte Observer reports that the heavy haze and smoky conditions should make people limit outdoor activities.\nThat apparently isn't stopping organizers of this weekend's Charlotte Marathon. They said Friday that they do not expect the wildfire smoke to impact Saturday's races, which include a marathon, half-marathon, 5K run/walk, marathon relay and a kids 1-mile fun run.\n___\nReynolds Yonker reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is pushing back against charges that the proliferation of fake news on Facebook was one of the factors that contributed to Donald Trump’s meteoric rise to the White House. \n“To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. He insisted only a “small amount” of fake news circulated on Facebook during this campaign, an unprecedented race that unfolded on social media as much as it unfolded on the physical campaign trail. \nZuckerberg’s strongly worded dismissal is unlikely to end the controversy over fake news on Facebook. Nearly half of Americans get their news from the social network, according to the Pew Research Center. His comments add another layer to the increasingly complicated and consequential conversation about the role that fake news plays in today’s divided media landscape.\nZuckerberg argued the focus on fake news stories planted by groups seeking to profit from page views or sway public opinion just distracts people from examining the real reasons Donald Trump won enough support to pull off a historic election upset. \n“I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,” Zuckerberg said, according to USA Today. “If you believe that, then I don’t think you have internalized the message the Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.”\nIn a statement, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that “there’s so much more” the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform.\nPlay Video CBSN Facebook apologizes for \"trending\" fake news story A fake news story about Megyn Kelly's relationship with Fox News was one of the top trending stories on Facebook. CNET's Dan Ackerman explains ho... \nFor some in Silicon Valley, the criticism of Facebook feels more than appropriate.\n“It is a very good thing if people in Silicon Valley are contemplating the consequences of the inventions they delivered to an unsuspecting world,” Silicon Valley forecaster Paul Saffo told USA Today . “The fact that there’s any reflection going on at all is a very good sign. There has long been this naive view that technology is neutral and there’s nothing neutral about technology. The problem is we can never figure out which way it’s going to cut until it arrives.”\nPresident Obama himself called out Facebook at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton on the eve of the election.\n“People, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it’s on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it’s on social media, people start believing it,” he said. “And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.”\nFake stories have long run rampant on Facebook — both on users’ News Feeds , as users share content from inauthentic news sites to their personal networks, and on Trending Topics , the homepage module on Facebook’s desktop site that presents viral stories of the moment. (Speaking of misinformation: Just today, Facebook was rocked by an apparent bug that led to numerous users being told, mistakenly, that their friends were dead via memorial banners on their profiles.) \nFacebook has little control over what users themselves share to their own networks. Its algorithm promotes content based on engagement levels, and Facebook doesn’t make any kind of “value judgment” on the nature of the content that’s being shared, CNET editor Dan Ackerman told CBS News. \nPlay Video CBS This Morning Mark Zuckerberg tops Fortune's Businessperson of the Year Fortune magazine is revealing its Businessperson of the Year list. They evaluated 10 different metrics, including company financial performance. ... \nBut recent investigative pieces have pulled back the curtain on the vast landscape of highly partisan operations that live only on Facebook and gained extraordinary momentum this campaign season. These hundreds of pages, from Occupy Democrats to Fed-Up Americans to RightAlerts to Addicting Info, represent the “most disruptive, least understood force in media,” The New York Times wrote in August.  \nFacebook has somewhat clearer control over Trending Topics, a feature that has been under fire in recent months for showcasing both conspiracy theories and false news reports. Facebook, which once employed a team of news curators to monitor and edit the Trending Topics section, laid off that team after an ex-staffer made anonymous claims that the section showed a  consistent bias against conservative-interest news stories . Since August, Trending Topics has been controlled by algorithm rather than human curators.\nThat move, however, did not mean the end to Facebook’s headaches. \nIn August, Facebook apologized after Trending Topics promoted a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, whose critical coverage of Donald Trump led the GOP nominee to launch a targeted campaign against her. The story, which falsely claimed that the cable channel had fired Kelly for being “a closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win,” was from the right-wing website End The Fed. \nIn September, news organizations and social media users sounded the alarm after Facebook’s Trending section promoted a so-called “9/11 truther” circulating the false claim that bombs and not terrorist-piloted planes brought down the Twin Towers in Manhattan. Under fire, Facebook removed the story from its Trending section.\nSocial media’s impact in shaping public perception and civic engagement is undeniable. Twenty percent of people surveyed say they have modified a personal stance because of content they saw on social media, according to the Pew Research Center. President-Elect Donald Trump’s largest megaphone this campaign was his Twitter account .\nFacebook seems to be trying to have it both ways, Ackerman told CBS News.\n“The paradox for Facebook and Zuckerberg is this: They want to claim very loudly that Facebook is very influential when it comes to choosing what car you’re going to buy, what phone you’re going to buy, what movie you’re going to go see,” Ackerman said. “And then they want to say they’re not really influential when it comes to these news stories affecting people’s election choices.” \nEmily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, issued a call for Facebook to take more responsibility for the proliferation of obvious propaganda on its platform.\n“Facebook, now the most influential and powerful publisher in the world, is becoming the “I didn’t do it” boy of global media,” she wrote. “Clinton supporters and Trump detractors are searching for reasons why a candidate who lied so frequently and so flagrantly could have made it to the highest office in the land. News organizations, particularly cable news, are shouldering part of the blame for failing to report these lies for what they were. But a largely hidden sphere of propagandistic pages that target and populate the outer reaches of political Facebook are arguably even more responsible.”\nWith more than one billion active daily users, Facebook is the world’s biggest distributor of information.",

      "text": "Check your Facebook account right now, you might be dead Oops. Facebook made a big mistake. It is reporting that people are dead. More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 11, 2016 1:19 PM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS I was a little stunned to hear the news . It turns out Facebook thinks I’m dead . See the image above. I opened my Facebook page and was going to change my Facebook profile picture. At the top, there’s a rather morbid notice. It says: “We hope people who love John will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.” Hold on there, for a second. Something is not quite right. For starters, who writes these memorials? There are a few issues, other than the obvious one that I’m still alive and well. So, the people who love me are going to go on Facebook and find out I’m deceased, apparently, and take comfort in a bunch of random thoughts and photos from people who don't love me. I guess when I finally do kick the bucket, it won’t bother me that someone dug up an old photo of me finishing a bike race or hugging one of my kids, but could they have worded it a little better? It seems like a bad newspaper memorial from the 70s, written by an intern. Also, did I mention it's a mistake? This is a widespread problem. Facebook, which obviously is having some trouble with their code right now (per the chatter on Twitter), is already under fire because people are blaming the immensely popular social network for allowing so much hate speech during the election cycle. It was quite the gutter grind. Almost every day, I’d see vitriol from both sides of the aisle to the point where I decided to stop reading most comments, even from friends. Now this? I can see slip ups happening like a weird news link or maybe some fake news from a content farm (that’s a problem, too), but social networking might need to do some better quality checks. I can’t think of anything worse than telling everyone I know I’m dead. What are the implications? They are not too severe. The notice only appeared for a while--long enough for me to write this post, anyway. And, long enough to have a discussion with my editors about it, and send a quick text to my wife telling her not to check Facebook. I jumped over to a few more profiles and saw the same notices. I know of at least one person who is likely incredibly offended by this because a loved one did recently die, and the Facebook page has become a memorial. I’m not sure how I feel about keeping these accounts open. My view is that it might be better to remove the account, mostly because I would not want people posting anything negative about someone who has died, which could be incredibly hurtful to family and friends who visit the profile. As it stands, it is a glitch. Nothing serious. But it is also another hink in the Facebook armor. I am not sure if a distant friend of family member out there checked my page and is filling out a card right now and ordering flowers. If you do, please make a donation in my name. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join? RELATED TOPICS",

(Photo: David Wallace / The Republic) \nWinning an election doesn’t make a person more honorable or more worthy. \nSo why did Donald Trump’s victory turn Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake into Sen. Namby and Sen. Pamby? \nThey spoke the truth about Trump before the election. Now, they grovel. \nIt took McCain a long time, but he finally said in October of Trump, “Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.” Adding, “Cindy (his wife) and I will not vote for Donald Trump.” 'America deserves better' - until Trump wins \nFlake had been a consistent Trump critic. He said, “What Trump has been willing to do is say terrible things about women, mock the disabled, disparage minorities, impugn the character of POWs, and go after the Gold Star parents of a fallen U.S. soldier. I’m not OK with that…” \nAnd he added, “America deserves better than Trump.” \nTrump trashed McCain and Flake, and kept at it throughout the campaign. \nMONTINI: McCain schools Trump on accepting election results \nThen he won. \nAnd McCain tweeted, “Congrats to President-Elect Donald Trump. As Chairman of the Armed Service Committee, I’ll work to confront national security challenges and support troops.” \nAnd Flake tweeted, “Congrats to President-Elect Trump on a big win and a gracious and healing speech. I look forward to working with him. Now, back to eating crow.” \nEating crow? Trump doesn't deserve respect, his office does \nDoes that fact that Trump won the election make him worthy? Does it suddenly make it okay he boasted on a hot mic that “stars” like him can do “anything” to attractive women, including grabbing them “by the p***y.” \nDoes it excuse all the other things he’s said and done? \nThen again, Trump won. He will be the next president. And doesn’t the president-elect, no matter who that is, deserve our deference and respect? \nNo. \nThe presidency deserves our respect. \nThe office. Arizona deserves better than this, too \nRepublicans like Flake and McCain have shown a lot less respect to President Obama, who has said or done nothing even close to the kind of things Trump has said and done. \nThere’s no reason for our senators to meekly knuckle under now. There's no upside. Trump’s supporters will never forgive Flake or McCain for criticizing their man. Neither will Trump himself. So be honest. Don't trade in your ethics. Your dignity. \n“America deserves better than Trump,” Flake said. \nYes. \nAnd Arizona deserves better than … jellyfish. Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2fiNpam Most Popular",

      "text": "Single mother in California facing imprisonment over private transaction on Facebook food group \n  by: Daniel Barker Tags: Mariza Ruelas , food freedom , California (NaturalNews) A single Californian mom with six children is facing a possible jail sentence for selling homemade food on a Facebook community food group.Several years ago, Stockton resident Mariza Ruelas joined a Facebook food and recipe trading group called 209 Food Spot. There, Ruelas and other cooking enthusiasts would trade recipes, organize pot luck dinners, and sometimes sell their home cooking to group members who lived nearby.Occasionally, Ruelas would sell or trade her signature version of ceviche – a classic Latin-American seafood dish – to friends or contacts on 209 Food Spot.One day, she received an order for her ceviche through the Facebook group from a person whom she thought was just another food enthusiast, but who in fact was a San Joaquin County undercover agent. Sting operation targets dangerous moms and their home cooking Ruelas and a dozen other members of the group were the target of an elaborate sting operation that was apparently needed to make sure moms don't make a little extra cash selling their homemade cooking to other food lovers.The offenders were charged with running food operations and engaging in business without proper permits.All of the others charged accepted plea bargains involving probation, fines and community service, but Ruelas refused to give in and decided to fight her case in court.If she loses, she faces up to two years behind bars.\"It was just, like, unreal that they were saying that you could face up to a year in jail,\" Ruelas told Fox News .On Facebook, Ruelas wrote:\"It was just some cooking me and my daughters would do for fun on a weekend we didn't have anything to do.\"Never tried to be in business. Never tried making an extreme amount of money. I just enjoy cooking. Not something I want to do daily lol or even weekly.\" Prosecutors punish defendant for refusing unfair plea agreement Ruelas chose to fight the charges because she felt that the terms of her plea bargain offer were unreasonable, and that she had received a harsher sentence for being outspoken.From The Los Angeles Times :\"Most of the offers gave the defendants a year of probation, 40 hours of community service and $250 in fines. But Ruelas said hers was different – she was offered three years' probation and 80 hours of community service. She said it was her punishment for refusing to take down her posts about the ceviche incident from social media.\"In fact, just after Ruelas refused to accept the plea agreement, prosecutors, instead of revising the plea bargain terms, decided to pursue two additional misdemeanor charges against the defendant. If those charges stick, Ruelas could serve as much as two years jail time.The absurdity of this case is staggering. However necessary food safety laws may be, they are obviously not intended in spirit to apply to those who share – and yes, occasionally sell – their home cooking as a hobby.It's reasonably safe to assume that Mariza Ruelas gained a following for her ceviche because it was fresh, tasty and prepared with the kind of care that moms are famous for.Meanwhile, fast food companies sell poisonous industrial garbage that is killing people and causing disease, GMO agricultural corporations spray their Frankenfood crops with carcinogens before foisting them on the public, and grocery store shelves are lined with processed foods that contain lots of contaminants and little nutrition.But none of them are subject to criminal charges. Instead, imprisonment for food safety violations seems to be reserved only for people like Mariza Ruelas.Nice to know that our tax dollars are being put to good use in funding elaborate sting operations designed to prevent us from ever having a chance to taste Mariza's specialty dishes.

      "text": "Facebook disables settings that let advertisers exclude jobs, housing content based on race Social media giant keeps 'ethnic affinities' tool open for other 'non-discriminatory uses' Thomson Reuters Posted: Nov 11, 2016 3:41 PM ET Last Updated: Nov 11, 2016 3:43 PM ET Facebook says it will no longer let advertisers exclude people based on race from seeing housing, credit or employment ads. (Eric Gaillard/Reuters) Related Stories Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news \nFacebook said on Friday it would no longer allow certain advertisers to exclude racial or ethnic groups when placing ads on its service, following criticism that the practice was discriminatory. \nFacebook will disable use of the advertising tool, called \"ethnic affinities,\" for ads that offer housing, employment and the extension of credit; areas where certain groups have historically faced discrimination, Facebook said in a blog post. \n\"There are many of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, wrote in a post . \nFacebook collects vast amounts of data on its users, including photographs, allowing it to demographically categorize them in ways that allow advertisers to precisely target content to those they want to reach. ProPublica outed the practice \nThe company said it will now use tools that automatically detect and disable ads offering housing, employment or credit that rely on ethnic affinity marketing, Egan said. \nIt will also update its policies to more explicitly require advertisers to not engage in discriminatory advertising. \nThe changes come two weeks after ProPublica, a non-profit investigative news organization, published an article showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude groups on the basis of ethnic affinities, a practice it said may violate federal housing and civil rights laws passed in the 1960s. ProPublica purchased a housing ad and chose the following parameters in order report on the company's 'ethnic affinities' option. (ProPublica) \nA group of Facebook users filed a lawsuit against the company after the ProPublica report, claiming such ad targeting violated the Fair Housing Act and Civil Rights Act. Under fire for fake news \nThe move comes amid growing scrutiny of how the world's largest online social media network's policies and algorithms shape what content appears in a user's news feed. Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news \nThe unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election this week has prompted questions over how much voters were swayed by inaccurate or misleading news items shared on Facebook, mostly in favor of Trump. \nFacebook has attracted criticism in recent months for how it polices several forms of content for its 1.8 billion users, including extremist propaganda, nudity and misleading or inaccurate political articles. \nOn Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg rejected those claims. \n\"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, (which is) a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said at a technology conference in California.",

It’s proven to become one of the biggest online shopping days in the world. \nVendors were spotted preparing for the madness with hundreds of products ready to be sold to the singles. REUTERS REUTERS \nAlthough I am a little upset America doesn’t celebrate the many glories of being relationship-less, I really enjoyed knowing the single ladies and gents overseas were able to celebrate their solitude. \nToday’s date, November 11, was carefully chosen since the number “1” represents being alone. \nClever, guys! Ha, I’m fine. Giphy \nI know the name might sound intimidating, and you might not want to celebrate the fact you don’t have a boyfriend or girlfriend — I totally get it! \nBut rest assured there’s a lot more focus on shopping than your love life during Singles’ Day. \nAccording to Business Insider, sales on the holiday have surpassed sales on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nIt’s also been reported sales on Singles’ Day still continue to grow each year (I guess all these dating apps are failing us all). Giphy \nYou know what that means? A LOT of single people are treating themselves with presents, and I’m in full support of it. \nIn fact, I think I’ll take a short trip to China next November if I’m still alone (which is very, very likely). \nAs much as I bitch and whine about being single, I guess I’m not alone. I’m also thrilled to know I’m not the only person who takes advantage of retail therapy. \nHopefully, some of the shoppers at the Singles’ Day festival in China will find lovers. \nIf not, I’m sure their closets will be nice and full with brand-new wardrobes.

      "title": "This Chelsea Clinton Rumor Could Lighten The Blow Of Hillary’s Loss",
      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nThe Clinton name might not be done in politics yet. \nAccording to a report from the New York Post , Chelsea Clinton could be ready to take up her mother’s mantle and jump into the political arena. REUTERS \nThe Post quoted a source as saying, \nWhile it is true the Clintons need some time to regroup after Hillary’s crushing loss, they will not give up. Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail. \nSources have reportedly informed the Post that Chelsea is being “groomed” to be the successor for Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the 79-year-old democrat who represents the 17th district of New York. REUTERS \nThe district includes Chappaqua, where Bill and Hillary reside. \nAnd while Chelsea has an apartment in New York City, the Post reports her parents purchased a $1 million home for their daughter and her husband. \nThis is sure to come as welcome news for some Hillary supporters, as one of the few things that has given hope to people who were devastated by Tuesday night’s result is the future. \nWhat can be done? What can we change? Who will help us change it? \nThose are just a few of the questions left-leaning voters were likely to ask themselves this week, and it looks like there might be a pleasantly surprising answer to the latter. \nWhile politics isn’t the life Hillary wanted for Chelsea, she chose to go on the campaign trail for her mother and has turned out to be very poised, articulate and comfortable with the visibility. \nOf course, there is another point to consider. \nIf this election is considered a rejection of the political “elite” (which is debatable, given Secretary Clinton’s win of the popular vote) the idea of another Clinton becoming a political star isn’t exactly as much of a slam dunk as you might have thought it was last week. One of the greatest honors of my life was voting for you today mom. As always, I'm beyond proud of you pic.twitter.com/d4azrAry0U \n— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) November 8, 2016 \nStill, the prospect of Chelsea following in her mother’s footsteps is cool.

      "text": "Amazon Like us on Facebook \nIf you managed to get your hands on the new Nintendo NES Classic today, consider yourself lucky. Like a scene out of the mid-1980s, the miniature game system—which comes pre-loaded with 30 classic video games—is flying off store shelves before it even touches them. While we can’t promise you’ll find one in your stocking this holiday season, we can share these fun facts about your favorite NES games. 1. THE KONAMI CODE’S ORIGINS ARE IN GRADIUS. \nWay back in 1985, Kazuhisa Hashimoto was working on the arcade game Gradius . Because he didn’t want to actually play the whole game during the testing process, he developed a little shortcut that gave him a full set of power-ups, letting him live long enough to easily get to where he needed to without dying. When the game went live in 1986, the code was still there. To get full power-ups, all a player had to do was enter the code up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. \nThe trick caught on, and soon, the so-called “ Konami Code ” could be found in a number of arcade and video games. Most notably, it gave you 30 extra lives in Contra . This super-secret (…or not) code has a special place in the hearts of geeks who have since grown up and used the insider code in websites, in movies, and on TV shows. 2. SUPER C USED A DIFFERENT CODE. \nThe original Contra was famous for featuring the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start) to score a player 30 lives. For whatever reason, Super C , the Contra sequel, instead used the code Right, Left, Down, Up, A, B, Start, which only gave a player 10 lives. 3. BALLOON FIGHT WAS ONE OF SATORU IWATA’S FIRST PROJECTS. \nBalloon Fight was one of the first games the late Satoru Iwata worked on as he began his career at Nintendo. He later went on to become Nintendo's president and CEO, presiding over the launches of the Nintendo DS and Wii. 4. BUBBLE BOBBLE IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN. \nBubble Bobble may seem rudimentary by today’s video game standards, but it proved that video games can be good for the brain. Educators praised the game’s ability to help kids overcome developmental challenges with its focus on problem-solving, strategy, and motor skills. 5. PIZZA INSPIRED PAC-MAN . YouTube \nIt’s not easy to create a game based solely on the concept of eating. But Namco employee Toru Iwatani did just that in 1980 by taking the idea of a pizza with a slice missing, and then having it eat a bunch of dots while being chased by ghosts in a maze. (Iwatani has also said that the shape is a rounded version of the square Japanese character for “mouth.\") The name of the game, Pakkuman , was inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeia, “paku-paku,\" which describes the sound of eating, similar to the English word “chomp.\" As the game was brought to market, the title morphed into Puck Man . \nBut when Puck Man made his way to North America there was concern that the arcade cabinets would be vandalized by making the P into an F to spell something entirely different. A compromise was reached and the game became known as Pac-Man instead. Thanks to the American marketing machine, the name Pac-Man was eventually adopted for the game all over the world. 6. AN ORIGINAL COPY OF CASTLEVANIA IS WORTH SOME SERIOUS CASH. \nThe Dracula-based video game Castlevania is particularly valuable these days. Sealed versions of the game sell for upwards of $900, depending on the condition. Original Nintendo NES editions of Castlevania and Castlevania 2 have sold for more than $950. 7. ICE CLIMBER GAVE BIRTH TO SUPER MARIO BROS. \nIce Climber was the first game that Kazuaki Morita worked on. He would go on to refine the game's formula for his next title at Nintendo: Super Mario Bros. , where the action moved horizontally instead of vertically. 8. THE REAL MARIO WAS A LANDLORD, NOT A PLUMBER. YouTube \nDuring the development of Donkey Kong, Jr. , a Nintendo employee reportedly pointed out that the character looked a lot like Mario Segale , the Italian landlord of Nintendo’s U.S. office. Thus, Mario was born. The original “Lady” character became “Pauline” at the same time in honor of one team member’s wife, Polly. 9. THE GAME VERSION OF MARIO WAS ORIGINALLY A CARPENTER. \nIn Mario's first appearance in Donkey Kong , he was portrayed as a carpenter . But after a colleague remarked that his overalls made him look more like a plumber, legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto changed the character's occupation. This alteration also led to the game being set underground in the pipe-populated sewers of New York City. 10. THE NEW YORK TIMES THOUGHT MARIO AND LUIGI WERE JANITORS. \nWhen longtime Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi passed away in 2013, The New York Times ran an obituary that quoted one of its own articles from 1988, in which Mario and Luigi were incorrectly described as janitors. On September 27, 2013—25 years after the article in question ran—the paper ran a correction : \n“An obituary on Sept. 20 about Hiroshi Yamauchi, the longtime president of Nintendo, included a quotation from a 1988 New York Times article that inaccurately described the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. 2. The brothers Mario and Luigi, who appear in this and other Nintendo games, are plumbers, not janitors.” 11. THERE’S AN EXCITEBIKE ARENA IN MARIO KART 8 . \nIn 2014's Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, an Excitebike arena became available as downloadable content (DLC), allowing the original game's 8-bit track to be played in a 3D environment. 12. FINAL FANTASY GOT ITS NAME FROM ITS CREATOR’S DESIRE TO RETIRE. \nOne of the most popular role-playing game franchises of all time got its name from almost becoming the last project its creator ever worked on. According to Hironobu Sakaguchi , he named the game he'd been working on Final Fantasy because he planned to quit the video-game industry if it didn't sell well. Despite the small staff of developers he was afforded for the game, it managed to sell—to the tune of 400,000 copies initially and a long list of sequels, spin-offs, and remastered releases in the years to come. Sakaguchi went on to serve for several years as President of Square USA, the company that first took a chance on Final Fantasy . 13. A U.S. COURT RULED THAT DONKEY KONG AND KING KONG ARE TWO DIFFERENT APES. \nFiled in 1982, argued in a federal court in May of 1984, and concluded that October, Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd . represented Universal’s demand for a piece of Nintendo’s Donkey Kong action. The game had pulled in $180 million in sales from around 60,000 arcade machines by 1982, and the studio alleged copyright infringement due to the titular villain’s resemblance to King Kong. \nAttorney John Kirby, Jr., who represented Nintendo (and for whom it's believed the company’s puffiest character was named, in thanks), pointed out that Universal itself had proved in the case of Universal City Studios, Inc. v. RKO General, Inc. that the plot and characters of King Kong were in the public domain. In the Nintendo case, the court ruled that Universal had acted in bad faith with the suit, had no right to the characters, and that, in any case, the studio had failed to prove that “there was any likelihood that an appreciable number of prudent purchasers [were] likely to be misled or confused as to the source of Donkey Kong ” based on the ape’s and the game’s attributes. 14. YES, METROID AND KID ICARUS ARE RELATED. \nIf you think Metroid and Kid Icarus are similar, there's a reason for that: They were both developed by the same team , including director Satoru Okada, co-director/artist Yoshio Sakamoto, and composer Hip Tanaka. 15. METROID LOOKED TO ALIEN FOR INSPIRATION. YouTube \nA fantastic game on its own, 1986's Metroid became the stuff of legends when it saved its biggest surprise for the final moments . After a player completed the game, a short scene revealed that the space-suited, missile-blasting hero was in fact (* gasp *) a woman! This shocking revelation wasn't something that had been planned from the start, and was instead the result of a programmer asking, “Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?” midway through the game's development. The Metroid team already counted Ridley Scott's female-led, sci-fi horror movie Alien as one of the game's chief inspirations, so they decided to run with that innocent suggestion—and the rest is gaming history. 16. WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHO JUSTIN BAILEY WAS. \nJustin Bailey was a programmer. Justin Bailey was an inside joke. Justin Bailey was referencing British slang for \"bathing suit.\" \nIf you played Metroid in the 1980s, chances are you’ve heard one of these explanations for the game’s most infamous password. Entering \" Justin Bailey \" and keying in an additional 12 blank spaces allowed players to begin the game with heroine Samus Aran appearing in a leotard instead of her armor while being supplied with a full arsenal of missiles. Where did he come from? Was he man or myth? Or was it all just one very weird fluke? \nTurns out, he could very well have just been a bored player who accidentally became the most famous (and hypothetical) NES gamer of all time. (Click here for a much more detailed explanation.) 17. THE ARCADE VERSION ENDING OF DOUBLE DRAGON II: THE REVENGE IS DIFFERENT FROM NINTENDO’S. \nThe end of Double Dragon II: The Revenge differs on both the NES and arcade. On the NES, damsel-in-distress Marian is brought back to life after being killed early in the story; the arcade version ends on a much more dour note, leaving her dead. You can compare both versions below: 18. A SEQUEL TO MEGA MAN 2 WAS ANNOUNCED, BUT NEVER MATERIALIZED. \nIn 2010, Capcom announced that it would release Mega Man Universe for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade the following year. The company promised that the new video game would have similar gameplay to Mega Man 2 and would give the player the ability to customize their own levels and stages. But a few months later, Capcom canceled the game and apologized to Mega Man fans who were anticipating the new release. \nCapcom didn’t disclose a specific reason why they canceled Mega Man Universe , instead citing “various circumstances,” which might have included the exit of the designer of Mega Man Universe , Keiji Inafune. \nIf Mega Man Universe had actually been released, it would have been the first time the character would have been called “Mega Man” in his native Japan. Historically, the character was called “Rock Man,\" but was changed when the video game was imported to the United States. 19. NINJA GAIDEN REVOLUTIONIZED THE CONCEPT OF CUTSCENES. \nNinja Gaiden 's director, Hideo Yoshizawa (credited as Sakurazaki), wanted the NES version of the game to have a much deeper story than the arcade version, so he implemented 20 minutes of cinematic cutscenes . Though standard now, a story told through cutscenes was revolutionary at the time. 20. BEFORE PUNCH-OUT! ’S OFFICIAL RELEASE, 10,000 JAPANESE FANS GOT A GOLD VERSION. YouTube \nNintendoficionados who submitted high scores from 1987’s Golf U.S. Course Famicom Tournament received gold-colored Famicom (the Japanese equivalent of the NES) cartridges containing Punch-Out! ’s near-identical precursor, with Super Macho Man as its final foe. 21. TO ADVANCE IN STARTROPICS , YOU NEEDED TO HAVE THE BOX. \nIn StarTropics , to advance the story, players were required to input a code that was attached to a letter . However, the letter didn’t exist in the game; it was physically included in the box the game came in. This obviously caused problems as players could easily lose it (or wind up with a rental copy lacking the letter at all) and be stuck forever, so Nintendo had to reprint the code in Nintendo Power magazine to try and help confused gamers. 22. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA ’S “ZELDA” IS NAMED AFTER ZELDA FITZGERALD. YouTube \nDespite being conceived in Japan, The Legend of Zelda ’s titular princess was named after a native Alabaman. Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that Zelda Fitzgerald—novelist, feminist, and wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald—was the inspiration for his Hyrulian heroine’s handle. 23. THERE IS SIGNIFICANCE TO LINK’S NAME, TOO. \nOriginally, The Legend of Zelda was meant to be a game that spanned in-universe time periods, beginning in the canonical “past” and ending up in the “future,” with the Triforce acting as a mode of transport between them. The series hero’s unusual moniker was meant to symbolize his role as a link between the eras. But Nintendo’s current position is that he is a “link” between the player and the game. 24. SHIGERU MIYAMOTO WAS DISAPPOINTED BY ZELDA II . \nWhen gaming site Kotaku asked Miyamoto if he’s ever made a bad game, the designer responded that Zelda II: The Adventure of Link didn’t live up to his expectations. “We could have done more with [ Link ],” he said. “It would have been nice to have had bigger enemies in the game, but the [NES] hardware wasn't capable of doing that.” 25. GHOSTS 'N GOBLINS IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOUGHEST VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME. YouTube \nNot only is Ghosts 'n Goblins known as one of the hardest games of all time , you actually have to beat it twice to actually complete it (it turns out the first play-through is all just a dream for the player).

      "text": "Disney | Katie Buckleitner 1. Gaston would stalk Belle on Facebook and Instagram instead of IRL. He keeps on identifying Belle as his wife on FB but her approval has been pending for three years. Meanwhile, his wall is filled with compliments and sexy selfies from his lady friends.\n2. B east would live in a penthouse in the middle of a busy metropolis. Before the spell, he had a view of the entire downtown. He faces a vent during the spell. He still has rooftop access but it’s windy AF.\n3. Bel le’s dad Maurice would drive a Prius. The Prius runs out of batteries, hence deserting Maurice in scary downtown, where Beast lives. He stumbles upon an open and deserted high tower that says “Under Construction.”\n4. G aston would drink protein shakes . Why crack a bunch of eggs when you can just hit ~*blend*~?\n5. Belle would look up the penthouse on Google Maps. But she goes inside anyway because there’s no reception and it’s cold.\n6. Th e rose would be a 3-D hologram . The rose is literally LIT.\nDisney | Giphy 7. B elle would have a Kindle for all that reading. She’d also be on Goodreads ALL. THE. TIME. Sample review: “I’ve read The Girls three times front to back and I’m just about to start again. Can’t get enough!”\n8. Be lle would wear a naked dress by Givenchy. Slay. (She'd also be into chokers since that's a thing again).\n9. And Gaston would have a man bun. Kinda hot, right?\n10. Lumiere would be out of a job because of LED . Poor Lumiere.\n11. Cogsworth would be an Apple Watch. Cogsworth > Siri.\n12. Chip would be a wannabe Vine star. Except Vine is dead so he’d have to try Snapchat or Instagram Story.\nDisney | Giphy 13. Mrs. Potts would be a Nespresso machine or Vitamix . Oh she fancy (huh).\n14. The “Kill the Beast” riot would never happen. Everyone would call Gaston out for intolerance on Twitter first.\n 15. The feather duster Babette would turn into a Kardashian after the curse is broken. Bigger question though: WHICH KARDASHIAN? (My money’s on Khloé because she loves to clean and get organized. Have you seen her cookie jar ?)\n16. Beast would never turn back into a prince because Belle would love him just the way he is . #bodypositivity\nDisney's Beauty and the Beast turns 25 this month.\nFollow Peggy on Twitter .\n ",

      "text": " \nFormer Dirty Jobs host Mike Rowe explained in a Facebook post Thursday the real reason he believes Donald Trump won the presidency. Responding to a post from a fan named Carol Savoy, who asked “what the hell happened” in Tuesday’s election and what advice Rowe could give her to make her “feel better about my fellow man,” Rowe compared Trump to his 2003 Dirty Jobs pilot on the Discovery Channel. “It wasn’t pretty or careful. It took place in sewers and septic tanks, and featured a subversive host in close contact with his 8-year-old inner child who refused to do second takes,” the 54-year-old wrote. “Everyone agreed that Dirty Jobs was totally ‘off-brand’ and completely inappropriate for Discovery. Everyone but the viewers.” Rowe compared the feeling of “being seen” to what resonated with a lot of voters, and that Trump’s campaign seemed authentic and spoke to people who had been ignored for a long time. “Here’s the thing — Dirty Jobs didn’t resonate because the host was incredibly charming. It wasn’t a hit because it was gross, or irreverent, or funny, or silly, or smart, or terribly clever. Dirty Jobs succeeded because it was authentic,” Rowe wrote. “It spoke directly and candidly to a big chunk of the country that non-fiction networks had been completely ignoring,” he added. “In a very simple way, Dirty Jobs said, ‘Hey — we can see you,’ to millions of regular people who had started to feel invisible. Ultimately, that’s why Dirty Jobs ran for eight seasons. And today, that’s also why Donald Trump is the President of the United States.” Rowe assured Savoy that we would survive, humoring her by adding that America has already survived 44 presidents. But his main concern was that a large segment of the U.S. was now going to be viewed as “racist, xenophobic, and uneducated misogynists.” He warned that despising candidates publicity doesn’t mean you should despise the voters. “Last week, three old friends — people I’ve known for years — each requested to be ‘unfriended’ by anyone who planned on voting for Trump. Honestly, that was disheartening. Who tosses away a friendship over an election?” Rowe said. “Are my friends turning into those mind-numbingly arrogant celebrities who threaten to move to another country if their candidate doesn’t win?” he asked. “Are my friends now convinced that people they’ve known for years who happen to disagree with them politically are not merely mistaken — but evil, and no longer worthy of their friendship?” The post ended with Rowe making an offer to Trump to be of service getting skilled trade jobs back on the table. “When the dust settles, and The White House gets a new tenant, I’ll make the same offer to President Trump that I did to President Obama — to assist as best I can in any attempt to reinvigorate the skilled trades, and shine a light on millions of good jobs that no one seems excited about pursuing,” he said. Rowe’s post has been shared over 105,000 times and received many supportive comments thanking him for his insight. What do you think?",

      "text": "Facebook mistakenly declares live users, Zuckerberg dead Agence France-Presse / 09:22 AM November 12, 2016 A screengrab of Mark Zuckerberg’s memorialized Facebook page. \nSAN FRANCISCO—Facebook accidently declared live users dead, acknowledging after fixing the problem Friday that it had committed a “terrible error.” \n“For a brief period today, a message meant for memorialized profiles was mistakenly posted to other accounts,” a Facebook spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. \n“This was a terrible error that we have now fixed.” ADVERTISEMENT \nMedia reports indicated that some two million errant memorials were posted on profile pages. The social network apologized and said it work as quickly as possible to correct the problem. \n“Damn. I should have used Facebook Live to show how I was Facebook Dead,” Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan said in a message fired off at Twitter. \nFacebook Live feature lets people broadcast video in real-time at the leading social network. \nEven very-much-alive Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was memorialized in a message at his profile page expressing hope people who loved him would take comfort in posts people shared in tribute to his life. \nThe mistaken memorial notices contained links to forms that can be submitted to have people’s accounts at the leading social network modified into online memorials after they die. \nPart of the process is showing proof of death. \nRELATED STORIES",

For a brief but deeply weird period this afternoon, Facebook killed a substantial part of its user base, telling their friends to “remember” them. These people were, to be clear, mostly alive. \nMemorial mode for Facebook accounts exists so that you can preserve a loved one’s posts and photos, but without seeing their faces and names in Facebook ads. You can have someone’s account put in that mode by sending to Facebook something as simple as an online obituary. \nToday, though, a glitch killed off much of Facebook’s user base for a few minutes, but left the newly deceased logged in. \nNaomi, for example, logged in to Facebook on her phone to discover that she was dead, but no one is supposed to be able to log in to a memorialized account . \nFortunately, everything went back to normal within the hour, with the living and the dead having the correct respective Facebook account statuses. There were no lasting effects other than being super weirded out. ",

      "text": "iStock Like us on Facebook \nInstead of making fun of crazy cat ladies, a new exhibit at Los Angeles’s Animal Museum wants to celebrate them. As The Washington Post reports , the museum recently launched an exhibit, “Crazy Cat Ladies,” that looks at the history of human-feline companionship and pays homage to ailurophiles in film, literature, and pop culture. \nThe Animal Museum (formerly known as The National Museum of Animals & Society) bills itself on Facebook as “the first museum of its kind—anywhere—dedicated to enriching the lives of animals and people through exploration of our shared experience.” It was founded in 2010, and recently moved into a brand-new space in downtown L.A.'s Arts District. On December 3, 2016, the revamped museum will officially celebrate its grand opening . \nThe Animal Museum is currently in a soft-opening period, and “Crazy Cat Ladies: A Celebration of Kitties and Their Champions” is one of its inaugural rotating exhibits. According to the museum’s website, the display aims to “take a magnifying glass to the myths and stereotypes surrounding this legendary figure, and provides viewers with a heartfelt insight into today’s modern cat lady and gent.” \nThe display includes a replica of a fictional crazy cat lady’s living room, cat-themed knickknacks and art, and plaques emblazoned with feline facts. (Example: “One in four Americans feed stray cats, so many of us have crazy cat lady tendencies!”) Feline fanciers can submit their true-life cat rescue stories to be featured in the exhibit, or download an official “Crazy Cat Ladies\" exhibition coloring book [ PDF ] from the Animal Museum’s website. As for dog-loving patrons, they can enjoy an exhibit that showcases portraits of celebrities with their rescued pets. \nCheck out some pictures of the “Crazy Cat Ladies” exhibit below, or visit the Animal Museum’s website for more information. (Visitors should note that the Animal Museum is not directly affiliated with any animal organizations, and its income does not go to animal advocacy or rescue groups.)",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg Among Facebook Users Mistakenly Declared 'Dead' Facebook accidentally started showing some users dead on their profiles Mark Zuckerberg was also one of the 'dead' users Facebook has said it has fixed the glitch \nFacebook accidentally declared its founder Mark Zuckerberg and many other users dead on Friday, acknowledging after fixing the problem that it had committed a \"terrible error.\" \n\"For a brief period today, a message meant for memorialised profiles was mistakenly posted to other accounts,\" a Facebook spokesperson told AFP. \n\"This was a terrible error that we have now fixed.\" \nMedia reports indicated that some two million errant memorials were posted on profile pages. Even Facebook co-founder and chief executive Zuckerberg was memorialized in a message at his profile page expressing hope that people who loved him would take comfort in posts people shared in tribute to his life. — Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) November 11, 2016 \n\"Poor Mark,\" read an @JudiD23 tweet that included weeping face emojis. \"Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.\"\nThe social network apologized and said it worked as quickly as possible to correct the problem. \n\"Damn. I should have used Facebook Live to show how I was Facebook Dead,\" Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan said in a message fired off at Twitter. \nFacebook Live feature lets people broadcast video in real-time at the leading social network. The mistaken memorial notices contained links to forms that can be submitted to have people's accounts at the leading social network modified into online memorials after they die. \nPart of the process is showing proof of death. \nSome wondered whether the mishap was a botched test promotion of the feature, rather than a software glitch. \n#FacebookDead Comments tagged #FacebookDead or #FacebookRapture went viral at Twitter, with people joking that the scenario marked a fitting end to tumultuous week. \n\"I think this is Facebook's way of flagging the people who died inside on Tuesday,\" read a tweet from @billkalpak. \nA darkly humorous post on Twitter by @JnPhillip was in the form of a note reading \"Dear Facebook, Donald Trump does not get inaugurated until January 20th. Nuclear annihilation occurs Jan. 21st.\" \n\"Naturally, Facebook waited until 2016 to kill us all,\" tweeted @kriheli. \nSome quipped that the mistake shook confidence in Facebook's feature for checking on people after disasters, or its claim that hoax stories are not a worry at the social network. \nA not-dead-yet Zuckerberg defended the integrity of News Feed stories duing an on-stage chat at a Techonomy conference in California the night before being memorialized on his profile page. \nZuckerberg rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for President-elect Trump. \n\"The idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said during an on-stage chat at the conference. \nThe News Feed at Facebook has evolved from early days of being about sharing personal tidbits with friends or family to becoming a platform for important news.",

      "text": "12 November 2016 at 5:59am Facebook snafu declares users dead, including Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg was memorialised by his own website due to a glitch. Credit: Facebook \nAround two million Facebook users logged into their accounts on Friday to find out that the social network had declared them dead - even the company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \nThe network accidentally \"memorialised\" accounts with the message: \"We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.\" \nFacebook apologised and said that the glitch was related to the process of \"memorialising\" someone's page when they die. \nWhile the company wanted to introduce the new message to existing memorial pages, it accidentally applied it to around two million extra accounts. \nA spokeswoman told The Guardian: \"For a brief period today, a message meant for memorialized pages was mistakenly posted to other accounts. \n\"This was a terrible error that we have now fixed. We are very sorry that this happened and we worked as quickly as possible to fix it.\" \nThe process of memorialising someone's Facebook page involves submitting a formal request and providing evidence such as a death certificate.

      "text": "The Straits Times | Ng Huiwen | Saturday, Nov 12, 2016 Photo: The New Paper The Straits Times Saturday, Nov 12, 2016 \nShe thought she had found love, but a woman in her 40s ended up losing thousands of dollars instead. \nMary (not her real name) befriended a man on Facebook early last year, after he sent her a request. It took almost a year and at least $85,000 before she realised she had fallen victim to an Internet love scam. \nSmitten with her \"boyfriend\", she agreed to transfer about $22,000 to his bank account in China in the middle of last year when he said his father was sick. \nHe said he needed to borrow the money to pay for the hospitalisation bills. \nShe sent it to him on three occasions over a month. \nSome time later, he asked for more money, claiming that he needed help to pay goods tax in Hong Kong before he could sell his products in the market. \nHe reassured her that he could earn more than $3 million from the sale of the goods, so she transferred more than $31,000 to him in three more transactions. \nIn December last year, she received the \"good news\" that his goods had been sold. \nShe was promised a cheque of $1.2 million in return, but it did not come. \nSoon after, another person contacted her asking for her bank account details so that he could pass the money to her. \nWhen asked to foot the bank transfer fees, she complied and deposited more than $32,000 to another bank account in China. \nFollowing this, she was unable to contact her scammer or his accomplice. She then made a police report in January. \nThis article was first published on Nov 12, 2016. Get a copy of The Straits Times or go to straitstimes.com for more stories.

      "text": " count=\"202\" data-total-count=\"202\">As Facebook has grown, so too has its ability to slice and dice the habits of its hundreds of millions of users, and offer them up to advertisers that want to reach specific groups for specific reasons. But while the social network has evolved to the point that it can target audiences as narrow as 18-to-24-year-old men in Connecticut who are in long-distance relationships, it has also created tools that allowed advertisers to discriminate against Americans in ways that were outlawed in the 1960s.\nFacebook responded on Friday to concern that it was violating anti-discrimination laws, announcing that marketers placing housing, employment or credit ads on the social network would no longer be able to use tools that target people by ethnicity.\n“There are many nondiscriminatory uses of our ethnic affinity solution in these areas, but we have decided that we can best guard against discrimination by suspending these types of ads,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a blog post on Friday.\nContinue reading the main story An article by ProPublica published last month reported that advertisers could use Facebook targeting to exclude certain races, or what the company calls “ethnic affinities,” from housing and employment ads, potentially putting the social network in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n The article prompted scrutiny from civil rights groups and policy makers, including the American Civil Liberties Union and four members of Congress, and a class-action lawsuit.\nThe decision casts a perhaps unwelcome spotlight on what Facebook calls its “ethnic affinity marketing solution,” which is still available for use outside the areas of housing, employment and credit advertising.\nOne of Facebook’s main draws for marketers is how narrowly it lets them target messages to its users. Ads can be sent to people based not only on standard demographics like age, gender and location, but also on a bevy of other factors, like whether they have an anniversary coming, their interest in horseback riding, whether they use Gmail or Hotmail, and the languages they speak. Users can also be excluded from seeing ads based on this data.\nPhoto Advertisers have been able to target and filter users by what Facebook calls “ethnic affinity.” While much of this information is provided voluntarily by users, ethnic affinity is one demographic offered to marketers that users cannot choose, but it is instead assigned based on their interests and activities on Facebook. That includes page likes, group memberships and friendships, the company said. You can list your religious views and languages on your Facebook profile, but you cannot self-identify as, say, Asian-American.\nOn Facebook’s ad-buying website, however, advertisers can choose to include or exclude certain demographic “affinities” from ads in the United States. For instance, they can exclude African-American, Asian-American and four “types” of Hispanic — bilingual, English-dominant, Spanish-dominant or all of the above. Facebook lists the number of people who match those affinities within its ads tool.\nFor example, if an advertiser wants to reach Americans ages 18 and up on Facebook, the company indicates that there are 26 million people with the “ethnic affinity” of African-American. The company confirmed that because the assignment is based on activity, a white person could be targeted as African-American and vice versa.\nFacebook users can visit their Ad Preferences and see what, if any, ethnic affinity is assigned to them under their “lifestyle and culture” interests, and remove it if they want, the company said. A reporter for The New York Times who is Indian-American did not have “Asian-American” listed under her interests in that section. A colleague, who is Hispanic and speaks primarily English, had “Ethnic affinity: African-American (U.S.)” listed under descriptions like “away from family” and “books.”\nProPublica, for its article last month, bought an ad targeting Facebook users who were house hunting, and excluded people with an “affinity” for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people. The publication showed the ad to a civil rights lawyer, who called it a “blatant” violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n On Friday, Facebook declined to disclose the number of housing, credit and employment ads placed using ethnic affinity targeting. The company brought in roughly $18 billion in revenue last year, almost all of it from advertising.\nIn her blog post, Ms. Egan wrote that this type of targeting “gives brands a way to reach multicultural audiences with more relevant advertising.” In addition to tools that will disable ethnic affinity marketing for housing, employment or credit ads, Facebook will “require advertisers to affirm that they will not engage in discriminatory advertising” on the site and offer them information so they “understand their obligations with respect to housing, employment and credit.”\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the New York State attorney general, said its civil rights bureau “inquired about Facebook’s practices and, while we are still reviewing them, we are pleased to see this positive step by the company.”\nYvette D. Clarke, one of the members of Congress who called on Facebook to change its ad policy, commended the decision and took the opportunity to rap Silicon Valley’s knuckles for its lack of racial and gender diversity.\n“To avoid these problems in the future, I urge Facebook and other technology companies to address the lack of diversity in the ranks of their leadership and staff by recruiting and retaining people of color and women,” Ms. Clarke said in a statement.\nThis is hardly the first time Facebook has received intense scrutiny over its ad-targeting practices. In 2013, Facebook paid $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against the company for sharing data with advertisers about users’ “likes” without asking permission. The same year, a lawsuit accused the company of scanning users’ private messages on the network and using the information for advertising purposes. In September of this year, a federal judge in California ruled against a bid to certify the case as a class-action lawsuit.\nThe changes to Facebook’s ethnic marketing tool will very likely deal a difficult blow to the company’s longstanding boasts about its superior ad-targeting capabilities, especially in the face of competitors like Google, Twitter and Snapchat. Shares of Facebook closed down 1.5 percent on Friday.\nFacebook also faces criticism for the role it may have played in the election of Donald J. Trump, with critics assailing the amount of “fake news” that showed up in users’ news feeds. The company came under fire this year for faults in its Trending Topics feature, which surfaced some of the most talked-about stories and topics circulating on Facebook. Users discovered that Trending Topics, among many other areas of the site, was a source for the spread of fake news from disreputable websites. Separately on Friday, the company accidentally placed notices on the profile pages of many users indicating that they were dead.",

      "title": "Facebook mistakenly declares 2 million users 'dead' | The Times of Israel",
      "text": "Digital Life after Death SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) — Facebook accidentally declared its founder Mark Zuckerberg and many other users dead on Friday, acknowledging after fixing the problem that it had committed a “terrible error.” “For a brief period today, a message meant for memorialized profiles was mistakenly posted to other accounts,” a Facebook spokesperson told AFP. “This was a terrible error that we have now fixed.” Media reports indicated that some two million errant memorials were posted on profile pages. Apparently Facebook marked me as deceased. So…yeah. I'm dead. RIP. pic.twitter.com/75auGxSMXF Even Facebook co-founder and chief executive Zuckerberg was memorialized in a message at his profile page expressing hope that people who loved him would take comfort in posts people shared in tribute to his life. “Poor Mark,” read an @JudiD23 tweet that included weeping face emojis. “Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.” The social network apologized and said it worked as quickly as possible to correct the problem. This file photo taken on March 2, 2015 shows Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg on the opening day of the 2015 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. ( AFP PHOTO / LLUIS GENE) “Damn. I should have used Facebook Live to show how I was FacebookDead,” Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan said in a message fired off at Twitter. Facebook Live feature lets people broadcast video in real-time at the leading social network. The mistaken memorial notices contained links to forms that can be submitted to have people’s accounts at the leading social network modified into online memorials after they die. Part of the process is showing proof of death. Some wondered whether the mishap was a botched test promotion of the feature, rather than a software glitch. Comments tagged #FacebookDead or #FacebookRapture went viral at Twitter, with people joking that the scenario marked a fitting end to tumultuous week. “I think this is Facebook’s way of flagging the people who died inside on Tuesday,” read a tweet from @billkalpak. A darkly humorous post on Twitter by @JnPhillip was in the form of a note reading “Dear Facebook, Donald Trump does not get inaugurated until January 20th. Nuclear annihilation occurs Jan. 21st.” “Naturally, Facebook waited until 2016 to kill us all,” tweeted @kriheli. Some quipped that the mistake shook confidence in Facebook’s feature for checking on people after disasters, or its claim that hoax stories are not a worry at the social network. A not-dead-yet Zuckerberg defended the integrity of News Feed stories during an on-stage chat at a Techonomy conference in California the night before being memorialized on his profile page. Facebook thinks everyone is dead https://t.co/QYnINMeVtR pic.twitter.com/ZdwYwHkVGW — Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) November 11, 2016 Zuckerberg rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for President-elect Trump. “The idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said during an on-stage chat at the conference. The News Feed at Facebook has evolved from early days of being about sharing personal tidbits with friends or family to becoming a platform for important news. ",

      "title": "On This Day in 1980, Voyager 1 Showed Us Saturn",
      "text": "NASA/JPL/USGS (Public Domain) Like us on Facebook \nOn November 12, 1980, Voyager 1 flew by Saturn. It was the second spacecraft to do so (Pioneer 11 had taken low-resolution pictures in 1979). But Voyager 1 had a high-resolution camera onboard, and it snapped photos of the planet, its rings, and its moons. It also found three previously-unknown moons: Atlas, Pandora, and Prometheus. \nThe image shown at the top of this post actually came a few days later, when Voyager 1 continued its flyby but turned its camera back. The original caption read: \nVoyager 1 image of Saturn and its ring taken Nov. 16, 1980 four days after closest approach to Saturn, from a distance of 5,300,000 km (3,300,000 miles). This viewing geometry, which shows Saturn as a crescent, is never achieved from Earth. The Saturnian rings, like the cloud tops of Saturn itself, are visible because they reflect sunlight. The translucent nature of the rings is apparent where Saturn can be seen through parts of the rings. Other parts of the rings are so dense with orbiting ice particles that almost no sunlight shines through them and a shadow is cast onto the yellowish cloud tops of Saturn, which in turn, casts a shadow across the rings at right. The black strip within the rings is the Cassini Division, which contains much less orbiting ring material than elsewhere in the rings. \nAmong the first photos we got back were these views of Saturn's satellites. I have embedded some nice ones below. TITAN'S HAZE (FALSE COLOR) \nTitan is Saturn's largest moon. Voyager 1 found Titan's thick atmosphere, which prevents visible-light cameras from seeing the surface. The image above shows a false-color view of the \"haze\" in Titan's atmosphere, which is mostly made up of nitrogen. RHEA \nLooks a lot like our moon, eh? DIONE \nAnother familiar-looking moon. JPL notes : \nAt the top of the image is the 166 km diameter crater Aeneas, centered at 26 N, 46 W. North is at 12:30. This image was taken from a distance of 162,000 km and has a resolution of 1 km/pixel. BROWN OVALS ON SATURN \nJPL notes : \nTwo brown ovals can be seen towards the right. The lower one is at about 40 degrees north latitude. The upper one, the polar oval, is at 60 degrees north. Both ovals are about 10,000 km across. North is at 1:30. VOYAGER 2 \nVoyager 2 also flew by Saturn, in August 1981. It took some amazing pictures. If you want to get deep into the Voyager data sets, JPL and the USGS have you covered .

      "text": "RCCG pastor's son stabbed to death in Canada Dokunola 1 hour ago 28782 Facebook \n– The death of a 21-year-old Nigerian studying in Canada has thrown the family into an unprecedented state of mourning \n– The aspiring Economist was reportedly stabbed by a Burundian during a fight with another person over a woman \n– Late Solomon’s dad is a pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Lagos, Nigeria and has since traveled to see things for himself \n– Police say the suspect has since been arrested and charged with second-degree murder \nSolomon Odekunle, a 21-year-old son of a Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) pastor has been reportedly hacked to death in Ottawa, Canada. \nReports say he was seen stumbling out of Piper’s Bar and Grill, a popular hangout in the capital city with torrential blood flow from his neck. \nThe young man was later pronounced dead in the hospital after collapsing a few steps away according to eyewitness account given to the police. \nThe young Nigerian was said to have been stabbed by one Joe Ndikuriyo, a 27-year-old Burundian during a fight over a woman, in what was described as the 17th victim of homicide in Ottawa since the beginning of 2016. Solomon Odekunle, the 21-year-old student who was stabbed to death by a Burundian in Canada. \nSolomon, The Punch investigations showed, was studying Economics at the University of Ottawa having gained admission in 2012 and when the parents were visited at their Rotimi Williams Estate, Fagba the father had reportedly traveled while the mother who could also not bear the pain, had moved out of the house temporarily. \nDeborah, the deceased’s sibling also studying in Canada, was totally broken by her brother’s death as she shared some emotional posts on the social media. \n“If I did know it would be your last, I would have given you more than a fist bump. I would have gotten down on my knees and give you the deepest bro-hug. \n“If I did know it would be your last, I would have pleaded with the drama leader to allow the rehearsal to linger a little so you and Peter could make us giggle a little more with some frog jump. \n“If I did know it would be your last, I would have treasured those great words you shared with me a couple of months ago in the technical department, have them handwritten with the best calligraphic pens, framed and given to you right after doing those frog jumps. \nREAD ALSO: SAD! Rival cult kills man, girlfriend in Makurdi \n“To the Solomon I saw last week, to the Solomon that finally got his picture taken properly last week, to the Solomon with an intellectual smile and chubby cheeks, to the Solomon his friends described as kind-hearted and meek, see you next,” she wrote. \nWhile also encouraging those attending the wake keep organised in memory of the slain student, Deborah said: “We would be having a memorial service for Solomon in Ottawa Friday evening and it is open to anyone that would like to come. Please, if you make it down, don’t cry because my dad would be there. I also believe that as Christians, we do not mourn, we celebrate life.” \nStaff Sgt Bruce Pirt in a report by CBC News, said: “We do have some bloodletting that covered quite an extensive area, we have to make sure it’s all connected to the same incident. As we investigate further, we’ll be able to tighten up that scene and make it smaller and smaller.” \nMeanwhile, the suspect who was recently served a two-week jail term for possession of weapons, has since been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. \nIn another development, the story of the gruesome stabbing which led to the eventual death of Damilola Taylor in the U.K is set to be told via a movie to be premiered by the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC. \nThe film titled Damilola, Our Loved Boy will be shown next week Monday, November 7 at 8:30pm on BBC One. \nRecall that Damilola Taylor was killed on November 27, 2000 less than two weeks to his 11th birthday. He was stabbed by two brothers Danny and Ricky Preddie (who later admitted that they wanted his coat) on his way home from a computer class. He later bled to death in a stairwell.",

      "text": "HIGHLIGHTS LIers report unfriending those with different views on Facebook Election discussions on social media trigger arguments Days after the 2016 election ended, Stacey Keller-Novita is coming to terms with a new president and a shorter-than-expected friends list on Facebook. \nThe Hewlett resident is one of several Long Islanders who are reporting damaged friendships and bitter online disputes with family and acquaintances over what many see as the most contentious election in United States history. \n“I would see a post from a friend that I was surprised they would be going in the direction they were going,” Keller-Novita, of Hewlett, said. “It angered me because I thought I knew people.” \nAs Facebook has become an important tool for sharing opinions, elections draw significant activity. A Facebook spokesman said on Election Day alone this year, 115.3 million people on Facebook worldwide generated 716.3 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the election. \nKeller-Novita said she’s always been passionate about politics online, but the last two presidential elections have become heated topics and generated disputes among her circle on Facebook. She’s both been unfriended and has unfriended others on Facebook this year. Most Popular Officials: Cops rescue family from house fire Reports:   Trump transition includes influential LI donor AG: LI attorney scammed Medicaid out of $1.7M Supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been clashing on social media throughout the election season, but even moreso after the unexpected outcome of the race for president. Photo Credit: AFP/Getty Images / TIMOTHY A. CLARY \nKeller-Novita, 41, who voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said most of her arguments were with acquaintances — people she said she didn’t get along with anyway. In one instance, she unfriended someone because she became frustrated with their political posts. In response, the person’s spouse unfriended her. \nKatie Byrnes, 22, of East Islip, said she tried to avoid political posts this year after seeing nasty comments elsewhere on Facebook. But she announced Tuesday she had voted for Republican nominee Donald Trump, and later posted she was happy her chosen candidate won. \nByrnes said she received harassing messages after a Facebook friend — one she said she didn’t know in real life — shared one of her posts. Friends made negative comments on her post celebrating the election’s outcome, she   \n“A lot of them unfriended me and told me I was racist. They just assumed things,” she said. \nByrnes said she doesn’t remember getting any blowback on Facebook after the 2012 election. \nIn a 2012 Pew research survey, 38 percent of social media users said they discovered their friends’ political views were different from what they had thought. \nPeople who identified as liberals were most likely to block, unfriend or hide other users in 2012, but only about 18 percent of all voters surveyed had taken those steps, according to Pew. \nWhile similar data isn’t available yet for this election season, many social media users say political discussions took a much more negative turn in 2016. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff \n“I’ve gotten into arguments with family members, friends, some that I’ve known since high school,” Harry Kalogeresis, 38, of Lindenhurst, said. “The level of civility and common decency on social media has eroded so quickly during this election.” \nKalogeresis ended a Facebook friendship with someone he had known from high school after the two had an unpleasant exchange on the social media site about gun rights. He’s also had disputes that ended Facebook friendships with family members. \nBrian Hoerning, 28, of Bay Shore, said he tried not to let disputes end Facebook relationships. Instead, he sometimes deleted comments others made on his pro-Trump posts if the discussion got combative. \n“Everyone was just completely against each other this time, there was no middle,” he said. “People don’t think before they speak on social media, everyone is just responding.” \nHe estimated he lost six Facebook friends this year. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nOne unique aspect of the 2016 election is there’s never been more people online, and it’s never been easier to block someone on social media, said Jessica Baldwin-Philippi, a professor of new media at Fordham University. \nYou can easily unfriend someone, or you can ask Facebook’s algorithm to stop showing specific posts or people on your news feed, she said. \n“Digital platforms blend the social and political in a way that’s uncomfortable for many,” she said. \nKeller-Novita sometimes wonders if she acted too quickly in removing some friends. One friendship that ended on Facebook had been meaningful, but she said she’s open to making amends — in the future. \n“Right now, I just need to keep my distance,” she said.

      "text": "Zuckerberg denies fake news on Facebook influenced US vote Chief executive says ‘pretty crazy idea’ that small number of posts had an effect Read latest: by: Hannah Kuchler in Menlo Park \nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, has shot down allegations that fake news spread on the social network influenced the US presidential election . \nFake news stories were a “very small volume” of posts and there were hoaxes on both sides in the election, Mr Zuckerberg said in his first public appearance since Tuesday’s vote. \n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which there is a very small amount of the content, influences the election is a pretty crazy idea,” he said at the Techonomy conference in California. \nAmericans received more of their news from social media this election than ever before, prompting some to question the accuracy of posts that were allowed to trend on Facebook — by far the largest network — and whether the algorithm that prioritises posts in its news feed creates a so-called ‘filter bubble’, where people only hear their own views repeated back to them. \nMr Zuckerberg said people who were looking for answers about Mr Trump’s victory should not be pointing fingers at Facebook . \n“People are trying to understand the result of the election. I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news. I don’t think that is internalising the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election,” he said. \nMr Zuckerberg did not define what he believes were the reasons the US elected Mr Trump. \nI do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news Mark Zuckerberg \nFacebook has studied the ‘filter bubble’ problem before and found people are presented with differing opinions from their friends and family in their feeds, far more than in the days when traditional media dominated, Mr Zuckerberg said. \n“The historical analogy here is you go back 20 years and look at the media landscape with a few major newspapers and TV networks in any given local area, each with an editorial opinion, and all your opinions are filtered through that,” he said. \nBut Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had found that people automatically ignored posts they did not agree with. “The content is there, you just don’t click on it, you tune it out when you see it and it does not have your world view,” he said. \nOverall, Mr Zuckerberg tried not to take sides on the election, despite the fact that most of Silicon Valley supported Hillary Clinton. “We have a lot of work to do. But that would have been true either way,” he said. “Most progress I think is made by private citizens … progress will continue.”  ",

Adams volcano is in the background. (Photo: USGS.gov) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \n(NEWSER) – The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, \"visualizing\" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls \"a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,\" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: \"The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface.\" \nScientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, \"rotten\" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media . But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers \"originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface.\" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. \"Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?\" asks Finn. Right now, \"nobody knows.\" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple .) \nMore from Newser",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nThe photo at the center of Taylor Swift’s sexual assault case has been revealed. \nIn the picture, which was published early Saturday morning by TMZ, former KYGO radio DJ and defendant David Mueller is shown taking a picture with Swift and another woman. Taylor Swift — The 'Sexual Assault' Photo I Wanted to Keep Secret (PHOTO) https://t.co/qT5FRZLo4T \nIn the photo, Mueller’s hand is clearly behind Taylor Swift. But what’s unclear is where exactly Mueller’s hand is placed. \nThat appears to be the key question in the lawsuit Swift has filed against Mueller. \nSwift’s suit alleges that Mueller groper her while posing for the photo, which was taken after a concert in June 2013. \nBillboard obtained a transcript of a videotaped deposition, in which Taylor Swift said, \nRight as the moment came for us to pose for the photo, he took his hand and put it up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek and no matter how much I scooted over it was still there. It was completely intentional, I’ve never been so sure of anything in my life. \nA few weeks ago, the judge presiding over Swift’s case had ordered the “evidence” (the photo above) to be sealed after the singer’s lawyers argued the picture would only be used for “scandalous” purposes. Judge will seal photo that proves David Mueller groped Taylor Swift https://t.co/0v4mEOZgsL pic.twitter.com/8Ox1iovwyy \n— Zesty TSwift News (@zesty_TSwift) October 22, 2016 \nStill, the image has been released and is now in full view of the public eye, despite the fact that Swift has intimated it was an extremely difficult moment for her. \nShe said in her deposition, \nI remember being frantic, distressed, feeling violated in a way I had never experienced before. A meet-and-greet is supposed to be a situation where you’re thanking people for coming, you’re supposed to be welcoming people into your home, which is the arena for that day, and for someone to violate that hospitality in that way, I was completely stunned. REX/Shutterstock \nMueller, for his part, filed a countersuit in 2015, alleging the singer falsely accused him and cost him his job at KYGO radio. \nNow all that remains to be seen is whether or not the photo is convincing enough in court. \n ",

      "text": "Facebook wants to make you secure no matter how hard you make it Posted Driving the Midwest When you have a billion people using your service, you have an obligation to keep your users secure, even when they behave in unsafe ways. Alex Stamos, Chief Security Officer (CSO) at Facebook, speaking at Web Summit last week, told a quick story to show what his company was up against when it came to security. “The family car was not designed to be driven into a wall at 100 kilometers an hour. We call that user error,” he joked. Car companies try to take reasonable safety scenarios into account when building cars, and then attempt to make them as safe as possible based on the information they have. Facebook, he said, doesn’t have that luxury. For example, Stamos said that he was in Nigeria recently and he met with young people, many of whom were using a $50 Android smartphone as their device of choice. The trouble with the phone, which was one these young people liked and could afford, was that it ran an older, much less secure version of Android — one which they weren’t likely to update. He can’t force people to upgrade their devices, so they have to accept the fact that these users are coming onto Facebook with devices, which very likely have malware running on them. “If we are going to connect the world, we also need to connect the world safely. In situations where it’s negative, we still look at it with open eyes and do everything we can to mitigate it,” he explained. He went on to differentiate between safety and security. You can develop your code as a company in a secure way, meaning you try to fill security holes and make it as difficult as possible for hackers to compromise the software. He says that every company should be duty-bound to prevent these types of weaknesses to the extent possible. Keeping your users safe is another matter. It’s about setting up systems in such a way that you have safety built into the structure of the service, regardless of how much or how little the end user is willing to participate in those safety mechanisms. For example, Facebook knows that users running two-factor identification are going to be inherently much safer than those running on a simple user name and password. Yet unlike your employer, Facebook can’t force you to use two-factor identification, even though it knows you would be safer if you did. That forces the social media giant to find other ways to build in safety for you.

Facebook knows it can’t possibly control every variable, or even impose reasonable safety measures onto its users, so it uses as many creative ways as it can consider to keep as much of its user base safe as is within the company’s control. Stamos says the company has built a safety-oriented culture that enables the company to iterate quickly on changing safety and security issues, regardless of user behavior. “It is still our responsibility to protect the people who choose not to use [advanced safety features the company has built],” Stamos explained. In other words, they are going to make every effort to try and keep you safe whether you participate or not. Featured Image: Sportsfile /Getty Images 0 ",

      "text": "Home » News » Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, others mistakenly declared ‘dead’ Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, others mistakenly declared ‘dead’ On 4:10 pm In News by Tony Comments \nAn unusual bug on Facebook briefly labelled many people as dead. \nThe error caused the social network to show a memorial banner on user profiles for people who were still alive. \nUsers posted status updates to reassure friends and family they were not dead, in spite Facebook’s message. \n“This was a terrible error that we have now fixed,” a Facebook spokesperson said. Mark Zuckerberg \n“We are very sorry that this happened.” \nThe message, intended for “memorialised profiles”, erroneously appeared on the profile pages of a large number of users including the network’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \n“We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life,” the banner on his page read. \nBoth technology reporters and users of the platform, however, saw a humorous side to the story. \n“Why Is Facebook Saying I’m Dead?” asked the New York Times’ Katie Rogers. “At first, I was indignant. I was definitely not dead. (Was I? It had been a long week.)” \n“Facebook is capping one of the longest weeks in American history by telling everyone that they are dead,” quipped The Verge, a technology website, in reference to the presidential election. \nThe memorial feature was introduced in 2015 after a number of high-profile cases where family wanted to access the social accounts of deceased loved ones. \nUser can opt to have their account turn into a memorial page upon their death, where the social network contacts can leave message and share memories. \nAn alternative option is to have your account deleted after your death.

One detective reportedly met with the mom and son, and said the child was \"in good shape,\" KHOU reports. \nAlthough the mother said she made the video in jest, that didn't stop a large number of people from posting angry reactions to the video on Facebook.

      "text": "Facebook's plan to revive its public group chat feature just became official. The social network tells the Courier Mail that it's rolling out a test version of Messenger Rooms on Android devices in Australia and Canada. As leaked code suggested, this is similar to but not quite like the Rooms app of old . All you have to do is create (or search for) a room around a given topic -- after that, anyone can join. If you're worried that you'll get an influx of trolls, you can require approval for new participants.\nIt's not certain if and when Rooms will make it to the US, UK and other countries. The Australian and Canadian launches are really about giving Facebook a way to test English-language features with a smaller audience, to make sure they work smoothly and gauge demand for a wider rollout. However, Facebook's public announcement of Rooms suggests that you could see the feature in other regions relatively soon. As it stands, this is a safer investment than the Rooms stand-alone app. Facebook doesn't have to pour as many resources into this as it would dedicated software, and you're more likely to use the feature if it's inside an app you already use.",

      "text": "Facebook \nA Ghanaian Reverend father has given some pretty fascinating reasons why a man can never sexually satisfy a woman. \nThe man, Rev. George Lutterodt who is also an On-Air relationship counsellor said that no man will be able to completely please a woman in bed on this earth. \nHe said this during a recent interview with the host of Abusua FM’s Drive, Ike-Da Unpredictable. \nRev. George says women are master pretenders when it comes to bedroom moves. He said women only appreciate the men for wasting their time by faking loud moans aimed at deceiving men. \nHe said, “No man can satisfy any woman sexually on this earth, the thank you, they say is appreciation for your time wasted. She is fanning your ego to let you know that you are counted among the lot.” \n“There are differences in the way we have the excitement, satisfaction and the pretence.” \n“Most of the moanings are all lies.” \n“Men are vulnerable sexually: the make organ is the most vulnerable organ in the world and is so disgraceful. Every hole you place it in, it’s happy. It appreciates and responds to every vagina.” \nRev. George, earlier this year, said all married couples to desist from practising doggy sex position if they want to save their marriages. \nDo you agree with the Reverend?",

      "text": "Facebook \nWith the present political unrest in the country, about five Nigerian governors will have serious issues with their deputies, NAIJ.com can exclusively report. \nAccording to Primate Elijah Babatunde Ayodele, who made this prophecy in an exclusive chat NAIJ.com, the governors of Abia, Ebonyi, Kano, Sokoto and Taraba states will have issues with their deputies before the end of their terms in office. The five governors who will have issues with their deputies. \nThe Spiritual head of INRI Evangelistic Spiritual Church explained that the governors and their deputies would have series of disagreements based on their political ambitions and they might end up betraying the trust and confidence reposed in them by the state governors. \n“They will have issues with their governors based on official duties as well as their respective political ambitions as the political atmosphere of the country will become rather unpredictable by the top shots,” he mooted to our correspondent during the chat. \n“Adamawa state governor has to be careful to avoid a rerun in his cabinet, Ikpeazu needs God’s divine intervention and should be wary of court judgment. \nREAD ALSO: ‘Amaechi and Fashola are the ones holding Nigeria together’ \n“Not all Speakers will finish their terms in office due to impeachment plans here and there,” the man of God added. \nThe primate also explained that the rerun election scheduled to hold in Rivers state will end in serious fracas as the All Progressives Congress (APC) will want to win the election at all costs. \nWhile also sounding another warning about the insurgency in the country, Primate Ayodele said: “Boko Haram is not over. Our security men should be more careful and more sensitive. \n“They are planning a major deadly attack again and our security men have to be on red alert to avert a major tragedy in the country.” \nIn his warning also, he asked the managing directors of Access and Fidelity banks and their Chairmen to be careful because “they will face some challenges that might amount to a risk of license with the CBN.” \nRecall the Primate Ayodele also warned Hillary Clinton ahead of the US presidential elections, tasking her to work on five different states and restrategise otherwise she would lose the election. \nHe listed Texas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Ohio as the states where she was supposed to work on. Unfortunately, she lost in four of the states, winning only in New Jersey as Donald Trump, eventual winner recorded an infamous victory in the polls.",

      "text": "James G. Brooks, Jr Crunch Network Contributor James G. Brooks, Jr. is the founder and chief executive of the social video distribution company GlassView .\nMore posts by this contributor: Publishers dodged a bullet in their war with Facebook How to join the network The advertising industry let out a collective groan in September when Facebook admitted a “discrepancy” in its reporting that led it to overstate how much time, on average, viewers were watching video.\nBecause the error was huge — numbers were inflated as much as 60-80 percent for two years — and in Facebook’s favor, some were quick to ascribe sinister motives. At the very least, it showcased the folly of trusting a media company to provide its own metrics.\n“We have also been calling for a long time for media owners like Facebook and Google not to mark their own homework and release data to comScore to enable independent evaluation,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP, told Bloomberg . “The referee and player cannot be the same person.” (It should be noted that WPP has invested in the research from comScore.)\nAdvertisers buy Facebook video on a cost-per-view basis that counts a view at three seconds or more, so marketers didn’t pay extra for the error. The stats did, however, foster the impression that Facebook videos were more effective than they actually were, which likely prompted marketers to spend more than they had planned.\nFor marketers, this once again illustrates the monopolistic position of Facebook and Google. Barring a Microsoft-like government intervention, it’s FaceGoogle’s world now, and we must all adapt. Assuming, however, that Facebook wants to create goodwill in the market, here are five ways marketers can push the social network to do the right thing:\nDemand an internal audit: Ideally, Facebook would hire a third-party firm to perform an internal audit to discover what went wrong this time and confirm that safeguards are in place so something similar won’t happen again. That’s the first step in rebuilding trust with marketers. Require Facebook to use third-party verification: The ANA has already suggested that Facebook should use the Media Rating Council for independent third-party verification. “ANA does not believe there are any pragmatic reasons that a media company should not abide by the standards of accreditation and auditing,” ANA CEO Bob Liodice wrote in a blog post in late September. So far, Facebook has declined to comment about using the MRC. Demand transparency going forward: Facebook is a walled garden, so marketers don’t have a great deal of visibility about its inner workings. One reason that Facebook’s Inflategate was allowed to persist was that the company’s performance dashboard lacked some metrics and an explanation of methodology. Facebook’s viewing metric should have been determined by dividing the total time spent watching a video by the number of people watching. Instead, it divided by the number of “views” (a play of three or more seconds). If Facebook had provided separate columns for views and people watching, then its error by omission wouldn’t have occurred. Work with smaller players: Independent adtech firms often use every sort of third-party tracking metric available to make their ROI case to marketers. If a brand wants to bring their own metrics, they can. The big guys have much more leverage, so they can cherry-pick their metrics and “grade their own homework.” Pressure the feds to intervene: In the 1990s, when Microsoft held a monopolistic position in desktop computing, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the company , eventually drawing out a settlement. Though the deal was a slap on the wrist, Microsoft faced a barrage of bad publicity that forever tarnished its brand. While that kind of smackdown might not be in order now, the FTC has previously stepped in when Facebook was caught lying to consumers about their data privacy. Lying to businesses (if that’s the case) would seem to warrant similar intervention. The reality is, no one really knows if Facebook was being devious here or merely sloppy. Either way, many brands were deceived into thinking their ads were working better than they were. That shouldn’t happen. Marketers have enough to worry about without trying to figure out who’s telling the truth and who has their finger on the scale.\nFeatured Image: Martin Barraud /Getty Images ",

      "text": "World Mark Zuckerberg vows to stop 'fake news' on Facebook after allegations that it influenced election results Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post, \"We don't want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here,\" IndiaToday.in | Posted by T A Bharadwaj Mark Zuckerberg said it was \"unlikely\" that fake news on Facebook influenced election results. 2 He said the company is working to enable Facebook users to flag hoaxes and fake news. 3 However, he warned that there was a lot of grey area in separating truth from falsehood. \nFacebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg today took a dig at those who suggested that fake news and hoaxes on social media sites like Facebook influenced the results of the US presidential election. \nMark Zuckerberg claimed that most of the content, users see on Facebook is authentic. He also said that the suggestion that 'fake news' actually influenced election results was \"extremely unlikely\" as the hoaxes weren't restricted to one partisan view or politics. \n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\" , Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook profile. PROMISE TO STOP 'FAKE NEWS' \nZuckerberg said that the company has already launched work to enable the Facebook users to flag hoaxes and fake news. He added that Facebook's goal was to make sure that people access only accurate news instead of hoaxes. \nHe wrote, \"We don't want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.\" DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING THE TRUTH \nHowever, Zuckerberg also pointed out the fact that it was sometimes hard to differentiate between real and fake news. He said that while some hoaxes can be easily spotted and disproved, there is a lot of grey area when it comes to people expressing opinions that others might feel is inaccurate. \n\"This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the \"truth\" is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual.\" \nZuckerberg reiterated Facebook's commitment to keep improving the way the Facebook news feed sorts out content and vowed to keep users updated on the changes. \nALSO READ: ",

      "text": "More people get their news on Facebook than ever before , but Mark Zuckerberg is still convinced fake news on Facebook was not that big a deal during the presidential election.\nWriting on Facebook Saturday, the CEO again responded to critics who have lambasted the social network for not doing more to combat the spread of misinformation. Instead, he wrote it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nSEE ALSO: Facebook failed America this year — now it should kill the News Feed\n\"We don't want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the post.\nThe CEO did acknowledge the company can do more to combat made-up news stories, but suggested that type of content was negligible.\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic.\"\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics,\" he added.\n\"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nRight now, the network relies primarily on its users to self-police content , including fake news stories. But Facebook's critics argue these tools don't go far enough in reducing the spread of false information.\nZuckerberg noted that discerning the \"truth\" is a more challenging problem than it may seem to those outside the company.\nIdentifying the \"truth\" is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\nZuckerberg's comments, his most extensive public remarks on Facebook's role in the election yet, come as he and other executives at the social network are under fire for not doing more to combat the spread of invented news and conspiracy theories.\nOn Thursday, Zuckerberg said the idea that fake news influenced the election was \"a pretty crazy idea.\"\nHis arguments will likely ring hollow to many critics who have hoped Zuckerberg would take a stronger stance on the issue, which has reportedly been controversial internally at the company.\nSome Facebook employees have questioned whether the network should have done more to stop fake news and racists memes from spreading, The New York Times reported Saturday .\nThough Zuckerberg seems unlikely to change his opinion — tone deaf though it may seem to critics — he confirmed a previous statement from the company that News Feed changes to address the issue are in the works.\n\"We hope to have more to share soon, although this work often takes longer than we'd like in order to confirm changes we make won't introduce unintended side effects or bias into the system,\" he added.",

      "text": "Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nOn June 25, 1998, Windows 98 went on sale , and geeks like me were excited...ish. At the time, I saw it as a small incremental change from Windows 95, but of course I bought it. \nFeaturing lots of web integration and slightly improved graphics, Windows 98 wasn't incredible—it wouldn't be until Windows XP that a massive change in consumer Windows operating systems came—but it did have some handy features around networking and driver support. On the bright side, it introduced Windows Update. Ugh but yay? \nCheck out this vintage episode of Computer Chronicles all about the then-new operating system. Stick with it for an interview with Linus Torvalds, inventor of Linux. Also fascinating is a review of a very fancy pager with a hardware keyboard, made by RIM...who would go on to make a device called the BlackBerry starting in 1999.",

      "text": "Israel Inside Israeli journalists accuse Facebook of infringing on freedom of speech Media professionals says social media giant is targeting their industry, and must be more transparent in how it chooses which posts to block Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg on the opening day of the 2015 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, March 2, 2015 . (AFP PHOTO/LLUIS GENE/File) Newsroom journalists A group of Israeli journalists and media and advertising professionals is accusing Facebook of a “harsh infringement” on their freedom of speech, saying they cannot remain silent any longer as the social network giant “tramples over” their freedom of expression by blocking posts. In a letter to Adi Soffer-Teeni, the Facebook Israel General Manager, a group of over 40 journalists and media, advertising and content professionals and social media activists — both religious and secular, from the left to the right of Israel’s political spectrum — called on Facebook to conduct itself in a “responsible manner” and be more transparent with its policies on blocking content. They called on the social media company to publish a detailed guide to what words it will block from its site and to enforce that policy in a unified and transparent matter. The media activists claim the social media giant started blocking their content about three months ago and that this censorship reached a peak in the past few days. Many of the users were blocked over content posted a year ago and even two to seven years ago, the letter said. The authors said that they use the Facebook platform as their core activity for traffic and distribution of their content and they are no longer willing to accept “Facebook’s harsh infringement of our freedom of speech and that of our community.” Public security minister Gilad Erdan (right), and Facebook’s Joel Kaplan and Monika Bickert together with Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked at meeting on September 12, 2016 (Courtesy) “Since Thursday we have noticed a wave of Facebook’s removal of posts,” said Dori Ben Israel, in a phone interview. Ben Israel is an advertising professional who runs a digital advertising website, and is one of the signatories in the letter. “We are noticing that they are not blocking the average surfer, but specifically targeting journalists, those with many followers and who are public opinion leaders.” Posts including the Hebrew equivalent of “nigger” and the Hebrew word “koksinel,” a denigratory term for a transvestite, were removed, Ben Israel said, even if they had been posted many years ago. After the removal of the posts, some users had been blocked from the site for a week and at times also a month, he said. “From what we understand, Facebook has been active recently particularly with Israeli posts. We follow what is going on in the world and we don’t see something similar happening abroad,” he said. A Facebook spokeswoman in Tel Aviv said via email, “We want people to feel safe when using Facebook and there is no place for content encouraging hate speech on Facebook. Therefore we’ve developed a set of Community Standards which makes it clear we remove content that attacks and offends people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity or serious disabilities or diseases. We also urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content.” Facebook came under fire from the Israeli government earlier this year for allowing incitement on its site, which it claims is fueling terror. The government has repeatedly said that Facebook should do more to monitor and control the content on its site, raising a host of legal and ethical issues over whether the company is responsible for material posted by its users. The social media company has community standards which say that the company can remove hate speech, including content that directly attacks people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, or gender identity, serious disabilities and diseases. “Organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred against these protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook. As with all of our standards, we rely on our community to report this content to us,” Facebook says in its community standards. “While we work hard to remove hate speech, we also give you tools to avoid distasteful or offensive content.” “We believe there is some reform underway at Facebook to keep us silent,” said Ben Israel. These words that were banned are indeed not politically correct, he said, but Facebook has been erratic about whose posts it blocks, and its policies in Israel are not clear, he said. Facebook has also ignored all inquiries by journalists into the matter, he added. Avishai Ivri, a journalist at Israel’s public broadcasting corporation, said in a phone interview that he was blocked from his Facebook page for a week. “One day, I just received a message saying that my post had been removed because it is against Facebook’s community standards,” he said. “I was blocked from the site for a week and only later did I realize that the offending words I had used were ‘stupid Palestinians.’ Two of my friends were blocked for a month, and this is not the first time this has happened.” The main problem is that Facebook policies are not standardized, he said. Not all posts containing offensive content are taken down, the process appears to be erratic and Facebook needs to clarify its policies in Israel, he said. “Facebook plays a significant role in our freedom of speech, but it behaves like a monopolistic bully. They are doing a bad job. Their monitoring against incitement is not transparent, not equal and not wise.” In the letter to Facebook, the authors said they expect “Facebook to conduct itself in a responsible, direct and transparent way concerning its policies and relationship with the community. We expect Facebook to immediately remove all blocks and to publish clear and detailed guidelines in every language spoken in Israel that will define the words and other content items that are forbidden from use and sharing on the platform.” “Facebook is a significant (part) of our lives and our demand for appropriate conduct on the network’s behalf is legitimate. This is the only way us content creators will be able to continue creating content and maintaining our Facebook pages, without the constant fear of arbitrary, unexplained blocks,” the authors of the letter wrote. “We will no longer remain silent as Facebook censors us and tramples over our freedom of expression for no reason, while ignoring our attempts to communicate, declining to explain reasons for blocking accounts and not providing an opportunity for users to themselves remove flagged content that has been posted unknowingly.” A copy of the letter was sent to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials.",

      "text": "Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election Posted \nIn case you missed it, last night Mark Zuckerberg published a response to accusations that “fake news” on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election, and helped Donald Trump to win. \nThe CEO claimed that at least 99% of news content on Facebook was “authentic.” Zuckerberg wrote: \n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \nFacebook boasts 1.79 monthly active users, and it generated $7.01 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2016. \nThe company has not enumerated the volume of posts that were categorized as news, and distributed through Facebook’s News Feed during the months leading up to the election. \nIn its earnings reports, Facebook does not break out how much of its revenue comes from political advertising or the promotion of news posts. That makes it hard for the public to evaluate what the impact of even 1% of “hoax” news could have been on users of Facebook who had the right to vote in the U.S. election. \nQuestions remain as to whether hoaxes could have been so well-targeted that they did, in fact, sway opinions of U.S. voters’ on candidates and issues. \nWe know that Facebook has the power to influence emotions, and has tested its own abilities in this regard through its 2012 Emotion Manipulation Experiment. \nAs TechCrunch reported when news of that experiment first broke , to impact users’ moods, Facebook showed them less positive posts in their News Feed, and found that they included .1% fewer positive words in their own posts as a result in following days. \nLast night, Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook now relies on the wisdom and involvement of its users to “flag hoaxes and fake news.” He admitted the company could do more to improve the quality of information shared via its News Feed. \nHowever, he also warned the company would not rush to release new solutions around factchecking or quality-rating news content on the platform. \nHe wrote: \n“This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” \nZuckerberg’s comment draws a false equivalency between “mainstream sources” of news (including TechCrunch) and political groups masquerading as news brands. \nThe Denver Guardian was one site that posed as a news publisher to bombarded readers with content full of misinformation meant to sway their opinions about candidates and issues on the ballot. And another group, based in Macedonia, had been posting fake news to Facebook’s Newsfeed simply to make money. \nFake news circulated virtually everywhere online, and on Facebook, at a time when voters needed facts to inform their decisions, unfortunately. \nThere is a possibility that Facebook may not even want to become “arbiters of truth,” because doing so could reduce engagement. \nAs a former Facebook designer named Bobby Goodlatte wrote on November 8th on his own Facebook wall, “Sadly, News Feed optimizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging. ” \nOther social media players under fire for helping to spread false stories ahead of the U.S. election include Twitter and Reddit, and others. \nBut unlike other social networks, Facebook can proudly claim that it helped 2 million people register to vote in this most recent election. But what good is that if those voters aren’t effectively informed? 0",

      "text": "David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Late on Tuesday night, as it became clear that Donald J. Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election, a private chat sprang up on Facebook among several vice presidents and executives of the social network. \nWhat role, they asked each other, had their company played in the election's outcome? \nFacebook's top executives concluded that they should address the issue and assuage staff concerns at a quarterly all-hands meeting. They also called a smaller meeting with the company's policy team, according to three people who saw the private chat and are familiar with the decisions; they requested anonymity because the discussion was confidential. \nMore from the New York Times: \nWhere cellphones are lifelines, start-up spy opportunities \nTrump's hires will set course of his presidency \nNew Zealand struck by powerful earthquake \nFacebook has been in the eye of a postelection storm for the last few days, embroiled in accusations that it helped spread misinformation and fake news stories that influenced how the American electorate voted. The online conversation among Facebook's executives on Tuesday, which was one of several private message threads that began among the company's top ranks, showed that the social network was internally questioning what its responsibilities might be. \nEven as Facebook has outwardly defended itself as a nonpartisan information source — Mr. Zuckerberg said at a conference on Thursday that Facebook affecting the election was \"a pretty crazy idea\" — many company executives and employees have been asking one another if, or how, they shaped the minds, opinions and votes of Americans. \nSome employees are worried about the spread of racist and so-called alt-right memes across the network, according to interviews with 10 current and former Facebook employees. Others are asking whether they contributed to a \"filter bubble\" among users who largely interact with people who share the same beliefs.\nEven more are reassessing Facebook's role as a media company and wondering how to stop the distribution of false information. Some employees have been galvanized to send suggestions to product managers on how to improve Facebook's powerful news feed: the streams of status updates, articles, photos and videos that users typically spend the most time interacting with.\n\"A fake story claiming Pope Francis — actually a refugee advocate — endorsed Mr. Trump was shared almost a million times, likely visible to tens of millions,\" Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies the social impact of technology, said of a recent post on Facebook. \"Its correction was barely heard. Of course Facebook had significant influence in this last election's outcome.\"\nThis image of Facebook as a partisan influencer and distributor of bad information is at odds with how the company views itself, former and current employees said. Chris Cox, a senior vice president of product and one of Mr. Zuckerberg's top lieutenants, has long described Facebook as an unbiased and blank canvas to give people a voice. Employees and executives genuinely believed they were well-intentioned and acting as a force for good, these people said.\nFacebook declined to comment beyond a previously released statement that it was \"just one of many ways people received their information — and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\"\nOn Saturday night, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a lengthy status update to his Facebook page with some of his thoughts on the election.\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. \"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nHe added: \"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\"\nThe postelection questioning caps a turbulent year for Facebook, during which its power to influence what its 1.79 billion users watch, read and believe has increasingly been criticized. Almost half of American adults rely on Facebook as a source of news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. And Facebook often emphasizes its ability to sway its users with advertisers, portraying itself as an effective mechanism to help promote their products.\nInside Facebook, employees have become more aware of the company's role in media after several incidents involving content the social network displayed in users' news feeds. \nIn May, the company grappled with accusations that politically biased employees were censoring some conservative stories and websites in Facebook's Trending Topics section, a part of the site that shows the most talked-about stories and issues on Facebook. Facebook later laid off the Trending Topics team. \nIn September, Facebook came under fire for removing a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, as she fled napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. The social network took down the photo for violating its nudity standards, even though the picture was an illustration of the horrors of war rather than child pornography. \nBoth those incidents seemed to worsen a problem of fake news circulating on Facebook. The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook's willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity, employees said. The \"napalm girl\" incident reminded many insiders at Facebook of the company's often tone-deaf approach to nuanced situations. \nThroughout, Mr. Zuckerberg has defended Facebook as a place where people can share all opinions. When employees objected in October to the stance of Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, in supporting Mr. Trump, Mr. Zuckerberg said, \"We care deeply about diversity\" and reiterated that the social network gave everyone the power to share their experiences. \nMore recently, issues with fake news on the site have mushroomed. Multiple Facebook employees were particularly disturbed last week when a fake news site called The Denver Guardian spread across the social network with negative and false messages about Mrs. Clinton, including a claim that an F.B.I. agent connected to Mrs. Clinton's email disclosures had murdered his wife and shot himself. \nOn Thursday, after a companywide meeting at Facebook, many employees said they were dissatisfied with an address from Mr. Zuckerberg, who offered comments to staff that were similar to what he has said publicly. \nEven in private, Mr. Zuckerberg has continued to resist the notion that Facebook can unduly affect how people think and behave. In a Facebook post circulated on Wednesday to a small group of his friends, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Zuckerberg challenged the idea that Facebook had a direct effect on the way people voted. \nIn the three-paragraph post, the chief executive cited several statistics about low voter turnout during the election. \nThen Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: \"So rather than focusing on strengths or weaknesses in specific demographics, or other factors that may have pushed this race in one direction or another, these stats clearly suggest what many people have said all along. Both candidates were very unpopular.\"",

      "text": "November 12, 2016 Employers begin calculus of balancing rising minimum wage and maintaining business \nAccording to a BuzzFeed analysis of many of these hyperpartisan pages, that misinformation targets both progressives and conservatives, but false or misleading news stories are more common among right-wing sites. That’s also reflected in The Post’s own, nonscientific tracking of fake stories about the election across all social media platforms over the past few weeks. Misinformation on Facebook wasn’t exclusive to the supporters of one candidate, but it was more common and viral on the right. \nThere is also some evidence that right-wing readers of online news are being encouraged to ignore attempts at verification of these stories. “Forget the press, read the internet,” Trump told his supporters just months before his victory. He didn’t specify which parts of the internet he liked, but we already know that he accepts and repeats information from websites and tabloids that publish false or misleading articles. For instance, he has in the past complimented the work of Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, which has argued that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a “false flag.” \n“The internet,” even just Facebook, looks very different to different people. As Facebook gains influence in the lives of its users, experts have become concerned about algorithmically enforced “filter bubbles.” People tend to click on stories that confirm their worldview. \nAny good algorithm for a site like Facebook would be able to notice that and use the information to start showing users other posts and stories like it. Although Facebook has over the years denied that its algorithms are part of the problem, the fact remains that ideological polarization on Facebook is getting worse at a time when the site has never been more important to how people consume information. Zuckerberg repeated his company’s long-standing response to questions about the influence of the filter bubble on Thursday. Which is, essentially, that it’s the people, and not the site or its algorithms, that create the problem. \n“Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, probably 10 percent are Republicans. Even if you live in some state or country, you will know some people in another state, another country,” he said. He added later that “it’s not that the diverse information isn’t there . . . but we haven’t got people to engage with it in higher proportions.” Tags:",

      "text": "Politics | Sun Nov 13, 2016 | 3:47pm EST Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on U.S. election Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seen on stage during a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California September 27, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg again rejected the idea that the social network affected the U.S. presidential election, saying late Saturday it is \"extremely unlikely\" news hoaxes changed the outcome. \nEnsnared in a string of content controversies in recent months, Facebook has insisted that it is a technology company, not a media firm. But scrutiny of the site has heightened since the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday, with critics alleging the site helped spread lies via fake news stories and hoaxes. \nZuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election \"crazy\" at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news. \nSuch hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the election's outcome, Zuckerberg said. \n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,\" he said, noting the network's goal is to \"give every person a voice.\" \nStill, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said. \nFacebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook. \n[nL1N1CJ2CE] \nQuestions over content policing have returned to the fore in the tense days since the election, which has led to protests against Trump and his proposed policies in major U.S. cities. [nL1N1DE06M] \nAhead of the Nov. 8 election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. \nSenior management have launched a conversation to examine Facebook's involvement in affecting opinions and votes, The New York Times reported on Saturday, saying a group of vice presidents and executives began discussing late Tuesday the company's role in the election's outcome. \nFacebook's policy team was called together and the firm plans to address staff concerns at a broader meeting, the paper reported, citing anonymous sources. \nFacebook representatives were not immediately available to comment on the report. \n\"After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading,\" Zuckerberg said on Saturday. \n\"These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right.\" \n(Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Mary Milliken) Next In Politics",

      "text": "2016 8 hours ago \nDonald Trump’s campaign spent nearly as much money on Facebook ($56 million) as on TV ($68 million) to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. \n“I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, who also heads the right-wing media site Breitbart, told Bloomberg before the election, explaining the campaign’s plans to drive down voter participation with anti-Clinton memes. “Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.” \nTrump won the election in a squeaker. Yet, if you ask Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about his platform’s power, well, he’s not so familiar with it—particularly when it comes to accusations about fake news stories posted on Facebook. \n“Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way—I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said two days after the election . “Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.” Does the CEO of this social media platform know how much his users’ lived experience is affected by Facebook? He may not. (The average Facebook user spends 50 minutes a day on Facebook’s platforms, according to internal company data.) The effects go beyond fake news appearing in one’s newsfeed; many also question whether the company’s affinity-matching services are siloing American users too much into like-minded networks. \nZuckerberg’s strategy is to avoid categorizing Facebook as a media company. Instead, he insists his company is a tech enterprise, which means he doesn’t need to be responsible for the content on his platform. As a media company, Facebook would need to develop ways to actively police the content or risk lawsuits for libel, free speech claims, and demands for fairness. Zuckerberg seems to be in denial here . His company is a primary distribution platform for digital media, and it makes its money through advertising. Zuckerburg’s denial becomes a particular problem with the issue of fake news. Many online activists spread false news stories on Facebook. Even ostensibly objective digital news sites create inflammatory posts designed to spread on Facebook that may not true. Zuckerberg claims that these news stories don’t reach people, writing in a Nov. 12 Facebook post that “of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” \nWe’ve contacted Facebook to ask how Zuckerberg came up with that figure, or whether the word “authentic” is doing a lot of work in place of terms like “accurate” or “true.” If fake news is shared by a user who believes it, is that authentic? \nMoreover, by claiming that fake news on his platform doesn’t affect users, Zuckerberg is also undercutting the argument for the efficacy of ads on the platform, as Hillary Clinton’s digital director noted on Twitter. I spent tens of millions trying to persuade voters on Facebook this cycle. If it didn't matter, can I have my money back please? https://t.co/eh4Ivdmr30 \n— Jenna Lowenstein (@just_jenna) November 13, 2016 \nWhat, after all, are advertisements, but fake news? But making paid promotions, whether advertisements or fake news, more obvious to users may make it more difficult for Facebook to earn revenue from them. And attempting to police “fake news” on a user-driven website promises to be an exasperating, if not impossible task. \nIt’s no simple dilemma, for Zuckerberg, or Facebook fans who want to use and improve their platform. But one thing is for sure: You can’t create a world-changing platform for social interaction, then claim it had little to do with a cataclysmic shift in society. Read full story ",

      "text": "filed under: charity , Food Like us on Facebook \nIf diners aren’t feeling the menu at EAT Cafe in Philadelphia’s Mantua neighborhood, they only have to wait a week to find something new. The charity-driven restaurant adapts to donations they receive from partners. After serving an Italian menu one week, a shipment of green tomatoes might inspire a soul food theme the next. But no matter what’s for dinner on any given night, the meal’s price tag—pay what you can—stays the same. \nEAT, or Everyone at the Table, became Philadelphia’s first nonprofit “community cafe” when it opened in the City of Brotherly Love at the end of October, Philly.com reports. It takes its cues from dozens of similar restaurants around the country: Meals are served for a suggested donation of $15. If you can afford that, great. If you can pay more, less, or nothing at all, that’s fine too. \nThe Drexel University enterprise seeks to differentiate itself from other pay-what-you-can spots by operating in the style of a full-service establishment. Instead of serving themselves cafeteria-style, diners can come in four nights a week for a three-course meal of restaurant-quality food. Mariana Chilton, who runs Drexel's Center for Hunger-Free Communities, told Philly.com, \"I wanted to make sure this would not be confused with a soup kitchen. It sets the stage for a place where all different kinds of people would want to meet up and intermingle.\" \nEAT currently sources their food from vendors and donors like Metropolitan Bakery, La Colombe, and Giant Food Stores. Their ultimate goal is to work with 60 percent donated ingredients with a target cost of $3.25 per meal and serve roughly 130 people a night. The cafe isn’t yet where it needs to be (they only served 125 meals in their first week), but the team behind it hopes that once word gets around, EAT will act as a space \" to nourish the community through good food and fellowship .\" \nHeader banner images courtesy of iStock.

Arthur Heeler-Frood disappeared two months ago. Credit: Devon and Cornwall Police \nWe are appealing to business owners, likely to be restaurateurs, hoteliers and cafe owners who may have had a young man work for them in the last few months or anyone who may have provided accommodation to him in that time period. – Superintendent Sam de Reya, Devon and Cornwall Police \nLast week, his parents appeared on ITV's This Morning and read a heart-breaking letter from Arthur, in which he said he would return in a year. \nMrs Heeler-Frood made a direct appeal for her son to return home. \nShe told the programme: \"Arthur, please, please just make contact with us.

      "text": "Facebook opens analytics and FbStart to developers of Messenger’s 34,000 bots Posted Microsoft announces Visual Studio for Mac will launch in November \nFacebook has been putting a lot of effort into growing Messenger as a bot platform this year, and now there are 34,000 of these bots in existence, built to present you with news and entertainment, let you shop, and more — expanding Messenger’s use beyond simple chats with friends. Today, that strategy is getting a significant boost: Facebook says it will now let developers track bots on its free analytics platform, alongside ads and apps. At the same time, Facebook is also opening up its developer program, FbStart , to bot developers. \nBoth potentially give bot makers more reasons to build and monitor how their new widgets are working. \nJosh Twist, a product manager for Facebook Messenger’s bot efforts, who is an Englishman based in Seattle but is in London today to debut the tools at a developer event, tells me that Facebook expanded the analytics and FbStart tools after a lot of requests from the developers. \n“Getting bot support for messenger is the most frequently requested feature from bot developers,” he said. This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise: Facebook already provided these kinds of tools to other developers on its platform, and bots have seen a massive surge of interest since they first made their debut earlier this year. That interest has not just come from users curious about how they work; developers are also very keen to see if bots really are the next big thing. \nTwist tells me that for now, the analytics will cover bots built just for Messenger. But given how bots are making their way to other communication platforms, from competing messaging apps like Viber’s through to enterprise-focused platforms like Slack , don’t be surprised if Facebook expands its both analytics to other platforms beyond Messenger. \n“It is something we have talked about and haven’t ruled it out,” he said. “It’s possible, absolutely, since we already support analytics for other platforms for apps. But right now we’re prioritizing support for Messenger bots. ” \nAnalytics, of course, is an essential tool for a developer, both to be able to track how well something is working and other kids of feedback. Here Facebook says that features that will be included are reaches across mobile and desktop devices and measurement of customers’ journeys across apps and websites. \nDevelopers also will be able to view reports on messages sent, messages received, and people who block or unblock your app. And they will also get access to anonymized data reports on bot demographics, which include details like age, gender, education, interests, country and language to figure out who is using your bot. \nFbStart, meanwhile, currently has some 9,000 members who get feedback from Facebook on their apps, ads and bots, as well as Facebook ads credits and other free tools from partners like Amazon, Dropbox, and Stripe. If Facebook was looking at ways of swelling those ranks, tapping 34,000 developers could be one way of doing that. \nTwist points out that while there are a lot of standalone bot developers coming to Facebook for the first time, there is a lot of crossover with other Facebook services like apps and ads. Those who are leveraging these together — for example using the recent ability to channel a person from a News Feed ad through to your Messenger experience — will be able to look at the effectiveness of those efforts now, and make potentially more ad buys based on them.",

      "text": "Follow The Fan: Facebook | Twitter \nPITTSBURGH (AP) – Tony Romo will be back in uniform next Sunday when the Dallas Cowboys host the Baltimore Ravens. \nThe leading passer in franchise history however, won’t be under center. As much respect as owner Jerry Jones has for Romo, even Jones isn’t going to go away from one of the hottest hands in the NFL, one that has the streaking Cowboys atop the NFC East with no signs of slowing. \nIt’s your job for now, Dak Prescott. \nA few more games like the 319-yard, two-touchdown performance in Sunday’s 35-30 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers and it may be yours for good. \n“I think the longer he plays like this, the more we have a chance to have another win,” Jones said. “Everybody here wants to do one thing and that’s win. And there’s nobody that would introduce any other issue or any other consideration than doing what it takes to win the game.” \nRomo included, apparently. Though Romo is practicing and fully recovered from the back injury he suffered in August, Jones plans to stick with Prescott with the Cowboys (8-1) riding an eight-game winning streak. While running back Ezekiel Elliott scored twice in the final 2 minutes of a wild fourth quarter to bring Dallas back a pair of one-point deficits, Jones was equally awed by the ease with which Prescott handled the pressure against a team desperate to right itself. \nPrescott went 9 for 10 over the final two Dallas drives, standing in the face of the Pittsburgh pass rush like a player who’s been around for more than just a couple of months. \n“He was outstanding,” Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. “It’s contagious throughout our team. Guys believed in him. Everyone believed in each other.” \nOther takeaways as Dallas matched the longest single-season winning streak in team history while the Steelers (4-5) dropped their fourth straight. \nZESTY ZEKE Elliott, the “other” Dallas rookie, found the going tough until late in the fourth quarter. Then, the NFL’s leading rusher with the relentlessly churning legs buried Pittsburgh. His first touchdown, a 14-yard dash down the right sideline, put the Cowboys up 29-24. \nHis second, a 32-yard sprint right up the middle , came on a simple play when he was just trying get the ball a little closer for kicker Dan Bailey. Instead, Elliott found nothing but a large swath of green in front of him. \n“It parted like the Red Sea,” Elliott said. “All I had to do was run.” \nFOR YOU, DAD Dallas wide receiver Dez Bryant caught six passes for 114 yards and a score , his most productive game of the season. Bryant’s breakout came just a day after the death of his father, MacArthur Hatton. Bryant chose to play and paid tribute by pointing to the sky after his pretty 50-yard touchdown grab. \n“I don’t know how you being to understand how someone can perform at that level dealing with such an emotional thing in their life,” Garrett said. “He was locked in. He was very passionate throughout the ball game.” \nACCOUNTING ISSUES? Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger passed for 408 yards and three scores to move into 10th on the NFL’s all-time list for career touchdown passes (292), slipping by Hall of Famers Johnny Unitas and Warren Moon. Yet it wasn’t enough to lift Pittsburgh to its first victory in more than a month. \nRoethlisberger said the Steelers were “undisciplined and not accountable.” When asked what he meant by accountable, Roethlisberger didn’t exactly provide specifics on where his team was lacking. \n“Just a feel,” he said. \nMARINO 2.0 Roethlisberger channeled Hall of Famer Dan Marino late in the fourth quarter, faking a spike and instead lobbing a 15-yard scoring pass to Brown that put Pittsburgh in front with 42 seconds left. It was reminiscent of Marino’s famous play against the New York Jets in 1994 . However, the exception is the Dolphins won and the Steelers didn’t. \n“(Offensive coordinator) Todd (Haley) was in my head yelling `Don’t waste a down,”‘ Roethlisberger said. “But I knew what we were doing, so I’m glad it worked.” \nUP NEXT Cowboys: Will go for their ninth straight victory on Sunday against the Ravens. Dallas has never won nine consecutive games in one season in the franchise’s 57-year history. “There have been a lot of great teams and championship teams that have come through in the last 57 years,” Garrett said. “That’s certainly something to comment on. It’s been a good streak for us.” \n*Listen to Dallas Cowboys football locally in DFW on 105.3 The Fan \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)",

      "text": "Wildlife traffickers from a small, sleepy village in Vietnam are using Facebook to offload large amounts of illegal ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts, an investigation has revealed.\nThe results of an 18-month sting by the Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) – shared with the Guardian – will be presented at a public hearing on 14 and 15 November at the Peace Palace in the Hague. They will show how social media sites such as Facebook are allowing traders greater access to customers.\n“It’s wildlife trafficking on an industrial scale,” said Olivia Swaak-Goldman, the executive director of the WJC.\nUndercover investigators visited the Vietnamese village of Nhi Khe, known as a wildlife trafficking hub, five times in the past year and scoured Facebook and WeChat, which is popular in China. In all, they tallied illegal wildlife products worth $53.1m (£42.8m) stemming from just 51 traders in the village for sale in person and online.\nNhi Khe traders are primarily using Facebook to sell processed ivory products. But even whole ivory tusks and tiger bone paste have been sold on the platform.\n“Social media provides a shopfront to the world,” Swaak-Goldman said.\nItems are being sold in closed or secret groups through auctions, which means new buyers or sellers have to be approved before being allowed into the group. Once in, traders will use instant messaging to keep in touch with buyers.\nSuch Facebook groups are also allowing traders to meet a wide array of potential new buyers. Payment is usually done via WeChat Wallet.\nWJC investigators have found that Facebook is primarily used by traders to sell wares locally or across other parts of south-east Asia. In contrast, traders use WeChat to sell unprocessed products in bulk to Chinese traders. Since Vietnamese traders aren’t able to write in Chinese, they tend to offer products on WeChat via voice message.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A beaded elephant bone and ivory bracelet, advertised for sale on Facebook and identified by the WJC. Photograph: Wildlife Justice Commission\nThis appears to be a widening pattern for wildlife traffickers in the region. In March, Traffic, another anti-wildlife trade organisation, announced that Facebook had become a popular tool for selling both animals parts and live animals with wildlife traffickers in Malaysia . These traders also use auctions in closed and secret groups to keep their illegal activities out of the public eye.\nThe WJC approached Facebook about the issue and a spokesperson from the social media group told it: “Facebook does not allow the sale and trade of endangered animals and we will not hesitate to remove any content that violates our community standards when it is reported to us.”\nThe social media giant’s community standards “prohibit the use of Facebook to facilitate or organise criminal behaviour that causes physical harm to … animals”.\nSwaak-Goldman said Facebook needs to go further, including shutting down traderss accounts and cooperating with law enforcement.\nFacebook has the capacity to delete posts of entire accounts, but the group said how it reacts depends on the severity of the breach in community standards. As to working with law enforcement, Facebook said it would not comment on specific legal cases.\nBuyers make bids for the bracelet below the post. Prices offered for this piece are little more than US$20 because only one of the beads is ivory. Photograph: Wildlife Justice Commission Sales are also continuing in person in Nhi Khe, which is home to just a few thousand people. Historically, Nhi Khe was a village of wood carvers, but in recent decades its economy has shifted towards this more lucrative trade, dealing in everything from dead baby tigers in a jar to sawed-off rhino feet, as documented in photos and videos taken by WJC investigators. The village is perfectly situated for the illicit trade, being 20km south of Hanoi and not far from the Chinese border.\nThroughout the investigation, the WJC tallied products representing up to 907 dead elephants and 225 dead tigers. Experts believe most of the tigers were born in tiger farms, because if they were coming strictly from wild tigers, it would represent nearly 6% of the world’s population.\nBut even more surprising was the amount of rhino material passing through Nhi Khe. Investigators detailed rhino parts from 579 individual rhinos, nearly half of the total amount of rhinos killed in South Africa last year.\nAnd these numbers don’t take into account products not directly seen by investigators either via social media or in person.\n“Can you imagine what the real number is?” said Swaak-Goldman. “This is the tip of the iceberg.”\nThe WJC also noted products in Nhi Khe that were from bears, pangolins, hawksbill sea turtles and helmeted hornbills.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The WJC said its investigators found more than one instance of raw elephant tusks being advertised for sale on Facebook. Photograph: Wildlife Justice Commission\nLast month, WWF and the Zoological Society of London released an update of the Living Planet Report that found the world is suffering a catastrophic loss in global wildlife . According to the report, wildlife populations fell by 58% from 1970-2012 and we are on track to lose two-thirds of wildlife populations by 2020.\nThe global wildlife trade is playing a leading role in what could become the world’s sixth mass extinction event. The illicit trade is estimated to be worth around $23bn (£18.5bn), making it the fourth largest illegal trade after drugs, arms and human trafficking (and that’s not including illegal fisheries, worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually).\nOver the past year, Nhi Khe traders have stopped showing their products in windowed store fronts, but the trade remains brazenly open, even more so than online.\n“On the front [of the shops], it advertises in Mandarin ‘rhino horn’, ‘tiger’, ‘ivory’. It’s like buying a Big Mac,” Swaak-Goldman said.\nIvory is in high demand worldwide for carvings and decorations, while rhino horn is believed, against all evidence, to be a curative in eastern Asian medicine. But Swaak-Goldman said tiger parts have largely become a status symbol for men. They are a part of the “Vietnamese gangster” look, she said, adding that wearing the body parts of a dead tiger is “a fashion statement with its claws and its slight hoodlumism”.\nSuch beliefs are killing off the world’s megafauna. Tigers are listed on the IUCN red list of endangered species. Several tiger subspecies are already extinct and all those remaining in south-east Asia (Sumatran, Malayan and the Indochinese) are on the verge of extinction. Meanwhile, Africa has lost 110,000 elephants from 2007-15 due to an epidemic of poaching, potentially putting forest elephants – which have been harder hit than savannah elephants – at risk of annihilation.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A trader in Vietnam shows off his tiger claw necklace, gun and other spoils of the trade. Photograph: Wildlife Justice Commission\nWhile the WJC is working with Facebook to combat the trade online, its biggest target is the Vietnamese government. The WJC began communicating with the government as soon as it launched the investigation in July 2015. Since then, it has handed over thousands of pages of evidence prepared by qualified law enforcement professionals to five government agencies.\n“Unfortunately, we have not received an adequate response or seen indication of serious law enforcement activity. We have continued to offer our support and co-operation to dismantle this network,” Swaak-Goldman said. “Given this lack of action [by the government], we have no choice but to present this investigation at a public hearing.”\nExperts have long viewed Vietnam as a hub for the global wildlife trade, especially in rhino horn. Today, three of the world’s five rhino species are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN red list, while the world is losing more than 1,000 white rhinos a year to poachers. Poaching has also taken a human toll: both wildlife rangers and poachers are sometimes killed in gunfights.\nThe WJC believes simply shutting down the trade in Nhi Khe alone could have a “significant impact” on global rhino poaching, given the staggering amount of product moving through the village.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An awning in Nhi Khe advertising ivory, agarwood and rosewood. Photograph: Wildlife Justice Commission\nIf caught and convicted, illegal traders in wildlife products in Vietnam face up to three years in jail. But the sentence could jump to seven years if the trade is deemed organised, which the WJC asserts is the case in Nhi Khe. Still, this is lower than other crimes in Vietnam. For example, possessing heroin in the country can lead to a life sentence or the death penalty.\nBut Vietnam has shown some signs of creating a new strategy on wildlife trafficking. In September, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc issued a directive urging local and regional officials to step up the fight against wildlife trafficking. The country has also announced a partnership with the US to combat the global trade. Vietnam is hosting a major international conference on the global wildlife trade 17-18 November, with Prince William expected to attend.\nAlthough only a year old, the WJC has already had success combating the illegal wildlife trade: an investigation resulted in the arrest of 16 wildlife traders in Malaysia in September.\nThe WJC hopes the public hearing on Monday will push Vietnam to “take real action” against the traders of Nhi Khe, Swaak-Goldman said. The public hearing at the Hague can be viewed live on Monday and Tuesday on the WJC’s website .",

But in some cases, thoughtfully designed utensils can help. Some adaptive utensils have wider grips or are contoured to make them easier to use. However, in the case of Knork Flatware , the benefits for people with mobility issues were kind of accidental, as Fast Company reports. \nKnork makes streamlined utensils designed to accommodate the way people actually eat—like sharp edges to allow you to cut with the side of a fork. They’re designed to be ergonomic, with comfortable platforms to place your fingers, and have a larger, balanced design to keep them from falling off plates. After launching, letters began pouring in from patients who couldn’t eat easily on their own with traditional utensils, saying that the forks were helping them eat one-handed and unassisted . And because they look like any other high-quality utensil that belongs on a white table cloth, patients don’t have to deal with feeling out of place using special needs forks and knives. \nThe company is launching a pilot study to analyze how patients use the flatware, and how design tweaks might improve the experience for them.",

He told police he enjoyed the attention he got. An aspiring weatherman in Kentucky was arrested after admitting to intentionally setting a forest fire in hopes of pursuing his dream, police said.\nJohnny Mullins, 21, reportedly wanted to bring attention to his Facebook videos where he reported on the fire, police said.\nHe’s been charged with second-degree arson in connection with a blaze in Letcher County, according to police.\nMullins posted selfie videos on Facebook that were recorded in front of various fires, police said.\nIn one of the video that is viewable on Mullins Facebook page, he tells viewers “Be extremely careful if you're out there.”\nHe called his reports \"Weather Outlook\" segments and has almost 5,000 views on a video he posted on November 6.\nMullins was charged earlier this week after he told police he started the fire \"because he enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff,” police said.\n\"It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid — he's just misguided,\" said Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens. \"He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Facebook's role in the 2016 election has been controversial. Photo by Getty Images \nJust in case you missed it first time, Mark Zuckerberg has once again defended the role Facebook played in the presidential election. \nThe social network's chief executive and co-founder responded on Sunday to accusations that Facebook played a role in promoting news biased towards Trump throughout the presidential election campaign. \nZuckerberg expanded on points he made during the Techonomy conference last week with a post on Facebook , which he used \"to share some thoughts\" on \"an historic election\" that he acknowledged has been \"very painful for many people.\" \nHe admitted that Facebook had work to do when identifying fake news. \"We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further,\" he said. \nMore than 99 percent of content on Facebook is authentic and the small amount that isn't is rarely political or biased in any particular way, Zuckerberg said. Facebook already allows users to flag stories that aren't true and is looking for more ways in which it can harness the community to prevent false news from being spread. \nThe social network must be careful though to ensure it is overstepping its boundaries when it comes to freedom of speech, though, the Facebook CEO said. \"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\"",

      "title": "Amazon to Refund Parents Whose Children Made In-App Purchases Without Permission",
      "text": "PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nIn 2014, the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on behalf of millions of parents whose kids spent money on in-app purchases without permission, on the grounds that the tech company made it far too easy for children to run up unlimited charges without any kind of permission from the account holder. Now, a federal judge has ruled that Amazon needs to set up a payment plan for the eligible customers to begin in 2017, Reuters reports. \nThe FTC alleged that, beginning in 2011, Amazon’s lack of parental permission guards resulted in $86 million in unauthorized charges for mobile games targeted toward kids like \"Ice Age Village,\" and subsequent updates to the in-app purchase process did little to fix the issue. According to the FTC, \"kids’ games often encourage children to acquire virtual items in ways that blur the lines between what costs virtual currency and what costs real money.\" A 2012 update to the charge system limited the amount of money kids could spend without parental permission, but still allowed charges of up to $20 without any kind of approval from a parent’s account. Internal communications from Amazon show that employees knew the extent of the problem, and likened the situation to \"near house on fire.\" \nA U.S. district judge in Seattle found the company liable in April 2016 , and has now ordered the company to begin paying out eligible customers. Regulators had argued for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout, but the judge found those damages to be too high. Instead, the company will have to alert customers who are eligible starting next year, and begin reimbursing them in cash (not gift cards, as Amazon requested). \nAmazon is not the first tech company to be held accountable for profits reaped from kids buying digital goods without their parents’ knowledge. Apple and Google have previously been targeted by the FTC over similar issues, and began paying refunds out in 2014.",

      "text": "For some people, looking at Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can spark jealousy and stoke fear of missing out. When we see others’ seemingly glamorous lives and purchases, it can make us want to “keep up with the Joneses.” But following certain accounts can influence you in a different way: they can make you smarter about money.\nRoughly four in 10 adults with a social media account (39%) say that seeing other people’s purchases and vacations on social media makes them look into a similar purchase or vacation , according to a survey of more than 1,000 Americans released this summer by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\nBut what if you started to use social media for your own financial good?\nIf you’re focused specifically on investing, check out this great list of Twitter must-follows from my colleague Barbara Kollmeyer.\nAnd for keeping yourself on track with your spending and saving habits, here are some of TWTR, +1.24% s finest. (If you don’t have Twitter, check out their websites, or find them on Facebook FB, -3.31% or Instagram, since many have feeds on there, too.)\nFor anyone who wants to be smarter about money:\nIf you’re a beginner in personal finance, you may want to follow some accounts that cover a wide range of topics.\nWe obviously think the best one is MarketWatch’s personal finance Twitter account , where you’ll find all kinds of stories about saving, investing, retirement, real estate, student loans and more.\nYou’ll also want to stay updated on the policies that affect your finances, so head over to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Twitter account for the latest updates on your rights as a consumer.

Their Twitter account shares stories including “4 Things I Learned From Quitting My Job With No Plan,” and you may want to check out their Instagram account , where you’ll find beautiful images and motivational sayings for when staying on track with earning and saving seems tough.\nI especially appreciate their creation of the hashtag #TotallyHonestTuesday, where they encourage readers to post about their lives and financial mistakes — a refreshing counterpoint to the polished, curated posts of fancy vacations and other life highlights your friends are probably posting.\nAnd check out The Billfold for personal stories about saving and spending money.

      "text": "Facebook's role in the 2016 election has been controversial. \nPhoto by Getty Images In case you missed it the first time, Mark Zuckerberg is once again defending the role Facebook played in the presidential election.\nThe social network's chief executive responded Sunday to accusations that Facebook promoted news bias that hurt Hillary Clinton and helped Donald Trump in the presidential election campaign. Examples include a fake story about an FBI agent associated with Clinton 's email leaks being found dead in a murder suicide and another fake story about the Pope endorsing Trump.\nZuckerberg expanded on points he made at a tech conference last week in a Facebook post Sunday about a \"historic election\" that has been \"very painful for many people.\" It wasn't just the election that was historic, though. The role that social media played was unprecedented.\nTrump, who won an unexpected victory last week against Clinton, has hailed the influence of social media in the election because it enabled him to speak directly to millions of people. Trump estimated in a \"60 Minutes\" interview , which aired Sunday, that he has about 28 million followers across all the social media platforms. \"I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing we should be ashamed of,\" he said.\nZuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook has work to do when it comes to identifying fake news. \"We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further,\" he said.\nMore than 99 percent of content on Facebook is authentic, Zuckerberg said in his post, and the 1 percent is rarely political or biased in a particular way. Facebook already enables users to flag stories that aren't true and is looking for more ways that it can harness the community to prevent false news from spreading.\nThe social network must be careful though to ensure it isn't overstepping its boundaries when it comes to freedom of speech, though, Zuckerberg said.\n\"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful,\" he said, \"but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\"",

      "text": "Facebook reportedly had a fake news fix, but was too afraid to use it Sources claim an ‘internal culture of fear’ following the Trending Topics debacle share A new report says Facebook shelved an update that would have suppressed fake news from going viral on the social network. According to Gizmodo , high-ranking Facebook executives were briefed on an update that identified fake news and hoaxes, but the tool was never released in fears of “upsetting conservatives.” The tool, which heavily affected right-wing media, was reportedly killed following revelations that the company’s human-curated Trending Topics team often favored liberal topics. Facebook then fired the team in place of an algorithm, which instead regularly surfaced fake news onto Trending Topics . It also updated the news feed to favor stories about friends and family over clickbait headlines and spam . As Zuckerberg remains dismissive, some of his “top executives” were asking each other whether Facebook had unduly affected the election Still, Zuckerberg maintains that “99 percent of what people see [on Facebook] is authentic.” The CEO claimed that fake news worked both ways — with inaccurate stories shared on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton — though a report earlier this year cites that right-wing media published misleading information 38 percent of the time compared to left-wing media’s 20 percent. As Zuckerberg remains dismissive, some of his “top executives” were asking each other whether Facebook had unduly affected the election, The New York Times reports . Facebook employees are reportedly “aware” of the social network’s influence and role in media with its content distribution powers. “ The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity,” employees told the Times. We’ve contacted Facebook for comment and will update if we hear back. In the Gizmodo report, Facebook denied withholding updates based on “potential impact with any one political party.” More From The Verge",

      "text": "Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg says it’s a “crazy idea” to suggest fake news influenced the outcome of the presidential election, but the social media giant is moving forward with plans to squash said content anyway.\nAfter saying Thursday that it’s “extremely unlikely” that a “small amount” of bogus posts masquerading as “news” had an effect on the election, Zuckerberg took to his Facebook page Saturday to elaborate:\nOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\nBut the billionaire tech tycoon went on to say that, because “we don’t want any hoaxes on Facebook,” the company has already begun work that will eventually allow users to “flag” hoaxes and “so-called fake news.”\nBut, he continued, “This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully”:\nIdentifying the “truth” is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual.\nZuckerberg said he’s “confident” Facebook can find a way to get rid of flatly false information while keeping what is “meaningful.” At the same time, he acknowledged we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.”\n\n(H/T: Business Insider )",

      "text": "Facebook Reportedly Had the Chance to Fix Their Fake News Problem and Chose Not To By Facebook David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? A rampant fake news problem you refuse to address. \nThere are a lot of reasons why Donald Trump was elected President. Economic anxiety. A desire to blow up the system. Sexism. The Democrats' midwest strategy. And the list goes on and on. But one reason, and this is a problem that is far bigger than this election, is Facebook. \nThe social networking giant has faced a rash of criticism for its inability to deal with the huge number of fake news stories that go viral on the site, thus making many people believe that the Pope really did endorse Donald Trump (he didn't), or that Hillary Clinton had an affair with Yoko Ono in the '70s (she didn't). Considering that Facebook is the primary driver for how a huge number of Americans get their news ( 44 percent of them, actually !), this is a huge problem. And one that Facebook has been hesitant to admit exists. \nIn a Facebook post after the election Mark Zuckerberg addressed this issue but downplayed its importance: \nOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other. \nAnd yet despite that (seemingly preposterous) claim that just 1 percent of news is fake, it's almost impossible to go on the site and not see false stories being shared. Take for instance this study that shows Zika misinformation spread far wider than actual facts. \nWhile most of the 200 posts contained useful and credible information, the researchers found that those spreading conspiracy theories or misinformation were most popular. \nThe most shared credible and useful post, for example, was a video of a WHO press briefing that was viewed 43,000 times and shared by 964 Facebook accounts. The most popular post spreading misinformation claimed Zika virus is a \"fraudulent medical hoax\" and was viewed more than 530,000 times. That post was also shared by more than 19,600 people. \nAnd today we get a great report from Gizmodo that claims Facebook has actually had the ability to fix this problem a few months before the election, but decided against it: \nAccording to two sources with direct knowledge of the company’s decision-making, Facebook executives conducted a wide-ranging review of products and policies earlier this year, with the goal of eliminating any appearance of political bias. One source said high-ranking officials were briefed on a planned News Feed update that would have identified fake or hoax news stories, but disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites by downgrading or removing that content from people’s feeds. According to the source, the update was shelved and never released to the public. It’s unclear if the update had other deficiencies that caused it to be scrubbed. \n“They absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news,” said the source, who asked to remain anonymous citing fear of retribution from the company. The source added, “there was a lot of fear about upsetting conservatives after Trending Topics,” and that “a lot of product decisions got caught up in that.” \nFacebook disputes this, but Zuckerberg also claims that only 1 percent of the news on Facebook is fake. So... Who knows. But as long as a huge number of people are getting their news from Facebook, we all have a vested interest in that news being accurate. Facts are still important. Or at least, they should be.",

      "text": "Facebook is a 'cesspool of nonsense,' says John Oliver Facebook is a 'cesspool of nonsense,' says John Oliver Technically Incorrect: The HBO comedian insists that Facebook did influence the election results. Facebook is a 'cesspool of nonsense,' says John Oliver 0 Share: \nOliver and examples from the cesspool Photo by Last Week Tonight/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nThe firing squads have become as circular as the arguments. \nThose that hoped for a Hillary Clinton victory are now looking the culprits in a defeat that so many data nerds, media members and Goldman Sachs executives failed to predict. \nOne target has been social media. \nPresiding over a very loud wake on Sunday night , HBO comedian John Oliver suggested the conventional media played into Donald Trump's hands by, for example, airing his speeches live and unedited. \nHe slung most bile, however, at social media (near the 10-minute mark of the video). \nAround 44 percent of people get their news from Facebook , he explained. Naturally, he gravitated to the idea that Facebook harbors many fake news sites that peddle complete garbage in a partisan cause. \nHe explained that while the informed -- in his view -- might have enjoyed a News Feed full of articles from The New York Times and The Washington Post, many Americans saw \"a cesspool of nonsense.\" More Technically Incorrect On 'SNL,' a somber Hillary Clinton refuses to give up \nHe insisted that President-elect Trump is one who shares such nonsense with his followers. (This led Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly to once suggest that Trump should never tweet again .) \nFacebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it was \"crazy \" to imagine his site had influenced voters. \nOn Monday, however, he suggested Facebook would do something about fake news . \nStill, the complaints about Facebook are odd. This is a company into which humans have voluntarily piled their personal data for the past few years. It has no customers, other than those it sells ads to. What responsibility should it have to people who pay nothing for the service, yet expect that Facebook will bend to some sort of moral will? \nBlaming Facebook and its fellow social media also misses that human beings often operate by their own personal instincts, good and bad. \nThose are often simpler and more basic than any amount of fake news or social media trolling. \nFor just enough people in just the right -- or, if you prefer, wrong -- places, Clinton represented more of the same and Trump stood for something, anything different. Oh, and he was famous too. \nWhich might have influenced people in, say, Wisconsin more: fake news or the fact that the Democratic candidate didn't bother going to Wisconsin at all ? \nThere's something quaint about the idea that people aren't able to think or decide for themselves and need to be told what to do. Propaganda certainly plays a role, but not the only role. When the word \"populism\" is used to describe movements such as Trump's, some might prefer to describe it as \"democracy.\" \nUnless, of course, you happen to believe that the election was rigged. I can't remember who first suggested that. I saw it somewhere on social media .",

      "text": "Facebook chose to fight fake news with AI, not just user reports Posted Advertisement \nFacebook built two versions of a fix for fake news this year, and decided to trust algorithmic machine learning detection instead of only user behavior, a Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch. \nToday Facebook was hit with more allegations its distribution of fake news helped elect Donald Trump. A new Gizmodo saying Facebook shelved a planned update earlier this year that could have identified fake news because it would disproportionately demote right-wing news outlets. \nFacebook directly denies this, telling TechCrunch “The article’s allegation is not true. We did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.” \nHowever, TechCrunch has pulled more details from Facebook about the update Gizmodo discusses. \nBack in January 2015, Facebook rolled out an update designed to combat hoax news stories , which demoted links that were heavily flagged as fake by users, and that were often deleted later by users who posted them. That system is still in place. \nIn August 2016, Facebook released another News Feed update designed to reduce clickbait stories . Facebook trained a machine learning algorithm by having humans identify common phrases in old news headlines of clickbait stories. The machine learning system then would identify and demote future stories that featured those clickbait phrases. \nAccording to Facebook, it developed two different options for how the 2016 clickbait update would work. One was a classifier based off the 2015 hoax detector based on user reports, and another was the machine learning classifier built specifically for detecting clickbait via computer algorithm. Latest Crunch Report Watch More Episodes \nFacebook says it found the specially-made machine learning clickbait detector performed better with fewer false positives and false negatives, so that’s what Facebook released. It’s possible that that the unreleased version is what Gizmodo is referring to as the shelved update. Facebook tells me that unbalanced clickbait demotion of right-wing stories wasn’t why it wasn’t released. \nThe choice to rely on a machine learning algorithm rather than centering the fix around user reports aligns with Facebook’s recent push to reduce the potential for human bias in its curation, which itself has been problematic. \nA Gizmodo report earlier this year alleged that Facebook’s human Trend curators used their editorial freedom to suppress conservative trends. Facebook denied the allegations but fired its curation team, moving to a more algorithmic system without human-written Trend descriptions. Facebook was then criticized for fake stories becoming trends, and the New York Times reports “The Trending Topics episode paralyzed Facebook’s willingness to make any serious changes to its products that might compromise the perception of its objectivity.” \nIf Facebook had rolled out the unreleased version of its clickbait fix, it might have relied on the subjective opinions of staffers reviewing user reports about hard-to-classify clickbait stories the way it does with more cut-and-dry hoaxes. Meanwhile, political activists or trolls could have abused the reporting feature, mass-flagging accurate stories as false if they conflicted with their views. \nThis tricky situation is the inevitable result of engagement-ranked social feeds becoming massively popular distribution channels for news in a politically-polarized climate where campaign objectives and ad revenue incentivize misinformation. Who Is The Arbiter Of Truth? \nFacebook as well as other news distributors such as Twitter and Google have a challenge ahead. Clear hoaxes that can be disproven with facts are only part of the problem, and perhaps are easier to address. Exaggerated and heavily-spun stories that might be considered clickbait may prove tougher to fight. \nBecause Facebook and some other platforms reward engagement, news outlets are incentivized to frame stories as sensationally as possible. While long-running partisan outlets may be held accountable for exaggeration, newer outlets built specifically to take advantage of virality on networks like Facebook don’t face the same repercussions. They can focus on short-term traffic and ad revenue, and if people get fed up with their content, they can simply reboot with a different brand. \nSimplifying user flagging of fake or exaggerated stories, appending fact-checking sites to suspicious articles, and withholding distribution from domains that haven’t proven their accuracy but prioritize monetization could be some ways to fight the avalanche of fake news. More clearly needs to be done. \nBut perhaps its risky to demand networks like Facebook become the truth police. That could force it to make more wide-reaching calls about what to censor that would inevitably invite blame. At least technology platforms that err on the side of ranking by engagement allow users to decide individually if what they read is false or exaggerated. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated this perspective, writing “I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” \nRight now, Facebook is damned if does allow fake news to spread because it relies on users to think for themselves, but it’s damned if it doesn’t allow fake news to spread because it makes decisions about what to censor that remove the power of choice from its users. The social network will have to choose its next moves carefully. 0",

      "text": "Man apologizes after Facebook post saying 'Mexicans are paying for the wall' goes viral Published November 14, 2016 Fox News Latino Getty \nRichard Kadesh, a Walpole, Mass. resident, thought people were ready to start taking Donald Trump’s bold proposals on immigration a bit more lightly. \nA few days before the election, Kadesh went to dinner at one of his favorite Mexican spots, Jalapeno’s Grill, and as he waited to be served he went outside and posed for a picture with a large Donald Trump campaign sign behind him. \nThen he posted it on Facebook with the comment “They’re paying for the wall.” \nHe thought it was funny. Apparently others didn’t. \nThe daughter of the restaurant’s owner, Ricardo Dorronsoro, went on Facebook to express her outrage. \n“[My dad] has been a citizen for well over 20. He shouldn’t have to walk out the front door of a place he has worked so hard to build to be greeted with hateful words and bogus requests,” Sabrina Dorronsoro wrote on her Facebook wall a few days after Kadesh’s original was posted on Nov. 3rd. \nThat post quickly went viral and Kadesh felt the backlash. He then went on apology mode. \n“[It was] an awful attempt at making a joke,” said Kadesh, according to the Boston Globe. “I can’t reiterate enough how badly I feel about it.” \nKadesh paid for a full page ad in the local newspaper to offer an apology. He also called the restaurant owner on the phone. \n“He apologized, saying it was meant to be a joke,” Ricardo Dorronsoro told the Globe, adding: “I said, ‘My friend, your jokes are in very poor taste. You hurt my family, you hurt my kids, you hurt my community.’” \nDorronsoro said he accepted Kadesh’s apology. \n“I just want to forgive him and move on,” he told the Globe. “We have been reminded all week just how supportive our community truly is and we appreciate it more than we can put into words. Gracias, amigos.” \nLike us on Facebook ",

She said in part, “Bunch of liars, the liberal media. Just because the KKK is marching doesn't mean anyone in the Republican party supports them. But you insinuate it because you are all a bunch of violent liberals. You incite violence and discourse.” \nI’m getting that a lot comments like that from people who supported Trump and are angry because they feel as if they are being lumped in with the racists, xenophobes, Islamophobes, homophobes, misogynists, sexists, anti-Semites and white nationalists who also supported Trump. \nAnd who still support Trump. \nPeople like former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, David Duke, who tweeted after Trump’s victory, “This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!\" \nI’m sure they did. \nAlong with a lot of people who tell me they’re not like David Duke's people. \nAnd yet, here is Trump appointing Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as “chief strategist and senior counselor” to the president. \nAn former co-worker of Bannon, an editor-at-large for years with Brietbart, said that Bannon “openly embraced the white supremacist alt-right.” \nLikewise, the Anti-Defamation League said Bannon presided over a “group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists.” \nWhy should we believe such a thing?",

      "text": "The Clinton campaign's chief digital strategist on Monday blamed Facebook for enabling the spread of misinformation about the Democratic nominee — and said Democrats in and out of government have been looking at how to tackle the \"big problem\" of fake news on the social network. \"Everyone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want,\" Teddy Goff told POLITICO. \"But a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook.\"\nCritics on the left say false headlines on Facebook harmed Hillary Clinton and helped swing the election to Donald Trump. One fake news story titled \"FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead\" from sources like The Denver Guardian, The Free Patriot and Red Flag News circulated on the social network prior to the election. Another, under the headline \"Michelle Obama Deletes Hillary Clinton From Twitter,\" was picked up by conservative radio host Sean Hannity, who later apologized for spreading the lie .\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed as \"pretty crazy\" the idea that the distribution of fake and misleading news items on the site could have influenced the 2016 presidential election.\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\" the Facebook CEO wrote in a post Saturday night . \"The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nObama: Democrats 'have to compete everywhere' By Yousef Saba\nBut Goff, who also served as digital director for Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, said fake news on Facebook painting Clinton as corrupt, criminal or otherwise beyond the political pale did have an impact — and he said Democrats, even before the election was over, started looking at how to address it.\n\"Two, three weeks ago, many of us are beginning to talk about what a big problem this is, both from the campaign and from the administration, and just sort of broader Obama orbit, and are talking about, this is one of the things we would like to take on post-election,\" he said. \"This is something we were very aware of, saw zero percent chance Facebook was going to be compliant or work with us during the election, but wanted to take on post-election.\"\nGoff declined to shed light on the strategy he says is in the works, other than to say that it would target \"one or two people\" at the company, including Zuckerberg. He also declined to say whether anyone within the Clinton campaign has reached out to the company to make their case.\nFacebook had no comment beyond Zuckerberg's earlier statements on the issue.\nThis isn't the first time Facebook has faced charges that it is meddling in politics. Earlier this year, Republicans objected to alleged anti-conservative bias in its trending news sidebar. The company scrambled to make changes in response to the criticisms — reportedly including scaling back its team of trending news curators and going instead with a largely automated system.\n\"Any reasonable set of humans would probably be a little gun-shy after a thing like that,\" said Goff, speculating on why the company might have been reluctant to tweak its news feed during the election.\nOther Democrats have taken aim at Facebook over the fake news issue.\nFormer Obama White House speech writer Jon Favreau tweeted that \"Zuckerberg's position that Facebook has no responsibility for the fake news on their platform because it has no influence is beyond absurd.\"\nEric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent company Alphabet and a Clinton supporter, spoke last week about his own concerns about \"the rise of misinformation\" and said Google approaches the problem through ranking, or figuring out formulas based on websites' reputation and quality.\nGoff endorsed that formula, saying, \"Something that is made up does not have business going viral, and ought to be de-ranked in the same way that misinformation gets de-ranked on Google.\" But he also conceded that Google isn't perfect, pointing to fact that the top search result for \"final vote tally\" at one point this week produced a story that Trump won the popular vote .\nBut Facebook, he argues, is a particularly dangerous combination.\nThe site, he says, serves to gin up outrage but then fails to give users anything productive to do with their ire, contributing to a mentality that was particularly damaging to Clinton.\nCongress\nDemocrats look to exploit Trump divisions with GOP Congress By Burgess Everett\n\"We spend all day, every day on these platforms that encourage us to get pissed off, to piss off each other, to share information that's alarming,\" said Goff. \"So you have rising despair and also a rising sense of helplessness, and that combination is extremely toxic, and contributes in a huge way to this 'throw the bums out' mentality.\"\nNot all Clinton supporters are ready to put so much responsibility on Facebook.\n\"There was a huge problem with the news and information environment in the 2016 election, but it wasn’t Facebook-specific. Fox News regularly reported outright lies. Right-wing radio regularly reported outright lies,\" said Alec Ross, a former State Department aide to Clinton who advised the campaign on tech policy. \"Facebook, which is a neutral platform, reported the lies its users posted there. So the problem overall is we have a polluted news-and-information environment.\"\n\"Everybody needs to take a breath and actually study this,\" he said.\nGoff, for his part, said while Facebook fake news played a role in the election, he's not pinning the full blame for Clinton's loss on one social network, musing, \"How many votes were directly affected by a piece of misinformation that a voter saw on Facebook, that's the thing that's unknowable.\"\nTony Romm contributed to this report.",

      "text": "View this image ›\nStephen Lam / Reuters\nID: 9981983 SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook employees have formed an unofficial task force to question the role their company played in promoting fake news in the lead-up to Donald Trump’s victory in the US election last week, amid a larger, national debate over the rise of fake and misleading news articles in a platform used by more than 150 million Americans.\nThe task force, which sources tell BuzzFeed News includes employees from across the company, has already refuted a statement made by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a conference last week that the argument that fake news on Facebook affected the election was “ a pretty crazy idea .”\n“It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” said one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division. He, like the four other Facebook employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News for this story, would only speak on condition of anonymity. All five employees said they had been warned by their superiors against speaking to press, and feared they would lose their jobs if named.\nThe employees declined to provide many details on the task force. One employee said “more than dozens” of employees were involved, and that they had met twice in the last six days. At the moment, they are meeting in secret, to allow members of the group to speak freely and without fear of condemnation from senior management. The group plans to formalize its meetings and eventually make a list of recommendations to Facebook’s senior management. Another Facebook employee said while the task force remained small, “hundreds” of Facebook employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on fake news in private online chats, and wanted to support efforts to challenge that position.\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News, but in a statement to media last week, a Facebook spokesperson said, “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.”\nIn the wake of Trump’s victory, Facebook has been facing questions over its responsibility in spreading misinformation or failing to clamp down on the sharing of fake news. Almost half of adult Americans rely on Facebook as a source of news, a recent study by the Pew Research Center found . A recent report by BuzzFeed News found that the three large left-wing pages published false or misleading information in nearly 20% of posts, while the three big right-wing Facebook pages published it 38% of the time. The report concluded: “The best way to attract and grow an audience for political content on the world’s biggest social network is to eschew factual reporting and instead play to partisan biases using false or misleading information that simply tells people what they want to hear.”\nOr, as former Facebook designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote on his own Facebook wall on November 8, “Sadly, News Feed optimizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging. A bias towards truth isn’t an impossible goal. Wikipedia, for instance, still bends towards the truth despite a massive audience. But it’s now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bullshit.”\nView this image ›\nDado Ruvic / Reuters\nID: 9982303\nThose involved in the task force who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they were reviewing whether Facebook had devoted enough resources to responding to user reports of fake news, or whether it had effectively used features that automatically scan the platform for certain kinds of offensive content.\n“There is a lot more we could be doing using tools already built and in use across Facebook to stop other offensive or harmful content,” said a second Facebook employee who has been a longtime engineer there. “We do a lot to stop people from posting nudity or violence, from automatically flagging certain sites to warning people who post content that doesn’t meet the community guidelines,” the employee said. He added that while Facebook users were encouraged to flag fake news, the guidelines for removing that sort of content were not clear. “If someone posts a fake news article, which claims that the Clintons are employing illegal immigrants, and that incites people to violence against illegal immigrants, isn’t that dangerous, doesn’t that also violate our community standards?”\nIn a January 2015 update, Facebook promised fewer fake news stories by giving users a tool to self-report fake stories on their feeds. In the nearly two years since, Facebook has refused to give reporters access to metrics showing how often fake news is reported and/or removed from their platform. A BuzzFeed News report found that even when fake news was flagged on one Facebook page, it was simply moved to another.\nFacebook came under fire in May amid accounts by recent employees that personal bias was pushing the platform’s Trending Topics section towards more liberal news sites. In the wake of the report, Facebook fired its entire Trending Topics team, and said it would instead rely on an algorithm — though as BuzzFeed News reported , experts warned that algorithms were likely to increase the spread of fake news.\nThe months that followed saw Facebook court controversy by removing the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam war for violating nudity standards, as well as removing a breast cancer awareness video for similar reasons. As BuzzFeed News reported, the removal of the posts was repeatedly blamed on a system error, and they were eventually reinstated.\n“Facebook, by design, by algorithm, and by policy, has created a platform that amplifies misinformation,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has been vocal in the need for social media to consider their role in spreading fake news.\nView this image ›\nNtb Scanpix / Reuters\nID: 9982308\nTwo Facebook employees, both of whom work as managers, told BuzzFeed News that the reporting of fake news was not taken as seriously as reports about other content that violates community standards. Both said that when they raised the issue in the past, they were told that the “top executives” at Facebook were discussing the problem and taking it seriously. One said she had made it clear that even though users were flagging certain media as being fake, or a hoax, the company was not taking a strict enough line with removing that content or defining what constituted fake news. She said she had passed on that concern to more senior managers, but has not received a response.\n“People know there are concerned employees who are seeing something here which they consider a big problem,” she said. “And it doesn’t feel like the people making decisions are taking the concerns seriously.”\nThe New York Times reported last week that top executives at Facebook have discussed the issue, and that a private Facebook post shared by Zuckerberg last week to a small group of friends and colleagues refuted the idea that Facebook had influenced the elections.\nCiting statistics about low voter turnout, Zuckerberg wrote, “So rather than focusing on strengths or weaknesses in specific demographics, or other factors that may have pushed this race in one direction or another, these stats clearly suggest what many people have said all along. Both candidates were very unpopular.”\nThe Facebook employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News stressed that they were not trying to “take sides” over who won the elections, but make an argument that Facebook should not be bolstering any political candidate through fake or misleading news items.\n“If someone is right-wing, and all their friends are right-wing, and that is the news they share on Facebook, then that is the bubble they have created for themselves and that is their right,” said the longtime Facebook engineer. “But to highlight fake news articles in the [news] feed, to promote them so they get millions of shares by people who think they are real, that’s not something we should allow to happen. Facebook is getting played by people using us to spread their bullshit.”",

      "text": "A West Virginia Woman Called Michelle Obama An ‘Ape’ On Facebook And Claims She’ll Sue Trolls For A Hate Crime For Trying To Get Her Fired Chris Spags Email \nDaily Dot – In a now-deleted Facebook post, Pamela Ramsey Taylor, director of West Virginia’s Clay County Development Corp, referred to First Lady Michelle Obama as an “Ape in heels.” And Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling responded that the post “made [her] day.” \nThe Clay County Development Corp’s Facebook page has been inundated with requests for Taylor’s removal, and a petition has been created calling for their termination. \nTaylor told WSAZ that she has been reprimanded at her job. However, she also believes she is the victim now and is filing a lawsuit against the people who are slandering her (there is currently a fake Facebook page under her name featuring a photo of a pig’s head on her body). Taylor says the reaction is now a “hate crime against [her].” \nHow about Big Pam Taylor here turning the game all on its head? She’s objectively pretty awful for putting outdated racist thoughts out there as a victory from the election but despite her hideous face and personality, I kind of like how she’s going back at the people attacking her with their own logic. By 2016 standards where colleges are genuinely holding “cry-ins” over the election results , shouldn’t this lady’s own Facebook technically be a Safe Space where she can articulate (lol) her own views without worrying about persecution? I’m just playing devil’s advocate here but why is it that there are a BILLION places for people with one viewpoint to voice their darkest and most emotional thoughts but there isn’t a single one for loathsome idiots like this chick who, while probably not deserving of breathing air, does have certain rights and freedoms to live and express herself. Speaking their language and dropping “hate crime” claims probably won’t carry much water but fuck it, I don’t blame her for giving it a shot. \nThe other thing I will say in Big Pam’s defense…she’s in West Virginia. There were probably legitimately hundreds of thousands of worse posts than this talking about the election coming from there that would make this one look like a warm congratulations. Honestly I wouldn’t be shocked if one of the replies edited out of the screenshot is someone going “Hey Pam, liberalism is a disease lol” and mailed her an I’m With Her sticker before they get sent to Haiti because this might be one of the most left-leaning posts in the whole state. Maybe something to grade on a curve is all I’m saying. Chris Spags",

      "text": "Try Solving This Math Puzzle That Is Making People Go Crazy on Facebook November 14, 2016 by Ann-Marie Alcántara 770 Shares \nEver wanted to tear your hair out and question everything you've ever learned about math? Well, thanks to the website Brain Dare, you can. The company recently posted a math puzzle to its Facebook page that's made the internet divide into two categories based on answers. \nTake a look at the puzzle below and determine your own answer. \nDid you get 40? Or 96? Though Brain Dare states that 96 is the correct answer , other users are claiming that both can be correct. Brain Dare figured out its answer with multiplication. To begin, you multiply the first number by the second number. For example, 1 x 4 = 4. Then, add that result to the first number and you'll arrive at the answer after the equal sign; for the first line it's 5. \nBut some people arrived at the answer 40 sans multiplication. Instead, they just added the answer of the first line (5) to the next one. So, 5 + 2 = 7. Add the 5 in the previous answer and you'll get to the answer 12. If you follow it all the way through, you'll arrive at 40. \nPeople in the comments are arguing about which answer is actually right. Some just want Brain Dare to acknowledge that math puzzles such as these can have two answers. The puzzle is clearly extremely popular, considering the post has more than 2,000 reactions, 7,000 comments, and 2,000 shares. At the POPSUGAR offices, we're also torn and finding these two answers as well. \nIf you want to drive yourself crazy with another brain teaser, try this one involving fruit from a few months ago. \nRelated content:",

      "text": "AnyCafé Like us on Facebook \nIt only takes a few minutes for a Keurig machine to brew a fresh cup of coffee, but every second counts during the morning rush. Soon, you might not need to choose between getting your caffeine fix and making it to work on time: As Real Simple reports , a company called AnyCafé has created a travel mug that brews single-serve pods on-the-go. \nThe BPA-free, battery-powered Travel Brewer works similarly to a K-cup machine: Simply open the lid, pour in some water, and stick a coffee pod inside. Then, close the mug’s lid and press a button. Voila —instant, fresh coffee. And if your beverage gets cold, the travel mug can reheat your brew for you. \nThe Travel Brewer, which is looking for funding on Kickstarter , holds nearly 10 ounces and is compatible with most K-cup brands. It also works with tea bags. (In the future, the company wants to create an eco-friendly mug that uses coffee grounds or loose tea leaves.) The dishwasher-safe mug does need a charged battery to work, however, so your alacrity in the morning depends on a bit of foresight the night before.",

      "text": "As critics slam Facebook for the role they believe it—and in particular its penchant for fake news stories— played in the election of Donald Trump, CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to resist any attempt to pin some of the blame on his company. But in doing so, he misses the point.\nOver the weekend, the Facebook co-founder took to the site to respond to some of those criticisms. He said he “cares deeply” about the fake news problem and wants to get it right. But he also said that he doesn’t believe fake news contributed to the election’s outcome.\n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg wrote. And since only a very small amount of those hoaxes relate to politics, and an even smaller number related to Clinton specifically, he argued that “this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nThe Facebook CEO also scoffed at the suggestion that the company is actually a media entity, or that it should behave like one, something many have argued for some time.\n“Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family. News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company,” Zuckerberg said. “We are serious about building planes to beam internet access, but we don’t call ourselves an aerospace company.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nZuckerberg responded to the “filter bubble” argument by saying the company’s research shows that people “are exposed to more diverse content on Facebook and social media than on traditional media like newspapers and TV.” In other words, filter bubbles used to be worse.\nAll of these arguments are true to some extent, but they still miss the larger point. And if anything, they reinforce the idea that Zuckerberg is desperately trying to avoid responsibility for the way Facebook influences the media consumption of its users. Even some of his own staffers are wrestling with this problem , according to a New York Times report.\nAs a number of people have pointed out, the social network can’t have it both ways. It can’t argue that Facebook is hugely influential for advertisers, or that it plays a key role in social movements like the Arab Spring, and yet also argue that fake news has no effect on users.\nFB + Twitter cannot take credit for changing the world during events like the Egyptian Uprising, then downplay their influence on elections\n— Karen K. Ho (@karenkho) November 13, 2016\nTo borrow Zuckerberg’s aerospace analogy, if Facebook flew planes and 1% of them crashed and killed all passengers on impact, most people probably wouldn’t accept the argument that this is a small number, and that in any case it isn’t really an airplane company because its real focus is the technology that keeps them from crashing most of the time.\nIn a sense, debating whether Facebook should call itself a media company or not is a red herring. Whatever it calls itself, it is one of the largest distributors of news that has ever existed.\nThis problem doesn’t just affect Facebook either. Google has also come under fire for pointing to fake news sites in Google News, including one site that topped its election results but had the wrong numbers. The company said it is “looking into” what happened.\nIn today’s news environment, traditional outlets have lost control over the distribution of their content, and platforms like Facebook and Google have taken over. In the process, they have become the most powerful media companies in history. And that brings with it certain responsibilities.\nIt's in journalism's best interest to report news accurately.\nIt's in tech's best interest to distribute news voluminously.\n— (((Josh))) (@Tyrangiel) November 14, 2016\nIt’s obvious why Facebook doesn’t want to admit that it has these responsibilities, of course. As a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Facebook investor told my colleague Jeff Roberts recently, admitting this would open the company up to an avalanche of criticism for being biased on one side or the other. And that would be a recipe for disaster.\nThat’s exactly what happened during the Trending Topics fiasco, when editors responsible for weeding out bad sites were accused of bias against conservative sites. Facebook’s response was to fire them all and sweep the problem under the rug by pretending it could all be done algorithmically.\nAccording to a report from Gizmodo, Facebook’s engineers actually developed a way of using its algorithms to detect and block fake news, but a test of the feature found that a disproportionate number of these stories were from right-wing sites.\nBecause the social network was afraid of more backlash over allegations of bias, Gizmodo says the feature was never released (Facebook has since denied that this occurred).\nDonald Trump outsmarted Hillary Clinton when it comes to earned media. Watch:\nIn his post, Zuckerberg said the company is working on ways for users to flag fake news. But are users who see fake articles that reinforce their beliefs going to flag them? That seems unlikely.\nThe core problem for Facebook is that what it wants more than anything else is engagement, and as a former Facebook staffer argued recently , “bullshit is highly engaging.” That means despite Zuckerberg’s protest that he cares deeply about the problem, finding a solution is never going to be as economically advantageous as not finding a solution.\nOne other point: The Facebook CEO says he doesn’t want his company to become “arbiters of truth.” But the reality is—as technology publishers Tim O’Reilly pointed out in a recent blog post —that the social network is already doing this on a regular basis by deleting posts and censoring content it deems unacceptable.\nZuckerberg is saying Facebook won't decide what \"truth\" is, even though on Facebook truth & credibility is defined by Facebook engagement pic.twitter.com/BMYAN7u3Z9\n— Hamza Shaban (@hshaban) November 13, 2016\nFiguring out what “fake news” consists of and flagging it in some way, or even down-ranking it in the news feed, may be a difficult technological challenge. And it may expose Facebook to charges of being biased in one direction or another. But the status quo is not going to work.\nRegardless of whether he personally wants to grapple with this thorny problem or not, Zuckerberg will have to admit that Facebook is a large and increasingly powerful player in the news business, and that certain duties and responsibilities come along with that. And the sooner he does so, the better.",

(Photo: Chris Schodt, USA TODAY) \nSAN FRANCISCO — The controversy over whether fake news on Facebook played a role in Donald Trump's election victory has apparently hit the employee ranks of the social media giant. \nA group of Facebook employees has formed an \"unofficial task force\" to meet in secret and investigate whether the spread of hoax articles on the service influenced the election's outcome, according to a report published in BuzzFeed News . \nSources told BuzzFeed the task force which includes employees from across the company is taking issue with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's contention at a technology conference last week that the notion that fake news had an impact was a \"pretty crazy idea.\" \n\"It's not a crazy idea. What's crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,\" one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division, told BuzzFeed. \nAnother Facebook employee said \"hundreds\" of Facebook employees had objected to the company's public position on fake news. The task force is probing whether Facebook dedicated sufficient resources to reports of fake news. \nFacebook could not be reached for comment. More fake news on the Web — this time, via Google \nGoogle was dragged into the fake-news controversy on Monday, too, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com , that falsely claimed Trump won the popular vote in last week's election. \nHillary Clinton campaign's chief digital strategist on Monday blamed Facebook for the spread of misinformation about the Democratic nominee. \n\"Everyone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want,\" Teddy Goff told POLITICO. \"But a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook.\" \nCriticism of Facebook's ascendant power to sway public opinion is growing after the election. \nAbout half of adult Americans rely on Facebook as a source of news, a recent study from the Pew Research Center found. \nA BuzzFeed News report found that three large left-wing pages published false or misleading information in nearly 20% of posts, while the three big right-wing Facebook pages published it 38% of the time. Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' \nThe Facebook employees, who spoke with BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity, said they were not taking sides in the election, but advocating that Facebook not favor any candidate through the dissemination of fake or misleading information. \nZuckerberg initially dismissed suggestions that fake stories — such as ones that stated Pope Francis had supported Trump — played a role in the Republican presidential nominee's victory. \n\"To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said Thursday at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. \nOn Saturday, Zuckerberg said Facebook is taking steps to eliminate fake news and hoaxes. \nWhile reiterating earlier comments in which he said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that phony stories posted on Facebook changed the election outcome, \nZuckerberg said work has already begun that would enable users \"to flag fake news and hoaxes.\" \n\"This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully, though,\" said Zuckerberg, who asserted that \"more than 99% of what people see is authentic.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "University Professor Forced to Resign Over Pro-Trump Facebook Comment | PJ Media",
      "text": "A university program director was forced to resign from his post over a Facebook comment which caused outrage among anti-Trump students on campus.\nFollowing a student protest at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, a program director made an arguably pro-Trump joke and the students pounced on him. The protest had a \"Not My America\" theme, so Ted Pawlicki quipped, \"A bus ticket from Rochester to Canada is $16. If this is not your America, then I will pay for your ticket if you promise never to come back.\"\nPawlicki, who until Friday served as undergraduate program director in the Department of Computer Science, posted the comment on a #NotMyAmerica Facebook page associated with the protest. Shortly after the program director posted the comment, the student Caleb Krieg responded, \"I have reported this as a bias incident report.\"\nTed Pawlicki clearly a smart professor at the @University of Rochester (Imagine there's such a thing as a bias incident report, per comment) pic.twitter.com/QU3b0DRXZC\n— PARKER ZACK (@PARKERzack) November 11, 2016\n\"This is why women and minorities don't feel welcome in the computer science department, wrote another student, Bethany Gardner. Pawlicki had not made any reference to race or sex in his comment, and this response reveals more bias from the student than from the professor.\n\"It was intended to be humorous, actually,\" Pawlicki told the Democrat and Chronicle . \"Moving to Canada (in reaction to presidential election outcomes) has been a joke since the Reagan administration. I didn't intend it to be malicious, certainly. I don't think there's anything malicious about it, either.\" After all, the party was themed \"Not My America,\" so it is reasonable to play off that theme.\nAnti-Trump rally at The University of Rochester #antitrumpprotests pic.twitter.com/DtSm4zTa53\n— City Newspaper (@roccitynews) November 11, 2016\nNevertheless, facing pressure, Pawlicki issued an apology letter. \"I apologize for my Facebook post of Thursday, November 10th. Those remarks were ill-considered and I deeply regret any and all hurt they occasioned,\" the professor wrote. He insisted that his opinions on Facebook only represented him and not the University of Rochester. \"Please also be assured that I am absolutely dedicated to the equality of all people.\"\nOn Friday, he stepped down, announcing, \"After reflecting on the impact my remarks have had on students, and following consultation with Dr. Wendi Heinzelman, Dean of Hajim School, and Dr. Sandhya Dwarkadas, Chair of Computer Science, I have decided to step down from the position of Undergraduate Program Director for Computer Science,\" he wrote in an email statement .\nPawlicki had directed the proram for 18 years, and he told the Democrat and Chronicle \"I love the job.\" He will continue in his role as a senior lecturer, an untenured teaching faculty position.\nThis forced resignation proves particularly ironic, as it follows the unforgivable sin of a joke that took the students' slogans seriously . Many celebrities had promised to move to Canada were Trump to win (and failed to fulfill their promises , alas), and it should not constitute hate speech to acknowledge this cultural tidbit.\nStudents and Teachers Walk Out of School in Protest of Trump Victory\nNext Page: Did the \"safe space\" bullies accept his apology?

      "text": "Dave Lee North America technology reporter 15 November 2016 comments Image copyright AP Despite the best efforts of Mark Zuckerberg to downplay Facebook’s role in the election of Donald Trump, the scrutiny of how fake news is spread on the platform has intensified. \nBuzzfeed News is reporting that \"more than dozens\" of Facebook employees have created an unofficial task force dedicated to addressing the issue. \nBuzzfeed quoted one member of that task force, who did not want to be named over fears for their job. \n“[Mark Zuckerberg] knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” the source said. \nFacebook has not responded to the BBC’s request for comment on Buzzfeed’s report. \nMeanwhile, Google on Monday announced it would do more to prevent fake news sites from making money through advertising. Agitated Zuckerberg \nEarlier on Monday Facebook denied claims that a tool to whittle out fake news had been created before the election, only to be shelved due to concerns it would make Facebook look like it was censoring conservative views. \nMr Zuckerberg appears to be increasingly agitated by the suggestion that fake news was a serious problem on his site. \nOn Saturday night he posted a lengthy update to his profile page defending it. Image copyright Getty Images \n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote. \n\"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics.\" \nHis conclusion: \"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\" \nThat statistic - 99% - has been the subject of much derision as it apparently refers to content of any kind being posted to Facebook. \nIn May, Facebook came under heavy criticism after it was alleged that human editors working on the Trending Topics section of Facebook were removing stories that pushed a conservative or pro-Trump agenda. \nFacebook denied this was the case, but removed the human element anyway in an attempt to appear neutral. Google action \nFacebook is not alone in coming under fire over fake news. \nGoogle said it would be clamping down on abuses of its AdSense advertising platform. \n\"We will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” said Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville. \nThat announcement followed reports that Google’s top-ranking news result for the term \"final election result” highlighted a story from a fake news site with inaccurate information on the vote tally.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \n“I want to take this opportunity to apologize… to absolutely nobody.” \nThose were the very words MMA fighter Conor McGregor uttered after coming out victorious following an intense brawl with Eddie Alvarez during UFC 205 at Madison Square Garden on November 21. Giphy \nWhile some people might have been shocked that such a statement could have come out of McGregor’s mouth, most of us aren’t. \nI mean, this is the same guy that shamelessly cropped a loyal fan out of a photo he took with her… \nOh, you didn’t hear about that, did you? Well, allow me to explain because it’s actually kind of hilarious. Giphy \nThe 28-year-old UFC star is making headlines for another reason besides the shocking knockout victory against Alvarez last weekend. Conor McGregor, a famous fighter who loves his fans, was generous enough to take a photo with a loyal supporter. If you expected Conor to share the photo on his Instagram account without cropping his fans out, you’re WRONG. Naturally, the internet got ahold of the original photo and had a field day with it. \n— Drew Crittenden (@Drucritt) November 13, 2016 How could you be so heartless, Conor?! Twitter \nThe fan, whose name is Erin Safran, spoke to BuzzFeed about the photo, saying , \nI wasn’t sad or embarrassed at all, I was happy enough he screenshotted my own pic and took time to crop me out. I’m glad he really liked that photo of himself. Cropped or uncropped, I love him. \nIn other words, she’ll take what she can get. After all, this is Conor McGregor. \nIf he’s not cropping your undeserving ass out of fan photos you asked for, he’s probably knocking you out in front of millions of viewers. Sure, Erin was unfazed by the whole thing, but she did seek revenge on the UFC champ with a cropped photo of her own… \nAdding more insult to injury, Erin Safran decided to post a photo on her own Instagram account. \nThis time, she cropped out McGregor and his “Gucci mustard” sweater. Her caption? His infamous words, reading, “I want to take this opportunity to apologize… to absolutely nobody.” \nBURN, BABY, BURN! \nConor might want to take a loss on to his fight record. It looks to me like he just got OWNED. As for Erin’s experience throughout this whole fan photo ordeal? She’s loving every minute of it. \nShe added, \nTo me, this is one of the highlights of my life — no lie. I never expected it and it’s been such a fun experience. \nForget taking photos with your favorite people. Instead, take photos with them and hope they crop you out. You’ll have way more fun, apparently! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.",

      "text": "Facebook will also cut off fake news sites from ad money It's all thanks to Google. Share Save \nFacebook has followed Google's example and finally banned fake news sites from using its ad network to generate revenue, according to The Wall Street Journal . Fake news websites now fall under the \"misleading, illegal and deceptive sites\" category, which are already prohibited from using the company's Audience Network. Facebook's Audience Network shows its customers' advertisements not just on the social network itself, but also on other mobile apps and websites. \nIf you'll recall Mark Zuckerberg and co. came under fire after the elections, with people accusing the tech titan of helping skew the results by allowing election-related fake news to propagate. Zuckerberg strongly denied the accusations, claiming that 99 percent of the content you see on the website is authentic. According to a Gizmodo report , though, the company knew it had a problem with fake news websites and had the tool to block them. Facebook decided not to use that tool, because it would prevent most conservative news sources from showing up on people's News Feeds. The company also denied that allegation. \nAs for this new development, a company spokesperson told The WSJ : \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\" ",

      "text": "Facebook had tool to weed out fake news: report The social network declines to deploy it out of fear of offending conservatives, reports say Published 12:30  35   NO FLEETING ISSUE. The social network finds itself in the middle of political turmoil as some believe that its News Feed paves the way for fake news. Photo by Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP \nWASHINGTON, U.S. – Facebook had a tool to weed out fake news circulating on the social network this year but declined to deploy it for fear of offending conservatives, a report said Monday, Nov 14. \nThe report by the online news site Gizmodo comes with Facebook under fire for allowing hoaxes and misinformation to go viral and – according to some critics – boost the efforts of Republican Donald Trump in his successful presidential run. \nFacebook denied the report. \nGizmodo , citing unnamed sources said to be knowledgeable about Facebook 's decision-making, said the tool was shelved after a controversy over reports saying the social network suppressed some conservative voices in its \"trending topics\" earlier this year. \n\"They absolutely have the tools to shut down fake news,\" Gizmodo quoted one source as saying. \"There was a lot of fear about upsetting conservatives after (the uproar over) trending topics.\" \nA Facebook statement said that the claims made in the article were \"not true.\" \n\"We did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party,\" the statement from Facebook said. \n\"We always work to make News Feed more meaningful and informative, and that includes examining the quality and accuracy of items shared, such as clickbait, spam and hoaxes.\" \nFacebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for Trump. \n\"The idea that fake news on Facebook , which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg said during an on-stage chat at Technonomy, a technology trends conference in California. \nIn a weekend posting, Zuckerberg said dealing with hoaxes and fake news is complex. \n\"This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,\" he said. \n\"Identifying the 'truth' is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\" \nBogus election results \nThe notion of hoaxes and fake news remained a topic of debate on Monday, when internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Trump won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70News – contradicting official results tallied so far by states – said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the Electoral College to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. \n\"Hey Change.org, scrap your loony petition now,\" the posting said. \nThe bogus site was listed at the top of many search queries for \"final election result.\" \nPreliminary tallies showed Clinton won roughly 700,000 more votes than Trump despite losing the states needed for an Electoral College victory. \nGoogle seeks \"to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\" a company statement to AFP said. \n\"In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\"  ",

      "text": "Check it out \nThe new comes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg refuted claims of fake news on the social network influencing the results of the election, stating that “more than 99% of what people see is authentic.” \nEven if we take Zuckerberg at his word, it’s possible that stories from those sites may have been targeted towards voters for greater impact. Plus, 1 percent of all content circulated on Facebook still amounts to a ton of misinformation. \nIt isn’t yet clear if the move will help stem the flow of fake news across the Web. Neither company has committed to improving their methods for detecting and blocking such content. \nHowever, Gizmodo reported that its sources informed it of a Facebook update that aimed to identify and remove hoax news stories. The feature is believed to have been shelved as it disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites. \nEarlier this month, BuzzFeed News found that several teens and young adults in Macedonia were running sites with that published fake news stories deriding Hillary Clinton, purely as a means to make money from ad revenue. It’s possible that Google and Facebook’s move to block such sites from their ad networks will curb their growth, but they’re not the only ones running such businesses. \nHopefully, tech firms and media platforms will be able to figure out more sophisticated ways of sniffing out bogus content. Whether they want to admit it or not in these difficult times, search engines and social networks are major destinations for people looking for news, and that means working to create an environment where hoaxes are easier to stamp out than it is to circulate actual facts. It’s not going to be easy, but that’s all part of the job.",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO: One of the world's most popular means of communication, Facebook's WhatsApp, said on Monday (Nov 14) it is adding fully encrypted video calling to its messaging app.\nWhatsApp, which boasts more than a billion users worldwide, adopted end-to-end encryption early this year, making it technically impossible for the company or government authorities to read messages or listen to calls.\nThe new video calling service will thus provide another means for people to communicate without fear of eavesdropping though WhatsApp does retain other data such as an individual's list of contacts.\nWhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said in an interview that video calls will be rolled out to 180 countries within hours after the feature is introduced at an event in India.\n\"We obviously try to be in tune with what our users want,\" Koum said at the company's unmarked Mountain View, California headquarters building. \"We're obsessed with making sure that voice and video work well even on low-end phones.\"\nKoum told Reuters that improvements in phone cameras, battery life and bandwidth had made the service viable for a significant proportion of WhatsApp users, even those using inexpensive smartphones.\nApple Inc offers its FaceTime video calls to iPhone users, and Microsoft Corp's Skype offers video calls on multiple platforms. But WhatsApp has built a massive installed base of mobile customers and has been steadily adding more features to what began as a simple chat applications.\nPRICE OF ALLEGIANCE\nWhatsApp has operated with some autonomy since Facebook bought it in 2014. Koum and co-founder Brian Acton, longtime Yahoo engineers who started the company in 2009, now have 200 staff, mostly engineers and customer support, up from 50 when Facebook bought it.\nKoum said Facebook has allowed WhatsApp to use its servers and bandwidth around the world for voice and now video. That support will help spread the souped-up WhatsApp much farther and faster, he said.\nBut the corporate allegiance also has a price. After years of pledging that it would not share information about users with Facebook, which already has digital dossiers on its own 1.7 billion users, WhatsApp revised its privacy statement in August to say it would do exactly that. That means Facebook knows whom WhatsApp users contact and their phone numbers.\nSome users complained, but Koum said that he had not seen a shift in behavior.\n\"In terms of security and privacy, what people care about the most is the privacy of their messages,\" he said.\nThe video service is well integrated and adds a few twists. Users can move around the thumbnail video showing what their correspondent sees and flick a video call in progress to the side to minimize it while checking texts or email.\nKoum said WhatsApp remained committed to security after the U.S. election of Donald Trump as president last week heightened fears of increased surveillance.\nTrump, along with some leading congressional Republicans and FBI Director James Comey, has advocated requiring tech companies to turn over customer information in many circumstances, a position which, if put into law, could require companies including WhatsApp to completely redesign their services.\nOther countries including China and the United Kingdom also take a dim view of encryption.\nBut Koum said he not see a major threat to his service, noting that diplomats and officials use WhatsApp in many countries.\n\"It would be like them shooting themselves in the foot.\"\n-\nEmail More",

      "text": "Pamela Ramsey Taylor called Michelle ‘a Ape in heels (sic.)’ (Picture: Facebook) American officials are facing pressure to resign after calling Michelle Obama an ‘ape in heels’. \nIn a racist Facebook post that has since been deleted, Pamela Ramsey Taylor – the Development Corporation Director for Clay County in West Virginia – compared the First Lady to ‘classy, beautiful’ Melania Trump.\n‘It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House,’ she wrote, referring to Melania – the wife of President-elect Donald Trump.\n‘I’m tired of seeing a Ape (sic.) in heels.’\nThe racist remark attracted a massive backlash (Picture: Facebook) Responding in the comments, the county’s mayor Beverly Whaling wrote: ‘Just made my day Pam.’\nThe county’s mayor responded in agreement (Picture: Facebook) By the time the post was deleted, it had already been shared hundreds of times online – and screenshot many more times.\nA massive £1.3bn steel and concrete dome is being moved over Chernobyl Michelle, a successful lawyer with degrees from Ivy League universities Princeton and Harvard, recently appeared on the cover of Vogue , and has been known throughout Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure for her grace, glamour, intelligence and sense of humour.\nShe undoubtedly stole the show at several points during Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and since the election people have been urging her to run for the post herself in 2020 .\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama meeting with Melania Trump at the White House (Picture: REX) So unsurprisingly Taylor’s racist post sparked a huge backlash, and a petition calling for the two officials to be sacked has, at the time of writing, gathered almost 85,000 signatures.\nBoth of the officials’ Facebook pages have now been removed, and the two women have issued apologies.\n‘My comment was not intended to be racist at all,’ Whaling said in a statement to the Washington Post .\nWhat the hell is this object that just fell from the sky? ‘I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused!\n‘Those who know me know that I’m not of any way racist (sic.)! Again, I would like to apologise for this getting out of hand!’\nTaylor also reportedly released a statement of apology on her Facebook page before it was suspended.",

      "text": "November 15 at 6:57 AM\nA 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of a displayed stock graph in this illustration photo taken November 3, 2016. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) Responding to growing concerns over the spread of misinformation online in the weeks and months before Election Day, Facebook and Google have announced plans to restrict sites that publish fake news from using online advertising.\nFacebook updated its advertising policy on Monday to make clear that it will not display ads in websites or mobile apps that contain fake news. Such outlets will now be included under the already banned category of misleading, illegal or deceptive sites. Earlier Monday, Google announced a similar policy prohibiting ads from being placed on websites that publish fake news, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n“We clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” a Google spokeswoman said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.\nOn Monday morning, The Washington Post reported, the top news link on Google in a search for “final election results” led to a fake news website incorrectly claiming that Donald Trump won both the popular vote and the majority of votes in the electoral college.\nThe announcements from both Internet giants came after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, denied Thursday that fake news on the social network could have influenced the result of the presidential election. He called it a “crazy idea,” and insisted that fake news “surely had no impact” on voters’ decisions.\nIn a Facebook status posted Saturday, Zuckerberg wrote that more than 99 percent of the content people read on Facebook is authentic, and the fake content that does exist is not limited to one partisan view or to politics in general.\nBut, he wrote, “We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.”\nHe continued to say everyone would need to proceed carefully to make sure they don’t become “arbiters of truth.”\n“While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted,” he wrote. “An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual.”\nSome Facebook employees countered Zuckerberg’s statements that fake news likely had no influence on the election, BuzzFeed News reported Monday. A group of “renegade employees” have reportedly formed a task force to call out the fake news being spread through the network and voice dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on the issue.\nIn a statement Monday, a Facebook spokesperson said the company would take “swift action” against sites and apps found to violate its ad policy.\n“Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance,” the Wall Street Journal reported.",

      "text": "Sauce Labs sops up $70 million round Posted Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks \nSauce Labs , a cloud-based software testing service, announced a $70 million round today. The investment is more than double the $31 million the company had raised across four previous rounds and brings the total investment to $101 million. \nCenterview Capital Technology, IVP, and Adams Street Partners all participated. Under the terms of the deal, Buno Pati, partner at Centerview and Sandy Miller, general partner at IVP, will join the Sauce Labs Board of Directors. \nSauce Labs has been around since 2008, but CEO Charles Ramsey says in some ways the company was offering an automated approach to software testing before the broad market was ready for it. Back in the dark ages of 2008, many companies were still using the Waterfall approach to development. It was a deliberate methodology in which you finished one release before you started the next. In that world, testing was done manually by a QA department who checked each feature to make sure it worked across a number of devices and browsers. \n“What we provide essentially is infrastructure as a service and software that allows developers to write their own tests and to manage the [testing] process,” Ramsey explained. Once the script is written, it can automatically test across whatever devices, browsers and operating systems the developer chooses. \nAs we’ve moved forward, the world has changed and moved more toward Sauce Labs’ automated approach. Companies have embraced Agile development methodology, which is more of a continuous development approach than a defined one. When you combine this with a growing number of devices, operating systems and browsers (and a legacy history to support), the idea that you could manually test against all of these contingencies became much more challenging. As companies moved to Agile, they couldn’t have testing be the bottleneck. \nIn essence, the market has caught up with Sauce Labs, Ramsey explained, and they believe they are poised to take off, being a company in the right place with the right product at the right time. Apparently their investors saw it that way too because they wrote an enormous check to give them the cash to take the company to the next level. \nThe company currently has 3500 customers and 140 employees. With this influx of money, they plan to hire engineers, sales people and customer success personnel over the next year, which should allow them to take advantage of the growing demand in a more controlled fashion. \nAs for why the company took so long to get to this point, Ramsey says things always move more slowly in the wider industry than we think. There is a tendency among technologists to think everyone is moving en masse to the next big thing, whether that’s the cloud, mobile or Agile development. Large companies tend to be more cautious than that (or at least they have been until recently). \nCompanies are recognizing that to be competitive, they have to update their development methodologies, and when they do, Sauce Labs now has $70 million to help convince them to move to their testing products.

      "text": "15 November 2016 at 12:57pm Google and Facebook unveil measures to clamp down on fake news online Facebook and Google have been accused of profiting fro fake news Credit: PA \nGoogle and Facebook have unveiled plans to curb fake news reports on their websites after they were widely criticised for profiting from lies and even faced claims they had helped swayed the US election results. \nThe internet giants have tightened their rules with the aim of preventing content producers from getting advertising revenue from false or misleading reports. \nIt comes after they faced growing protests for failing to take decisive action over the growing number of fake news being distributed through social media and search results. \nBoth companies were also accused of swaying the US election result by facilitating a huge surge in entirely false stories about the presidential candidates being shared online in the run up to the vote. \nResearchers have found a vast underbelly of websites producing entirely false content which have apparently drawn in many credulous social media users. \nSome are intended to promote political campaigns - such as news sites detailing the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton carried out a murder. Others are simply designed to be 'clickbait' which can draw in revenue from advertising placed alongside the content. Most people read news articles shared online - but are they trustworthy? Credit: PA \nThe problem is made even worse by a technique used by both Facebook and Google known as 'filter bubbles' in which they attempt to learn users' interests and promote content which they think they will like. \nIt means that people who rely heavily on social sites or google search for news may fail to get a balanced view of contentious or political issues. \nAnd if they share one false news story, they are likely to see any more along the same lines, shoring up their belief despite there being no basis in the reports. \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied claims that the social network played any role in influencing the election result, claiming that \"99%\" of the content on Facebook was authentic. \nHowever there are reports that some staff at the social media network have set up an unofficial task force to combat the problem. \nFacebook said that it was now updating its policy to restrict adverts from appearing alongside \"misleading or deceptive\" content - though this will not impact on fake news that is shared by users on their news feeds. \nMeanwhile Google said it would restrict adverts from being placed on websites and pages that \"misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property\".

      "text": "  Google, Facebook Say They Won't Serve Ads to Fake News Sites Published on November 15, 2016 . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seen during a session at the Techonomy 2016 conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., on Thursday, has said that 'more than 99 percent' of what people see on Facebook is authentic. Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Most Popular \nGoogle and Facebook took steps to punish fake news websites amid growing scrutiny of technology platforms for permitting false information to spread online. \nOn Monday, Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it's implementing a new policy that pulls its popular advertising tool from websites that run \"misrepresentative content\" although it stopped short of banning fake news from its pages. Facebook clarified existing rules that it won't integrate or display ads in apps or sites that are illegal, misleading or deceptive. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, wrote in a statement. Related Stories How Did Hillary Clinton Screw This Up? For Starters, Her Advertising Was All Wrong \nGoogle's AdSense for publishers, which facilitates web display ad sales, is the dominant service in the industry and a primary source of revenue for most online publications. The incoming policy will not necessarily scrub false articles from its search pages, which surface from complex algorithims. But the move could send publications behind fake news scrambling for cash. \nReuters first reported on Google's policy change. Google was working on the policy prior to the U.S. presidential election last week, according to Ms. Faville. \nDonald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. election has sent shock waves across Silicon Valley. Geoff Lewis, an investor with venture firm Founders Fund, pinned some of the blame for the results on the tech industry on Sunday, arguing that social media sites had grown too cloistered. Facebook, in particular, has been the target of criticism for hosting false stories that circulated before the election. \nOn Sunday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded, claiming that \"more than 99 percent\" of what people see on the social media site is authentic. \"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\" he wrote. \nGoogle faced similar heat on Monday morning. The top search result for a query around the election result directed users to a Wordpress blog citing unverified information. Google copped to the error. \"In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,\" Ms. Faville said. \n-- Bloomberg News",
