      "title": "FCC Warns AT&T, Verizon They're Violating Net Neutrality With Zero Rating Schemes",
      "text": "FCC Warns AT&T, Verizon They're Violating Net Neutrality With Zero Rating Schemes from the nice-timing,-hero dept Last month, we noted how the FCC had finally woken up from a deep slumber to realize that zero rating (an ISP exempting its own or a partner company's content from usage caps) can be anti-competitive. The FCC's net neutrality rules don't specifically ban zero rating, but the agency had said it would act on a \"case by case basis\" should the practice be used anti-competitively. But a year came and went, and the FCC consistently failed to act as ISPs from Comcast to Verizon began giving their own content an unfair leg up in the market. That was until last month, when the FCC sent AT&T a letter warning it that exempting its DirecTV Now content from AT&T wireless usage caps raised \"serious concerns\" about the open internet. Apparently unfazed by AT&T's defense of its behavior, the FCC last week sent an additional letter to AT&T (pdf) saying it believes that AT&T's implementation of usage caps hurts competition: \"...Your submission tends to confirm our initial view that the Sponsored Data program strongly favors AT&T's own video offerings while unreasonably discriminating against unaffiliated edge providers and limiting their ability to offer competing video services to AT&T's broadband subscribers on a level playing field. We have therefore reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the \"virtuous cycle\" needed to assure the continuing benefits of the Open Internet.\" Again, why it took the FCC the better part of a year to realize this isn't clear, but the agency sent a similar letter to Verizon (pdf). In that letter, the FCC criticizes Verizon's \"Free Bee\" sponsored data service that lets competing content companies enjoy the same cap-exempt status Verizon's own content enjoys -- if companies are willing to pay a steep premium: \"Under either option for competing with Verizon' s Go90 or other affiliated edge services, unaffiliated edge providers appear to confront significant disadvantages when trying to compete with Verizon from the combined impact of Verizon's FreeBee Data 360 fees and zero-rating of its own Go90 offerings. We are therefore concerned that this combination could present anti-competitive effects.\" That's great , FCC, we're so glad you could join the rest of us in realizing the obvious. But while the FCC's letters urge both AT&T and Verizon to offer up further justifications before December 15, there's no indication any FCC enforcement or punishment for these violations will survive the Trump administration. We've noted how all of Trump's telecom advisors not only have deep ties to the broadband industry, but have actively stated they want to gut net neutrality rules entirely in addition to hamstringing and defunding the FCC. In fact Ajit Pai, a current Commissioner in the running for new FCC boss issued a statement (pdf) reminding the FCC that whatever it does can (and likely will) be undone by the new administration: \"Chairman Wheeler launched yet another broadside against free data for consumers, notwithstanding the objections of Republican commissioners. This end-run around Congress’s clear instruction is sad—and pointless. For any unilateral action taken by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau at the Chairman’s direction in the next 49 days can quickly be undone by that same bureau after January 20, 2017.\" So again, it's great that the FCC finally realized that using caps to give your own content an unfair market advantage is anti-competitive, but the enforcement (if you can call it that) comes too little too late for consumers, given the incoming administration has made every indication it intends to either refuse to enforce the existing rules, or work to scrap net neutrality protections entirely.",

      "text": "Tweet Share The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files More REUTERS - Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers to Equinix Inc for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas in the United States and Latin America, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. The sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, which have been offering deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Verizon and Equinix were up marginally in premarket trading. (Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Reblog",

      "text": "Newly Named Rainguard Water Sealers 600 Set for Saturday, June 10, On 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series Schedule\nFort Worth, TX -- ( ReleaseWire ) -- 12/06/2016 -- Rainguard Water Sealers, a rapidly growing private water sealant and graffiti protection coating company, has signed a three-year agreement with Texas Motor Speedway to become the entitlement sponsor of the annual Verizon IndyCar Series race held in June at the world-renowned motorsports facility.\nThe multi-year deal for \"America's Original Nighttime IndyCar Race,\" will begin with the 2017 event scheduled for Saturday, June 10, at the Fort Worth-based speedway. The race will be rebranded the Rainguard Water Sealers 600 and serve as the ninth event on the Verizon IndyCar Series' current 17-race schedule for next season.\nThe agreement is the first entitlement sponsorship of any kind for the company that is based is Newport Beach, Calif. Specific financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\"We are extremely pleased to have Texas Motor Speedway and 'America's Original Nighttime IndyCar Race' serve as the initial sponsorship venture into motorsports and sports in general for Rainguard Water Sealers,\" Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage said. \"We look forward to providing Rainguard with an exceptional first experience as an entitlement sponsor and help the company attain their goals through this sponsorship agreement.\"\nRainguard, founded in 1969 as a manufacturer of architectural grade coatings used in the construction industry, is utilizing the sponsorship to enhance the consumer awareness and growth of the company that in 2010 developed a full line of specialty sealer products for the home improvement marketplace. The company specializes in premium sealers, interior and exterior sealers, water protection and exterior stains for a diverse assortment of surfaces that are sold through major distributors such as Home Depot and Walmart, among others.\nThe entitlement of the Verizon IndyCar Series race at Texas Motor Speedway was particularly appealing to Rainguard due in large part to the top-five metropolitan market size of Dallas/Fort Worth and the growth of INDYCAR in recent years. The Verizon IndyCar Series race telecasts have increased 55 percent in viewership since 2013; social media conversation of the sport has increased 126 percent in that same timeframe; and more than 57 million Americans identify themselves as INDYCAR fans, according to the sanctioning body. Also, more than a dozen new sponsors came aboard to INDYCAR in 2016 alone.\n\"I've always believed that Indy racing is a great way to move a company's brand to the next level. That coupled with the incredible venue at Texas Motor Speedway, made the decision easy,\" Rainguard International President Claude Florent said. \"We are committed to solidifying Rainguard as a respected national brand of home-improvement sealers, and creating effective and safe solutions for every homeowner throughout the nation. There is no better way than partnering with Indy and Texas Motor Speedway.\"\nFor ticket information on the 2017 Rainguard Water Sealers 600, please visit http://www.texasmotorspeedway.com/ or call the Texas Motor Speedway ticket office at 817-215-8500.\nAbout Rainguard Water Sealers\nRainguard was founded in 1969 as a manufacturer of architectural grade coatings used in the construction industry throughout the United States and Canada.

(Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA) \nVerizon is selling its data center business to Equinix in a $3.6 billion cash deal as the communications giant focuses on digital transformation for its customers, the companies announced Tuesday. \nRedwood City, Calif.-based Equinix will get 24 Verizon customer-facing data sites, which include 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas in the U.S. and Latin America. Data centers typically store large amounts of data on hard drives. The transaction doesn't affect Verizon’s managed hosting and cloud offerings, or the New York-based company's data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada. \nThe transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, the companies said. \nThe announcement sent shares of Equinix ( EQIX ) 2% higher to $338.75 in morning trading. Verizon ( VZ ) shares were up fractionally at $50.11 shortly after U.S. financial markets opened. \nVerizon has shifted its corporate focus to mobile video and advertising as it moves toward completing its $4.83 billion deal for Yahoo. Verizon begins Yahoo breach evaluation, earnings hit by Samsung Note 7 recall \nEquinix bills itself as the world's largest provider of IBX data centers, carrier-neutral facilities where major networks, enterprises, and business partners interconnect with each other and with more than 1,400 networks. \nThe company said the deal would further strengthen its global platform by increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America. Additionally, the transaction will speed Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy, the company said. \nEquinix President and CEO Steve Smith predicted the deal would immediately boost the company's finances for shareholders. \"The new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros,\" he said. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

Daily Edition Verizon CEO Talks AT&T-Time Warner, Content Strategy 7:00 AM PST 12/6/2016 by Georg Szalai Lowell McAdam Lowell McAdam appeared at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York. \nVerizon chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam told an investor conference Tuesday that AT&T's $85.4 billion deal for Time Warner doesn't affect Verizon and its strategy. \n\"No. I respect the strategy,\" he said when quizzed on the topic. \"It makes perfect sense for them\" given the telecom rival's assets. But he said Verizon was focused on serving millennials with content that is \"more snackable\" and otherwise different from traditional programming. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York, he was also asked about the regulatory outlook for the Trump administration. Highlighting that Verizon didn’t get into Twitter wars with either candidates, he said it was too early to tell. \nCorporate tax reform could be good news, but things would depend on details, he said, adding: \"You really have to wait and see.\" McAdam also said that Verizon would \"continue to play our game\" while the outlook becomes clearer. \nFellow telecom giant AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion and recently launched streaming service DirecTV Now to reach consumers who aren't currently pay TV subscribers. DirecTV Now, which starts at $35 per month, has struck content deals with all major entertainment companies except for CBS Corp. Verizon instead has focused on deals that have built out its digital offers for millennials, focusing on another opportunity. \nVerizon earlier this year announced the $4.83 billion acquisition of Yahoo's core internet business, but has since looked at the fallout from a Yahoo email hack and whether that should lower the price tag it pays. McAdam didn't provide any updated forecast for that process on Tuesday. McAdam previously told analysts that there would be “meaningful” financial synergies in the Yahoo deal, but the company so far hasn't detailed any figures. \nThe company previously also bought AOL and Millennial Media and last year launched millennials-focused mobile video service Go90. McAdam told the UBS conference that the combination of offering AOL, Go90, skinny bundles and Verizon's FiOS pay TV service allows the company to better monetize content across platforms. \nAsked if Verizon has all the assets it needs, McAdam said \"we'll keep our options open.\" But he said the company feels good about its position in sports, finance, news and entertainment, which, followed by lifestyle, are its key content pillars.

      "text": "Equinix to Acquire Portfolio of 24 Data Center Sites from Verizon in $3.6 Billion Deal [December 06, 2016] Tweet \nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Equinix, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQIX), the global interconnection and data center company, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a portfolio of 24 data center sites and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) for $3.6 billion in an all cash transaction. The 24 sites consist of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas. The addition of these strategic facilities and customers will further strengthen Equinix's global platform by: increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America ; opening three new markets in Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston ; and accelerating Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy. \nThe acquisition of these assets will enable Equinix customers to further respond to a key market trend that is enabling their evolution from traditional businesses to \"digital businesses\" -- the need to globally interconnect with people, locations, cloud services and data. Additionally, customers will have the opportunity to operate on an expanded global platform to process, store and distribute larger volumes of latency sensitive data and applications at the digital edge, closer to end-users and local markets. \nThe acquired portfolio includes approximately 900 customers, with a significant number of enterprise customers new to Equinix's platform, and it adds approximately 2.4 million gross square feet. It will bring Equinix's total global footprint to 175 data centers in 43 markets and approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. \nThe transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nHighlights / Key Facts The transaction includes 29 data center buildings across 24 sites in 15 metro areas, including Atlanta ( Atlanta and Norcross ), Bogotá, Boston ( Billerica ), Chicago ( Westmont ), Culpeper , Dallas ( Irving , Richardson -Alma and Richardson-Pkwy), Denver (Englewood) , Houston , Los Angeles ( Torrance ), Miami ( Miami and Doral ), New York (Carteret, Elmsford and Piscataway), São Paulo, Seattle ( Kent ), Silicon Valley ( Santa Clara and San Jose ), and Washington, D.C. ( Ashburn , Manassas and Herndon ). The addition of the new data center assets will greatly expand Equinix's global platform for enterprises by adding new markets and Fortune 1000 enterprise customers. It expands capacity in existing markets, such as Atlanta , Denver, Miami , New York , São Paulo, Seattle and Silicon Valley, and it provides a platform for the future expansion of the acquired data centers. The NAP (Network Access Point) of the Americas facility in Miami is a key interconnection point and will become a strategic hub and gateway for Equinix customer deployments servicing Latin America . Combined with the Verizon data centers in Bogotá and the NAP o Brasil in São Paulo, it will strategically position Equinix in the growing Latin American market. The NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper, VA is a highly secure campus focused on government agency customers, strengthening Equinix as a platform of choice for government services and service providers. Approximately 250 Verizon employees, primarily in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Quote s \nSteve Smith , President and CEO, Equinix: \"This unique opportunity complements and extends Equinix's strategy to expand our global platform. It enables us to enhance cloud and network density to continue to attract enterprises, while expanding our presence in the Americas. The new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros. The deal will also provide significant value for shareholders as the proposed transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to our adjusted funds from operations per share upon close.\" \nKarl Strohmeyer , President, Americas, Equinix: \"This deal is a significant win for our existing customers, who will gain access to new locations, ecosystems and partners. It is also a win for the new companies joining Equinix, as they will be able to leverage Equinix's global footprint and unique interconnection services. At Equinix, companies can architect a globally consistent platform within local metros, keeping their critical data and processing capabilities as close as possible to the digital edge and end-users.\" \nInvestor Call \nEquinix will hold an investor conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time ( 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time ) to discuss the details of this announcement.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Equinix scoops up 24 Verizon data centers for $3.6 billion The all-cash deal consists of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas, as well as an acquired portfolio of around 900 customers and roughly 250 Verizon employees. | Topic: Data Centers \nEquinix to expand footprint of 24 new data center sites containing 29 data center buildings, across 15 metro areas. \nEquinix said on Tuesday that it will buy 24 data center sites from US telecommunications giant Verizon for $3.6 billion. What's Hot on ZDNet Why I cancelled my new 15-inch MacBook Pro order \nThe deal follows an announcement from Verizon in October that it was in the midst of negotiations to offload some of its data center assets, which it had been floating on the market throughout this year. \nThe all-cash deal consists of 29 data center buildings across 15 metropolitan areas, as well as an acquired portfolio of around 900 customers and roughly 250 Verizon employees. \nEquinix said the data centers will expand its enterprise colocation services to new markets such as Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston and further the company's strategic push into the government and energy sectors. \n\"This unique opportunity complements and extends Equinix's strategy to expand our global platform. It enables us to enhance cloud and network density to continue to attract enterprises, while expanding our presence in the Americas,\" said Equinix chief executive Steve Smith. \nVerizon has a bevy of colocation assets and roughly 48 data centers that compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. A bulk of the assets were acquired in 2011 when Verizon bought Terremark , providers of cloud services and data center hosting, for $1.4 billion. \nAt the time, Verizon said cloud computing was a key cog in its growth strategy, however recent earnings reports from the telecom giant have barely mentioned cloud hosting. \nEquinix said the transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, subject to closing conditions.

      "text": "Verizon CEO Doesn’t Want to Sell You a 300-Channel TV Package 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nVerizon is the latest old-line telecom company that sees its future in “skinny bundles” and mobile video. \nAt a Tuesday morning session at the 44th annual UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said the company will continue to base its content strategy around younger viewing habits as it rolls out its 5G wireless network. \n“We want to skate to where the puck is going,” McAdam said. “if you look at millennials and how they choose to consume their media, it’s much more mobile, snackable and internet-based.” Also Read: Viacom CEO Calls MTV US Strategy a 'Mistake' \nMcAdam said Verizon is consciously investing in internet-based programming with a proven youth-heavy audience rather than build an old-style cable bundle, saying that’s where the growth opportunity is. \n“We’re more bullish on the digital media because the millennials don’t want a 300-channel bundle,” McAdam said. “That’s why we’re going the route of [lifestyle website] Complex Media and [digital video network] AwesomenessTV.” \nMcAdam also addressed Verizon’s rollout of its high-speed 5G network, which he described as “wireless fiber.” As opposed to its FiOS product, which ran fiber lines directly into people’s homes, the 5G network will be a hybrid with fiber to the neighborhood and a wireless component to carry it the last mile. And again, McAdam plays to use the network, which is rolling out in several cities, namely Boston, to deliver a skinny TV bundle in addition to high-speed internet. Also Read: Verizon Buys Jason Kilar's Video Service Vessel \n“Our plan is to offer 1-gigabit broadband service to them and a over-the-top bundle,” he said. “We can go with a 300-channel bundle, [but] in our view, the market is going more toward a skinny bundle.” \nMcAdam declined to talk about Yahoo, which Verizon agreed to purchase for $4.8 billion in July, other than to say that the company is still working through its security processes after revelations of a major breach, and that he still anticipates Yahoo being added to the Verizon fold. \nRead original story Verizon CEO Doesn’t Want to Sell You a 300-Channel TV Package At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "title": "Verizon Will Offer Skinny Bundle Video In 5G Wireless Test, CEO Says",
      "text": "Verizon REX/Shutterstock \nVerizon plans to offer a skinny bundle video service via 5G wireless transmissions in early 2017 to test the speedy technology in some “relatively small towns,” CEO Lowell McAdam said today at the UBS Global Media and Telecommunications Conference. Yahoo Q3 Earnings Solid, Says It's Still Prepping For Verizon Takeover \n“Our plan is to offer 1Gb broadband service and an OTT [streaming] bundle,” he says. \nHe offered no update on the status of Verizon’s plan to buy Yahoo’s assets and blend them with AOL. But he says that a plan to blend content about sports, news, entertainment, finance with his Go90 short form videos plus a skinny video bundle “gives us an opportunity to monetize content across platforms.” \nUnlike AT&T, which is focusing on long form content with its plan to buy Time Warner, Verizon’s offerings will mostly be “snackable and internet based” which he says “resonate with a younger group.” \nStill, the 5G effort would not be limited to communities where Verizon currently offers FiOS wired services, McAdam says. That suggests Verizon still hopes to grow its TV delivery capabilities even after it halted the expansion of FiOS to additional markets. \nMcAdam says that Verizon will test a “pre commercial architecture” at no charge to help it figure out the distances it can reach with 5G — which telcos hope will enable them to compete with cable companies that dominate broadband. \n“I call it wireless fiber,” the CEO says. \nThe test would transmit video and other data via Verizon’s firber optic network and then use 5G to transmit into wirelessly as “the last leg into the home.”",

      "title": "Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion",
      "text": "(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc <EQIX.O> for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo.\nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers.\nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.\nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc <TMUS.N> and Sprint Corp <S.N>, which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.\nVerizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year.\nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets.\nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees.\nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas.\n\"We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,\" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts.\nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets.\nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.\nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon.\nShares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.\n\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

      "text": "  10:49   \nBENGALURU (Dec 6): Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers to Equinix Inc for US$3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. \nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas in the United States and Latin America, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. \nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. \nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. \nVerizon has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, which have been offering deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. \nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. \nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. \nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centres, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. \nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. \nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. \nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. \nShares of Verizon and Equinix were up marginally in premarket trading.

      "text": "Jonathan Weiss/123RF\nAT&T apparently isn’t going to take the news that Verizon has started testing 5G without doing anything itself — in fact, AT&T is now set to start testing the next generation of data transfer technology itself. In a new blog post, the company said it would begin testing 5G out in the real world in partnership with Intel and Ericsson. The tests are taking place in one of AT&T’s Austin, Texas, offices.\nAs mentioned, AT&T isn’t the only company testing the new technology — all four of the major carriers are working on 5G, but Verizon and AT&T seem to be the furthest ahead in the testing process.\nMore: Hands on with DirecTV Now, AT&T’s new streaming service starting at $35\nThe news isn’t all that surprising — AT&T announced earlier this year that it would be testing 5G in Austin by the end of the year. According to the company, it specifically wants to test how 5G handles 4K video, butit will be testing a range of use cases, including using 5G for VoIP.\nBefore you get too excited, it’s important to note that it will probably be a while before we mere humans have access to 5G. The 5G standard still has yet to be defined, which means it will still likely be a few years before it can actually be implemented. Most companies seem to be targeting a 2020 launch for the new standard, but whether they can hit that goal still remains to be seen.\nIt’s also likely that once 5G implementation begins, it will only be in select areas. The new standard is likely to require all-new infrastructure, especially considering that it uses millimeter wave technology, which can’t really travel long distances or through many obstacles.\nMicrosoft shrinks bandwidth requirements for its Holoportation system Start getting ready for 5G!

      "text": "AT&T Says Early Demand for DirecTV Now Is ‘Exceeding Expectations’ Plus, Verizon details its 5G deployment plans By Jason Lynch December 6, 2016, 11:15 AM EST Television AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the company met its DirecTV Now December subscriber goals in one day. Getty Images Last week's launch of DirecTV Now was plagued with errors , but AT&T says it's thrilled with the early interest in its new streaming bundle offering. \"The early demand has been rather dramatic ... we've been pleased with it,\" Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chairman, CEO and president, said this morning at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York. (Yesterday, execs from Netflix, CBS, 21st Century Fox and Discovery Communications spoke at the conference.) Stephenson said that John Stankey, CEO of AT&T Entertainment Group, told him that AT&T met its goals for December subscribers last Wednesday, the first day DirecTV Now was available. Demand is \"exceeding expectations,\" he added, especially in apartment buildings. He was also pleased with the interest in adding on HBO or Cinemax, for an additional $5 per month. So how will AT&T make money on a service that is offering $35 a month for a bundle of 100-plus channels ? The company is \"perfectly content\" with \"lower, thinner margins,\" said Stephenson, adding, \"early on, I do expect the margins to be fairly thin.\" But as AT&T collects viewership data on DirecTV Now customers, as well as those DirecTV customers who can now stream programming on mobile devices (AT&T says half of all DirecTV customers will stream some of their content by year's end), \"the advertising opportunity here we think is rather significant,\" said Stephenson. Next year, one of the company's top priorities is to \"really begin to scale those advertising models\" for DirecTV Now. And the company hopes to pair products, like wireless and broadband or DirecTV and wireless. When that happens, \"churn goes down precipitously,\" said Stephenson, referring to subscribers who don't renew. \"We have high expectations for churn reduction in this environment.\" Stephenson said that DirecTV Now was \"a 5G service being launched on a 4G network,\" and hopes that new products like that will accelerate efforts to bring 5G. As the regulatory process continues for AT&T's $85 billion merger with Time Warner , Stephenson said \"we're hopeful that perhaps a more moderate approach to some of these regulations\" will be in the works under President Trump's administration, later calling it \"a more rational level of regulation.\" He was hopeful about achieving \"meaningful corporate tax reform\" with Trump as president, noting that for the first time in many years, the company's 2017 scenario includes better than expected economic growth. Stephenson had no updates about the Time Warner deal beyond his comments right after it was announced, explaining that \"we do not compete. This is a classic vertical merger.\" Verizon prepares for 5G While Stephenson briefly mentioned 5G, the next-generation wireless network was also on the mind of Verizon Communications chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam, who also spoke this morning at the UBS conference. McAdam said Verizon is planning pre-commercial 5G trials in \"relatively small towns\" for the first quarter. Verizon sees 5G as \"wireless fiber,\" where the fiber connection ends 200-1000 feet from the home, and data is transmitted into the home via \"a wireless last leg.\" The trial will also include 1G wireless broadband and an over-the-top bundle, said McAdam. \"The early phase is not mobile-oriented,\" said McAdam, adding that he expects to have a better sense of the timeline for Verizon's 5G rollout by the middle of 2017. McAdam said that there was \"really not a lot to say\" about the company's efforts to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion , a deal which was threatened by Yahoo's subsequent revelation that 500 million user accounts were hacked in 2014. \"They've been doing all their work on the breach. We need to give them a lot of time to do that analysis before we move forward on that,\" he said. And Verizon doesn't feel pressure to match AT&T's big merger with Time Warner. \"I respect the strategy; it makes perfect sense for them,\" said McAdam, but his company's approach is \"mobile, snackable, internet-based video\" like its Go90 platform.

      "text": "Photo: Bloomberg News 375 Pearl Street, formerly the Verizon Building, which currently houses the Intergate.Manhattan data center. \nVerizon Communications Inc. agreed to sell its data-centers business to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion in cash as the company turns its focus to mobile video advertising. \nThe deal includes 24 facilities across 15 metropolitan markets, according to a statement Tuesday. Equinix, based in Redwood City, California, operates as a real estate investment trust, mostly holding interconnected data centers . With the deal, Equinix now has 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world. \nFor Verizon, the nation’s largest wireless carrier, the deal marks an exit from the data-hosting and cloud-services business five years after it bought Terremark Worldwide Inc. for $1.3 billion. As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago. \nAs the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL’s web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo! Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook Inc. \nThe sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon’s cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. \nShares of Verizon rose less than 1% to $50.09 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. Equinix climbed 1.3% to $336.54. \nVerizon’s advisers were Citigroup Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nTelecom giant Verizon made it official Tuesday, saying it will sell its cloud hosting and data center business to global data center operator Equinix for a cool $3.6 billion. \nThe move comes after speculation began last year around the fate of Verizon's data center business. By selling its data centers to Equinix, Verizon can focus on its core connectivity and wireless business and Equinix will boost its presence in the U.S. and Latin America, the two companies said Tuesday morning. \nThe $3.6 billion cash deal gives Equinix 29 data center buildings across 24 data center sites. Equinix will expand into 15 metro markets in North America and Latin America, including in Atlanta, Denver, Miami, New York, Sao Paulo, and the Seattle area. This brings Equinix's data center footprint to 175 buildings in 43 global markets. \n[Related: Report: Verizon 'Starting Process' To Sell Off Data Center Business For $2.5 Billion ] \nVia the terms of the deal, 250 Verizon data center operations employees will become Equinix employees. Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix will gain about 900 new customers, the companies said. \nIn January, reports had surfaced that said Basking Ridge, N.J.-based Verizon was getting ready to auction off its data center assets in a deal worth north of $2.5 billion. During Verizon's third-quarter earnings call in October, CFO Fran Shammo confirmed that Verizon was expected to sell its cloud hosting and data center business early in the fourth quarter. \nVerizon entered the co-location and hosting space in 2011 when it purchased data center operator Terremark for $1.4 billion. \nData center operations have proven to be a challenge for many of the incumbent carriers. While many carriers began scooping up data center assets in earnest to get into the cloud market, these investments in physical assets largely haven't paid off. As a result, many have opted to return to their roots in the connectivity and voice markets, deciding that cloud services can still be offered without owning their own data center assets. \nIn November, Monroe, La.-based CenturyLink unveiled plans to sell off its data centers and co-location business for $2.15 billion to a group of funds advised by investment firm BC Partners. Little Rock, Ark.-based provider Windstream also sold off its data center operations to co-location provider TierPoint for $575 million in 2015. \nVerizon said that its managed hosting and cloud offerings and its data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada won't be affected by this deal. \nThe two companies expect the transaction to close by mid-2017.",

      "text": "Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion By Reuters Media Today at 10:53 a.m. The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nVerizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. \nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. \nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. \nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. \nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp , which offer deep discounts on cell phone and data plans. \nVerizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. \nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. \nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. \nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. \n\"We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,\" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. \nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. \nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. \nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. \nShares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.",

      "text": "Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion By Reuters Media Today at 10:53 a.m. The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nVerizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. \nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. \nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. \nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. \nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp , which offer deep discounts on cell phone and data plans. \nVerizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. \nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. \nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. \nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. \n\"We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,\" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. \nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. \nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. \nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. \nShares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.",

The acquisition brings Equinix’s total data center footprint to 175 in 43 metro areas. Verizon is keeping its data centers in 27 sites across Europe, Asia and Canada. \nThe news comes on the heels of the early November announcement by CenturyLink that it would be selling its data center and colocation business to a group of investors for $2.15 billion in cash . The purchasing group is made up of funds advised by BC Partners, Medina Capital Advisors and Longview Asset Management. CenturyLink sold off 57 data centers. \nBoth CenturyLink and Verizon say they’re still committed to providing customers with cloud and data center services, interconnections and networking products. It just won’t own the infrastructure that powers those operations.  ",

      "text": "  \nEquinix is set to acquire 24 datacentre sites from telecommunications giant Verizon for $3.6bn, paving the way for the colocation firm to expand its footprint in the US and Latin America.   Hybrid Cloud workloads: The Essential Guide \nAccess this guide to help you tackle the key hybrid cloud architecture issue: workload management.   \nThe deal will see Equinix pick up 29 facilities, spread across 24 datacentre campuses, in 15 metro areas, as the firm continues in its quest to build out its datacentre portfolio across the globe. \nThese metros include areas the company has yet to site facilities of its own, including Bogotá, Columbia; Culpeper, Virginia; and Houston, Texas. This is as well as places where it already has existing capacity, such as Atlanta, Denver, Miami and Silicon Valley. \nOnce the deal closes, which Equinix predicts will be in mid-2017, the company’s global datacentre portfolio will consist of 175 sites, spanning approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific markets. \nAs a result of the deal, around 250 Verizon employees will also be absorbed into Equinix to oversee the continued operations of the acquired sites. \nSteve Smith, CEO and president of Equinix, said the deal stands to benefit customers by providing them with a wider selection of sites worldwide whereby they host and deliver their IT services from. \n“The new assets will bring hundreds of customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros,” he said. \n“The deal will also provide significant value for shareholders as the proposed transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to our adjusted funds from operations per share on close.” Read more about Verizon’s datacentre business Verizon and Centurylink are reportedly on the cusp of reaching separate agreements to divest their datacentre assets, as both telcos look to exit the increasingly competitive colocation market. Verizon is launching a virtualised services offering for enterprises , aimed at growing its presence in the emerging SDN and NFV marketplace. Called Virtual Network Services, the product is intended to aid businesses in transitioning to a virtual infrastructure. \nA question mark has remained over the fate of Verizon’s datacentre portfolio for much of 2016 , after reports in the US at the start of the year suggested the firm had appointed Citigroup to oversee the sale of around 48 of its facilities. \nFurther speculation about the firm’s plans for the sites developed in October 2016 when an analyst report suggested Equinix was on the cusp of acquiring a number of Verizon’s facilities for around $3.5bn. \nVerizon originally bought its way into the colocation market in 2011, after paying out $1.4bn to acquire Terremark . \nIn a statement, Verizon said the deal is a sign of the company’s commitment to focusing resources on areas that will support the digital transformation efforts of its enterprise customers. \n“The sale does not affect Verizon’s managed hosting and cloud offerings, or its datacentre services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada,” the statement added .

      "text": "Verizon to Sell Data Centers to Equinix Big Red continues selling physical assets as it focuses on media and mobile video. Evan Niu Dec 6, 2016 at 12:30PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened \nTelecommunications giant Verizon Communications ( NYSE:VZ ) has reached an agreement with Equinix ( NASDAQ:EQIX ) to sell two dozen data center sites for a total of $3.6 billion. Included in those sites are 29 data center buildings located within 15 major metropolitan areas. Along with the data centers, Equinix will be acquiring roughly 900 customers and 250 new employees from Verizon, including many new enterprise customers. After closing, Equinix will have a total of 175 data centers across 43 markets, covering 17 million gross square feet of data center space around the world. \nThe deal is expected to close by the middle of next year. Does it matter? \nFor Equinix, the deal will expand its global reach and strengthen its interconnections in the U.S. and Latin America while growing its exposure to enterprise and government markets. For instance, the Network Access Point in Miami is an especially important interconnection point for Latin America. Existing customers will also benefit from the larger platform's scale. Equinix said on a conference call with analysts that it had been considering these assets for some time. \nVerizon had previously acquired Terremark Worldwide in 2011 for $1.4 billion, expanding its own data center operations, but has since shifted its focus toward media- and content-related deals. The company had reportedly been trying all year to sell these data center assets, a continuation of recent physical asset sales. Speaking at an investor conference this morning, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said that the company lacked scale in data centers, so it preferred to sell the assets in order to better deploy the capital. \nEvan Niu, CFA has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "title": "Equinix purchases Verizon's data centers for $3.6B, enhances interconnection portfolio",
      "text": "by Sean Buckley | Dec 6, 2016 11:41am \nEquinix made it official: It will purchase a portfolio of 24 data center sites and their operations from Verizon for $3.6 billion, deepening the data center provider's footprint in the United States and the desirable Latin America market. \nThe 24 sites consist of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas. Equinix said that the addition of these facilities and customers will further strengthen the data center providers’ global platform by increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America; opening three new markets in Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston; and accelerating Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy. \nAfter meeting customary closing conditions, Equinix and Verizon said they expect to close the transaction by the middle of next year. Equinix will gain about 900 additional customers, the majority of which are enterprises. \nThe acquired portfolio includes approximately 900 customers, with a significant number of enterprise customers new to Equinix's platform. From a data center space point of view, Equinix will gain about 2.4 million gross square feet, bringing its total global footprint to 175 data centers in 43 markets and approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. \nNews of Equinix buying the data centers should be of no surprise as a Cowen & Co. investor note indicated in October that the provider was the top candidate. \nRELATED: Verizon close to selling data centers to Equinix for $3.5B, report says \nBy purchasing these new data center assets, Equinix will expand its global platform for enterprises by adding new markets and Fortune 1000 enterprise customers. It will also expand capacity in existing markets, such as Atlanta, Denver, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Seattle and Silicon Valley, and it provides a platform for the future expansion of the acquired data centers. \n“The acquisition should benefit Equinix's enterprise initiatives, enhancing the government and energy verticals,” Jefferies said in a research note. “Though a hefty purchase price, the deal appears accretive and brings key strategic assets.” \nDeepening Latin America, government customer reach \nOne of the key pieces of the Verizon data center portfolio is the NAP (Network Access Point) of the Americas facility in Miami. This facility has become a key interconnection point and will become a strategic hub and gateway for Equinix customer deployments servicing Latin America. \n“Equinix was likely most attracted to the NAP of the Americas, and NAP of the Capital Region, two facilities Verizon acquired from Terremark in April 2011 in a deal valued at $1.4bn,” Jefferies said. “The NAP of the Americas in Miami is a key interconnection point for traffic to and from Latin America while the NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper is designed for rigid government standards, and houses many federal clients.” \nVerizon acquired the NAP of the Americas when it purchased Terremark in 2011 as part of an initiative to enhance its cloud services capabilities. \nIn combination with Verizon’s data centers in Bogotá and the NAP do Brasil in São Paulo, it will strategically position Equinix as a major in the growing Latin American data center and interconnection market. \nAn additional benefit is that Equinix will be able to better respond to the public sector segment. The sale also includes the NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper, Virginia, a secure campus focused on government agency customers. \nAfter completing the acquisition, 250 Verizon employees—primarily in the operations functions of the acquired data centers—will become Equinix employees. \nVerizon resets focus \nThe sale of the data center assets to Equinix is just one of several moves that Verizon has made in recent years to fine tune the focus of the company by divesting non-core assets, and the Equinix deal is no different. \nBesides selling the data center business to Equinix, Verizon sold off its wireless towers and three of its wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier earlier this year. \nVerizon said the properties it sold to Frontier were \"islands” of mostly copper and some fiber assets. \nWhat drove Verizon to sell its data center assets was that it was facing greater competition from data center specialists like Equinix and Cologix in a market segment that’s very expensive to maintain. \nLowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon, told investors during the sale of the data centers is part of a way to sell off assets that are no longer core to its business strategy. \n“Inside the company, I use the term you trim the branches on the tree so the tree can be as strong as possible,” McAdam said. “Whether it was selling the smaller properties to Frontier, we took that capital and redeployed it into our wireless and wireline footprint, so this sale is another example of that.” \nMcAdam added that Verizon will look for “opportunities where we are sub-scale and put the money into an area where we can scale because our cost structure is critical to our long-term success.” \nVerizon’s data center sale is part of a growing trend among the largest telcos. Fellow telco CenturyLink recently reached a deal to sell off its data center portfolio to a consortium led by BC Partners and Medina Capital for $2.15 billion in cash and a $150 million minority stake. \nCenturyLink will use the net proceeds from its sale to partly fund a $34 billion acquisition of Level 3 Communications , which the company announced on Monday.

      "text": "Markets Today Wireless Carriers Make Underwhelming Offers in FCC Spectrum Auction AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Comcast and others bid more than $20 billion below the asking price in the FCC's latest auction. Chris Nolter Dec6,201611:21AMEST \nAT&T ( T ) , Verizon Communications ( VZ ) , T-Mobile USA ( TMUS ) , Comcast ( CMCSA ) and other potential buyers of wireless spectrum licenses made underwhelming offers in the third stage of a government auction. The bidding began and ended on Monday, lasting just one round and setting up a next stage of the auction. \nThe Federal Communication Commission is selling television broadcast spectrum licenses to wireless carriers and other buyers through a complex auction aimed at enticing broadcasters to sell their licenses to the government, so that the wavelengths can be repurposed for wireless service. \nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article was originally published by The Deal, a sister publication of TheStreet that offers sophisticated insight and analysis on all types of deals, from inception to integration. Click here for a free trial. \nEach stage of the auction contains two rounds of bidding. In the first, broadcasters tell the FCC how much they will accept for their spectrum. Then, wireless carriers and other bidders say how much they are willing to spend. In each subsequent round, the government offers less spectrum for sale to incentivize bidders to act sooner rather than later. \nThe latest bidding lasted just one round, with the wireless carriers and others offering about $19.7 billion , well below the TV station owners' ask of $40.3 billion. \nBIA/Kelsey analyst Mark Fratrik expected the wireless carriers to show more interest in the latest round. TV station owners have lowered the ask from $86.4 billion in the first round to $54.6 billion in the second before their latest offer in the third round, which closed Thursday.

      "text": "Verizon cancels Galaxy Beta Program for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge It is said that all things must come to an end. That is true, not only in life, but also in the latest beta program for Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 edge customers. Samsung is making the following Nougat beta announcement in the Galaxy Beta app: Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team What this means is that Verizon will no longer endorse the Galaxy Beta Program on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, so customers whove been making the most of the program will either remain on their current beta version or exit the program completely and revert back to the current Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Beta participants will get Nougat, but theyll have to wait until early next year Samsung says. No, Android Nougat wont arrive just in time for Christmas. We dont know if this will be permanent for upcoming OS updates, but it certainly seems abrupt at this point and is discouraging to Samsung customers with Big Red and intrudes upon Samsungs own vision for its customer base. Verizon has not only done this, but other past actions that make Big Red suspect when it comes to Samsung devices. In the Galaxy S5, Verizon customers were denied Download Booster until a later update added it back. On the Galaxy Note 5, Verizon customers were denied Samsungs Write On PDF feature until Verizon brought Marshmallow to the Note 5 back in March of this year (though Samsung did bring it to the Play Store even earlier). Even with the Galaxy Note 7, Samsungs 15GB Samsung Cloud storage was hidden from users who had to use an app shortcut to find it in their software. Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 edge customers, what do you think? Have you received the message yet? Planning to stay in the Galaxy Beta Program until Nougat lands, or revert back to Marshmallow?",

      "text": " Beamr\nTEL AVIV, Israel , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Beamr Imaging Ltd. , the only video and image encoding and processing company with commercially deployed content adaptive optimization technology, announced it has secured an additional $4 million in funding from Verizon Ventures. Joining existing investors Eric Schmidt's fund Innovation Endeavors, Marker LLC, and Disruptive, Verizon Ventures' investment will support Beamr's contribution to improved network performance and video quality. This new funding enables Beamr to accelerate development of solutions that will feature the company's highly regarded and patented perceptual quality measure technology.\nAs continuously improving display technologies boost consumers' expectations of video quality, and with the rise of 4k, HDR, VR and 360 video formats, Beamr's H.264 and H.265/HEVC video optimization technology and encoders are finding their place in critical video workflows such as OTT streaming services, cable and satellite systems, and managed IP networks. Through the application of Beamr Optimization, large network operators are seeing the tangible effects of reducing video traffic and storage costs by 20% or more.\n\"Beamr's vision has always been to merge standards-based encoding technologies with the benefits of our perceptual quality measure, so the industry can meet the heightened consumer expectations for video quality while staying within network constraints,\" commented Sharon Carmel , CEO and Founder of Beamr. \"Our approach to bitrate reduction has attracted an industry-leading customer base where network capacities and media storage requirements are under pressure, but where exceptional video quality must be maintained.\"\nBuilding on the acquisition of Vanguard Video earlier this year, Beamr's industry leading video optimization solution, Beamr Video, has combined two highly regarded HEVC and H.264 software encoders that are in use by dozens of leading media & entertainment companies, broadcasters, streaming video distributors, and OEMs. The products are available as software running on all major platforms and operating systems, and may be deployed on most cloud services including Microsoft Azure and AWS.\n\"The competitive nature of consumer video services today is forcing everyone to improve and we believe Beamr's perceptually driven optimization technology delivers benefits to the network and ultimately, the bottom line,\" said David Famolari , Director at Verizon Ventures. \"Beamr significantly addresses the pain and costs of storing and delivering high bandwidth video content over increasingly congested networks, with no loss in visual quality. As more HD and ultra-HD content becomes available, Beamr's technology can be critical to delivering superior end-user quality of experience.\"\nAbout Beamr\nBeamr is the leading provider of encoding, and optimization solutions for the world's top MSOs, OTT streaming service providers, Hollywood studios, web publishers, and social content publishing platforms. Founded in 2009 by a team of leading imaging experts, Beamr's suite of high-performance H.264 and H.265/HEVC video processing solutions are fully scalable for use in on-premise and cloud implementations.\nBeamr's flagship product, Beamr Video, represents the industry's first content adaptive perceptual quality measure driven optimizer that significantly reduces the bitrate of video streams and files without sacrificing quality. Beamr's encoder product line includes broadcast quality H.265/HEVC and H.264 codec SDK's for x86 and ARM platforms, while supporting popular operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Beamr is headquartered in Tel Aviv with offices in Palo Alto and St. Petersburg, Russia .

      "text": " Equinix, Inc.\nDeal Further Strengthens Equinix's Global Platform; Expands Breadth and Depth of Interconnection Portfolio\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. Equinix, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQIX), the global interconnection and data center company, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a portfolio of 24 data center sites and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) for $3.6 billion in an all cash transaction. The 24 sites consist of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas. The addition of these strategic facilities and customers will further strengthen Equinix's global platform by: increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America ; opening three new markets in Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston ; and accelerating Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy.\nThe acquisition of these assets will enable Equinix customers to further respond to a key market trend that is enabling their evolution from traditional businesses to \"digital businesses\" -- the need to globally interconnect with people, locations, cloud services and data. Additionally, customers will have the opportunity to operate on an expanded global platform to process, store and distribute larger volumes of latency sensitive data and applications at the digital edge, closer to end-users and local markets.\nThe acquired portfolio includes approximately 900 customers, with a significant number of enterprise customers new to Equinix's platform, and it adds approximately 2.4 million gross square feet. It will bring Equinix's total global footprint to 175 data centers in 43 markets and approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific markets.\nThe transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nHighlights / Key Facts\nThe transaction includes 29 data center buildings across 24 sites in 15 metro areas, including Atlanta ( Atlanta and Norcross ), Bogotá, Boston ( Billerica ), Chicago ( Westmont ), Culpeper , Dallas ( Irving , Richardson -Alma and Richardson-Pkwy), Denver (Englewood) , Houston , Los Angeles ( Torrance ), Miami ( Miami and Doral ), New York (Carteret, Elmsford and Piscataway), São Paulo, Seattle ( Kent ), Silicon Valley ( Santa Clara and San Jose ), and Washington, D.C. ( Ashburn , Manassas and Herndon ). The addition of the new data center assets will greatly expand Equinix's global platform for enterprises by adding new markets and Fortune 1000 enterprise customers. It expands capacity in existing markets, such as Atlanta , Denver, Miami , New York , São Paulo, Seattle and Silicon Valley, and it provides a platform for the future expansion of the acquired data centers. The NAP (Network Access Point) of the Americas facility in Miami is a key interconnection point and will become a strategic hub and gateway for Equinix customer deployments servicing Latin America . Combined with the Verizon data centers in Bogotá and the NAP do Brasil in São Paulo, it will strategically position Equinix in the growing Latin American market. The NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper, VA is a highly secure campus focused on government agency customers, strengthening Equinix as a platform of choice for government services and service providers. Approximately 250 Verizon employees, primarily in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.

      "title": "Verizon Sells Data Centers to Equinix for $3.6 Billion -",
      "text": "by Karl Bode Tuesday Dec 06 2016 14:10 EST \nConfirming rumors that emerged in October , Verizon today confirmed it has struck a $3.6 billion deal to sell off all of its data centers to Equinix. A Verizon announcement states that under the deal, Equinix will own and manage 24 Verizon customer-facing data sites, consisting of 29 data center buildings across the United States and Latin America. The move is part of a larger trend at Verizon away from more traditional fixed infrastructure (its FiOS expansion was all but frozen several years ago) and toward wireless and content (as evident by Verizon's buy of AOL and Yahoo). \"This transaction aligns with Verizon’s strategy to focus resources in areas that will help drive digital transformation for enterprise customers, while providing world-class service,\" Verizon said in the statement.\nAccording to Verizon, the sale does not affect Verizon’s managed hosting and cloud offerings, or its data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada (though it's entirely possible those could be offloaded in future deals). Many of the sold centers came as part of a Verizon deal to acquire Terremark in 2011 for $1.3 billion. With this latest deal, Equinix now owns 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world. Verizon, meanwhile, is attempting a pivot towards online content and marketing to millennials in the hopes of doing battle with the likes of Google and Facebook. At least initially those efforts have seen mixed results, with many partners even calling Verizon's Go90 streaming video service \" a dud .\"",

      "text": "Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to sell its data-centers business to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion in cash as the company turns its focus to mobile video advertising.\nThe deal includes 24 facilities across 15 metropolitan markets, according to a statement Tuesday. Equinix, based in Redwood City, California, operates as a real estate investment trust, mostly holding interconnected data centers. With the deal, Equinix now has 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world.\nFor Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier, the deal marks a retreat from the data-centers business five years after it bought Terremark Worldwide Inc. for $1.3 billion. As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago.\nAs the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL's web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook.\nThe sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon's cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction.\nShares of Verizon rose as much as 1.8 percent to $50.62 in New York Tuesday. Equinix climbed 3.2 percent to $342.81.\nAfter the deal, which includes sites in the U.S., Brazil and Colombia, Verizon will still offer data-center services using Equinix as a partner.\nThe deal affects data centers in 15 cities: Atlanta, Bogota, Boston, Chicago (Westmont), Culpeper, Va., Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.\nVerizon's advisers were Citigroup and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune JPMorgan Chase & Co.",

      "text": "Dec 6, 2016 12:19pm Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam \nVerizon continues to move deliberately into digital media, but the company has no plans to offer a massive video service like AT&T’s DirecTV Now, CEO Lowell McAdam said this morning. \nThe nation’s largest wireless carrier is looking to build a media empire through a series of acquisitions. Last year it bought AOL for $4.4 billion . McAdam said he was optimistic that the deal to acquire Yahoo will eventually go through (although the future of that agreement is still uncertain following the major hack of Yahoo’s customer information). Meanwhile, Verizon recently bought the web-video startup Vessel for an undisclosed sum, and it continues to pursue Go90, an OTT video offering aimed at young mobile users. \nThat strategy stands in marked contrast to DirecTV Now, which AT&T launched last week with a lineup of big-name content providers with traditional TV offerings. \n“I think AT&T is certainly going to push the envelope here,” McAdam said this morning at an investors conference. “We’re a bit more bullish on digital media because the millennials don’t seem to be buying the 300-channel bundles. They seem to be much more mobile, much more internet-oriented, and that’s’ why we’re going the rout of Complex Media and AwesomenessTV and RatedRed and some of the other content that we’ve gone through, then putting it on Go90 as the mobile screen rather than the big screen of the house.” \nMobile video consumption is clearly on the rise, but it still isn’t clear that Verizon – or any other carrier – can monetize that trend directly via either a premium offering or advertising. McAdam conceded that Go90 has yet to catch fire among customers, but he said he’s pleased with the incremental growth in viewership. \n“Go90, there was an awful lot of hype on this early on, but we knew that this was going to be what we call patient money,” he said. “Over the last quarter we announced viewership was up to 30 minutes per month, now that doesn’t sound like a lot but people are coming back and they’re doing it for two or three minutes at a time. That gives us a chance to put our other monetization efforts into play such as the advertisers that we mentioned, such as AOL. So we’re building slowly, we’re happy with the build and we continue to invest in that unique content.” Read more on",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson December 6, 2016, 3:40 pm \nThe # Verizon branded # Samsung # GalaxyNote4 is now available for just $184.95 on eBay . The smartphone comes with a very attractive hardware specs sheet underneath, despite the fact that it’s over two years old in the mobile industry. As you would expect, the phone will only work with Verizon’s networks in the U.S. Barring this one caveat, the deal here is well worth your attention. \nThe Galaxy Note 4 comes with a 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display, a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 3.7-megapixel front camera, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, the quad-core Snapdragon 805 SoC, Android 4.4 KitKat (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 3,220 mAh battery. The smartphone also comes with a couple of neat software tricks thanks to the S Pen stylus on board. Productivity enthusiasts will find themselves at home with the Galaxy Note 4. \nMake sure you snatch up the handset before stocks run out.",

      "text": "Jordan Graham Sunday, December 04, 2016 Credit: The Associated Press comments \nThe first Boston customer accounts for Verizon’s high speed FiOS internet service could come online in the next few weeks, the company says, as the city prepares to grant a crucial license to the cable and communications giant. \n“We are planning to begin offering FiOS in parts of our very first service area later this month,” said Michael Murphy, a spokesman for Verizon. “We estimate that by year’s end Fios services will be available to approximately 25,000 premises in Dorchester, the Dudley Square Innovation District of Roxbury, Roslindale and West Roxbury.” \nVerizon said earlier this year it would spend $300 million over six years to install high-speed fiber optic lines throughout the city, beginning with Dudley Square, parts of Dorchester and West Roxbury. \nBoston has no authority to oversee internet service in the city, but does have the power to regulate cable television providers, which Verizon aims to offer as well. \nA draft cable license — a requirement to offer cable television — is expected to be approved soon, clearing the way for Verizon to begin selling and marketing FiOS. \n“My expectation is we will make a decision quite quickly, as soon as next week,” said Jascha Franklin-Hodge, chief information officer for Boston. “We anticipate being able to reach an agreement on a final agreement in the near term.” \nThe license only grants Verizon the ability to serve certain neighborhoods, but can be expanded. The license says Verizon must offer service to anyone who wants it, with some exceptions experts said are relatively standard. \nOne thing the license does not include is requirements for Verizon’s workforce, including mandating union labor, which advocates pushed for — and got — in license negotiations between Verizon and Philadelphia last year. But Myles Calvey, business manager for IBEW Local 2222, which represents Boston’s Verizon workers, said those provisions weren’t necessary because Local 2222’s contract says Verizon must use union workers and cannot hire non-union contractors. \nCalvey said the FiOS installation has brought some much-needed work for the union. \n“This has been a resurrection for us, we had been dying on the vine, no one was taking copper wires,” Calvey said, referring to copper lines historically used for phone and slower internet connections. “Nobody was getting landlines anymore, this brought new work and good work.” \nVerizon also said it would also fund a mobile hotspot lending program through the Boston Public Library and work with city officials on “smart city” projects. Neither of those are included in the license, but a BPL spokeswoman said the hotspot lending program is in development. More On: ",

      "text": "  12:30 P.M. Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion By Scott Moritz and Alex Sherman Bloomberg Twitter \nVerizon Communications Inc. agreed to sell its data-centers business to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion in cash as the company turns its focus to mobile video advertising. \nThe deal includes 24 facilities across 15 metropolitan markets, according to a statement Tuesday. Equinix, based in Redwood City, California, operates as a real estate investment trust, mostly holding interconnected data centers. With the deal, Equinix now has 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world. \nFor Verizon, the nation’s largest wireless carrier, the deal marks a retreat from the data-centers business five years after it bought Terremark Worldwide Inc. for $1.3 billion. As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago. \nAs the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL’s web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook. \nThe sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon’s cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. \nShares of Verizon rose as much as 1.8 percent to $50.62 in New York Tuesday. Equinix climbed 3.2 percent to $342.81. \nAfter the deal, which includes sites in the U.S., Brazil and Colombia, Verizon will still offer data-center services using Equinix as a partner. \nVerizon’s advisers were Citigroup and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Published: Dec. 6, 2016, 12:30 p.m.",

      "text": "svenska Verizon begins offering Fios in first Boston neighborhoods as revolutionary citywide fiber-optic rollout gets underway Fios Internet, TV and phone services available for order beginning today in parts of Dorchester, Roslindale and West Roxbury; transformational six-year rollout of new fiber-optic network underway News provided by Dec 06, 2016, 15:54   BOSTON , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon today announced the first availability of Fios Internet, TV and phone services in several Boston neighborhoods, which residents can order by visiting www.verizon.com/BostonFios . Fios is debuting just eight months after the company outlined a $300 million investment to build a fiber-optic network platform across Boston over the next six years. Capable of powering wired broadband, advanced wireless services, smart community solutions and future innovation, Verizon's new 100% fiber-optic network platform will transform Boston's technology infrastructure and bring competition and new choices to residents and businesses. Beginning today Fios Internet, TV and phone are available to order in parts of Dorchester , Roslindale and West Roxbury . Residents in these first neighborhoods can visit www.verizon.com/BostonFios to check Fios availability at their specific address. As previously announced , Verizon also plans to bring Fios Internet, TV and phone service to Roxbury's Dudley Square Innovation District before year's end. Expansion will continue street-by-street, week-by-week, in Dorchester , Roslindale , West Roxbury and parts of Roxbury in 2017. View from Verizon \"Just eight months ago we announced that Fios was coming,\" said Ken Dixon , leader of Verizon's consumer landline business. \"This speedy launch is only possible because of the cooperation and partnership between the City of Boston and Verizon at every level. The winners are Boston residents.\" Since April's announcement Verizon has placed more than 160 miles of fiber-optic wiring throughout Boston including large-capacity 'feeder' lines above and underneath city streets to prepare for eventually connecting fiber-optic lines directly to homes and businesses that order Fios service. \"Beginning today Verizon brings Fios, competition and choice to the first neighborhoods of Boston ,\" Dixon said. \"By the end of December, more than 25,000 addresses will be able to order Fios. Unlike cable, Fios provides a 100% fiber-optic network to your home or business.\" Fios is not cable…We are wired differently. Verizon Fios uses a 100% fiber-optic network that provides equal upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, making it the fastest internet and Wi-Fi available + . With innovative Fios TV service, customers can enjoy crystal-clear HD picture quality. Fios Triple Play bundles, featuring 150/150 Mbps internet, Custom TV and phone begin at $79.99* per month online. Fios is the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. Fios Internet is rated highest in customer satisfaction in the East Region by J.D. Power four years running, and rated #1 in Internet Speed for 10 years running by PC Magazine. Fiber-optics helping Boston's streets get smarter In November Verizon and the City of Boston reached an agreement to conduct a trial of smart communities solutions at the intersection of Mass Ave & Beacon Street. Construction is currently underway to install new traffic signals, lighting and video solutions which, for the first time, will work together to provide integrated data to city planners and engineers via Verizon's fiber-optic network. This 'proof-of-concept' pilot is expected to become operational later this year and is designed to help the City better inform and engage with its constituents. Verizon's continued commitment to Boston Verizon has made a commitment to donate $100,000 to Boston Public Library in support of a new Wi-Fi Hotspot Lending program. The two-year pilot focuses on making 100 hotspots available to library patrons, increasing access to the Internet and other online services. This grant to BPL is in addition to more than $200,000 that Verizon invested in Boston -area schools and non-profits in 2016 supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, including: The Community Academy of Science and Health , Boston Adult Technical Academy, and Urban Science Academy - to host the Verizon Innovative Design Thinking Academy which trains high school teachers to engage students to develop mobile apps or websites for small businesses and community nonprofits The Boston Private Industry Council - towards 'Classroom in the Workplace' which expands STEM career awareness and academic programming for Boston public high school students The Roxbury Innovation Center/Venture Café - to further youth entrepreneurship and STEM programs for children ages 7 – 17 living in Boston Public Housing Camp Harborview's Knowledge Is Power - curriculum which includes environmental science, healthy lifestyles, STEM and career education to summer campers in grades K – 10 Boston Partners in Education - to fund development of a world-class STEM education for 300 students at the Dearborn STEM Academy in Dorchester Generations Inc. - supporting twelve highly-trained tutors within the Lyndon K-8 School in West Roxbury to provide support to all K-2nd grade students More information regarding the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network build across Boston is available at www.verizon.com/BostonFios .

      "text": "(Hollywood Reporter) – Verizon’s $4.8 billion deal to acquire Yahoo and merge it with AOL has stalled following a widespread hack of 500 million Yahoo users. But AOL CEO Tim Armstrong believes the deal will ultimately close.\n“I’m cautiously optimistic that it will happen,” Armstrong told attendees of Business Insider’s Ignition Conference. “The companies are working well together. There’s been a constructive dialog around things like the data breach that need to get resolved.”\nSEE ALSO: Cybercriminals, Not State-Sponsored Actors, Likely Behind Yahoo Breach \nVerizon emerged as the winning bidder for Yahoo after the flagging giant underwent a lengthy auction process. But two months later, Yahoo revealed that it had been subject to a large breach of security in 2014, putting the deal in jeopardy. Armstrong, who has been leading the integration with Yahoo alongside Verizon’s Marni Walden, said the two companies had been setting up a merger strategy when the data breach was made public, a turn of events that “slowed things down a bit.” But he noted that they are proceeding with planning the deal, and expect to begin laying out the structure of the combined company.\nArmstrong also expects Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer to remain with the company. “I’m hopeful that as we go forward that Marissa will play a role in getting Yahoo to the next iteration and next generation of what Yahoo’s going to be,” he said, calling Yahoo’s recent presentation of its 2017 strategy “impressive.”\nSEE ALSO: Yahoo’s Mayer Suffers New Hit to Privacy Reputation With E-Mails \nAOL recently announced plans to lay off 500 employees. It’s a move that Armstrong said would have happened regardless of the Yahoo deal and was instead the result of a string of deals that AOL has made to acquire smaller companies since it was bought by Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion. He said those cuts should carry AOL through 2017 but added that “we’ve said there will be synergies when we did the deal” for Yahoo.\nArmstrong spoke at the conference ahead of Arianna Huffington, who just recently left her post at AOL as president of The Huffington Post Media Group to launch wellness startup Thrive Global. When asked about The Huffington Post’s treatment of the 2016 presidential election – the website appended an editor’s note to stories about Donald Trump that included describing him as a “serial liar,” “racist” and “misogynist” – Armstrong called the coverage “differentiated and bold.”",

      "title": "Verizon’s Wireless TV And Internet Service Coming To Small Towns Soon",
      "text": "Verizon is getting close to its first large scale trials of a high-speed wireless video service to compete with cable television.\nThe company will roll out the service, which is based on the upcoming 5G wireless standard, in several small towns by the end of March, CEO Lowell McAdam said on Tuesday. The goal is to provide high-speed connectivity for TV and Internet service to homes and businesses without needing to run fiber optic lines to every customer.\n“We won’t be charging for the service, but we will be learning from it and figuring out the distance between the transmitter and the receiver in a 5G environment,” McAdam said at a UBS investor conference in New York.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nVerizon has long touted the upcoming 5G standard, which can be up to 100 faster than current 4G wireless service, as the basis for a new cable and Internet service. The 5G technology is needed for Verizon’s six year, $300 million plan to offer TV and Internet in Boston, for example. But McAdam had not previously given the early 2017 timeline and additional details about Verizon’s efforts.\nThe carrier is looking for ways to save money and crack new markets as growth in its two main lines of business, wired and wireless phone service, have slowed. In addition to 5G video service, McAdam has also targeted service for smart, connected devices in the Internet of things and online advertising, via the acquisition of AOL and pending purchase of Yahoo.\nVerizon’s Fios unit, which offers TV and Internet service, largely ceased expanding years ago because of the expense of building fiber optic lines to customers.\nFor more on the Yahoo deal delay, watch: \nBut the 5G wireless plan could dramatically reduce those costs. A customer would only need a typical router placed by a window to receive signals for Internet and TV service from a neighborhood-based cell tower. Verizon vz has even discussed deploying more numerous microcells, with new technology that can put a 5G transmitter inside a street light, for example.\n“This will allow you to stop anywhere from 200 feet to 1,000 feet, somewhere in that range, we think, from the home and then make it a wireless last leg into the home,” McAdam explained. “And I think that is going to be the predominant architecture for wireless service going forward.”",

      "text": "Verizon begins offering Fios in first Boston neighborhoods as revolutionary citywide fiber-optic rollout gets underway [December 06, 2016] Tweet \nBOSTON , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon today announced the first availability of Fios Internet, TV and phone services in several Boston neighborhoods, which residents can order by visiting www.verizon.com/BostonFios . \nFios is debuting just eight months after the company outlined a $300 million investment to build a fiber-optic network platform across Boston over the next six years. Capable of powering wired broadband, advanced wireless services, smart community solutions and future innovation, Verizon's new 100% fiber-optic network platform will transform Boston's technology infrastructure and bring competition and new choices to residents and businesses. \nBeginning today Fios Internet, TV and phone are available to order in parts of Dorchester , Roslindale and West Roxbury . Residents in these first neighborhoods can visit www.verizon.com/BostonFios to check Fios availability at their specific address. \nAs previously announced , Verizon also plans to bring Fios Internet, TV and phone service to Roxbury's Dudley Square Innovation District before year's end. Expansion will continue street-by-street, week-by-week, in Dorchester , Roslindale , West Roxbury and parts of Roxbury in 2017. \nView from Verizon \n\"Just eight months ago we announced that Fios was coming,\" said Ken Dixon , leader of Verizon's consumer landline business. \"This speedy launch is only possible because of the cooperation and partnership between the City of Boston and Verizon at every level. The winners are Boston residents.\" \nSince April's announcement Verizon has placed more than 160 miles of fiber-optic wiring throughout Boston including large-capacity 'feeder' lines above and underneath city streets to prepare for eventually connecting fiber-optic lines directly to homes and businesses that order Fios service. \n\"Beginning today Verizon brings Fios, competition and choice to the first neighborhoods of Boston ,\" Dixon said. \"By the end of December, more than 25,000 addresses will be able toorder Fios. Unlike cable, Fios provides a 100% fiber-optic network to your home or business.\" \nFios is not cable…We are wired differently. \nVerizon Fios uses a 100% fiber-optic network that provides equal upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, making it the fastest internet and Wi-Fi available + . With innovative Fios TV service, customers can enjoy crystal-clear HD picture quality. Fios Triple Play bundles, featuring 150/150 Mbps internet, Custom TV and phone begin at $79.99* per month online. \nFios is the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. Fios Internet is rated highest in customer satisfaction in the East Region by J.D. Power four years running, and rated #1 in Internet Speed for 10 years running by PC Magazine. \nFiber-optics helping Boston's streets get smarter \nIn November Verizon and the City of Boston reached an agreement to conduct a trial of smart communities solutions at the intersection of Mass Ave & Beacon Street. Construction is currently underway to install new traffic signals, lighting and video solutions which, for the first time, will work together to provide integrated data to city planners and engineers via Verizon's fiber-optic network. This 'proof-of-concept' pilot is expected to become operational later this year and is designed to help the City better inform and engage with its constituents. \nVerizon's continued commitment to Boston \nVerizon has made a commitment to donate $100,000 to Boston Public Library in support of a new Wi-Fi Hotspot Lending program. The two-year pilot focuses on making 100 hotspots available to library patrons, increasing access to the Internet and other online services. This grant to BPL is in addition to more than $200,000 that Verizon invested in Boston -area schools and non-profits in 2016 supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, including: The Community Academy of Science and Health , Boston Adult Technical Academy, and Urban Science Academy - to host the Verizon Innovative Design Thinking Academy which trains high school teachers to engage students to develop mobile apps or websites for small businesses and community nonprofits The Boston Private Industry Council - towards 'Classroom in the Workplace' which expands STEM career awareness and academic programming for Boston public high school students The Roxbury Innovation Center/Venture Café - to further youth entrepreneurship and STEM programs for children ages 7 – 17 living in Boston Public Housing Camp Harborview's Knowledge Is Power - curriculum which includes environmental science, healthy lifestyles, STEM and career education to summer campers in grades K – 10 Boston Partners in Education - to fund development of a world-class STEM education for 300 students at the Dearborn STEM Academy in Dorchester Generations Inc. - supporting twelve highly-trained tutors within the Lyndon K-8 School in West Roxbury to provide support to all K-2nd grade students \nMore information regarding the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network build across Boston is available at www.verizon.com/BostonFios . Explore the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network platform in Boston in this video, Wiring Boston for the future , at https://youtu.be/33HdgGLQJ6g . \n+ Symmetrical speed options available up to 500/500 Mbps.

      "text": "\nSamsung will proceed with its Android 7.0 Nougat beta test for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge , but apparently it will continue without the many Verizon owners of those phones. The carrier has reportedly sent messages to Galaxy Beta app users, informing them that their phones will “stay on the original software for the remainder of [the] trial.”\nSee also: This is Nougat on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 1 week ago What exactly does that mean for Big Red users currently enrolled in the beta program? Well, if and when Samsung releases another Nougat beta build for those phones, they will not be accessible to Verizon owners. They can choose to stick with the current Nougat beta build that have already installed, or they have the option to roll back to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow . Verizon owners will have to wait until sometime early next year before the official Nougat update begins rolling out for those phones.\nAgain, this change affects only Verizon customers with the Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge. People who have those phones on other networks can get the latest Nougat beta if they have an active Samsung account , and if they install the Galaxy Beta Program app from Samsung’s Galaxy Apps store.\nIf you are a Verizon subscriber, how do you feel about your carrier ending the Nougat beta for the Galaxy S7 ahead of schedule?",

      "title": "Partners Applaud Verizon's $3.6B Data Center Sale To Channel-Friendly Equinix",
      "text": "last » \nVerizon on Tuesday said it would sell its cloud hosting and data center business to global data center operator Equinix for $3.6 billion, following a year of speculation that the carrier was considering leaving the business of running data centers. Partners say that refocusing on its core offerings, while selling its data center assets to a channel-friendly, global data center provider is the right move. \nVia the terms of the deal, Equinix will take over ownership and management of 24 Verizon data centers sites, including 22 sites in the U.S. and two in Latin America. By offloading the data center operations, Verizon could be freed up to double down on its connectivity services, said J.R. Vernick, co-founder of Clinton, N.J.-based RDS Solutions, a telecommunications solution provider who partners with both Verizon and Equinix. \n\"Equinix used to not be too channel-friendly, but they are now. As an Equinix partner, now they even have more availability, so we definitely don't see this as an option lost,\" Vernick said. \n[Related: Verizon Gets Out Of Data Center Business, Sells Latin, North American Assets To Equinix For $3.6B ] \nVerizon's sale of its data centers to Equinox makes sense because data center services have not been core to Verizon's portfolio, said Michael Wolfington, vice president of West partner sales for Kingcom, a Portland, Ore.-based national Verizon platinum partner. \nVerizon's co-location services that it acquired when it bought Terremark in 2011 have struggled to gather traction within the channel community, Wolfington added. \n\"This will now free up further capital to invest in areas Verizon knows will excel. Particularly, the SMB marketplace with the emergence of 5G LTE coming down the pipe. Smart cities will [also] create a rapid revenue stream as business owners nationwide will have affordable, reliable and efficient options beyond cable,\" Wolfington said. \nAccording to Verizon, the two companies are moving forward together and are working on a joint marketing agreement in which both providers will market each other’s services. Verizon and Equinix will offer solutions for business customers based on the newly-combined product portfolios, a Verizon spokesperson said. \n\"Verizon’s sale of its co-location data centers is consistent with the company’s strategic focus. The sale will enable Verizon to invest our resources in areas that will help drive digital transformation for enterprise customers,\" the spokesperson said. \nVerizon is one of the last of the incumbent carriers to relinquish its cloud hosting and data center strategies. In November CenturyLink announced plans to sell off its data centers and co-location business for $2.15 billion to a group of investors advised by investment firm BC Partners. Little Rock, Ark.-based provider Windstream also sold off its data center operations to co-location provider TierPoint for $575 million in 2015. \nWhile there's always uncertainly following an acquisition, RDS' Vernick doesn't believe the deal will create any issues for business customers using Verizon's co-location services.

The carrier confirmed that the Android Nougat update for these two smartphones will be launched early next year. Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team So, if you're a Verizon customers who got into beta you already know that you won't be getting Android Nougat on your Galaxy S7/S7 edge. If you're not a member of the beta, consider yourself informed about the next major Android update for these two devices, which won't be arriving until 2017. The reasons behind Verizon's decision to cancel the release of Android Nougat to the Galaxy S7 /S7 edge this year is unknown, but not unexpected. Samsung and Big Red don't have a good relation.

      "text": "  15:54 PM EST Verizon begins offering Fios in first Boston neighborhoods as revolutionary citywide fiber-optic rollout gets underway \nBOSTON , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon today announced the first availability of Fios Internet, TV and phone services in several Boston neighborhoods, which residents can order by visiting www.verizon.com/BostonFios . \nFios is debuting just eight months after the company outlined a $300 million investment to build a fiber-optic network platform across Boston over the next six years. Capable of powering wired broadband, advanced wireless services, smart community solutions and future innovation, Verizon's new 100% fiber-optic network platform will transform Boston's technology infrastructure and bring competition and new choices to residents and businesses. \nBeginning today Fios Internet, TV and phone are available to order in parts of Dorchester , Roslindale and West Roxbury . Residents in these first neighborhoods can visit www.verizon.com/BostonFios to check Fios availability at their specific address. \nAs previously announced , Verizon also plans to bring Fios Internet, TV and phone service to Roxbury's Dudley Square Innovation District before year's end. Expansion will continue street-by-street, week-by-week, in Dorchester , Roslindale , West Roxbury and parts of Roxbury in 2017. \nView from Verizon \n\"Just eight months ago we announced that Fios was coming,\" said Ken Dixon , leader of Verizon's consumer landline business. \"This speedy launch is only possible because of the cooperation and partnership between the City of Boston and Verizon at every level. The winners are Boston residents.\" \nSince April's announcement Verizon has placed more than 160 miles of fiber-optic wiring throughout Boston including large-capacity 'feeder' lines above and underneath city streets to prepare for eventually connecting fiber-optic lines directly to homes and businesses that order Fios service. \n\"Beginning today Verizon brings Fios, competition and choice to the first neighborhoods of Boston ,\" Dixon said. \"By the end of December, more than 25,000 addresses will be able to order Fios. Unlike cable, Fios provides a 100% fiber-optic network to your home or business.\" \nFios is not cable…We are wired differently. \nVerizon Fios uses a 100% fiber-optic network that provides equal upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, making it the fastest internet and Wi-Fi available + . With innovative Fios TV service, customers can enjoy crystal-clear HD picture quality. Fios Triple Play bundles, featuring 150/150 Mbps internet, Custom TV and phone begin at $79.99* per month online. \nFios is the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. Fios Internet is rated highest in customer satisfaction in the East Region by J.D. Power four years running, and rated #1 in Internet Speed for 10 years running by PC Magazine. \nFiber-optics helping Boston's streets get smarter \nIn November Verizon and the City of Boston reached an agreement to conduct a trial of smart communities solutions at the intersection of Mass Ave & Beacon Street. Construction is currently underway to install new traffic signals, lighting and video solutions which, for the first time, will work together to provide integrated data to city planners and engineers via Verizon's fiber-optic network. This 'proof-of-concept' pilot is expected to become operational later this year and is designed to help the City better inform and engage with its constituents. \nVerizon's continued commitment to Boston \nVerizon has made a commitment to donate $100,000 to Boston Public Library in support of a new Wi-Fi Hotspot Lending program. The two-year pilot focuses on making 100 hotspots available to library patrons, increasing access to the Internet and other online services. This grant to BPL is in addition to more than $200,000 that Verizon invested in Boston -area schools and non-profits in 2016 supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, including: The Community Academy of Science and Health , Boston Adult Technical Academy, and Urban Science Academy - to host the Verizon Innovative Design Thinking Academy which trains high school teachers to engage students to develop mobile apps or websites for small businesses and community nonprofits The Boston Private Industry Council - towards 'Classroom in the Workplace' which expands STEM career awareness and academic programming for Boston public high school students The Roxbury Innovation Center/Venture Café - to further youth entrepreneurship and STEM programs for children ages 7 – 17 living in Boston Public Housing Camp Harborview's Knowledge Is Power - curriculum which includes environmental science, healthy lifestyles, STEM and career education to summer campers in grades K – 10 Boston Partners in Education - to fund development of a world-class STEM education for 300 students at the Dearborn STEM Academy in Dorchester Generations Inc. - supporting twelve highly-trained tutors within the Lyndon K-8 School in West Roxbury to provide support to all K-2nd grade students \nMore information regarding the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network build across Boston is available at www.verizon.com/BostonFios .

      "text": "Enlarge | Buy This Image \nNEW YORK — Wall Street climbed today as telecom stalwarts AT&T and Verizon gained and bank shares added to their torrid post-election rally, helping the Dow set another record closing high. \nThe S&P financial sector rose nearly 1 percent, lifted by a 2.2 percent gain for Wells Fargo. The bank's chief executive told an investor conference it will see a near-term profit hit because of the sharp rise in interest rates, but will benefit in the longer term from rising rates. \nRELATED: Searchable stock index \nBank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also ended higher. \nFinancials have climbed more than 15 percent since the Nov. 8 election and are seen as one of the sectors particularly benefiting as President-elect Donald Trump seeks to pass economic stimulus and reduce corporate taxes and regulations. \nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates next week, in another boost for banks. \nFinancials in general are “benefiting from the feeling that interest rates are done going down and we are going to see a much more favorable interest rate and spread environment for financials,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 19,251.78, the S&P 500 gained 7.52 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,212.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.11 points, or 0.45 percent, to 5,333.00. \nEquities are also gaining support from recent positive economic data and corporate results from S&P 500 companies, which in the third quarter were poised to snap a streak of quarterly profit declines, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \n“It looks like we are leaving the earnings recession and we have entered a period of earnings growth that I think can support the higher prices that we're seeing,” Carlson said. \nAT&T shares rose 1.9 percent. The company said its new streaming television service DirectTV Now has so far exceeded expectations. \nVerizon shares climbed 1.2 percent. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier is selling 29 data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion. \nVerizon also helped boost the Dow, which has outperformed other major indexes and notched a series of fresh record highs since the election as investors pile into financials and industrial stocks. \nTrump's market influence was seen on Tuesday as Boeing shares fell after he tweeted that the government should cancel an order with the plane maker to develop a revamped Air Force One. Boeing shares recovered initial losses and ended marginally positive. \nTrump's announcement that Japanese telecoms and internet firm SoftBank agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States also rippled through markets, with Sprint shares rising 1.5 percent and T-Mobile gaining 1.8 percent. \nIn other corporate news, Nike fell 2.5 percent after Cowen & Co downgraded the shoe and apparel maker's shares to \"market perform.” \nAbout 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 294 new highs and 21 new lows.

      "text": "Verizon to install FiOS service in Boston tomorrow Jordan Graham Tuesday, December 06, 2016 comments Verizon will begin installing its high-speed FiOS internet service in Boston tomorrow after the city approved a license allowing the company to begin operating in the city.\n“Boston will continue to grow and thrive, and Boston’s residents need fast, reliable communications services built on the latest technologies,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “I look forward to working with Verizon to bring more choice and upgraded technology to Boston’s residents and businesses.”\nToday, Walsh signed a license that is required for cable television providers, the last obstacle to offering service. Boston has no authority to regulate internet service, but Verizon plans to offer television and internet through the same installations.\nIn parts of Roslindale, Dorchester and West Roxbury, Verizon technicians will begin installing the internet and television service. The company said it has already installed 160 miles of fiber optic cable in Boston, enough to install in 25,000 homes right now.\nMore parts of those neighborhoods will be available next year, with other parts of the city coming online later. Verizon has said it will spend $300 million to wire the entire city with FiOS.\n“This shows what’s possible when the public and private sector are both willing to try a new approach to deploying fiber-optic technology,” said Bob Mudge, executive vice president for Strategic Initiatives at Verizon.\nFiOS - Verizon’s fiber optic internet and television offering - is a service that has long been sought after by Boston and other cities for not only its product but also for its ability to bring competition to an internet and cable television market. In Boston, much of the city is only served by Comcast.\nBoston has focused on increasing internet access and affordability in Boston, including by hiring its first ever digital equity advocate. Verizon will also fund a wireless hotspot lending program at the Boston Public Library.",

      "text": "Arianna Huffington Amy Sussman \nAOL chief executive officer Tim Armstrong is “cautiously optimistic” that the deal between Verizon and Yahoo will go through, he said Monday during Business Insider’s Ignition conference. Last July, AOL parent company Verizon revealed that it would buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion, but the sale was no longer seen as a sure thing after the Internet company’s fall disclosure that it had suffered a massive data breach. \nAlthough Armstrong declined to quantify his optimism with a percentage, he said it was more likely to happen than not. But considering that the deal stalled in October, anything Armstrong said about it was guaranteed to be big news. \nArmstrong also hinted that there may be layoffs — or rather, “synergies,” as he euphemistically referred to them — in store for Yahoo should his cautious optimism prove warranted. Yahoo ceo Marissa Mayer , he seemed to suggest, would most likely stay on at the company to “play a role in getting Yahoo to its next iteration.” \nThe AOL ceo was similarly circumspect when asked about the way that The Huffington Post , another AOL-owned property, covered the candidacy of now President-elect Donald Trump. The left-leaning media company initially confined coverage of the former reality star to its entertainment section. As the election progressed and coverage of Trump could no longer be classified as entertainment, Huffington Post instituted a policy of including a disclaimer to remind readers of objections to Trump’s rhetoric. \nAccording to Armstrong, he never weighed in on HuffPo’s editorial strategy, which he called “bold,”“differentiated” and “interesting.” \nArianna Huffington , who left her namesake company in August to focus on preaching the benefits of sleep through Thrive Global, took the stage after Armstrong. \n“ You’ve always been an inspiration as a media mogul,” Business Insider cofounder and ceo Henry Blodget said, by way of introduction. “Now I understand that you are trying to sell me pillows.” \nIn fact, Huffington is trying to sell way more than just pillows — everything from $10,000 nap pods designed for the office to pajamas to an audiobook, written and narrated by Huffington, called “ Good Night Smartphone” are for sale on Thrive’s e-commerce platform. \nHuffington explained that our dependence on technology means “we need to disconnect” more than ever — which is why she has created a charging station that looks like a bed for cell phones . Tucking your cell phone into its own bed, under its own covers, Huffington said, should be part of every family’s nighttime ritual. \n“My children are not idiots. Will they accept this?” Blodget asked. \nHuffington promised she would send him a bed to test it out. According to Huffington, Trump exhibits the classic symptoms of sleep deprivation. \n“To me, convincing Donald Trump he has to sleep at night will be a tremendous part of national security,” Huffington said. “In fact, I’m sending him a phone bed tomorrow!”",

Capable of powering wired broadband, advanced wireless services, smart community solutions and future innovation, Verizon’s new 100% fiber-optic network platform will transform Boston’s technology infrastructure and bring competition and new choices to residents and businesses. \nBeginning today Fios Internet, TV and phone are available to order in parts of Dorchester, Roslindale and West Roxbury. Residents in these first neighborhoods can go online to check Fios availability at their specific address. \nAs previously announced , Verizon also plans to bring Fios Internet, TV and phone service to Roxbury’s Dudley Square Innovation District before year’s end. Expansion will continue street-by-street, week-by-week, in Dorchester, Roslindale, West Roxbury and parts of Roxbury in 2017. View from Verizon \n“Just eight months ago we announced that Fios was coming,” said Ken Dixon, leader of Verizon’s consumer landline business. “This speedy launch is only possible because of the cooperation and partnership between the City of Boston and Verizon at every level. The winners are Boston residents.” \nSince April’s announcement Verizon has placed more than 160 miles of fiber-optic wiring throughout Boston including large-capacity ‘feeder’ lines above and underneath city streets to prepare for eventually connecting fiber-optic lines directly to homes and businesses that order Fios service. \n“Beginning today Verizon brings Fios, competition and choice to the first neighborhoods of Boston,” Dixon said. “By the end of December, more than 25,000 addresses will be able to order Fios. Unlike cable, Fios provides a 100% fiber-optic network to your home or business.” Fios is not cable…we are wired differently \nVerizon Fios uses a 100% fiber-optic network that provides equal upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, making it the fastest internet and Wi-Fi available+. With innovative Fios TV service, customers can enjoy crystal-clear HD picture quality. Fios Triple Play bundles, featuring 150/150 Mbps internet, Custom TV and phone begin at $79.99* per month online. \nFios is the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. Fios Internet is rated highest in customer satisfaction in the East Region by J.D. Power four years running, and rated #1 in Internet Speed for 10 years running by PC Magazine. Fiber-optics helping Boston’s streets get smarter \nIn November Verizon and the City of Boston reached an agreement to conduct a trial of smart communities solutions at the intersection of Mass Ave & Beacon Street. Construction is currently underway to install new traffic signals, lighting and video solutions which, for the first time, will work together to provide integrated data to city planners and engineers via Verizon’s fiber-optic network. This ‘proof-of-concept’ pilot is expected to become operational later this year and is designed to help the City better inform and engage with its constituents. Video of Wiring Boston for the future: Explore the start of Verizon&#039;s fiber-optic network platform in Boston Verizon’s continued commitment to Boston \nVerizon has made a commitment to donate $100,000 to Boston Public Library in support of a new Wi-Fi Hotspot Lending program. The two-year pilot focuses on making 100 hotspots available to library patrons, increasing access to the Internet and other online services. This grant to BPL is in addition to more than $200,000 that Verizon invested in Boston-area schools and non-profits in 2016 supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, including: The Community Academy of Science and Health, Boston Adult Technical Academy, and Urban Science Academy - to host the Verizon Innovative Design Thinking Academy which trains high school teachers to engage students to develop mobile apps or websites for small businesses and community nonprofits T he Boston Private Industry Council - towards ‘Classroom in the Workplace’ which expands STEM career awareness and academic programming for Boston public high school students The Roxbury Innovation Center/Venture Café - to further youth entrepreneurship and STEM programs for children ages 7 – 17 living in Boston Public Housing Camp Harborview’s Knowledge Is Power - curriculum which includes environmental science, healthy lifestyles, STEM and career education to summer campers in grades K – 10 Boston Partners in Education - to fund development of a world-class STEM education for 300 students at the Dearborn STEM Academy in Dorchester Generations Inc. - supporting twelve highly-trained tutors within the Lyndon K-8 School in West Roxbury to provide support to all K-2nd grade students \nExplore the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network platform in Boston in this video, Wiring Boston for the future . \n+Symmetrical speed options available up to 500/500 Mbps.

      "text": "Best Buy Offers 32-Inch LG Smart TV With LG G5 Or LG V20 On Sprint Or Verizon 6 December 2016, 6:54 pm EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Top 5 Alternatives Now Playing Best Buy has a new promo in store, offering a free 32-inch LG Smart TV with the purchase and activation of an LG G5 or LG V20 on Sprint or Verizon. The LG G5 also comes with additional freebies besides the smart TV. ( Best Buy ) Advertisement \nBest Buy has kicked off an attractive new deal for LG fans, offering a free 32-inch LG smart TV with the LG V20 or LG G5 on Sprint or Verizon. \nFor those who were already planning on buying one of LG's highest-end smartphones, this deal could be a great fit. \nBoth the LG G5 and the more recent LG V20 are powerful smartphones able to handle virtually any task you throw at them and they're among the best Android smartphones of 2016 . Free LG Smart TV \nBest Buy is now sweetening the deal by throwing in a free 32-inch LG LED 720p Smart TV with either the LG G5 or the LG V20. To take advantage of this deal, customers have to buy and activate their preferred LG smartphone with either Sprint or Verizon Wireless. \nThe fine print reveals that the offer also requires customers to purchase the LG G5 or LG V20 on Sprint's 24-month installment, Verizon Device Payment, or a two-year contract. \nWhen these terms and conditions are met, Best Buy will automatically add the free LG Smart TV to your cart along with the LG V20 or LG G5. LG G5 Extra Freebies \nWhile the LG G5 is not as powerful as the LG V20 , it comes with more treats from Best Buy. In addition to the 32-inch LG TV, the retailer is also throwing in a free accessory bundle consisting of an extra battery, an additional USB Type-C cable and a charging cradle. The three-piece accessory bundle is not available for the LG V20 purchase. \nAs a refresher, the LG G5 sports a 5.3-inch QHD display (2,560 x 1,440 pixels), a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 2,800 mAh battery (removable) and offers customization options via modular extensions called LG G5 Friends . The Sprint LG G5 has already started getting Android 7.0 Nougat . \nThe LG V20 , meanwhile, rocks a larger 5.7-inch QHD display (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) and a secondary screen at the top for quick access to apps, notifications and shortcuts. Other specs include a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB of RAM, among the highlights. The LG V20 also launched as the first non-Nexus/Pixel device to run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. \nBest Buy doesn't mention when its free LG TV deal will expire, but the offer may not be available for long. To take advantage of this deal, head over to Best Buy's website and shop LG smartphones included in this promotion.  ",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson December 6, 2016, 4:50 pm \nThe # Samsung # GalaxyS7edge is now selling on eBay for just $424.95 . This smartphone is only compatible with Verizon’s networks, though, so the compatibility list is very limited here. But barring this one caveat, the Galaxy S7 edge is a fairly attractive offering to own for the cost mentioned here. The handset is available in Black, Silver and Gold color variants. \nThe Galaxy S7 edge comes with 5.5-inch Quad HD dual-edge Super AMOLED display, a 12-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front camera, the quad-core Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, Android 6.0 Marshmallow (upgradable to Nougat), and a 3,600 mAh battery. The device also comes with IP68 certified water and dust resistance. As you can see, the Galaxy S7 edge is a flagship offering and will remain the company’s top flagship until the Galaxy S8 surfaces sometime next year. \nBut given that this is an in-demand product, we expect the stocks to run out quickly. Keeping this in mind, you should proceed with haste if you’re interested.",

      "title": "Verizon selling data centers to Equinix for $3.6B",
      "text": "Verizon selling data centers to Equinix for $3.6B By SCOTT MORITZ NSD ALEX SHERMAN Bloomberg news First Published 7 minutes ago • Updated 7 minutes ago Share This Article Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to sell its data-centers business to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion in cash as the company turns its focus to mobile video advertising. The deal includes 24 facilities across 15 metropolitan markets, according to a statement Tuesday. Equinix, based in Redwood City, Calif., operates as a real estate investment trust, mostly holding interconnected data centers. With the deal, Equinix now has 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world. For Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier, the deal marks a retreat from the data-centers business five years after it bought Terremark Worldwide Inc. for $1.3 billion. VIDEOS TOP JOBS As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago. As the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL's web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook. The sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon's cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. Shares of Verizon rose as much as 1.8 percent to $50.62 in New York Tuesday. Equinix climbed 3.2 percent to $342.81. After the deal, which includes sites in the U.S., Brazil and Colombia, Verizon will still offer data-center services using Equinix as a partner. Verizon's advisers were Citigroup and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.",

      "text": "News Feed Item Verizon begins offering Fios in first Boston neighborhoods as revolutionary citywide fiber-optic rollout gets underway Fios Internet, TV and phone services available for order beginning today in parts of Dorchester, Roslindale and West Roxbury; transformational six-year rollout of new fiber-optic network underway December 6, 2016 03:55 PM EST Blog This \nBOSTON , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon today announced the first availability of Fios Internet, TV and phone services in several Boston neighborhoods, which residents can order by visiting www.verizon.com/BostonFios . \nFios is debuting just eight months after the company outlined a $300 million investment to build a fiber-optic network platform across Boston over the next six years. Capable of powering wired broadband, advanced wireless services, smart community solutions and future innovation, Verizon's new 100% fiber-optic network platform will transform Boston's technology infrastructure and bring competition and new choices to residents and businesses. \nBeginning today Fios Internet, TV and phone are available to order in parts of Dorchester , Roslindale and West Roxbury . Residents in these first neighborhoods can visit www.verizon.com/BostonFios to check Fios availability at their specific address. \nAs previously announced , Verizon also plans to bring Fios Internet, TV and phone service to Roxbury's Dudley Square Innovation District before year's end. Expansion will continue street-by-street, week-by-week, in Dorchester , Roslindale , West Roxbury and parts of Roxbury in 2017. \nView from Verizon \n\"Just eight months ago we announced that Fios was coming,\" said Ken Dixon , leader of Verizon's consumer landline business. \"This speedy launch is only possible because of the cooperation and partnership between the City of Boston and Verizon at every level. The winners are Boston residents.\" \nSince April's announcement Verizon has placed more than 160 miles of fiber-optic wiring throughout Boston including large-capacity 'feeder' lines above and underneath city streets to prepare for eventually connecting fiber-optic lines directly to homes and businesses that order Fios service. \n\"Beginning today Verizon brings Fios, competition and choice to the first neighborhoods of Boston ,\" Dixon said. \"By the end of December, more than 25,000 addresses will be able to order Fios. Unlike cable, Fios provides a 100% fiber-optic network to your home or business.\" \nFios is not cable…We are wired differently. \nVerizon Fios uses a 100% fiber-optic network that provides equal upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, making it the fastest internet and Wi-Fi available + . With innovative Fios TV service, customers can enjoy crystal-clear HD picture quality. Fios Triple Play bundles, featuring 150/150 Mbps internet, Custom TV and phone begin at $79.99* per month online. \nFios is the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. Fios Internet is rated highest in customer satisfaction in the East Region by J.D. Power four years running, and rated #1 in Internet Speed for 10 years running by PC Magazine. \nFiber-optics helping Boston's streets get smarter \nIn November Verizon and the City of Boston reached an agreement to conduct a trial of smart communities solutions at the intersection of Mass Ave & Beacon Street. Construction is currently underway to install new traffic signals, lighting and video solutions which, for the first time, will work together to provide integrated data to city planners and engineers via Verizon's fiber-optic network. This 'proof-of-concept' pilot is expected to become operational later this year and is designed to help the City better inform and engage with its constituents. \nVerizon's continued commitment to Boston \nVerizon has made a commitment to donate $100,000 to Boston Public Library in support of a new Wi-Fi Hotspot Lending program. The two-year pilot focuses on making 100 hotspots available to library patrons, increasing access to the Internet and other online services. This grant to BPL is in addition to more than $200,000 that Verizon invested in Boston -area schools and non-profits in 2016 supporting STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, including: The Community Academy of Science and Health , Boston Adult Technical Academy, and Urban Science Academy - to host the Verizon Innovative Design Thinking Academy which trains high school teachers to engage students to develop mobile apps or websites for small businesses and community nonprofits The Boston Private Industry Council - towards 'Classroom in the Workplace' which expands STEM career awareness and academic programming for Boston public high school students The Roxbury Innovation Center/Venture Café - to further youth entrepreneurship and STEM programs for children ages 7 – 17 living in Boston Public Housing Camp Harborview's Knowledge Is Power - curriculum which includes environmental science, healthy lifestyles, STEM and career education to summer campers in grades K – 10 Boston Partners in Education - to fund development of a world-class STEM education for 300 students at the Dearborn STEM Academy in Dorchester Generations Inc. - supporting twelve highly-trained tutors within the Lyndon K-8 School in West Roxbury to provide support to all K-2nd grade students \nMore information regarding the start of Verizon's fiber-optic network build across Boston is available at www.verizon.com/BostonFios .

      "title": "Equinix to Acquire Portfolio of 24 Data Center Sites from Verizon in $3.6 Billion Deal",
      "text": " Equinix, Inc.\nDeal Further Strengthens Equinix's Global Platform; Expands Breadth and Depth of Interconnection Portfolio\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. , Dec. 6, Equinix, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQIX), the global interconnection and data center company, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a portfolio of 24 data center sites and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) for $3.6 billion in an all cash transaction. The 24 sites consist of 29 data center buildings across 15 metro areas. The addition of these strategic facilities and customers will further strengthen Equinix's global platform by: increasing interconnection in the U.S. and Latin America ; opening three new markets in Bogotá, Culpeper and Houston ; and accelerating Equinix's penetration of the enterprise and strategic market sectors, including government and energy.\nThe acquisition of these assets will enable Equinix customers to further respond to a key market trend that is enabling their evolution from traditional businesses to \"digital businesses\" -- the need to globally interconnect with people, locations, cloud services and data. Additionally, customers will have the opportunity to operate on an expanded global platform to process, store and distribute larger volumes of latency sensitive data and applications at the digital edge, closer to end-users and local markets.\nThe acquired portfolio includes approximately 900 customers, with a significant number of enterprise customers new to Equinix's platform, and it adds approximately 2.4 million gross square feet. It will bring Equinix's total global footprint to 175 data centers in 43 markets and approximately 17 million gross square feet across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific markets.\nThe transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nHighlights / Key Facts\nThe transaction includes 29 data center buildings across 24 sites in 15 metro areas, including Atlanta ( Atlanta and Norcross ), Bogotá, Boston ( Billerica ), Chicago ( Westmont ), Culpeper , Dallas ( Irving , Richardson -Alma and Richardson-Pkwy), Denver (Englewood) , Houston , Los Angeles ( Torrance ), Miami ( Miami and Doral ), New York (Carteret, Elmsford and Piscataway), São Paulo, Seattle ( Kent ), Silicon Valley ( Santa Clara and San Jose ), and Washington, D.C. ( Ashburn , Manassas and Herndon ). The addition of the new data center assets will greatly expand Equinix's global platform for enterprises by adding new markets and Fortune 1000 enterprise customers. It expands capacity in existing markets, such as Atlanta , Denver, Miami , New York , São Paulo, Seattle and Silicon Valley, and it provides a platform for the future expansion of the acquired data centers. The NAP (Network Access Point) of the Americas facility in Miami is a key interconnection point and will become a strategic hub and gateway for Equinix customer deployments servicing Latin America . Combined with the Verizon data centers in Bogotá and the NAP do Brasil in São Paulo, it will strategically position Equinix in the growing Latin American market. The NAP of the Capital Region in Culpeper, VA is a highly secure campus focused on government agency customers, strengthening Equinix as a platform of choice for government services and service providers. Approximately 250 Verizon employees, primarily in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Quote: s\nSteve Smith , President and CEO, Equinix:\n\"This unique opportunity complements and extends Equinix's strategy to expand our global platform. It enables us to enhance cloud and network density to continue to attract enterprises, while expanding our presence in the Americas. The new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros. The deal will also provide significant value for shareholders as the proposed transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to our adjusted funds from operations per share upon close.\"\nKarl Strohmeyer , President, Americas, Equinix:\n\"This deal is a significant win for our existing customers, who will gain access to new locations, ecosystems and partners. It is also a win for the new companies joining Equinix, as they will be able to leverage Equinix's global footprint and unique interconnection services.

Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the failure of one or more conditions to the acquisition of data centers from Verizon to be satisfied; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that would compromise our ability to complete the acquisition of such data centers from Verizon within the expected timeframe or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the proposed acquisition cannot be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of data centers or companies we have acquired or will acquire into Equinix, including the data centers we may acquire from Verizon; the challenges of acquiring, operating and constructing IBX centers and developing, deploying and delivering Equinix services, including in the Verizon data centers; a failure to receive significant revenue from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers, including those acquired from Verizon; failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time; competition from existing and new competitors; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness; the loss or decline in business from our key customers; and other risks described from time to time in Equinix's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on Equinix.

      "title": "Verizon will sell 29 data centers worth $3.6 billion to Equinix",
      "text": "Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo.\nThe sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.\nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp, which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions – it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year.\nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas.\n“We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time …(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.\nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.\nReuters \nThe post Verizon will sell 29 data centers worth $3.6 billion to Equinix appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n(Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Tuesday as telecom stalwarts AT&T and Verizon gained and bank shares added to their torrid post-election rally, helping the Dow set another record closing high.\nThe S&P financial sector <.SPSY> rose nearly 1 percent, lifted by a 2.2 percent gain for Wells Fargo <WFC.N>. The bank's chief executive told an investor conference it will see a near-term profit hit because of the sharp rise in interest rates, but will benefit in the longer term from rising rates.\nBank of America <BAC.N>, Citigroup <C.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> also ended higher.\nFinancials have climbed more than 15 percent since the Nov. 8 election and are seen as one of the sectors particularly benefiting as President-elect Donald Trump seeks to pass economic stimulus and reduce corporate taxes and regulations.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates next week, in another boost for banks.\nFinancials in general are \"benefiting from the feeling that interest rates are done going down and we are going to see a much more favorable interest rate and spread environment for financials,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 35.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 19,251.78, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 7.52 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,212.23 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 24.11 points, or 0.45 percent, to 5,333.00.\nEquities are also gaining support from recent positive economic data and corporate results from S&P 500 companies, which in the third quarter were poised to snap a streak of quarterly profit declines, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.\n\"It looks like we are leaving the earnings recession and we have entered a period of earnings growth that I think can support the higher prices that we’re seeing,\" Carlson said.\nAT&T <T.N> shares rose 1.9 percent. The company said its new streaming television service DirectTV Now has so far exceeded expectations.\nVerizon shares climbed 1.2 percent. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier is selling 29 data centers to Equinix <EQIX.O> for $3.6 billion.\nVerizon also helped boost the Dow, which has outperformed other major indexes and notched a series of fresh record highs since the election as investors pile into financials and industrial stocks.\nTrump's market influence was seen on Tuesday as Boeing <BA.N> shares fell after he tweeted that the government should cancel an order with the plane maker to develop a revamped Air Force One. Boeing shares recovered initial losses and ended marginally positive.\nTrump's announcement that Japanese telecoms and internet firm SoftBank <9984.T> agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States also rippled through markets, with Sprint shares <S.N> rising 1.5 percent and T-Mobile <TMUS.O> gaining 1.8 percent.\nIn other corporate news, Nike <NKE.N> fell 2.5 percent after Cowen & Co downgraded the shoe and apparel maker's shares to \"market perform.\"\nAbout 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 294 new highs and 21 new lows.\n(Additional reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Dan Grebler and James Dalgleish)",

      "text": "(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc <EQIX.O> for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business.\nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo.\nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers.\nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.\nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc <TMUS.N> and Sprint Corp <S.N>, which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.\nVerizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year.\nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets.\nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees.\nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas.\n\"We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,\" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts.\nThe acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets.\nEquinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.\nCiti and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon.\nShares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
