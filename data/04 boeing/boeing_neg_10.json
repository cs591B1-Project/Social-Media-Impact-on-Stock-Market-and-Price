      "text": "By Robert Wall and and Doug Cameron\nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co. (BA) determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules.\nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers.\nThe WTO said the U.S. should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, though the U.S. can appeal the ruling.\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström.\n-Write to Robart wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 28, 2016 10:39 ET (15:39 ",

      "text": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet Reuters 11 hrs ago By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles Boeing 777X: Everything you need to know about the world's biggest passenger airliner International Business Times The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nQuote: s in the article Boeing Co BA\n▼ 149.77 -0.27 -0.18% It is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus.\nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based.\nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.\nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute.\nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel.\nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when.\nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid.\nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received.\nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.\nCONFIDENT ON APPEAL\nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay.\"\nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020.\nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.\nInvestors, too, seemed skeptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market.\n\"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly.\nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned.\nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.\nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter)\nGo to MSN Home",

Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. Get news headlines sent daily   \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "US giving illegal tax subsidy to Boeing, rules WTO   11:02   The World Trade Organisation (WTO) on Monday dealt a huge blow to Boeing Co. by ruling that a special and very low “business and occupation” tax rate granted by the state of Washington to the airliner was unlawful. In 2013, Washington provided Boeing the subsidy asking the company to make wings for its new 777X jetliner — in which more than 400 passengers can seat and is due to enter service around the of 2020 — only there. This provision ensured that Boeing will use only local rather than imported materials, distorting international trade rules. In December 2014, the European Union alleged in the WTO that the tax cut given by the US state was discriminatory and was central to a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers. It alleged that the latest tax cuts to be withdrawn immediately amount to $5.7 billion. However, the US pegged the value at merely $50 million. The WTO said in its ruling on Monday: “The Panel has found that the European Union has demonstrated that the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X programme… is a subsidy contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods [and is] prohibited.” For more than a decade, both the US and the EU have accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to the other’s large commercial airplane maker. “The wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE,” the Wall Street Journal reported. The two aircraft makers previously settled a disagreement in 1992, but the US withdrew from that deal in 2004, saying Airbus had an unfair advantage. The US government is consulting with Washington state to decide how to respond and it remains to be seen if the US would appeal the ruling. However, the WTO asked the US to withdraw the tax relief to Boeing within 90 days. “We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström. Even though Boeing general counsel J. Michael Luttig said the planemaker expected “every aspect” of the Washington state incentives to persevere after any appeal, Boeing said it wouldn’t engage in talks until the EU had come into compliance with WTO rules. According to the WSJ report, “at stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the US and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO’s subsidy concerns are addressed.”",

      "text": "By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (BA.N) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus.\nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based.\nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.\nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute.\nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel.\nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when.\nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid.\nThey also zeroed in on \"programme accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received.\nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.\nCONFIDENT ON APPEAL\nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\".\nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020.\nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.\nInvestors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market.\n\"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly.\nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned.\nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.\nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.",

A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered ... more Photo: Reed Saxon, AP Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US 1 / 1 Back to Gallery GENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. The Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. The WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. The 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. Appearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. The ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale , referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. He said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. For its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" Airbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. The case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. Airbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. ___ ",

      "text": "Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state Updated 4:56 pm, Monday, November 28, 2016 OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state. What happens next isn't entirely clear. The Chicago-based company and the European Union , which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. The WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed. Here is reaction from Washington state officials: —Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement: Three years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is. We will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed. Washington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world. —Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\" \"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said. —Sen. Reuven Carlyle , a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\" He said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\" \"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said. Carlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\" Latest News Video ",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Raf Casert Associated Press November 29, 2016\nGENEVA — US plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nAdvertisement\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to ‘‘prohibited’’ subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on the condition that Boeing keeps production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. But Boeing called that figure excessive and said only ‘‘future incentives’’ of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the US government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,’’ said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a ‘‘conservative estimate’’ and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling ‘‘an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.’’\n‘‘We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,’’ Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the US company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n‘‘Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,’’ Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. ‘‘In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.’’\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, ‘‘and that’s only for the 777X.’’\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support US business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the ‘‘prohibited subsidy’’ involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.",

Kuwait, an ally of Saudi Arabia, is also part of a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\nBoeing, Northrop Grumman Corp, Raytheon Co and General Electric Co are the prime contractors for the proposed sale.\n(Reporting by Ahmed Hagagy and Reem Shamseddine; writing by William Maclean; editing by Mark Heinrich)",

      "text": "Kuwait City (AFP) - Kuwait will buy 28 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets to replace a fleet of earlier versions of the US fighter jets, a top official said Monday.\nThe value of the deal is not expected to exceed $5 billion, the KUNA state news agency reported the head of armament and procurement at Kuwait's defence ministry as saying.\nMajor General Lafi al-Azemi said the deal stipulates the supplier will re-purchase the old Hornet fighter jets from Kuwait.\nThe US State Department this month said it has authorised the deal, as well as the sale of 72 F-15 Strike Eagle jets to Kuwait's Gulf neighbour Qatar at an estimated value of $21 billion.\nIn April, Kuwait signed a contract with Italy's Finmeccanica for the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoon warplanes for under eight billion euros ($8.5 billion).\nKuwait's parliament in March approved spending an additional $500 million as an advance payment for the jets.\nThat funding came on top of $10 billion additional defence spending already approved by parliament in January to upgrade the country's military.\nThe emirate is a member of the US-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria and Iraq, and is also taking part in a Saudi-led coalition pounding Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.\nLast year, it bought 24 Caracal military tactical transport helicopters and French light armoured vehicles.",

      "text": "Boeing Was Offered Illegal Tax Breaks In US, World Trade Body Says Raf Casert and Jamey Keaten, Associated Press November 28, 2016 10:49 AM The logo of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing taken at Le Bourget airport, near Paris on June 23, 2013 during the 50th International Paris Air show. AFP PHOTO ERIC PIERMONT (Photo credit should read ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo credit: ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images) GENEVA (AP) —U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n“We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,” said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a “conservative estimate” and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.” \nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were “the right thing to do for our state’s economic future,” noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

Kuwait, an ally of Saudi Arabia, is also part of a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. \nBoeing, Northrop Grumman Corp, Raytheon Co and General Electric Co are the prime contractors for the proposed sale.",

      "text": "News   \nEVERETT — The World Trade Organization ruled Monday that the Boeing Co. received illegal subsidies from Washington to put 777X assembly here and called for the support to end within a few months. \nBut don’t expect anything to change anytime soon — if at all. \nIt is the latest twist in a 12-year-old legal melodrama between the United States and the European Union on behalf of the world’s two biggest airplane makers — Boeing and its European rival, the Airbus Group. Both sides accuse the other of flagrantly violating international trade rules by pouring huge sums of illegal support into the aerospace giants. \nTrade disputes brought to the WTO typically end in a settlement negotiated by the countries involved or by aggrieved countries imposing tariffs or other trade restrictions with the WTO’s blessing. The international group adjudicates disagreements but does not enforce the outcomes. That is up to member countries. \nThe significance of Monday’s ruling could be overshadowed next year when the WTO is expected to rule on a related complaint from the E.U. concerning a much larger amount of indirect public support for Boeing. \nBoth Airbus and Boeing claimed victory following the WTO’s latest decision, which rejected most of the allegations in the EU’s complaint from 2014. The 28-member bloc charged that tax breaks passed by Washington in 2013 amounted to prohibited subsidies for Boeing. The tax incentives were contingent on Boeing assembling the 777X and making the airplane’s advanced composite-material wings in Washington. \nAirbus and E.U. leaders used the ruling to savage Boeing , Washington and the United States. \n“The WTO has for the first time in these disputes identified prohibited subsidies to Boeing for the 777X, condemning as the worst form of trade violation a full aircraft development illegally financed by taxpayer money,” said John Harrison, general counsel for the Airbus Group. \nThe European airplane maker claims that illegal support for Boeing has cost the company $95 billion. \nThe two sides in the dispute couldn’t agree on how much money was at stake in Monday’s ruling. Airbus and E.U. officials said it is $5.7 billion in illegal support. Boeing and U.S. officials came up with $1 billion. \n“That’s still a lot of money,” but nowhere near the $8.7 billion that the E.U. alleged in its complaint, said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman. The E.U. has “thrown a lot of accusations against the wall to see what sticks, and they’ve won very little.” \nA Geneva-based trade official told The Associated Press that the ruling addressed only the legality of the tax breaks, and did not calculate the financial benefit for Boeing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. \nEither way, Boeing has not received any benefit yet. The 2013 tax breaks in question do not go into effect until 2024. They are based on tax incentives Washington passed in 2003 when Boeing was publicly wondering where to build its 7E7, which became the 787 Dreamliner. \nIn a prepared statement, Gov. Jay Inslee lauded lawmakers for approving the package of legislation in 2013 with near unanimous votes. \n“That was the right thing to do for our state’s economic future and it still is,” he said. It is “too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed” by the U.S., a process which could take up to two years. \nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is reviewing the ruling, said Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the agency. \nIf it does appeal, it likely would do so in December, he said. \nWhile this dispute spans Republican and Democratic presidential administrations, it is not clear how President-elect Donald Trump will handle it. As a candidate, he attacked U.S. trade policy — and the belief in free trade that has underpinned it for decades — as weak and foolish. He called the WTO “a disaster” and threatened to pull out. \nHowever, Trump also told voters he would use the WTO to bring complaints against China and other trading partners. \nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s office has not received any word from the incoming administration, McAlvanah said. \nTrump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment Monday. \nThe WTO ruled in September that the E.U. is still giving prohibited support to Airbus despite a 2011 ruling against the subsidies. The decision put the amount of illegal aid at $22 billion. The E.U. appealed that ruling in October . \nThe international group is expected to rule in the first half of 2017 on whether the U.S. has complied with a WTO ruling in 2012 that Boeing has received illegal subsidies. \nNeither side appears to be in a rush to settle, said Gary Hufbauer, an international trade expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C. \nUltimately, the U.S. and E.U. will exhaust their legal options, and they will either have to settle or punish each other with trade restrictions approved by the WTO, he said. \n“Countermeasures don’t have to apply to aircraft,” he said. “They can apply to cheese, wine, automobiles, whatever.” \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nDan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; .

      "text": "By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN\nAssociated Press GENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants.\nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that the tax breaks were \"the right thing to do for our state's economic future,\" noting that more than 88,000 aerospace workers are employed in the northwestern state. He said he would work with federal officials about how to respond.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n ",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US KING 5's Glenn Farley reports. Associated Press , KING 7:52 PM. PST November 28, 2016 0815 777X Automation CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. The European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. The ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. Monday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nBut both Boeing and the State of Washington don't see the ruling as any sort of disaster, claiming that six of the seven points raised by the E.U. were thrown out by the WTO. \n\"And if you look at the overall European subsidy of Airbus, it's not even in the same league,\" said Washington State Senator Reuven Carlyle, who as a representative was the author of the legislation. \"I don't think it's problematic in the large scale.\" \nAirbus contends the tax breaks connected to the 777X have cost the European plane maker $50 billion in sales already. \nBoth companies have publicly railed at each other over the decades over the trade issues. The case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nBoeing is vowing to appeal, the case is expected to be heard late in 2017 or early 2018. The case, filed in 2014, has taken two years to get this far. \nBoth Boeing and Airbus are producing most of their planes at record rates. Earlier in 2016, Airbus set up a factory building A-320 single aisle aircraft in Mobile, Alabama after that state offered incentives. The Washington legislature and Governor Jay Inslee felt they had to come up big after Boeing threw open the competition to build the 777X to other states around the country. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \nCopyright 2016 KING",

      "text": "Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state - Spokane, North Idaho News & Weather KHQ.com Member Center: KHQ Email Subscription Inslee: Boeing tax breaks ruled illegal were right for state \nOLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - The World Trade Organization has ruled that Boeing received illegal tax breaks from Washington state to keep 777X production in the state. \nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The WTO ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures it reviewed. \nHere is reaction from Washington state officials: \nGov. Jay Inslee said in a statement: \nThree years ago, lawmakers passed, on a bipartisan basis, a package of legislation that resulted in the Boeing 777X being assembled in Washington state, ensuring the health of the Washington aerospace industry and sustaining jobs in our state. That was the right thing to do for our state's economic future and it still is. \nWe will continue to work with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washington, DC, to determine how to respond to the WTO Panel report. It is important to note that the WTO Panel rejected the EU's arguments with respect to six of the seven challenged tax measures. Moreover, it is too early to tell what actions the state might undertake in response to the Panel report as it is likely to be appealed. \nWashington State is a great place for aerospace companies to do business. Washington is home to more than 88,300 skilled aerospace workers and a cluster composed of over 1350 companies, making our industry one of the most robust and dynamic in the world. \nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler said that Airbus's complaints about the subsidies are \"the pot calling the kettle black.\" \n\"They're not receiving extremely favorable treatment? Hardly,\" he said. \nSen. Reuven Carlyle, a Democrat from Seattle who sponsored the 2013 tax incentive bill when he was a state representative, said the WTO \"categorically rejected the overwhelming majority of the European Union's case.\" \nHe said that the element of the ruling related to Washington state \"is pretty modest compared to the central argument.\" \n\"If that's the strength of their entire case compared to the U.S. case against the European Union, that's little league versus the majors in terms of scale,\" he said. \nCarlyle said that if the ruling were upheld on appeal and there wasn't some type of negotiated solution, the Legislature has options, adding that \"the ability to continue to solidify Washington state's role with the aerospace industry is in no way compromised.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "WTO delivers knockout blow to Boeings record-breaking subsidies with historic ruling \n28 November 2016 \n- Extends the WTO’s earlier condemnation of massive illegal subsidies to Boeing to 26 billion USD in the form of wholly non-refundable corporate welfare. This is the single largest state-level instance of corporate welfare in US history. - The subsidy package condemned by today’s report is large enough to fund the entire development of the 777X and has already cost Airbus $50 billion in sales. - This is only the second time in the WTO’s 20+ year history that a country has been found to have provided prohibited subsidies contingent on domestic content. \nToday’s report from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Panel (DS487) confirms that the United States has ignored international trade rules by permitting illegal subsidies to Boeing, this time targeted at the 777X aircraft. The Panel found Washington State’s multi-billion dollar subsidy regime for Boeing to include “prohibited” subsidies, which in the Panel’s words belong to “a special category… which Members have deemed to create such trade distortions that they are proscribed,” because they are “specifically designed to affect trade.” \n“The United States and Boeing picked this fight at the WTO, and today’s ruling is yet another blow for that strategy,” said Tom Enders, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus Group. “Those prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn immediately following today’s historic ruling, meaning that Boeing must give up these massive tax subsidies.” \nThis ruling adds to the previous findings by the WTO in 2012 that federal, state, and local governments in the United States are providing huge and WTO-inconsistent subsidies to Boeing (DS353), now mounting up to a total of 26 billion USD of pure grants which Boeing has no plans to repay. “The earlier WTO rulings had already confirmed that B787 was the most highly subsidized aircraft in the history of aviation,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. “Today’s report leaves no doubt that Boeing has gone even further. The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State’s taxpayers. We estimate the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry in the region to be $50 billion so far, and that’s only for the 777X. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) should take immediate action. This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the U.S. Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behavior.” \nAmong those subsidies found to be WTO-inconsistent in 2012 – due to the significant competitive harm caused to Airbus – was the very same Washington State tax incentive regime found today to include a “prohibited” subsidy. “Instead of complying with that 2012 ruling, the United States has doubled-down on illegal conduct,” explained John Harrison, General Counsel, Airbus Group. “By extending the tax incentives through the year 2040, increasing their value by nearly $9 billion, making them available to a new Boeing aircraft, and adding an illegal contingency, the United States and Washington State are further defying WTO compliance.” \nIndustry specialists suggest that the nearly $9 billion in subsidies provided by Washington State is largely sufficient to cover the entire cost of design and production of the 777X, essentially giving Boeing a “free ride” by offsetting entirely the costs of developing and bringing the aircraft to market. \nConsidering today’s ruling, together with the 2012 ruling in the original dispute, Boeing has caused at least $95 billion in commercial harm to Airbus, opening the door to trade sanctions against the US in an equivalent amount. As Harrison explains: “The WTO has for the first time in these disputes identified prohibited subsidies to Boeing for the 777X, condemning as the worst form of trade violation a full aircraft development illegally financed by taxpayer money. And that is supposed to be good for American business and workers? Unlike the loans to Airbus – the interest rates of which were considered in the WTO dispute against the European Union – Boeing plans no repayment of any kind.” \nHarrison added that: “The United States has no other option than to direct that Washington State repeal the legislation or amend it in a way that makes it WTO-compliant. That would obviously take away any incentive to keep producing the 777X in Washington State and it will certainly not benefit Boeing’s balance sheet.” The Panel has declared that the US must end the prohibited subsidy regime in Washington State within 90 days. This is on top of the ongoing US failure to comply with the original WTO ruling against Boeing subsidies - for which the public panel report is expected in the next several months. \nAirbus once again congratulates the European Commission and the Governments of France, Germany, the UK and Spain for their success at the WTO, and is grateful for the years of effort they have invested in setting the record straight. \n“We hope this outcome will lead those at Boeing who advocate continuing this trade dispute to reconsider,” Tom Enders concluded.",

      "text": "Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks: WTO Associated Press X \nA World Trade Organization panel has ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the US government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU rival Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for air planes. \nMonday's ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the US government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies.

      "text": "World briefs: WTO: Boeing received illegal tax subsidy November 29, 2016 12:08 AM Compiled from news services \nBoeing received an illegal tax break from Washington state as part of $8.7 billion in aid to assemble the 777X and manufacture the jetliner’s carbon-fiber wing there, the World Trade Organization said. \nAn incentive cutting a state levy on gross receipts by 40 percent is a prohibited subsidy that must be removed, a three-judge panel said Monday in Geneva. The tax break, which takes effect when the first 777X is delivered in 2020, gives an unfair advantage to the U.S. planemaker to the detriment of overseas manufacturers, the WTO determined. \nThe European Commission said Boeing would gain $5.7 billion from the disputed benefit, while the U.S. company put the value at $1 billion over 20 years. The decision marks the latest twist in a longstanding clash between the U.S. and the European Union over government incentives to ease the heavy costs of developing new jetliners for Chicago-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus Group SE. \nIndependence Party head \nLONDON — The spectacle surrounding the U.K. Independence Party continued on Monday, as the party named Paul Nuttall as its leader after the previous one resigned last month after less than three weeks in charge, citing internal squabbles and rivalries. \nThe announcement Monday that Mr. Nuttall would lead the right-wing party would seem to allow the acting leader, Nigel Farage, a polarizing figure who has made much of his new friendship with President-elect Donald Trump, to move to the United States. \nIn October, one leadership candidate, Steven Woolfe, ended up in the hospital after a fight with another party member at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. \nMr. Nuttall’s main challenges now appear to be forging a post-Farage identity for the party and moving beyond its ultra-fringe voice in Parliament — holding just one seat in the 650-member House of Commons. \nPresident Zuma struggles \nJOHANNESBURG — South African President Jacob Zuma was fighting for his political survival Monday, ambushed by a surprise no-confidence vote launched by his opponents in the governing party, the African National Congress. \nA series of senior figures have called for him to go, after accusations he allowed members of a powerful family, who are in business with his son, to influence Cabinet appointments and to benefit from government contracts. \nAnother concern centered on the ANC’s disastrous performance in municipal elections in August, when it lost control Johannesburg, Pretoria and Port Elizabeth to the opposition. \nBomb safely detonated \nBEIJING — Police in Manila, Philippines, on Monday detonated a suspected “improvised explosive device” found in a trash bin near the U.S. Embassy and linked it to terrorism. Nobody was injured. \nEarly Monday morning, a street cleaner named Winniefreda Francisco spotted what looked like a cellphone connected by red wires to a cylindrical device and alerted authorities, according to The Associated Press. Police responded to the scene, briefly closing a major road near the embasssy and detonated the item. \nAlso in the world ... \nMontenegrin lawmakers on Monday swore in the pro-NATO government of Prime Minister Dusko Markovic amid political tensions following an alleged foiled election-day coup orchestrated by Russian nationalists to derail the Balkan country’s bid to join the alliance.",

      "text": "Lauren Hepler Tuesday, November 29, 2016 - 1:30am Clockwise from top left: Geisha Williams, PG&E; Kevin McAllister, Boeing; Jan Dell, Wood Group; Emma Stewart, Impact Infrastructure; Stephanie Stuckey Benfield, City of Atlanta. \nThe year may be winding down, but there's plenty to report in this month's Names in the News wrap up of big hires, promotions and other job news in sustainable business. \nThis month we cover career changes from green design to green cities, Atlanta's first resilience chief and the executive swapping one industrial titan for another. \nHave a tip for our next installment? Shoot us an e-mail at [email protected] . Who's news \nGeisha Williams, PG&E \nCalifornia mega utility PG&E has tapped an in-house clean energy expert to serve as its next president and chief executive. Geisha Williams, currently president of the company's electric utility and responsible for growing renewable power capacity, will take the reigns of the entire company from current CEO Tony Earley Jr. \nIn addition to an uncertain national landscape for climate and energy policy, Williams — who reports cite as instrumental in the utility's recent decision to close the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant — also takes the job as PG&E looks to rebuild after a conviction this summer for safety violations related to a 2010 pipeline explosion. A native of Cuba, Williams will also be the first female Latina CEO for a Fortune 200 company. \nEmma Stewart, Impact Infrastructure \nEmma Stewart, former head of sustainability solutions for design software provider Autodesk, is diving deeper into the way we build infrastructure. \nStewart has been named chief business development officer of four-year-old Impact Infrastructure, which builds cost-benefit analysis tools for green building and infrastructure projects. \nKevin McAllister, Boeing \nBoeing has poached Kevin McAllister, former head of General Electric's aviation division, to head its flagship commercial aviation business. \nThe move comes as the aviation industry embarks on early stage joint emissions-reduction efforts, though the Wall Street Journal reports that McAllister will primarily be tasked with cutting production costs as the company looks to grow high-margin businesses like part replacement. \nStephanie Stuckey Benfield, City of Atlanta \nAtlanta is the latest city to name its first-ever chief resilience officer, selecting former 14-year Georgia state Rep. Stephanie Stuckey Benfield for the job. \nPrior to her appointment, Stuckey Benfield was director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability for Atlanta. On the move \n— Veteran science and environmental reporter Andrew Revkin , most recently of the New York Times, has joined investigative reporting nonprofit ProPublica as a senior correspondent covering how countries and companies are (or aren't) working to combat climate change. \n— Veteran corporate sustainability executive Jan Dell has been tapped to lead the clean energy team for energy services company Wood Group. \n— The former managing director of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, Owain Johnson , has signed on to run research and product development in London for U.S.-based energy development giant CME.

      "text": "Boeing becomes latest casualty of EU-US trade spat Published time: 29 Nov, 2016 10:44 Get short URL Visitors talk next to a Boeing 777X aircraft model at the Singapore Airshow © Edgar Su / Reuters The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled special tax exemption granted for the production of Boeing’s newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules. Read more \nThe tax exemption was the central part of a case the EU filed with the trade organization against the US in December 2014. \nUnder the ruling the US should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, it can also appeal. \nThe tax cut was provided by the state of Washington in 2013 to ensure the wings for Boeing's 777X widebody plane were made only there. The plane can seat more than 400 passengers and is an updated model of the 777. It is due to enter service at the end of the decade. \nThe WTO said giving Boeing the special and very low business and occupation (B&O) tax rate was unlawful because it required the company to use local rather than imported materials which distort trade. \n\"The Panel has found that the European Union has demonstrated that the B&O aerospace tax rate for the manufacturing or sale of commercial airplanes under the 777X program... is a subsidy contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods [and is] prohibited,\" said the WTO in its ruling. \n“We expect the US to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom as cited by the Wall Street Journal. \nREAD MORE: Airbus probed over corruption, bribery & fraud allegations \nThe EU suggested Boeing had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing denied the accusations, saying they totaled just $50 million. \nIn September, the WTO determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus. Next year the trade body is expected to pass a similar judgment on the US. Russian-Chinese passenger jet to take on Boeing & Airbus https://t.co/o3YhxZbhhs pic.twitter.com/tANxCl7A8e — RT (@RT_com) May 31, 2016 \nThe transatlantic trade spat between Boeing and its European rival Airbus dates back more than a decade with the sides accusing each other of receiving billions of dollars in illegal government aid. \nTheir previous disagreement was settled in 1992. However, the US walked away from that deal in 2004, claiming Airbus had an unfair advantage.",

      "title": "WTO calls US state’s Boeing subsidies illegal in win for EU",
      "text": "GENEVA: Subsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organisation said on Monday, in a victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the European Union.\nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry’s two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way.\nThe WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing’s 777X jet were “prohibited” as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling trade distortions.\nThe panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days.\nAirbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities do not have standing at the Geneva-based WTO. \nBoeing said it expects the US to appeal against the decision.\n“After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel.\nAccording to Airbus’s own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth $8.7 billion (8.2 billion euros) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040.\nBoeing has dismissed those numbers, putting the benefits to date at a maximum of $1 billion.\n“The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State’s taxpayers,” Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement of the aircraft that is expected to be market ready by 2020.\n“This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour,” he added.\nThe WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line.\nCalling Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU,” the bloc’s trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States “to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.”\nA spokesman for the US Trade Representative said the agency was reviewing the ruling, but suggested it was ready to fight on behalf of the US aerospace giant.\n“This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States’ favour,” spokesman Matt McAlvanah said in a statement, adding that “the US government will continue to hold the EU to account for illegal, market distorting subsidies.”.\n \nTit-for-Tat:\nThe EU has also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing.\nIn September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus.\nThe WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales.\nThe EU has appealed against that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had been discontinued.\nMeanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months.\n \nA new industry-wide pact?\nAirbus Group chief executive Tom Enders described the seemingly never-ending spat with Boeing as “a ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US.”\nIn seeking to move past drawn-out, costly squabbles at the WTO, Enders called for an agreement “on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.”\nHe noted that the battle for aviation contracts was no longer just Airbus versus Boeing.\nAircraft maker Bombardier has received massive support from the Canadian government, while Russian and Asian firms have increasingly become market players, Enders said.\n“We need a global framework,” he continued. “This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ for more than a decade.”",

      "text": "Juneyao inks MoU with Boeing for 787-9s Juneyao inks MoU with Boeing for 787-9s 29 November, 2016 BY: Mavis Toh Singapore \nJuneyao Airlines confirms that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Boeing for 10 787-9s, as part of its plans to go long-haul. \nAn airline executive tells FlightGlobal that the MoU with Boeing was inked in September, but that with Airbus on the A350 are continuing. The airline is expected to make a decision and firm the order in the middle of 2017, with the aircraft to be delivered starting from 2018, he adds. \nThe airline is now studying where it can deploy its first widebody jets. Ideally, Juneyao would like to put its first widebodies on services to North America from Shanghai. This is however largely constrained by traffic rights, and the airline may hence have to first operate services to Australasia and Europe instead, says the executive. \nJuneyao’s main base lies in Shanghai, where China Eastern Airlines is also based. The carrier currently operates 56 A320 family jets, largely on domestic services. Its only international routes are to points in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Related Content",

      "text": "Market News | Mon Nov 28, 2016 | 12:09pm EST UPDATE 2-WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet \n* Washington tax break for 777X is prohibited subsidy - WTO \n* EU says aid worth total $5.7 bln, Boeing says $50 mln/year \n* Europeans claim Boeing fell into trap of its own making \n* Boeing confident ruling will be reversed on appeal (Adds background, details, shares) \nBy Tim Hepher and Tom Miles \nGENEVA, Nov 28 The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. \nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nCONFIDENT ON APPEAL \nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\". \nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \nInvestors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market. \n\"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. \nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.

      "text": "Boeing P-8 Poseidon (Credit: Boeing Co. ) Norway plans $1.15 billion order for five Boeing Poseidon military aircraft Reuters ( … ) \nBoeing P-8 Poseidon (Credit: Boeing Co.) \nOSLO • Norway plans to order five Boeing Co. P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes to maintain its surveillance capacity and meet future security challenges, the NATO country's Defense Ministry said. \nFollowing an agreement in Norway's parliament to boost long-term military spending, the 9.83 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.15 billion) purchase will likely face only minor political opposition. \nNorway's long maritime border with neighboring Russia has become a renewed focus for the country's military planners following the Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Norway's territorial waters also stretch far into the Arctic. \nNeighboring Sweden and Finland, which are not in the NATO alliance, have also expressed concerns about incursions by Russian submarines and other naval vessels. \n\"The new security situation increases our demand for situational awareness in our own vicinity. The ability to handle current and future challenges must therefore be strengthened,\" Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said. \n\"The introduction of the Poseidon aircraft is crucial for Norway to maintain a leading position and expertise on strategic conditions in northern areas,\" she said in the statement released late on Friday. The statement did not specifically mention Russia.",

      "text": "View Caption of \nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday that Boeing received large illegal tax breaks from Washington state to help it develop its new 777X jetliner, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe global trade body said the “prohibited” subsidies to the US plane manufacturer came in the form of a renewed cut in the state's main business tax for aerospace from 2024 to 2040, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. The Chicago-based company has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Boeing's key European rival, Airbus. Both Boeing and the European Union, which backs Airbus, called the ruling a victory. Recommended: How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz \nThe The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU said that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/28 \nBoeing called the $5.7 billion figure excessive and said the WTO found impermissible only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the US government and the European Union over state support for the two aerospace giants, dating back to 2004. \nThe WTO urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between US and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the EU and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the US company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to favor US businesses over foreign ones. \nOn paper, the ruling is seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.

      "text": "Trump May Bring Turbulence To Boeing Nov.29.16 \nBA's share of China's $1 trillion aircraft market is at risk. \nA stronger US dollar makes BA aircraft less competitive. \nHigher interest rates makes aircraft more expensive to finance. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is an American brand that has the dominant market share in a duopoly with Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) ( OTCPK:EADSF ). The Company, boasting a $93 billion market cap , is up 8.3% year-to-date. Since November 8 (immediately prior to the US election), BA has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 2%, increasing 5.5%. The DJIA, of which BA is a component, is up 4.5% during the same period. Click to enlarge Source: Yahoo Finance The Company competes and is profitable both in the commercial airplane (68% of revenues and 43% of profits - 9 months ended September 30, 2016) and defense (32% of revenues and 57% of profits) segments. As such, the Company both has risks (higher dollar and interest rates, negative impact of anti-trade actions) and opportunities (expected higher defense spending) from the policies (real and perceived) of President-elect Trump. BA's forward multiple is 16x and the Company's PEG (PE/5-Year Growth Estimate) is 1.65. These ratios are reasonable if growth continues and would be considered overvalued if growth falters. Earnings estimates have actually ticked up, to a projected $9.39 in fiscal 2017, from $9.37 30 days following the election. As outlined below, the lack of material change in these estimates suggests the negatives for BA associated with the Trump Presidency may not have been fully assessed. Trade Barriers and Tariffs While running for office, President-elect Trump's platform loudly called for tariffs and competitive retaliation against both foreign countries and companies. As has been widely reported, President-elect Trump has vowed to name China a \" currency manipulator \" and has threatened to impose 45% tariffs on imports from the country. BA notes that it derives \"70% of commercial airplane revenue (historically) from customers outside the United States.\" BA recently forecast that China (domestic airlines) is expected to purchase 6,810 ($1.0 trillion) planes over the next 20 years. Currently, as reported by Bloomberg , BA earns about 12% of annual revenue from China. If the Trump administration follows through on its threats, China, would almost certainly retaliate against the US in general, and iconic brands like BA (and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )) would serve as highly visible scapegoats. The China Times , as reported in HotHardware.com, noted \"China is willing to use the nuclear option with regards to trade... a batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus... US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\" These are not idle threats; in 2014, amid US charges of Chinese hacking, China aggressively retaliated against Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ). To placate Chinese authorities, BA announced a plan to open a plant in China (Airbus already has an assembly facility in China); Trump denounced this move. Speaking of the Trump risk to BA, aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels notes, \"Boeing has to be as worried as anyone... it would be horrible and a huge boom to Airbus.\" While the above discussion focuses on China, other countries are likely to use influence with their national carriers to shift aircraft orders if the US imposes tariffs on imports. The impact on revenues from trade retaliation is hard to predict; it is almost impossible to envision a scenario where increased tariffs and/or a trade war would be anything but materially negative for BA. While not strictly related to trade policy, BA's recently announced letter of intent with Iran, worth up to $25 billion, would also be at risk from changes in the US-Iran relationship. President-elect Trump has spoken frequently about his displeasure with the Iran nuclear deal. Iran would almost certainly retaliate against the US (and BA by extension) in the event the agreement is unilaterally changed. Currency While not as dramatic as the rise of the US dollar in 2014, the US dollar has appreciated about 4% and 6% against the Euro and Yen, respectively, as well as against other relevant currencies in the post-election period. While BA typically prices its aircraft in US dollars, foreign buyers must convert their currency into dollars, effectively making US dollar products materially more expensive in a rising dollar environment. Source: Investing.com Unlike other exporters, the impact of a strong US dollar on BA will be seen indirectly in the form of reduced sales (as prices rise) and/or lower margins (price cuts to hold market share) as opposed to a loss on currency translation. The strong dollar is not expected to be a short-term phenomenon. As noted in the Wall Street Journal , multiple analysts, including Citibank and Brown Brothers Harriman, are projecting the US dollar to reach parity with the Euro within six-to-twelve months. Interest Rates As readers know, we have been in an extended period of historically low interest rates. Post-election, the yield on the US 10-year has already increased by about 50 basis points. While BA is not a large borrower, almost all customers either finance or lease (indirectly financing) aircraft purchases. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates (assuming a 10-year loan, and a rate increasing to 5%) would increase payments by 2.5%. Ex-Im Bank The Ex-Im Bank, which helps finance US exports, was almost eliminated in 2015. It almost certainly will be killed by the Trump administration . While the impact of losing this financing conduit is uncertain, in April, BA noted \"some airlines might not be able to accept new planes... in the absence of US Export-Import Bank support for aircraft and engine sales.\" Potential Positives There are of course, potential positives from President-elect Trump's likely legislative agenda. Military Sales While BA's public reputation is focused on commercial aircraft, as noted above, about 1/3 of sales and the majority of profits are garnered from military sales. President-elect Trump and members of the Republican legislative majority have loudly called for increased military spending. BA would be a recipient of the (future) rising tide in military spending. Unlike, commercial aircraft, the focus of higher tariffs would not cause the same level of retaliation by foreign buyers of BA's military/security products. Higher Interest Rates BA would benefit from higher interest rates with respect to the Company's underfunded pension liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 , the net pension liability on BA's balance sheet was $18 billion. Higher interest rates will enable the Company to increase its assumptions regarding future returns and reduce the balance sheet value of the present value of future obligations. While these are non-cash changes, the changes in pension assumptions will be seen on the income statement. Reduction in Corporate Tax Rate BA used a 30% effective tax rate in its 2016 financial outlook. A decrease in the US tax rate would materially impact BA. A reduction to 22% (a level recommended by Barron's this week), would increase net income by $405 million or $0.58/share (diluted). Conclusion BA continues to be an American icon and a leader in commercial aircraft. I am concerned the current stock price (and lack of estimate movement) fails to consider the negatives associated with the Trump Presidency. Specifically, trade restrictions and a stronger US dollar will have material impacts on BA's earnings and hence its stock price. These negatives will be partially offset by pension benefits associated with higher interest rates and the potential for a lower US tax rate. In the risks to earnings section, S&P does not mention the above risks, only commenting, \"slower global economic growth, incremental US defense budget pressures and... cost overruns.\" It is my opinion that the market has not properly considered the highlighted negatives (as well as the positives) in the wake of euphoria about potentially lower US tax rates.

      "text": "Paying Off $29 Billion In R&D On The 787 Nov.29.16 \nBoeing invested ~$29bn on the 787. \nIts has a block of 1,300 aircraft to cover this. \nWill Boeing recover this R&D? Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) 787 R&D cost more than the company had planned for. The technologies and industrialization became challenging - the global supply chain was supposed to all be moved and local to Everett. Boeing also went through some labor unrest even as it was trying to solve these issues. Then came the battery fires. The 787 gestation is very tough. Focusing on the $29Bn R&D cost, on a block of 1,300 aircraft this would be $22.3m per aircraft to recover. There are estimates the actual R&D overhang per aircraft is closer to $36m. A Bloomberg report states the overhang is being worked down. The R&D charges are said to have dropped to $27.5Bn and the decline cut $4m per aircraft. Can Boeing ever recover the 787 R&D? It's going to be tough. Even as Boeing improves its productivity, its flexibility to claw back R&D via higher pricing is limited. The next chart illustrates how Boeing has improved its production efficiency. Click to enlarge As the chart also shows, 787 orders have started to slow. Obviously Boeing needs lots of orders to keep driving down the R&D impact. At 1,198 the company is short of its 1,300 block. What makes it tougher is that just last week, Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) rolled out its first A330neo from the Toulouse FAL. This aircraft will be the price leader in the segment. In other words, the A330neo will exert pricing limits on Boeing. So just as Boeing is getting its 787 rhythm up to speed, the market started to slow and a lower cost competitor emerges. Boeing's choices include: Squeeze more savings from its supply chain and workers. Boeing can increase its block size It can take a financial hit and get the R&D out of the way. Option 1 comes with risks of labor strife and added financial stress in the supply chain. Option 2 makes the 787 look more expensive. Option 3 means stockholders take a hit. There will be more 787 orders of course. The 787-10 is about to join the 787 family. But 787-8 orders have slowed earlier than expected. The 787-9 is now the best seller. How many more 787 orders are going to come? We believe Boeing could sell 2,000 and the R&D per aircraft would drop to $14.5m. That is still an overhang that Airbus does not have and can exploit.  ",

      "text": "By Amey Stone Wells Fargo is looking for a big dividend hike from Boeing ( BA ) on December 12.\nAnalyst Sam Pearlstein and team write:\nBoeing generally announces a dividend increase after its December Board meeting on the 2nd Monday of the month. We expect at least a 10-15% dividend increase to be announced after the December 12th close — increasing BA’s projected yield to about 3.2-3.3% from 2.9% today. We view the dividend increase as positive. In addition, in recent years, Boeing replaced and expanded its share repurchase authorization at the same time and this would also be positive.\nHe notes that the shares generally rise after these increases. But that doesn’t mean he expects a big gain in the stock. He puts the valuation in the $155-$160 level. The stock is trading near $150 currently. He notes:\nWe believe near-term sentiment on BA shares will be neutral, given the slowing pace of orders and general macroeconomic concerns.",

      "title": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet",
      "text": "By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (BA.N) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nIt is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus.\nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based.\nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales.\nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute.\nThe WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel.\nIt urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when.\nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid.\nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received.\nUnder the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors.\nCONFIDENT ON APPEAL\nThe European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\".\nBoeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020.\nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.\nInvestors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market.\n\"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\nOn paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly.\nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned.\nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere.\nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state.",

      "text": "Boeing (BA) Hits 52-Week High on Steady Flow of Contracts November 25, 2016, 08:57:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nOn Nov 23, shares of The Boeing Company BA soared to a new 52-week high of $150.81, before closing the trading session at $149.74. The closing price of this   prime, which has a market cap of around $92.4 billion, reflects a year-to-date gain of roughly 3.6%. Over the past 52 weeks, Boeing's shares have ranged from a low of $102.10 to a high of $150.81. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 3.5 million. What's Driving Boeing Up? Last month, Boeing delivered stellar third-quarter 2016 results on the back of strong defense deliveries. Earnings beat expectations and were up an impressive 39.3% year over year. The company raised its core earnings and revenue guidance for 2016. Boeing expects to deliver 745-750 commercial airplanes in 2016, which would allow it to surpass its European rival Airbus Group SE's EADSY delivery numbers. Recently, Boeing received purchase commitment from Fiji Airways for five 737 MAX 8s. Again, in October, the company received an order from Swiss International Air Lines for one 777-300 ER (Extended Range) for $339.6 million at list prices. The company also inked a deal to sell a dozen of 787-9 Dreamliner jets to China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd. These contracts will contribute significantly to the company's top line. In the defense arena, Trump's victory in the Presidential race may turn out to be a growth catalyst for Boeing and other defense majors like Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT and Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC . During his pre-electoral campaign, Trump had made promises of an increase in defense spending and expansion of troops. Moreover, a quick review of the past reveals that the Conservative Republican Party has usually advocated in favor of higher military spending. Boeing continues with investor-friendly moves, paying regular dividends and repurchasing shares, which reflect its strong operational performance. During the first nine months of 2016, Boeing paid $2,084 million in dividends, up 10.7% from the prior-year payout. The company also repurchased 51.4 million shares for $6.5 billion.\nBOEING CO Price and Consensus \nBOEING CO Price and Consensus | BOEING CO Quote \nZacks Rank Boeing currently holds   You   (Strong Buy) stocks here .

      "text": "News, analysis and commentary on income-generating investments. Search Income Investing2 November 29, 2016, 10:58 A.M. ET Boeing May Hike Dividend by Double Digits Again this December By Amey Stone \nWells Fargo is looking for a big dividend hike from Boeing ( BA ) on December 12. \nAnalyst Sam Pearlstein and team write: \nBoeing generally announces a dividend increase after its December Board meeting on the 2nd Monday of the month. We expect at least a 10-15% dividend increase to be announced after the December 12th close — increasing BA’s projected yield to about 3.2-3.3% from 2.9% today. We view the dividend increase as positive. In addition, in recent years, Boeing replaced and expanded its share repurchase authorization at the same time and this would also be positive. \nHe notes that the shares generally rise after these increases. But that doesn’t mean he expects a big gain in the stock. He puts the valuation in the $155-$160 level. The stock is trading near $150 currently. He notes: \nWe believe near-term sentiment on BA shares will be neutral, given the slowing pace of orders and general macroeconomic concerns.",

      "text": "Next Big Future ^ | Nov 2, 2016 | Brian Wang \nPosted on 11/29/2016 8:21:05 PM PST by bkopto \nBoeing is out with new concept art for the U.S. Air Forces next-generation fighter jet, a sleek, tail-less design featuring conformal engine inlets and what looks like a manned cockpit. \nThe tail-less airframe, thin swept wings and conformal shaping suggest a stealthy, penetrating aircraft that may be able to fly supersonic. The silhouette of a pilot inside the cockpit indicates Boeing is banking on the Air Force sticking with at least an optionally manned platform for the future capability. \nBoeings new vision comes as the Air Force begins to solidify a plan for the next generation of air superiority, alternatively called sixth-generation fighter,next-generation air dominance, F-X, and most recently Penetrating Counterair (PCA). The service just kicked off an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (AFSAB) study that will begin identifying key capabilities needed to fight in the battlefield of 2030 ahead of a formal analysis of alternatives (AoA) for PCA. \nThe Air Forces Air Superiority 2030 initiative identified a hybrid PCA capability as key to ensuring air superiority in future denied battlespaces characterized by sophisticated air defense systems and counterair technologies. But so far, the Air Force has only described PCA in relatively broad terms. \nThe AFSAB study, announced Oct. 27, will begin to define the key operational characteristics of a PCA capability. The pre-AoA (pre-analysis of alternatives) effort will examine likely adversaries, identify and assess relevant technologies, and determine the timelines and investments needed to mature them. The study aims to provide a technology roadmap to support developing and fielding of an initial PCA capability in 2030.",

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nPARIS France said on Wednesday that the United States must comply with a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling this week against U.S. tax breaks for Boeing ( BA.N ), and that failure to do so would give the EU legal basis for retaliatory measures. \nThe WTO said this week that a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus ( AIR.PA ). \n\"The United States must quickly comply with the decision and put an end to these illegal measures,\" the French finance ministry said in a statement. \n\"If not, the European Union will have the legal grounds to adopt retaliatory measures concerning goods coming in from the United States,\" it added. \n(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love) Next In Business News",

Now it appears the subsidies they extract could get them in trouble with the World Trade Organization.What do state-level economic development tactics have to do with international trade?

      "text": "United may amend big Airbus order, looks at Boeing’s 737 MAX 10X Originally published November 30, 2016 at 4:41 pm The multibillion-dollar changes are under consideration as a new management team reviews the Chicago-based carrier’s order portfolio and revamps its fleet strategy. Share story Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News \nUnited Continental Holdings may convert a $12.4 billion order for Airbus Group’s largest twin-engine jet to smaller long-range models. It’s also interested in a new Boeing 737 MAX that’s still on the drawing board. \nThose are among the multibillion-dollar changes under consideration as a new management team reviews the Chicago-based carrier’s order portfolio and revamps its fleet strategy, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said in an interview. The goal: to close a profit gap with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. \nUnited is weighing the conversion of Airbus A350-1000s as it looks to replace its fleet of 747 jumbo jets. The carrier could switch to a smaller version of the aircraft or even the mid-sized A330. That would dent Airbus’s order book, since United is the second-largest customer for the -1000 variant, which took its first flight last week. \nThe airline also is studying the so-called MAX 10X, a stretch of Boeing’s largest 737, after deferring 61 of the company’s smallest jets this month. The support from a blue-chip airline customer may help Boeing close the business case for the proposed new variant, intended to help catch up to sales of Airbus’s A321neo. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \n“These fleet decision are big decisions, they affect your balance sheet for a long time,” Levy, 47, said in the interview at United’s Chicago headquarters. “These are big capital decisions that you have to live with for a really long time, so you need to make sure you get it right.” \nThe A350-1000 has only garnered 195 total orders, according to Airbus’s website. Qatar Airways is the largest customer for the jet, which is similar in size to Boeing’s 777-300ER. An Airbus representative declined to comment. \nUnited Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz unveiled a $4.8 billion plan this month to reap greater revenue and savings from its worldwide route network. That includes improvements in the way the airline forecasts demand and manages seats, which is expected to generate an extra $900 million a year. Cost-cutting moves will save another $700 million by 2020, compared with last year’s level. \nMunoz pledged to reshape the executive corps he inherited when he became CEO in September 2015 and has been under pressure from investors to improve performance. With new agreements with workers in hand, the focus now is to lift United’s operating profit, which amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year. Industry leader Delta had a 19 percent margin and American’s was 15.1 percent. \nScrapping current jet orders altogether is unlikely because it would be too costly, Levy said. United plans to accept delivery of 14 of Boeing’s ultralong 777-300ER, the first of which is due to arrive within weeks. That is a “done deal,” he said. \nBoeing met with United officials recently to discuss the MAX 10X, a longer version of the largest 737 model . It “definitely looks to be of interest to us,” Levy said. \nUnited’s interest is critical as Boeing weighs how to respond to the Airbus A321neo, which has emerged as a hot-seller for airlines flying transcontinental routes. \nBoeing is mulling two options. One is a simple stretch of the MAX 9 that would enter the market by 2019 and rely on a higher-thrust version of the Leap-1B engine developed for the MAX family. The planemaker is also studying a more extensive revamp that would rely on the larger Leap created for Airbus and would be ready to fly commercially by late 2021. \n“We are continuing to work through the business case and talk to customers about a potential MAX 10X,” Boeing spokesman Paul Lewis said. “Once this process is successfully completed we will be in a position to share more details.” \nDeferring the 61 737-700s was an easy call, Levy said, because of the jet’s small size and older technology. United also is considering the more advanced 737 MAX 8 or the MAX 9 models as replacements, Levy said. \nLevy likes Bombardier’s C Series jets but until a review of United’s entire fleet is completed he’s unsure “if there’s a place for a 100- to 120-seat airplane.” \nUnited placed the A350-1000 order in 2013, upgrading an earlier deal. It has a value of $12.4 billion at list prices before big discounts that are customary for major airlines. Levy wants to look at whether United should swap out some or all of those aircraft for other wide-body jets, such as the A350-900, which can fly longer routes, or the smaller A330. \n“Since we have the opportunity let’s look at what we think would be ideal,” he said.

      "text": "Looking at the net orders, Boeing is having a lead. \nIn October, Airbus booked 19 orders versus 85 orders for Boeing. \nWide body sales seem to be picking up for Boeing, but are still lagging for Airbus. The order battle between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) is one of the ways for the companies to flex their muscles, next to marketing their respective products as the best solution with the highest fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite the fact that the orders (in terms of value) are in no way a reflection of financial performance, it is important to have a look at the order inflow, since it gives a nice idea of which manufacturer offers the best mix of discount, comfort, slot availability and efficiency. In this article, I will have a look at the order inflow during October for both manufacturers and have a look at their role in the narrow- and wide-body market. I am currently polling interest for a premium research service on Seeking Alpha focusing on the aerospace sector. Are you interested? Let me know here . Overview October In October, Airbus and Boeing together hauled in 104 orders compared 93 last year. Looking at the division of the orders Boeing can be marked as the clear winner. Airbus received 19 orders, while Boeing received 85 orders. Boeing had a good month with a focus on wide-body order inflow: Almost half of the orders came from Qatar Airways, which ordered 30 Boeing 787-9 aircraft and 10 Boeing 777-300ERs. Swiss International Air Lines placed a follow-up order for one Boeing 777-300ER. UPS (NYSE: UPS ) placed an order for 14 Boeing 747-8F aircraft. Two unidentified customers ordered 12 and five Boeing 787-9 airframes, respectively. The order for 12 units likely comes from China Southern Airlines ( OTCPK:CHKIF ). Two unidentified customers ordered six and two Boeing 737MAX airframes, respectively. An unidentified customer ordered five Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. The full report for Boeing's orders and deliveries in October can be found here . For Boeing it was an important month. The jet maker received orders for two wide-body programs, the Boeing 777 and Boeing 747, that are facing some difficulties and received follow-up orders for the Boeing 787. The Boeing 747 program up until recently had a high probability of being shut down. With a lower production rate and 17 net orders for the year, Boeing seems to have guaranteed the line to remain open for years to come. On the Boeing 777 program the jet maker saw some order inflow, which helps the company in closing the production gap as it transitions towards the production of the Boeing 777X. Although Boeing received 17 net orders for the type in 2016, I do think it is likely that we will see a further trim. The order inflow for Airbus was solely for its narrow-body product: An unidentified customer ordered two Airbus A320ceo aircraft and three Airbus A321ceo aircraft. A second unidentified customer ordered 10 Airbus A320neo aircraft. A third unidentified customer ordered four Airbus A319ceo aircraft. The full report for Airbus' orders and deliveries in October can be found here . Order inflow for Airbus was not really exciting. It seems that Airbus is having problems securing orders for the Airbus A330neo and the Airbus A350. Currently, the pricing of the Airbus A330ceo is sufficiently compelling for airlines to order the airframe instead of the new engine option. The full report for the September orders can be found here . In terms of units, Boeing had a better month than Airbus. Also in terms of value Boeing had the upper hand, booking $10.9 billion worth of orders versus $0.9 billion for Boeing. Overview year-to-date Click to enlarge Figure 1: Infographic Orders October (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Airbus received 190 cancellations, including 24 swaps, leaving the jet maker with 395 net orders year-to-date. Boeing received 545 orders and 88 cancellations, bringing its net orders to 457. Looking at the net orders, Boeing is having a lead over Airbus with only 2 months remaining in 2016. Order inflow in October was focused on wide-body aircraft: Almost 70% of the orders were for wide-body aircraft and Boeing was the jet maker that has added all these orders to its backlog. Conclusion Boeing had a good month with strong order inflow. For Airbus, the order inflow for wide-body jets is not picking up pace yet, but I think this has to do with the novelty of its wide-body products. Up until June, Boeing and Airbus had been following different paths. Airbus was lagging behind, while Boeing seemed to have a good first 6 months. It took Airbus just 2 months to take the lead. Looking at the net orders, Boeing currently has a lead over Airbus. Airbus's orders from January up until October fell by roughly 35% year-over-year, due to soft order inflow so far in 2016. Boeing's orders are roughly 2% lower, closing the gap from 8% last month. Boeing actually did not have a lot of big orders to be announced during the Farnborough Airshow, while Airbus did. This led Airbus to completely close the gap and end on top of Boeing in just 2 months, but it also had to scrap orders a month later which turned the tables. The total order inflow for both jet makers, combined, has been roughly 25% lower in the first 10 months of this year. Many analysts are expecting a slowdown in order inflow. Up until June, there was no slowdown visible, but after the month of July, the challenging environment to accumulate orders has become visible. I think order inflow could fall by as much as 5-20% this year, where Airbus is likely to perform worse than last year.

      "title": "Arrival in Europe — Copenhagen, Denmark",
      "text": "Arrival in Europe - Copenhagen, Denmark \nCopenhagen, Denmark \n\nWe flew in a beautiful Boeing 787 Dreamliner on Norwegian air to Copenhagen. We really appreciated how quiet the flight was and the fact the atmosphere is denser so we didn't feel as fatigued or dehydrated. Everyone got some sleep, even Leo who after being convinced he wouldn't sleep was sawing wood. We got very nicer treatment from the flight attendant giving everyone the breakfast food even though it wasn't included with our ticket.\nUpon arrival in Copenhagen we got through customs quickly and proceeded to get a couple of wonderful double espressos from \"Joe &amp; the Juice\" - yum! Then we headed right over to the Lego store located at the airport. The boys were very happy and saw some sets they had only see in catalogs, never in person before. \nWe still had several hours before our flight to Paris so we decided to take the Metro into the Copenhagen city center. On the Metro we met a nice young man named Robert who recommended we have some herring and salmon. He also mentioned after hearing we are going to Rome later in our trip that Catholics are a very small population here in Denmark, about 44K out of 5M people. \nGetting to Copenhagen via Metro was VERY easy and we went straight to the canal area and found a lovely restaurant, Skipperkroen, to have herring and salmon. The spicy herring and smoked salmon were our favorites. \n\n",

      "title": "Boeing Uses Drones and Hololens to Take On Wildfires | Digital Trends",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAircraft manufacturer Boeing is looking to help revolutionize the fire-fighting business by implementing two contemporary pieces of technology — drones and augmented reality. The idea is to use the drones for tracking the progress and status of fires, while the augmented reality headsets give coordinators a unique perspective on their progress. \nOne of the biggest issues with dealing with wildfires is that both the fires themselves, and the teams combating them, can be hard to keep track of. With thousands of acres potentially alight or at risk and hundreds or even thousands of people helping to put the flames out, tracking all the activity can become disorientating, adding to the inherent danger that firefighters face. \nBoeing’s system is designed to reduce those risks by utilizing tracking and camera feeds from the unmanned drones and holograms in augmented reality to visualize all of the data in an easy-to-digest manner (thanks NextReality ). \nMore: The best drone you can buy \nThe drones are able to use infrared cameras and other sensors to provide a unique, real-time map of a fire’s progress, as well as the location of any teams fighting fires on the ground. Boeing then made its 2D mapping system known as INEXA Control, compatible with Microsoft’s Hololens augmented reality headset. That allows for a 3D map that gives a bird’s-eye view of the situation and even allows for the controlling of drone paths through the software. \nOne of the big advantages of using AR is that the operators can work in a real-world space with other people around them, making it easy to continue communicating with people, and to continue interacting with other headset users in the same room. \nAs it stands, the software can only control a handful of drones at a time, but in the future it could handle whole fleets autonomously, or at the behest of a human operator. The hope is that one day these drones will take over the roles of human pilots and will be able to perform missions that would not be possible, or would simply be too dangerous to complete by traditional means. \nBoeing plans to leverage this software for all sorts of large-scale reconnaissance work. Other expected applications include monitoring shipping and train loads, and enabling farmers to survey their fields from a real vantage point. ",

      "text": "Boeing Unit Wins $559M Air Force Contract to Upgrade Radars by Zacks Equity Research Published on December 01, 2016 Trades from $ 3 The Boeing Co. ’s ( BA - Free Report ) business unit, Defense, Space & Security, has won a modification contract from the U.S. Air Force to upgrade F-15 Combined APG-63 Version 3 Radar Improvement Program Version 3 and APG-82 Version 1 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) radar. Contract Details The contract is valued at $558.5 million. It was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Per the contract, Boeing will procure, install, supply initial spares and provide support for 42 Version 3, and 29 RMP radars.Work is scheduled to be complete by Jan 15, 2019. The company will execute the work in St. Louis, MI. The contract will use fiscal 2015 and 2016 procurement funds. \nBOEING CO Price BOEING CO Price | BOEING CO Quote What’s APG-63 and APG-82? APG-63 is an all-weather multimode radar system designed by Raytheon Company ( RTN - Free Report ) for the F-15E air superiority fighter. It boasts multi-role capability, long-term support, and future growth options. The APG-63 Version 3 radar offers powerful, adaptable radar technology, with established performance and strategic flexibility. This innovative, highly reliable technology is compatible with the F-15C and F-15E aircraft.The APG-82 Version 1 optimize the F-15E’s multirole mission capability. It includes extended-range, superior multi-target tracking and precision engagement potential. This version also provides enhancement of system reliability over the legacy F-15E APG-70 radar. This unique level of reliability and maintainability will help the Air Force generate cost savings. Why Boeing? Boeing is the manufacturer of the F-15. The company has received several contracts from the Pentagon in the past to install the APG-63 Version 3 radar on its F-15C/D jet fighters and APG-82 radar systems on its F-15E fighter-bombers. With the installation of these radar systems, high-resolution ground-mapping data has been enabled in the F-15, which helps crews identify targets at great distances and increases situational awareness, lethality and survivability.The company witnesses a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon and other international customers. It is one of the major players in the defense business. Its defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Price Movement Boeing’s stock has improved about 2.45% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks Categorized Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 10.82% over the same time frame. This could be because Boeing continues to face challenges from the uncertainties related to high-cost programs, risks related to key project executions, order cancellations as well as stiff competition.

      "text": "Dec 1, 2016 5:29pm Image: Boeing \nThe Competitive Carriers Association (CCA), which represents T-Mobile US, Sprint and scores of other smaller U.S. operators, has come out against Boeing’s proposal to operate a non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) system in the 37.5-42, 47.2-50.2 and 50.4-51.4 GHz bands, saying it threatens spectrum for terrestrial 5G operators. \nBoeing filed an application last summer with the FCC to launch and operate an NGSO fixed satellite service (FSS) system operating in low Earth orbit (LEO) in the 37.5-42.5 GHz, 47.2-50.2 and 50.4-52.4 GHz bands, collectively known as the V-Band. In so doing, it's putting its hat into the same ring as companies like OneWeb and SpaceX. \nThe problem, according to the CCA, is that spectrum is already undergoing comprehensive review in the commission’s Spectrum Frontiers proceeding, where the rules and policies will serve as the cornerstone for 5G services. \n“The Commission has yet to resolve the technical challenges it foresees with this valuable spectrum, and it makes little sense for the FCC to prematurely act on Boeing’s request until the Spectrum Frontiers proceeding is settled,” said Steven K. Berry, president and CEO of CCA, in a press release . “The FCC should deny Boeing’s request which would only further complicate the analysis of these bands and disadvantage competitive carriers and their consumers. This is a pure and simple ‘spectrum grab’ attempt that should be rejected.” \nIn its application , Boeing acknowledged that the proposed system would operate in the same V-band spectrum as 5G systems and said it believes technological advances make possible the sharing of spectrum. Plans call for the initial constellation to consist of 1,396 LEO satellites operating at an altitude of 1,200 kilometers and eventually growing to 2,956 NGSO FSS satellites. \nThe CCA argues that allowing Boeing the freedom to operate a new NGSO system in the requested GHz bands would be counterproductive to assuaging the “spectrum crunch.” \n“Boeing should not be allowed to ‘cut in line’ and gain access to this important 5G spectrum when data use and demand on mobile networks continue to increase exponentially,” Berry said in the statement. “I encourage the FCC to deny Boeing’s untimely application and to focus on the Spectrum Frontiers proceeding to resolve outstanding allocation, operational and sharing issues related to these valuable spectrum bands.” \nRELATED: Boeing responds to ‘errors’ and ‘flawed assumptions’ about its proposed satellite system in 37/39 GHz band \nBoeing recently filed correspondence with the FCC in order to correct what it deemed to be several foundational errors and significantly flawed assumptions that some commenters had made regarding its proposed satellite system. It attempted to address concerns brought up by the likes of T-Mobile, Samsung, CTIA, Straight Path Communications and Nokia. \nStraight Path in particular has opposed Boeing’s plans, saying geostationary satellite orbit systems are about 100,000 times less efficient in providing broadband access than terrestrial systems and that terrestrial broadband will continue to expand its reach into areas where it wasn’t economically viable in the past. Last year, Straight Path said it was developing a 5G phased-array transceiver prototype in the 39 GHz band and it expected to complete its work within 12 to 18 months with hopes of using the prototype to demonstrate the viability of using 39 GHz for 5G services.

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nAircraft manufacturer Boeing is looking to help revolutionize the fire-fighting business by implementing two contemporary pieces of technology — drones and augmented reality. The idea is to use the drones for tracking the progress and status of fires, while the augmented reality headsets give coordinators a unique perspective on their progress.\nOne of the biggest issues with dealing with wildfires is that both the fires themselves, and the teams combating them, can be hard to keep track of. With thousands of acres potentially alight or at risk and hundreds or even thousands of people helping to put the flames out, tracking all the activity can become disorientating, adding to the inherent danger that firefighters face.\nBoeing’s system is designed to reduce those risks by utilizing tracking and camera feeds from the unmanned drones and holograms in augmented reality to visualize all of the data in an easy-to-digest manner (thanks NextReality ).\nMore: The best drone you can buy\nThe drones are able to use infrared cameras and other sensors to provide a unique, real-time map of a fire’s progress, as well as the location of any teams fighting fires on the ground. Boeing then made its 2D mapping system known as INEXA Control, compatible with Microsoft’s Hololens augmented reality headset. That allows for a 3D map that gives a bird’s-eye view of the situation and even allows for the controlling of drone paths through the software.\nOne of the big advantages of using AR is that the operators can work in a real-world space with other people around them, making it easy to continue communicating with people, and to continue interacting with other headset users in the same room.\nAs it stands, the software can only control a handful of drones at a time, but in the future it could handle whole fleets autonomously, or at the behest of a human operator. The hope is that one day these drones will take over the roles of human pilots and will be able to perform missions that would not be possible, or would simply be too dangerous to complete by traditional means.\nBoeing plans to leverage this software for all sorts of large-scale reconnaissance work. Other expected applications include monitoring shipping and train loads, and enabling farmers to survey their fields from a real vantage point.\nSelf-flying firefighting choppers could keep humans out of harm's way Apple may introduce augmented reality functionality into the iPhone’s camera Is the AI apocalypse a tired Hollywood trope, or human destiny?",
