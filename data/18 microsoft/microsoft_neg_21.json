      "text": "Microsoft, NVIDIA Collaborate on Enterprise AI (MSFT, NVDA) By Richard Saintvilus | November 16, 2016 — 7:07 AM EST \nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become the new buzzword among tech companies aiming to dominate the consumer home market, but the enterprise remains relatively untapped. And few companies are in better position to service that corporate need than Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ), which has dominated the enterprise with its Office and Windows franchises. \nOn Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant announced a partnership with NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) to accelerate AI in the enterprise, with the use of Microsoft's commercial cloud platform Azure serving as the hub. (See also: How Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Affect Investing .) \n\"Every industry has awoken to the potential of AI,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. \"We've worked with Microsoft to create a lightning-fast AI platform that is available from on-premises with our DGX-1 supercomputer to the Microsoft Azure cloud. With Microsoft's global reach, every company around the world can now tap the power of AI to transform their business.\" \n\"We're working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world's most pressing problems,\" said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. (See also: Microsoft's Quest for Market Share in Online Collaboration Space .) \nThe companies explained that their joint efforts will allow corporations to take full advantage of AI not only to make better decisions but also to offer new products and services faster and provide better customer experiences. The companies said their collaborative efforts have created \"the fastest, most versatile AI platform,\" adding that \"AI is now within reach of any business.\" \nIn a statement, the two tech giants pointed out that artificial intelligence has a place in almost every environment, regardless of market. Industries such as health care, life sciences, energy, financial services, automotive and manufacturing are benefiting from deeper insight on extreme amounts of data, the company's said. \nMicrosoft shares, which have risen 6.11% year to date, closed Tuesday at $58.87, while NVIDIA, which has risen 161% this year, closed at $86.19.

      "text": "LinkedIn Deal May Spur More Large-Cap Software, Internet M&A   Microsoft Corp. submitted concessions to European Union antitrust officials examining its takeover of professional social network LinkedIn Corp., which may allow the deal to win early-stage approval. \nEU spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said regulators extended their deadline to rule on the deal to Dec. 6. The office software giant had until Nov. 15 to submit so-called remedies to the EU’s merger watchdog to allay any potential competition concerns. The EU didn’t provide further details and Microsoft representatives declined to comment. \nConcessions made in the early stage of the EU’s review, including asset sales, can help regulators approve a deal without opening an investigation of at least four months. Microsoft and LinkedIn have said they plan to close the deal this year. \nSalesforce.com Inc., which was outbid by Microsoft’s $26.2 billion offer for LinkedIn, has urged the EU to take a closer look at the deal. Microsoft’s control of LinkedIn’s “unique dataset” of professionals may allow it cut off rivals’ access to that data, the company said. The EU was also looking at whether   could allow Microsoft reap key insights from LinkedIn data that would aid sales of its other products. \nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has voiced concerns about how technology companies’ control of data might strangle competition. In the Microsoft-LinkedIn review, regulators would look at whether “the data purchased in the deal has a very long durability and might constitute a barrier for others, or if they can be replicated so that others stand a chance to enter the market,” Vestager said in June. “We’ve done that kind of analysis in the past and it’s something we’re generally paying a lot of attention to.” \nMicrosoft escaped extended EU merger probes when it bought Nokia’s handset unit and videoconferencing service Skype.",

      "text": "Samsung teams up with Microsoft to enable C# developers to build apps for Tizen Samsung today announced a partnership with Microsoft on open source projects like .NET Core and Xamarin.Forms to provide .NET support for Tizen. What this means is that C# developers can now build apps for Samsungs Tizen devices. Tizen is a nascent operating system based on Linux. It currently powers more than 50 million Samsung devices. Samsung has released the first preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen which enables .NET developers to easily create applications for smart TVs, wearable devices like the Gear S3, Tizen-powered smartphones and Internet of Things devices. The first preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen supports mobile app development with device emulators as well as an extension to Visual Studio which provides full IntelliSense and debugging support. Through thoughtful and progressive collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung is expecting to create unique development experiences for both Tizen and C# developers, enriching the Tizen ecosystem, said Seung-hwan Cho, Executive Vice President and Deputy Head of Software R&D Center at Samsung. The company is going to add support for smart TVs, wearables and other IoT devices to this tool in future releases. Samsung confirms that Tizens .NET support is going to be officially released and shipping on its devices, including smart TVs, starting next year.",

By: FE Online | Updated: November 16, 2016 8:29 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with Co-Chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates during a meeting in New Delhi. (PTI) \nBill Gates, Microsoft Corporation co-founder and Co-Chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, today met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. Gates, who is on an India visit met PM Modi ahead of government’s think tank Niti Aayog’s initiative to strengthen states. During the meeting, they had discussions on various topics. Gates was scheduled to address India’s top policy makers as part of Niti Aayog’s lecture series on ‘Transforming India’. \nLater in the day, Gates also met Niti Aayog vice chairman Dr Arvind Pangariya and CEO Amitabh Kant before addressing Niti Lectures: Transforming India – the first part of this event was inaugurated by PM Modi in August. \nBehind inviting Gates as a guest speaker at the event, government’s premier think tank’s motive was to bring the increasing use of technology in government’s policies to build a strong Indian economy and bolster its infrastructure. \nDuring the program, Gates delivered a lecture over the use of technology as India is heading towards the digital finance after government’s efforts to wipe out black money from the country. \nGates visit is happening even as the demonetisation drive of the government has brought the public onto the streets in front of ATMs and banks in an effort to get their hands on cash as well as deposit the now banned Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. However, this has also proved to be a windfall for digital payments business in the country. \nHere are the excerpts from Bill Gates’ lecture at Niti Aayog’s ‘Transforming India’: \n* Technology a key lever for transformation! Strong Innovation ecosystem needed to build products for the future The world is looking to India not just to solve its problems but to address global challenges through innovation: @BillGates #NITILectures pic.twitter.com/sxX6PWoeGh \n— NITI Aayog (@NITIAayog) November 16, 2016 \n* In any country government should be an enabler and a smart regulator to enable the private sector to deliver efficient services across sectors \n* The world is looking to India not just to solve its problems but to address global challenges through innovation  ",

      "text": "Microsoft offers EU concessions over its $26 billion LinkedIn bid Updated: November 16, 2016 — 5:03 AM EST Share Mail icon \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Alexandra Hudson) Published: November 16, 2016 — 3:52 AM EST | Updated: November 16, 2016 — 5:03 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Used with permission Image courtesy of Microsoft. \nToday The Linux Foundation is announcing that we’ve welcomed Microsoft as a Platinum member. I’m honored to join Scott Guthrie, executive VP of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise Group, at the Connect(); developer event in New York and expect to be able to talk more in the coming months about how we’ll intensify our work together for the benefit of the open source community at large. \nMicrosoft is already a substantial participant in many open source projects and has been involved in open source communities through partnerships and technology contributions for several years. Around 2011 and 2012, the company contributed a large body of device driver code to enable Linux to run as an enlightened guest on Hyper-V. Microsoft has an engineering team dedicated to Linux kernel work, and since that initial contribution, the team has contributed improvements and new features to the driver code for Hyper-V on a consistent basis. \nOver the past two years in particular, we’ve seen that engineering team grow and expand the range of Linux kernel areas it’s working on to include kernel improvements that aren’t specifically related to Microsoft products. The company is also an active member of many Linux Foundation projects, including Node.js Foundation, R Consortium, OpenDaylight, Open API Initiative and Open Container Initiative. In addition, a year ago we worked with Microsoft to release a Linux certification, Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate Linux on Azure . \nThe open source community has gained tools and other resources as Microsoft has open sourced the .NET Core, contributed OpenJDK, announced Docker support in Windows Server, announced SQL on Linux, added the ability to run native Bash on Ubuntu on Windows , worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure, and open sourced Xamarin’s software development kit and PowerShell. The company supports Red Hat, SUSE, Debian and Ubuntu on Azure. Notably, Microsoft is a top open source contributor on GitHub. \nThe Linux Foundation isn’t the only open source foundation Microsoft has committed to in 2016: in March, the company joined the Eclipse Foundation. A Microsoft employee has served as the Apache Software Foundation’s president for three years. \nLinux Foundation membership underscores what Microsoft has demonstrated time and again, which is that the company is evolving and maturing with the technology industry. Open source has become a dominant force in software development--the de facto way to develop infrastructure software--as individuals and companies have realized that they can solve their own technology challenges and help others at the same time. \nMembership is an important step for Microsoft, but it’s perhaps bigger news for the open source community, which will benefit from the company’s sustained contributions. I look forward to updating you over time on progress resulting from this relationship.",

      "text": "69 shares \nIn 2001, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer described Linux as a “… cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.” And this week, in 2016, Microsoft announced that it’s joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. WTF. \nAt face value, it’s the type of news that could only really make sense in 2016. Watch Live \nBut it shouldn’t come as that much as a surprise. While Microsoft has been known for its proprietary software, like Windows and Office, it had a bit of damascene conversion since the start of the decade, and is now an enthusiastic contributor to open source. \nIn 2012, it was one of the top 20 contributors to the Linux Kernel , accounting for 1 percent of all source code commits. In 2014, it open sourced the .NET Core Framework , and in the following year it did the same with Visual Studio Code . It has also assisted in the development of a number of other high-profile open source projects including Hadoop and Samba. And of course, earlier this year it worked with Canonical to port Bash to Windows . \nTl:DR: Microsoft is a changed company. Gone are the days of “Embrace. Extend. Extinguish.” This latest news is just an exclamation point on the above. \nAccording to Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, Microsoft’s membership of the Linux Foundation means that it will be “better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.” \nThere’s another key bonus to the Linux Foundation from Microsoft’s Membership. It’s joining under a platinum membership, which means it’ll be paying annual dues of $500,000 annually. That’s a lot of money to fund development, management, and outreach. Other platinum members include Cisco, Fujitsu, HPE, Huawei, IBM, Intel NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, and Samsung. \nIt would be easy to write off this move as mere altruism, and I think to an extent it’s partially driven by that. But I also realize that the development of Linux is in Microsoft’s best interests, especially given the importance of Microsoft Azure to the company’s long-term plans. \nI rather like this new Microsoft.",

Microsoft Joins The Linux Foundation As A Platinum Member Written by Michael Larabel in Microsoft on 16 November 2016 at 10:48 AM EST. 17 Comments Microsoft announced at their 2016 Connect event today they are joining the Linux Foundation. Microsoft is becoming a Platinum Member of the Linux Foundation -- the highest tier of membership for companies interested in supporting Linux. The platinum members of the Linux Foundation currently include Cisco, Fujitsu, HP Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, and Samsung. Becoming a platinum member also earns Microsoft a seat on the Linux Foundation board of directors. This announcement comes after Microsoft keynoted at LinuxCon earlier this year and the slew of Linux/open-source announcements out of the Redmond company since Satya Nadella took over as CEO.More details at LinuxFoundation.org .",

      "text": "Microsoft \nIf 2016 weren't weird enough already, here's something else to add to the notion that the end times are approaching: Microsoft is embracing Google, Apple, Samsung and even the free Linux operating system in ways it never has before.\nHere's the quick rundown of the news, coming out of the Microsoft Connect event for programmers:\nMicrosoft will be joining the Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux. Microsoft spent much of the '90s fiercely competing with Linux , seeing it as a threat to the dominance of Windows, so this is a notable deal. Microsoft is also releasing a public preview edition of its previously-announced SQL Server database product for Linux . Google is joining the steering committe of the .NET Foundation, the independent nonprofit that Microsoft set up in 2014 to oversee the community around the .NET Programming Framework, its very popular set of technologies for building software, particularly software for businesses and for the web. Samsung is working with Microsoft to let programmers use .NET to develop apps for Tizen operating system, popular on Samsung smart TVs and other gadgets made by the South Korean company. Last, but not least, Microsoft will be releasing a version of Visual Studio for Apple's Macs . Microsoft accidentally revealed this news earlier this week when it published a blog entry ahead of schedule. Julia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate VP of the developer division, says ever since the company embraced open source technologies and a more partner-friendly attitude , it's been winning over converts who may otherwise never have looked at Microsoft products.\n\"We're really finding fans everywhere,\" Liuson says.\nMicrosoft \nFor instance, she says, a team at Google is using Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's free lightweight code editor, to build the Chrome browser. That's gives Microsoft some major brownie points, given Google's reputation as one of the arbiters of cool in Silicon Valley's programmer scene.\nWhich brings us back around to that veritable mountain of announcements. The whole point is to take Microsoft's improving image in the developer world, and solidify it by making some lasting, formal partnerships.\n'Better than the picture' Another Google example: Liuson says the team behind the Google Cloud platform kept reaching out to Microsoft with questions about .NET, because their own customers wanted to use it to build their software. Now, Google is officially helping steer the future of .NET, ideally making it better for customers of both companies.\n\"We're really building one of the biggest and the most robust ecosystems,\" says Liuson.\nSimilarly, for the last few years, Microsoft has loved trotting out a picture of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaiming his love for the Linux operating system. It's the first image in this article.\nWhile Linux never caught on as a proper competitor to Windows or Mac on PCs, it's the operating system of choice for many millions of servers in the world, and Microsoft supports it in its Azure cloud to great enthusiasm.\nMicrosoft \nNow, by signing on as a member of the Linux Foundation, it just proves to the world that its love is real, which has the nice benefit of helping Microsoft prove to developers that Azure is committed to supporting Linux.\n\"We have something better than the picture,\" Liuson says.\nAlong those lines, Visual Studio for Mac — based heavily on the Xamarin Studio product, which Microsoft got in its purchase of Xamarin earlier this year — is a play to appeal to those many programmers who mainly code on their Macs, but might benefit from some Microsoft technologies. \nThe bottom line is, Microsoft is showing a willingness to work with competitors and their platforms if it makes developers, still the company's most important customers, happy. When those customers are happy, they spend more time on Microsoft's playground. And with these announcements, they're committing to fair play.\n\"The excitement is real,\" Liuson says.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to use Microsoft's new Paint 3D \n",

      "text": "Microsoft Uses Minecraft To Teach Kids To Code By Chance Kinney · On November 16, 2016 \nCode.org runs a program called Hour of Code, which aims to make computer programming more accessible and fun for students across the nation. The core of the program are coding tutorials disguised as bite-sized games. Unlike most games, students must input a string of commands beforehand, then watch as their character does what they told them to do — and find success, hopefully. Students learn how to think in terms of programming, making the program invaluable in grabbing the attention of young girls and minority students who might otherwise stay away from learning about programming. \nWhile anyone can learn from an Hour of Code tutorial, they’re made mostly for kids. And, as we know, kids love Minecraft . Yesterday, Microsoft and Code.org released a brand new Minecraft -themed tutorial. It’s not the first one — they already have one Minecraft tutorial that had kids play the game using programming commands. This new tutorial puts kids into the role of the developer — step by step, Minecraft Hour of Code Designer introduces basic commands that game developers use to spawn creatures into games and tell them how to act. At the end, kids have enough tools to develop their own mini- Minecraft level. \nHour of Code was founded on the idea that an hour of coding practice can help get kids interested in and prepared for a career in programming. The tutorials don’t always take an hour, but they usually allow for some kind of free play at the end to let kids be creative, as the Minecraft Designer tutorial does by letting kids build their own levels. All of the tutorials can be found on Code.org for free, and can easily be understood and accessed by teachers who want to introduce coding to their students. \nThis is only the latest way Microsoft has used Minecraft to help teachers and students. The company released Minecraft: Education Edition to teachers in June of this year, which can be used to teach lessons in a broader base of subjects. ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nLast week, Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14965 to PCs and phones in the Fast ring . Today, the company announced availability of that build for PCs in the Slow ring too. \nWhile Fast ring builds are at the bleeding edge of Windows 10 development, the Slow ring is reserved for those who like to test previews but who prefer more stable builds. The last build to head to PCs in the Slow ring was in early October; build 14931 was the first Slow ring preview of the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update , previously referred to by its development codename, Redstone 2. \nBut there's still no sign of a Creators Update preview for Windows 10 Mobile devices in the Slow ring. The most recent Insider Preview for phones in the Slow ring was build 14393.448 - but that build was from the Redstone 1 development branch (now known as the Anniversary Update ). \nThe Windows 10 Creators Update is expected to be released for all PCs, phones and other devices early next year .

      "text": "Microsoft joins Linux Foundation in another nod to open-source code Originally published November 16, 2016 at 10:23 am Microsoft on Wednesday said it had joined the Linux Foundation alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. (Ted S. Warren/The Associated Press) The move is the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility. Share story Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter \nMicrosoft has joined the Linux Foundation, the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility. \nThe foundation helps advise the development of the Linux and other software tools built on open-source terms that allow the community to freely use and modify software. Microsoft on Wednesday said it had joined the foundation on its most expensive tier of corporate membership, alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \nLinux, which former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once called a cancer, was for years one of Microsoft’s biggest rivals . The free-to-use operating system was seen for a time as the primary threat to expensive, proprietary Windows. \nWindows won the battle for the personal computer, but didn’t fare so well in the broader debate about the value of open-source versus proprietary technology.

      "text": "You are at: Home » Technology » Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Technology Archrivals turn friends as Microsoft officially joins the Linux foundation No, it isn’t April Fools Day as Microsoft announces the next version SQL Server for Windows and Linux, Google joins .Net foundation and Microsoft announces release of Visual Studio for Apple’s Macs. \nNo today the Sun didn’t rise from the West nor is it April Fool day but you have got to stomach this news : Microsoft today announced that it is joining the Linux Foundation . Archrival Microsoft which hated open source till its current CEO Satya Nadella took over the helms is now joining its nemesis of a kind. \nThe fact remains that Linux was developed to fight Microsoft’s closed source architecture and break its hegemony over desktop computing. Microsoft will be joining the Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux. If you are an old timer, you will remember Bill Gates run Microsoft spent much of the ’90s fiercely competing with Linux, seeing it as a threat to the world dominance of Windows. \nMicrosoft is also releasing a public preview edition of its previously-announced SQL Server database product for Linux. Microsoft’s announcement in March, that it was bringing its flagship SQL Server database software to Linux came as a major surprise. But no one suspected the Redmond-based company would go a full circle embrace that which it hated the most, open source. \nComing back to the SQL Server database for Linux, if you are interested, you can download it here . This public preview is part of the launch of the next version of SQL Server, which will be the first one that’s available for both Windows and Linux. \nThere are more surprises this 16th morning. Google has joined the Microsoft owned .Net foundation. .NET Foundation, the independent nonprofit that Microsoft set up in 2014 to oversee the community around the .NET Programming Framework, and Google will be joining its steering committee. Another one for your, Samsung and Microsoft will be collaborating to bring .NET architecture to Samsung’s homegrown Tizen operating system. Tizen operating system is used in Samsung smart TVs and other gadgets made by the South Korean company and .Net applications may bring further Apps and development. \nThe last surprise for today, Microsoft will be releasing a version of Visual Studio for Apple’s Macs. Microsoft accidentally leaked this news earlier this week when it published a blog entry ahead of schedule. \nAs we said, life has come a full circle for Nadella run Microsoft. He has already announced that Windows 10 may be the last operating system in Windows line so we can expect that Microsoft is secretly working on some Linux+Windows project for a future operating system. We can also expect an amalgamation of closed source Microsoft architecture with open source Linux one to bring consumers the best of the two.",

      "text": "\nLast week, Microsoft released a new build of Windows 10 to Windows Insiders in the Fast Ring. The build, 14965, introduced a big new feature: a virtual touchpad for Windows tablets. With the virtual touchpad, Windows 10 users are able to control external monitors connected to their Windows 10 tablets such as the Surface Pro 4 without having to connect an external mouse. In addition to these updates, Microsoft also brought Sticky Notes’ Insights features to more countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, France, and India.\nThe update introduced a couple of other improvements for Windows Ink: the Recently Used apps now shows 6 apps and users can also now access their pen settings very quickly. The update also improved the loading time of Windows Ink’s Sketchpad, and the protector in Windows Ink can now be shrunk/expanded using your mouse’s scroll-wheel.\nWindows 10 Build 14965 includes some other bug fixes and performance improvements, which are always nice to see. The build is only available to Windows 10 PC users part of the Windows Insider program’s Slow Ring. Microsoft is yet to release Windows 10 Mobile Build 14965 to Windows Insiders in the Slow Ring, but that might arrive shortly. Additionally, it is worth noting that Microsoft is yet to provide the official ISO files for Windows 10 Build 14965, but that will likely arrive soon, too.\nIf you are interested, you can find the full changelog for Windows 10 build 14965 here.

Microsoft makes 'commitments' to EU over LinkedIn deal 0 Share: \nMicrosoft in June bought professional networking site LinkedIn for $26 billion. Photo by Sergei Konkov/TASS \nMicrosoft made commitments to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion acquisition of professional networking site LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday. \nThe commission declined to provide further details. Microsoft declined to comment. \nThe concessions come after EU regulators expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, reported Reuters . The commission will rule on the deal by December 6. \nIn June, Microsoft announced plans to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , its biggest ever acquisition. For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal furthers its plan to become an essential provider to businesses of cloud-based services, including its Office 365. Salesforce was also reportedly interested in making a bid for LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft submitted its LinkedIn acquisition for EU regulatory approval in October , after already receiving approval from authorities in the US, Canada and Brazil. Its up to the EU Commission to either approve the deal, along with these new commitments, or open a full investigation into Microsoft's purchase.",

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nHome Depot fell 3.6 percent to $123.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 144 new highs and 28 new lows.

      "text": "REUTERS - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's flagship cloud service, Azure. OpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies.\nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp co-founder Reid Hoffman.\nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December.\nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations.\n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. (http://bit.ly/2gdxifR)\nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities.\nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years.\nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.\n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru)",

During installation, users are offered the possibility to choose the additional components they want to setup, depending on the task they want to achieve: Office , SharePoint or Web developer tools, Silverlight development kits or Microsoft Foundation Classes for C++. Due to the large amount of files and data that need to be configured, it takes several minutes until installation completes (depending on the performance of the host PC). This IDE supports several programming languages frequently used by developers and webmasters: C/C++, VB.NET, C#, and F#, whereas downloading and installing extra utilities can bring support for Python and Ruby. Users can also develop JavaScript, CSS, XML/XSLT or HTML/XHTML projects within Visual Studio. Not only can developers start their apps from scratch, but they can also modify their existing source code or look for syntax errors. Bugs can be fixed due to the built-in debugger that can be used both as a source-level and as a machine-level one, meant to support managed code and native one developed in any supported programming language. Due to the complexity of Visual Studio, the type of projects that can be created is equally varied, so specialized tools are provided: web and class designers, creator of forms for GUI apps and a database schema builder. Although it runs on Windows OS, Microsoft Visual Studio does not restrict its users when it comes to the platform they can develop on: Windows Mobile, Windows CE, Silverlight, .NET Framework or .NET Compact Framework. In other words, when developers want to create a specific type of interface or app, they can find the proper tools within Visual Studio to ensure their project is bug-free and runs smoothly.

This really is part of major shift by Microsoft in recent times. At its Connect 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft announced it is joining The Linux Foundation. And the company isnt joining just to say it did: Microsoft is joining at the Platinum level, the highest level of membership, which costs $500,000 annually. John Gossman, architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will sit on the foundations Board of Directors and help underwrite projects. Microsoft Takes Platinum Membership at The Linux Foundation [venturebeat.com] 6:28 pm on Nov 16, 2016 (gmt 0) \nposts: 2912 votes: 12 Microsoft is drifting away from their Windows only approach. Since a year their Visual Studio 2015 development suite is capable of cross compiling applications for Android, MacOS and iOS and they announced two days ago that a future release of Visual Studio will be available as native application on MacOS. It looks like their focus has shifted from desktop/office to cloud/azure where the platform to connect to Azure doesn't matter. In that vision Linux, Android and MacOS are just as important as Windows. Giving away Windows 10 for free to Windows 7/8 owners already showed that end-user operating systems aren't their money maker anymore. Besides that, more Microsoft employees are contributing to open source projects than Google employees. It is really amazing which silent transition the company has gone through in the last few years. Seems to be one of the best kept secrets in the industry :)",

      "title": "LSU Microsoft Campus Agreement FAQ",
      "text": "LSU Microsoft Campus Agreement FAQ What’s New Concerning LSU Licensing Microsoft Products? In June of 2010, Louisiana State University renewed the LSU Microsoft Campus License Agreement (CLA). This is a licensing program from Microsoft targeted toward higher education institutions, designed to help them effectively acquire Microsoft products. Microsoft originally developed this model of licensing in 1998 and since then many universities have taken advantage of the program for faculty/staff use. The CLA program basically allows the university to pay a “per-head” amount and then be able to have any of its faculty and staff use the software, and then there are addendums to the program that allows universities to license their student populations as well. LSU now has coverage, under the new CLA, for faculty, staff and students. What is the Microsoft Campus License Agreement (CLA)? It’s a licensing program from Microsoft targeted toward higher education institutions, designed to help them effectively acquire Microsoft products. Microsoft originally developed this model of licensing in 1998 and since then many universities have taken advantage of the program for faculty/staff use. The CLA program basically allows the university to pay a “per-head” amount and then be able to have any of its faculty and staff use the software, and then there are addendums to the program that allows universities to license their student populations as well. LSU now has coverage, under the new CLA, for faculty, staff and students. What Products are Covered Under the LSU CLA? Who Can Use These Products? This varies by whether you are a LSU Faculty / Staff Member, or an LSU Student. Generally, both subsets of the user community have access to the Basic Desktop – This includes an upgrade to the most recent Operating System, the Office Suites (for both Intel and Macintosh systems), and Client-Access-Licenses (CALs) which allow a computer to interact with a variety of server-based products – some of which are deployed already at LSU and some which may be in the future. Beyond the Basic Desktop – Faculty & Staff have access to FrontPage (a webpage development tool), Visual Studio (a collection of programming tools), and OneNote (a note-taking tool). Students have access to OneNote only, as this was the choice of products the students selected to be paid for by STF at this time. The Faculty & Staff package is what has been deployed at LSU, for participating departments, for the past several years and ITS felt it best to maintain availability of this toolset as it was expanded across campus. The decision to add OneNote for Faculty & Staff is on a pilot basis for this year, to see if the tool has value to Faculty & Staff users as well, especially those who may interact with students who will use the software in their learning. For a list of products currently covered under the campus agreement please refer to: LSU Microsoft Campus License Agreement . Why is Broader & More Complete Coverage Important to LSU? Broader and complete coverage of the entire LSU community ensures a common infrastructure across those who choose to use the Intel/Microsoft personal computing platform. Previously, there were ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ in terms of having needed software tools, and the most modern versions of those tools. Now, everyone in the LSU community will have access to these valuable tools which form the basis of a solid IT infrastructure. Which LSU Campuses are Participating in this CLA? Baton Rouge Campuses – A&M, Law, and AgCenter all are participating. Shreveport and Alexandria are also participating to cover their Faculty & Staff Only. TigerWare will distribute the software for the A&M, Law, and AgCenter campuses ONLY . Will Having the CLA Help with IT Security? Yes . Having the latest available operating systems on Intel desktops that use them will mean that we can ensure that all desktops are at the most current levels, and thus best positioned to secure the integrity of our environment and help minimize the impact of various worms and viruses that periodically appear on the internet. Had all systems at LSU been running the most recently available and patched versions of Microsoft Windows operating system this past August, the impact of the worm that hit campus would have been negligible. As it was, several machines in key areas (where the operating systems were not current) were impacted significantly. Why Did LSU Pursue a Broader Licensing Agreement for Microsoft Products? LSU pursued a broader licensing agreement for two basic reasons: First, building a solid, consistent software infrastructure across all users of Intel/Microsoft platforms is one key element critical to the ultimate success of information technology at LSU. Second, the students communicated a desire to see STF investments be focused in the area of software availability (responding to student requests) and to also provide something very tangible students could use and take with them from their experience at LSU. Where Can We Get the Software? Software will be distributed electronically, via the web, from the new TigerWare software distributor. http://tigerware.lsu.edu . What About Macintosh Users? Microsoft Office Suite products for the Mac (Entourage, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) will be available as well. However, since Macintosh systems do not use the Microsoft Operating System, this part will not be applicable. What About Linux / UNIX Users? None of the Microsoft software runs on Linux / UNIX systems. Does this mean I don't have to buy Microsoft Windows when I buy my computer? No , you still must buy the operating system when you buy a new computer. The CLA only provides for upgrades to a previously purchased operating system license. Intel computers come bundled with an operating system, though users of Linux often request a \"no operating system\" hardware device. But if you intend to use a Microsoft OS on a computer you're buying, you have to buy this component. You don't need to buy the application products, such as the Office Suite. Does this mean I don't have to buy Microsoft programs like Office Suite & OneNote when I buy my computer? Yes , you need no longer purchase these products 'bundled' on your new computer purchase. In fact, this will save you a great deal of money! Simply order the system with only the operating system, and then download the Microsoft applications you want, covered under LSU's CLA, from TigerWare. If a computer vendor tells you that \"these applications are bundled at no additional charge\" press harder on them, as it is not the case that these software products are given away; their costs are rolled into the overall bundle price. Be a sharp consumer and take advantage of this new deal for LSU affiliates -- don't buy software you can get for free on campus! As mentioned above, however, the operating system from Microsoft must still be purchased on any computer 'bundle' you acquire -- just not the other products. For products that aren’t covered under the agreement, can we still get them under the educational discounts? Yes . Not all Microsoft products are covered under the agreement (e.g., Visio, FrontPage for students, etc.). LSU still has discounts available for other Microsoft products. Information about these products and how to get them under discount programs can be found on TigerWare as well. Also, Microsoft is exploring what other, additional software products available in their ‘free-ware’ product set that may be of use for broader distribution. ITS will communicate developments in this regard as they emerge. Does This Mean That LSU Plans to Standardize on the Microsoft Windows Operating System & Microsoft Programs and Discourage the Use of Other Products? No. Not at all. The reason for acquiring the CLA is to allow for standardization WITHIN the Microsoft software toolkit, so that users that are using this company’s products can have access to the most popular ones, and get the latest versions/upgrades without paying an additional amount. By eliminating the problem of supporting multiple versions of Microsoft operating systems and applications, and facilitating the most modern software for users who choose this company’s products, LSU will gain significant support benefits. Strategically, the Office of the Chief Information Officer and ITS envision a diverse computing platform and software environment consistent with an “IT Abundance” model. What Other Software Does LSU Have Covered with Licensing Agreements or Special Pricing Deals? There are a host of products spanning the spectrum of applications for which LSU has broad-based licensing, or for which there are free-ware/share-ware/open-source products. To see what all is available across a number of application areas, visit TigerWare online at: http://tigerware.lsu.edu . Can LSU Faculty & Staff Members Use These Products on their Home Computers? Yes . The CLA allows faculty & staff to use the products not only on their office computers, but for work purposes on their home computers. Faculty & Staff should be aware that home use is allowed for work purposes only. Are Part-time LSU Faculty, Staff, & Students Also Able to Take Advantage of this Licensing Agreement? Yes . Again, for Faculty and Staff wishing to use the software at home for work purposes, you will have to acknowledge understanding of the Licensing Conditions. Can Visitors to LSU Use the Software? (Guests who are here for conferences or other temporary assignment.) No , only appointed or enrolled members of the LSU community can access TigerWare and download and use the software. Do Many Universities Have Such an Agreement with Microsoft, or Is This a New Thing? Microsoft originally developed this approach to licensing their products in 1998, working closely first with Indiana University and then with the University of Texas system. Since that time, the CLA has become the standard licensing model for higher education. While perhaps as many as 4 in 5 of colleges and universities nationally have a CLA covering part or all of their faculty and staff use, a much smaller number (under 3 in 10) provide coverage for their entire student populations. In fact, of LSU’s Flagship peers, both regionally and nationally, less than 1-in-5 offer a total faculty/staff/student license. LSU is now among the leaders nationally in offering this key IT infrastructure capability. And LSU is one of only a handful of schools doing online distribution of software, and the only school that distributes licensed software 100% online. Article ID:",

      "text": "You can now Skype without a user account \nRose Behar \nNovember 16, 2016 8:00am \nMicrosoft is now allowing people without Skype accounts to use all of the platform’s video and audio features on the web. \nTo take advantage of the new feature, users can head to Skype.com where they’ll be able to hit the prominent “Start conversation” button . \nThe website will then request the user’s name, as well as microphone and camera privileges and take them to a dedicated conversation web page, where a temporary 24-hour link is displayed that can be shared with those that they’d like to invite to the conversation. Users of the tool can group chat with up to 300 people total or up to 25 on a voice/video call. \nUnfortunately, it appears the option is only available via desktop, with no option to “Start a conversation” appearing on the mobile or desktop version of my mobile Chrome browser. \nAdditionally, features like calling landlines or Skype Translator still require an account. Regardless, it’s an interesting step forward for the platform, and one that’s sure to interest more potential users.",

      "title": "Microsoft says Linux is no longer 'cancer,' joining Foundation",
      "text": "By James Walker 10 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has seemingly completed its transition to being a company that cares about open-source by joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. The move would have been unthinkable for the famously closed company only a few years ago. Microsoft's relationship with the open-source Linux community is notorious for being almost non-existent. Former CEO Steve Ballmer once described Linux as a \"cancer\" that threatened to obscure Microsoft's proprietary closed-source software. In recent years, the company has transformed itself. Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has embraced open-source Linux projects, bringing some of its most important software for developers to the platform and publicly showing slides confessing a \"love\" for Linux. Today, it reached a milestone in its endorsement of the platform. At its annual Connect(); developers event in New York, Microsoft announced it is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. It joins companies including Samsung, Qualcomm, Oracle, Intel, Huawei and IBM in the platinum rank, paying $500,000 a year for the privilege. Facebook and Google are amongst those in the lower Gold position. Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation's executive director, alluded to the \"old\" Microsoft's approach to Linux in a comment to TechCrunch . \"This may come as a surprise to you, but they were not big fans,\" he said. The Microsoft of today takes a very different view. Even three years ago, Microsoft joining the Foundation would have been unthinkable. It has transformed itself in just a few years though, becoming an active contributor to some of the largest open-source projects. Microsoft has contributed to Node.js, the Open Container Initiative and the R Consortium, amongst many others. It has also open-sourced large parts of its formerly proprietary .NET platform and brought its PowerShell scripting environment to Linux. Today, it announced another of its most important products is coming to the platform. SQL Server for Linux is available in preview today, making Microsoft's popular database engine available to Linux developers. Microsoft's newfound commitment to open-source is a product of a company-wide push to make its services available to as many people as possible. When it open-sourced PowerShell in August , it noted how it's operating in a \"multi-platform, multi-cloud, multi-OS world.\" After years of treating Linux as a malignant \"cancer,\" Microsoft has been forced into realising it's no longer enough to write closed software for Windows systems and charge a fixed fee for it. Much of the rest of the industry moved away from that model years ago and Microsoft is now catching up with the times. \"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,\" said Scott Guthrie , Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Executive VP. \"By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.\" Microsoft's endorsement of open-source software has been welcomed by most community members. There remains some scepticism though, particularly around its long-term commitment and its wider intentions. Zemlin noted an \"anti-establishment sentiment\" remains around open-source projects but suggested Microsoft's wide-ranging work with Linux over the past few years suggests it's genuinely trying to get involved. Alongside the announcement today, Microsoft also launched the release candidate of Visual Studio 2017 , the next-generation version of its advanced software development environment for Windows. The company has focused on streamlining and optimising Visual Studio, making it faster and more productive for developers. It also unveiled a preview version of Visual Studio for Mac . While it doesn't include all the features of its Windows counterpart, the Mac version again marks the importance Microsoft places on bringing its software to every platform.",

      "text": "Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Swati Khandelwal You won't believe your eyes while reading this, but this is true. Microsoft just joined the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member. Microsoft's love with open source community is embracing as time passes. At its first Connect event in 2013, the company launched Visual Studio 2013. A year later, Microsoft open sourced .NET, and last year, it open sourced the Visual Studio Code Editor, as well. Not just that, Microsoft partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu on Windows 10 , worked with FreeBSD to develop a Virtual Machine image for its Azure cloud , and chosen Ubuntu as the OS for its Cloud-based Big Data services. And the big news for this year is… At its 2016 Connect developer event in New York today, Microsoft announced that the company is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member – the highest level of membership, which costs $500,000 annually. Besides this, Microsoft also announced that tech giant Google has also joined on with the independent .NET Foundation. The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux, alongside advances open technology development as well as commercial adoption. Microsoft has already contributed to a number of its open source projects, including Node.js Foundation, Open Container Initiative, OpenDaylight, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative. However, today's announcement from Microsoft still comes as a surprise to many, as Former Microsoft Chief Steve Ballmer once said, \" Linux is a cancer ,\" in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times . Here's what Microsoft said in its latest announcement for joining the Linux Foundation: \"As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem.\" Microsoft believes its latest move will benefit its customers through increased collaboration and innovation. Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, also acknowledged the company's move to work more closely with the open-source community, saying: \"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people. Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.\" Other Linux Foundation Platinum members include Cisco, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Qualcomm, Samsung, Fujitsu, HPE, and NEC. While Gold sponsors include Google, Facebook and more than a dozen other prominent open source users.",

      "text": "SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens Offers visibility control. \nPress Release Summary: \nNovember 14, 2016 - \nAvailable in both tabletop and immersive mode, SketchUp Viewer provides access to the most critical pieces of information for making vital project decisions. With SketchUp Viewer, users can view models that are published to their holoLens device via AR|VR extension for SketchUp Desktop, unit enables re-scaling, moving and rotating model as desired. Offering anchoring and re-anchoring in physical environment, device offers 3d view. Trimble Navigation Ltd. - Alpharetta, GA Trimble's New SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens Enables Users to Inhabit and Experience Designs Press release date: November 7, 2016 \nSketchUp with Mixed Reality Ushers in New Paradigm: Experiential Design Review \nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) launched today its SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens. The new mixed-reality solution allows users to virtually inhabit and experience their designs to improve quality, communication and efficiency in the design, construction and operation of buildings. SketchUp Viewer is the first extensible commercial HoloLens application available in the Windows Store. \nThe announcement was made at Trimble Dimensions . \nSketchUp is the world's most widely used 3D modeling software for architects, engineers, design and construction professionals as well as members of the global maker community. \nDemonstration Highlights Design and Collaboration Scenarios \nDuring the Trimble Dimensions keynote, Trimble, Microsoft and architect Greg Lynn demonstrated how the SketchUp Viewer solution could improve design and construction processes. Using HoloLens, architects were able to experience SketchUp models in mixed reality, as holograms placed in the real world—enabling them to quickly analyze various \"what if\" design scenarios in the context of the physical environment. The demonstration also illustrated how using Trimble solutions with HoloLens holographic technology enables remote teams to effectively review and collaborate in order to resolve constructability issues in real time. \nGreg Lynn leveraged Trimble's mixed-reality solution and Microsoft HoloLens to re-imagine the Packard Plant—a historic, abandoned automobile factory in Detroit. The architectural project was commissioned as part of the U.S. Pavilion at the 2016 Venice Biennale exhibition in Italy. \n\"Trimble mixed-reality technology and Microsoft HoloLens bring the design to life and bridge the gap between the digital and physical. Using this technology I can make decisions at the moment of inception, shorten the design cycle and improve communication with my clients,\" said Greg Lynn. \nThe emergence of mixed-reality technology is enabling new workflow processes for the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) market. Trimble's mixed-reality solution gives users the ability to understand and communicate complex spatial conditions in one comprehensive and immersive experience. The combination of SketchUp with mixed reality ushers in a new paradigm: Experiential Design Review—the ability to inhabit and experience design and construction projects in the most natural way possible. \n\"Empowering people to design and communicate better in 3D is part of our DNA. Across the SketchUp platform, we are dedicated to the idea that technology should get out of the way of our users,\" said Chris Keating, general manager of Trimble's SketchUp. \"With SketchUp Viewer, we are taking another big step toward delivering the ultimate experience for designers and their clients—the experience of inhabiting their own work.\" \nTrimble's SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens \nMicrosoft HoloLens is the world's first self-contained, holographic computer that provides a mixed-reality experience for a range of commercial and consumer applications. HoloLens extends interaction with 3D models beyond the confines of a 2D computer screen, creating new ways for the many stakeholders of complex, multi-phase construction projects to visualize, collaborate, share ideas and manage change. \n\"We are thrilled to work with Trimble to deliver new innovation to SketchUp, one of the most widely used applications in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations industry,\" said Lorraine Bardeen, general manager of Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Experiences. \"SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens can dramatically improve collaboration, decision making, efficiency, quality, and safety by giving users the unique ability to bring digital content into the real world, real-time as part of their current workflow.\" \nWith SketchUp Viewer, users can view models that have been published to their HoloLens device via the newly launched AR|VR Extension for SketchUp Desktop; they can browse and download models from Trimble's 3D Warehouseor they can pull project files down from Trimble Connect, a cloud-based collaboration platform. Users then have the option to place a model within their physical environment. \nIn Tabletop mode, models can be scaled as needed to best fit the available space or specific design review requirements. While the experience is intended to mimic viewing a physical scale model, it maintains the flexibility and the dynamic nature of a digital model. Users can re-scale, move and rotate the model as desired. Models can be anchored and re-anchored in the physical environment, so designers and engineers can walk around the project and examine it from any vantage point. \nWhat truly differentiates SketchUp Viewer from any other product on the market is the ability for users to transition seamlessly to an immersive experience. Mixed reality enables unique opportunities to overlay physical models in real world environments; and as a completely untethered device, HoloLens allows users to move freely as they inhabit their digital surrounds. \nIn both Tabletop and Immersive mode, SketchUp Viewer allows users to do more than just look at the model. The application provides access to the most critical pieces of information for making vital project decisions and gaining consensus among project stakeholders. The Entity Info feature gives users access to important Building Information Modeling (BIM) data embedded within project components; and with the Tape Measure functionality, users can pull up dimensional information from the model. Users can also control the visibility of various aspects of the model by toggling layers on and off. \nReal-time, remote and co-located collaboration are key elements to the experiential design review process in SketchUp Viewer. With multiple HoloLens devices, a group of users can load the same model, engaging a \"see what I see\" collaboration mode. Remote collaborators can communicate via real-time audio and use mixed-reality visualization \"sight-guides\" to better understand who in the group is looking at what. \nAvailability \nSketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens is available now from the Microsoft Windows Store. For more information, visit: www.sketchup.com/viewer . A new AR|VR extension for SketchUp Desktop, which enables users to publish models directly from their desktop to the Microsoft HoloLens, is available from SketchUp's Extension Warehouse.

      "text": "Follow https://www.flickr.com/photos/epicfireworks/8058678846/ \nToday Microsoft announced some MAJOR changes to the SQL Server 2016 product. As of SQL Server 2016 SP1, which ships today, from a programmability perspective there is no difference between the editions anymore. All programmability features will be available in all editions from LocalDB to Enterprise edition (there’s a couple of exceptions for various reasons which I’ve tried to notate below). What’s Included? \nThis includes features such as table partitioning, Hekaton, ColumnStore, distributed partitioned views, Change Data Capture, Change Tracking, etc. will work everywhere. Basically the goal of this change was to make it so that you can deploy your database via a deployment script on any edition of SQL Server and it would just work, no matter if you are deploying on Express or Enterprise edition. \nThere’s some realistic exceptions to this. Chance Data Capture won’t work in Express Edition or LocalDB for example due to the fact that these editions don’t include the SQL Server Agent. \nThis is a huge improvement for software vendors as they can now use all the features of SQL Server 2016 SP1 and above without needing to require that their customers buy Enterprise Edition. \nYou may be asking yourself why would I buy Enterprise Edition after this announcement? The reason to buy Enterprise Edition hasn’t really changed. Most people didn’t buy Enterprise Edition to get any of these features. Customers typically buy Enterprise Edition to get access to more than 16 cores and to more than 128 Gigs of RAM. This will still be the case moving forward. If you need to run SQL Server on massive hardware at massive scale, if you need scale out HA using Always On Availability Groups, or Virtualization installation rights (also known as host based licensing), then you will still need to purchase SQL Server Enterprise Edition. But Why? \nThe next question is “why is Microsoft doing this”? The reason is that Microsoft wants to make life simpler for people that develop software. They want to make it so that ISVs can install their software using a single codebase. They can start their customers on Express Edition, and as the customer grows they simply upgrade their instance to Standard Edition, then later to Enterprise Edition without having to have the customer make ANY changes to the application database. Just buy the new SQL Server license and to a SKU upgrade. \nPersonally I don’t see this taking any Enterprise Edition license sales away from Microsoft (remember that Microsoft is in business to sell software). The primary reasons for buying Enterprise Edition are still there. There’s probably a couple of people that won’t need to buy Enterprise Edition, which is fine. Now they’ll be happier customers because they only need to buy the right sized license for their workload. \nAll this will be available in CTP1 of SQL Server v.Next (it doesn’t have a name yet) which also ships today. Why Much RAM? \nWhen it comes to In Memory OLTP (Hekaton) and ColumnStore there’s probably some questions about how much memory you can use for editions other than Enterprise Edition. The rule will be that Hekaton and ColumnStore will each be allowed to use 25% of the memory cap, and this memory will be outside of the memory cap. So if you are using SQL Server Express edition which has a 1 Gig cap for SQL Server pool memory today, you’ll be able to use an additional 256 Megs of RAM for Hekaton and an additional 256 Megs of RAM for ColumnStore. For Standard Edition you can use 128 Gigs of RAM for pools and an additional 32 Gigs of RAM for Hekaton and an additional 32 Gigs of RAM for ColumnStore. When using these features this effectively gives you a 50% increase in the amount of RAM you can use with these down-level editions. \nWith PolyBase there’s an additional note. If you need scale out of PolyBase where you scale the PolyBase configuration out to a scale out farm the head node of the farm needs to be Enterprise Edition, however the worker nodes of the PolyBase farm can be standard edition. This is a massive cost savings for those using PolyBase for huge amounts of data processing. If you don’t need the scale out feature of PolyBase and just need normal PolyBase support within SQL Server that will be available in all editions other than LocalDB. Wow! \nJust wow, I can’t imagine the work that went into getting this change in place. And I’m not talking about the technical work to get this far, but the work of getting all the various people in management to approve such a radical change of taking what we have traditionally called “Enterprise Edition” features and moving them into not just Standard Edition, but into every edition of SQL Server 2016 SP1. This is just huge. \nNow there’s a few things which aren’t quite done yet because they’re going to take some more work, so we’ll hopefully see these changes rolling into SQL Server 2016 in later CUs or SPs. \nIn the meantime, enjoy the new features once you patch your SQL Server 2016 servers to SP1. \nIf you are running an older version of SQL Server don’t look for a new service pack that’ll back port these features to your older version. The only way that you’re getting that to happen is with an upgrade to SQL Server 2016. If you are looking for a consulting partner to help you with those upgrades, might I recommend Denny Cherry & Associates Consulting . We are available to assist you with those projects right away. \nDenny ",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 16, 2016, 1:33 P.M. ET Alphabet: Machine Learning Push Shows Edge on Amazon, Microsoft, Says Baird By Tiernan Ray \nR.W. Baird ’s Colin Sebastian today reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) after attending a press event that the Google division held in San Francisco yesterday, during which it made several announcements about its cloud computing system, and came away reassured in his view “that Google would ultimately be able to differentiate its enterprise offering from competitors by leveraging advanced ML capabilities and monetize ML through a range of business services.” \nOne highlight of the presentation was Google saying it will place a “new Google Cloud Machine Learning group” in the hands of Fei-Fei Li and Jia Li , whom it called “two world-renowned researchers in the subject of machine intelligence.” It also said it would make available several GPU graphics chip offerings from Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) for customers who want to do cloud workloads on those rather than on a standard microprocessor. \nGoogle can have an edge over Microsoft ’s ( MSFT ) Azure and Amazon.com ( AMZN ) with enhancements to machine learning and artificial intelligence, says Sebastian: We believe that Google can enhance the value of GCP by leveraging the company’s advanced ML/AI capabilities, and potentially differentiating enterprise services from competitors such as AWS and Azure. Importantly, Google has demonstrated some of the most advanced applications of ML to-date in areas including core Search, voice recognition, language translation, image recognition, and data center power usage, to name a few. As more companies look to extract value from large data sets, there will be a significant increase in demand for ML functionality, and we believe Google is very well positioned to provide some of the most advanced tool sets.",

      "text": "  \nThe Supreme Court of India, the highest judicial forum under the Constitution of India, has directed Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo to block all pre-natal sex determination advertisements hosted by them, as per a report by LiveLaw . \nThe SC bench asked the search engines to do so within 36 hours of a nodal agency of the Centre pointing out to them each such advertisements. The nodal agency to be appointed will also be empowered to receive complaints from the general public. Once any violation is brought to the notice of the nodal agency, it shall inform the search engines and they, after receiving the information, are obliged to delete it within 36 hours and inform the nodal agency. \n“Whether one is going to have a boy or a girl, that kind of information is not necessary in India. The sex ratio is going down in the country and we are concerned about that. Whether you are making money or not we are not concerned with that.” \nAccording to the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994, sex determination of the foetus is prohibited in India. The PNDT Act came into force to crack down on female foeticide, and bans the propagation of pre-natal sex determination. \nThe apex court will further hear the matter on February 17 but the interim arrangement would continue till this issue pertaining to advertisements relating to pre-natal sex determination was debated upon before it. \nThe counsels appearing for the companies shared that they have complied with the earlier order passed in the matter according to the provisions of the act, however, contended that the matter requires further debate.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nThis week, Microsoft is hosting its Connect() developer conference, where it's already made a series of announcements for software creators on all platforms. In addition to joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member , there was plenty of news about its Visual Studio tools too. \nVisual Studio for Mac made its official debut today, and a release candidate of its new Visual Studio 2017 suite has also been released. On top of that, the company introduced its new Visual Studio Mobile Center, a range of cloud services and tools to help developers build and manage their mobile apps. \nMicrosoft describes VS Mobile Center as \"a mission control for mobile apps that brings together all the cloud and lifecycle services\" needed to enable smooth mobile development. Devs can use it to build, test, distribute and monitor their apps, as well as adding backend cloud services, with the ability to scale them to meet any number of users. \nKey features available at launch include: Build your apps automatically with every pull request Test apps on thousands of real-world devices Distribute passing builds to beta testers Monitor apps for crashes and bugs Learn about real world usage with mobile analytics Connect to a mobile backend for automatic scaling and to add important cloud services like offline data sync, tabular data storage, and end-user authentication services \nMicrosoft is already working on further additions, including \"expanded platform support for Cordova and the Universal Windows Platform, as well as additional cloud services such as push notifications and advanced analytics\". Next year, Mobile Center will also integrate new and existing HockeyApp and Test Cloud apps. \nTo begin using the Visual Studio Mobile Center preview, you can request an invitation now . Once you're approved, you'll be able to sign in with your login details from HockeyApp, GitHub or your Microsoft Account. Tags",

      "text": "Enterprise × Microsoft Connect (); 2016 Recap By Joseph Hill November 16, 2016 Xamarin Platform \nWe just started a few hours ago, but Microsoft Connect (); 2016 is already a huge success. In addition to our onsite attendees, hundreds of thousands of developers are watching live through Channel 9 , and during the keynote, we made major announcements across our Cloud, Data, and Developer tools and services. \nI’d like to talk in a bit more detail about the announcements that mean the most to you, as Xamarin developers. The Announcements Visual Studio for Mac (Preview) \nWe’re excited and proud to introduce Visual Studio for Mac, the latest member of the Visual Studio family. Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS-based IDE focused on building apps for mobile to cloud and will be extremely familiar if you’ve used Xamarin Studio. I’ve taken Xamarin Studio’s robust mobile C# development experience and iOS and Mac support, and, with Visual Studio for Mac, extended it to the cloud and added support for .NET Core. \nVisual Studio for Mac (Preview) includes support for building native Android and iOS apps with C# and F#, just like Xamarin Studio, but also adds ASP.NET Core support. Upcoming releases will improve and add support for more programming languages, including first-class support for CSS, HTML, ASP.NET Razor, JSON and JavaScript editing experiences. \nXamarin Studio and Visual Studio for Mac can coexist happily on the same machine, so take it for a spin and let us know what you think. For more information, please see our announcement on the Visual Studio Team Blog and the Visual Studio for Mac (Preview) page . Visual Studio Mobile Center (Preview) \nAfter several months in private preview, I’m thrilled to be able to announce a Preview of Visual Studio Mobile Center to the world. Mobile Center is our new mobile cloud service for mobile developers, a “mission control for mobile apps.” Developers can use Mobile Center to build, test, distribute, and monitor apps from a single, integrated console. \nThe current preview includes the following services: Build : Continuous integration and release management Test : Automated testing on real devices Crash Reporting : Real-time crash analytics Distribution : Deployment to enterprise users or test groups Analytics : Business / usage metrics Authentication : Easy integration with popular authentication systems EasyTables : Create simple cloud-based storage in under 15 minutes \nThe current Mobile Center preview works with Android and iOS apps built in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin, and React Native. In future versions, we’ll add more services and support for UWP and Cordova apps. \nFor more information and request an invitation to join the Preview, please read Nat’s post on the Visual Studio Team Blog . \nNew Xamarin GA features : Some of you may have tried these in preview over the past few months, and we thank you for your feedback and input. We’re proud to announce that the following features are now generally available and fully-supported: The Remote iOS Simulator provides Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers with a remote view to simulated iOS apps, allowing them to stay focused and productive, without having to leave their IDE to work with the app on a Mac. Xamarin Profiler allows Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers to find memory leaks, resolve performance bottlenecks, and add polish to their apps before shipping. Xamarin Inspector is an interactive tool that enables Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers to attach to their running application and diagnose and prototype changes live. Users can explore the UI and state of their application, alter its state, or even try new APIs on the spot. Xamarin Workbooks let you explore C# through rich and interactive contextual experiences for Android, iOS, Mac, WPF, or Console, and get instant live results as you learn these APIs. Great for experimenting, teaching, training, or exploring development in C#. Appium Support in Xamarin Test Cloud \nAfter a successful private preview, we’re pleased to announce general availability and full support for Java via the Appium framework in Xamarin Test Cloud. We designed Xamarin Test Cloud to work for any app, in any language, and we want it to work for any developer, too. Our customers have had great success authoring their Xamarin Test Cloud tests in Ruby and the Calabash framework or C# with Xamarin.UITest. But, we know a lot of you may prefer Java, and we want you to be comfortable and able to ship your mobile apps with confidence. With Appium support, Java developers everywhere can now take advantage of real, automated mobile device testing on 400+ configurations to get the productivity and quality benefits of real device testing. You can learn more about this and Test Cloud’s future as part of Visual Studio Mobile Center in our post here. \nWant to learn more? Watch the event live , and don’t forget to join us for Day 2, when we’ll dive deeper into the products, including those announced on Day 1, and Day 3, which is a full day of FREE training from Xamarin University and Microsoft Virtual Academy.

      "text": "By Justin Raczak November 16, 2016 Xamarin Test Cloud \nAt the Microsoft Connect(); keynote in New York this morning, we made some significant announcements about Xamarin Test Cloud, namely that we now support the Appium framework and that Visual Studio Mobile Center (Preview) is the next generation of Xamarin Test Cloud. \nA mission control for mobile apps, Mobile Center has all of the lifecycle and cloud services you need to ship high quality app faster. Mobile Center is the future of Xamarin Test Cloud and we could not be more excited about the new possibilities ahead of us. \nAs we’ve said many times before, Test Cloud was designed to help accelerate a continuous integration workflow. This direct integration into the rest of the lifecycle toolchain will enable us to deliver value to our users in brand new ways. \nIn light of today’s announcement, I wanted to take a moment to shed some light on what Xamarin Test Cloud users can expect as we continue the move to Mobile Center. The Xamarin Test Cloud You Know \nWe know many of you depend on Test Cloud for your day-to-day operations. To avoid any interruption for you and your team, the existing Xamarin Test Cloud product will continue to function as it does today. All features in both the service itself and our test frameworks (Calabash and Xamarin.UITest) will be supported until we seamlessly transition you and your apps to Mobile Center when it GA’s next year. Getting access to Mobile Center \nIn order to engage early with our users and begin gathering feedback, we have made Mobile Center available as a limited preview. During the preview period, Mobile Center is not considered suitable for production apps, which means that existing apps in Test Cloud cannot be synced with Mobile Center at this time. While you are welcome to request access today, note that you will need to create a new account and recreate your existing apps. At the end of the preview, we’ll provide a simple and painless way to migrate your entire operation to Mobile Center. Welcoming Appium to the Lineup \nWhile new feature development going forward will be delivered in Mobile Center, we wanted to provide Test Cloud users one long-awaited feature—today we are excited to announce support for Appium. Appium’s popularity has risen at meteoric rates over the past two years and the project has quickly become a household name in test automation. We will initially offer support for Appium tests written in Java with JUnit and will continue to expand support for other programming languages as we see demand to do so. To request support for other languages, vote for the feature in our request portal. \nAppium works with your existing Xamarin Test Cloud subscription and will work seamlessly in Mobile Center once you have made the move in the future. Simply follow the instructions in the test run dialog to instrument your project with the requisite libraries for Test Cloud. To the Future \nThe team at Xamarin has always been mission-driven to make it fast and easy to deliver incredible mobile experiences. We’re incredibly excited by the potential of this new chapter and hope you are, too. As always, we welcome all questions and feedback, so please sign up for Mobile Center now and let us know what you think! Written on November 16, 2016 by Justin Raczak",

      "text": "Microsoft Corp. kicked off its third annual Connect(); developer conference in New York today with an announcement that would’ve hardly been believable five years ago: It’s joined the Linux Foundation .\nThe move marks the latest milestone in CEO Satya Nadella’s ongoing campaign to foster closer ties with the open-source community. Microsoft previously joined several Linux Foundation sub-groups as part of this push, including the OpenDaylight network automation effort and the Open Container Initiative to develop a common runtime standard for microservices-based applications. The company even launched a few projects of its own along the way to try and change its reputation as a proprietary-minded software company.\nAmong others, Microsoft has released the code for its .NET development framework along with a cross-platform version that works on Linux. The operating system and the foundation that bears its name stand at the very center of the firm’s open-source efforts. One of the areas where Satya Nadella’s focus on the platform has been most pronounced is the public cloud, where the software giant is aggressively competing for Linux workloads. Microsoft added support for more than a half dozen distributions to its Azure infrastructure-as-a-service suite over the past few quarters, including flavors from Red Hat Inc. and other key competitors.\nThe software giant should be able to continue its open-source efforts more easily as an official member of the Linux Foundation. Microsoft is joining at the Platinum participation tier, which only features nine other companies and carries a $500,000 annual fee. John Gossman, an architect with its Azure division, will join the The Linux Foundation Board of Directors as part of the move. His appointment will enable the company to take part in shaping the group’s organizational roadmap and become more directly involved in projects such as Opendaylight that are important to its long-term plans.\nImage courtesy of Microsoft ",

      "title": "Microsoft Drops Tech Bombshell As It Joins Linux Foundation",
      "text": "by Rob Williams — Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Microsoft Drops Tech Bombshell As It Joins Linux Foundation \nUp until Satya Nadella took the reigns at Microsoft , it wasn't a secret that Redmond company didn't take too kindly to Linux . The situation has sure changed over the past couple of years, though. Even the company's massive Azure platform supports Linux, and a couple of months ago, it ported its popular PowerShell admin tool to the Penguin-fueled platform. \nBut now the company has officially fortified its interest in Linux by joining the Linux Foundation as a top-tier Platinum member. It joins the likes of Intel , Samsung , IBM , Cisco, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm , NEC, and Huawei. This even gives Microsoft a better standing than Google , a company that has had Linux running through its veins for many. \nBeing an official part of the Linux Foundation could mean big things for Microsoft's enterprise efforts, as those who might not have taken the company too seriously in the past should be forced to change their tune now. Microsoft wouldn't have made a decision like this in haste: to progress further, this bolstering of its image in the Linux realm can sure help. \nScott Guthrie, Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise Group says, \"As a cloud platform company we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know\", so the company's focus is clear. With this move, John Gossman, the Chief Architect for Azure, will be joining the Linux Foundation's Board of Directors. \nIt's noted that Microsoft already contributes to a variety of Linux-specific projects, including Node.js and the Open API initiative. \nJim Zemlin, the Executive Director at the Linux Foundation, gives Microsoft a nice pat on the back, \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nThe future of enterprise Linux is going to be very, very interesting. Who would have seen this coming a decade ago?",

With the new My Saves searching feature, you can save where you found them by hovering on the video result and clicking ‘Save.’ Then decide later which will be the crowd pleaser. This action saves that searched item to ’My Saves’ where you can come back and view it later when it’s convenient for you.” Bing’s My Saves \nThe same functionality is extended to image searches where users can “go to the image source to research prices, purchase the item or, when you’re at the store for the item, use the image to get to the web source and ensure you get the right item.” \nWhile similar to Microsoft’s browser Edge which allows users to save Reading List across devices such as Windows phones and Windows 10 PCs, the new My Saves for Bing has the potential to reach an even broader audience not being tied strictly to Windows. Perhaps, ‘My Saves’ gets more people using Bing across devices. In this story stream:",

      "text": "(Adam Bettcher/Getty) \nMicrosoft Cortana — a virtual assistant picking the winner of every NFL game on Bing — cooled off in Week 10, going 7-7 picking the outright winner of each game. The average showing brought its overall record to 81-65 (55%). \nThis week, there are only three teams favored on the road, and Cortana and Vegas only disagree on one game. Vegas likes the Dolphins in Los Angeles, whereas Cortana gives the Rams a slight advantage. \nThe most interesting game of the weekend might just be the Cardinals and the Vikings, as both teams are in desperate need of a win. Vegas calls this came a pick-em, but Cortana thinks the Vikings — losers of four straight — will win. \nElsewhere, Cortana likes the Colts to beat the Titans and the Seahawks to beat the Eagles. \nAs always, Cortana only picks the outright winner of each game. It does not make picks against the spread, though we like to include the point spread (in parentheses, courtesy of Vegas Insider ) for comparison. You can find Cortana's predictions by searching \"NFL schedule\" on Bing (picks made prior to the Thursday night game). \nNew Orleans Saints at Carolina Panthers (-3.5) — Panthers 67% chance to win Tennessee Titans at Indianapolis Colts (-3) — Colts 57% chance to win Jacksonville Jaguars at Detroit Lions (-6.5) — Lions 75% chance to win Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Kansas City Chiefs (-7.5) — Chiefs 74% chance to win Chicago Bears at New York Giants (-7.5) — Giants 69% chance to win Arizona Cardinals at Minnesota Vikings (PK) — Vikings 57% to win Buffalo Bills at Cincinnati Bengals (-3) — Bengals 60% chance to win Baltimore Ravens at Dallas Cowboys (-7) — Cowboys 77% chance to win Pittsburgh Steelers (-8) at Cleveland Browns — Steelers 75% chance to win Miami Dolphins at Los Angeles Rams (+1) — Rams 52% chance to win New England Patriots (-13) at San Francisco 49ers — Patriots 83% chance to win Green Bay Packers at Washington Redskins (-2.5) — Redskins 64% chance ton win Philadelphia Eagles at Seattle Seahawks (-6.5) — Seahawks 73% chance to win Houston Texans at Oakland Raiders (-5.5) — Raiders 66% chance to win NOW WATCH: LeBron James swears by this unusual workout class to keep in shape \n\nMore From Business Insider \nThe Seahawks exposed the Patriots' biggest weakness \nThe NFL just passed its first post-election ratings test, but there are warning signs ahead \nTampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans says he sat during national anthem to protest Donald Trump",

      "text": "tweet \nMicrosoft will change how patches and updates are delivered to devices running Windows 7 or Windows 8 starting tomorrow. \nWe have talked about the push towards all-in-one (cumulative) Windows updates in August when the company announced the change. \nThere is a bit of light and a lot of shadow when it comes to the new system that Microsoft has used for Windows 10 ever since the operating system launched. \nBefore we look at those, lets recap what changes and how that may affect your updating strategy. October 2016 Windows updating changes for Windows 7 and 8 \nMicrosoft moves from a one patch per issue update model to a cumulative update model known from Windows 10. \nThe company plans to release two patches in total for devices running Windows 7 or 8: the first is a cumulative security update that includes all security patches of the given month. \nThese security updates can be downloaded from Microsoft’s Update Catalog . \nAdditionally, a single cumulative update is made available each month that includes all security and non-security updates. This update is made available via Windows Update, but also as a download from the Update Catalog. \nFor managed systems, updates are also available through WSUS or SCCM. \nThese monthly rollups are cumulative which means that they include all patches that were added to previous rollup updates. Microsoft plans to integrate all available patches — that were published prior to October 2016 — eventually as well so that a single monthly rollup patch installs all patches released for Windows 7 or 8. \nMicrosoft will make available certain updates separately. This includes update for Microsoft’s .NET Framework, and for Internet Explorer 11. \nAdditionally, driver updates won’t be included in those patches , and out-of-band security updates will be published as soon as they are available. They will be added to the next monthly rollup patch and security update automatically. \nMicrosoft references a third update, called monthly quality rollup. This is a preview update that will include fixes that will be included in the next monthly rollup, and it will be released on the third Tuesday of each month. \nMicrosoft will release it as an optional update on WSUS, Windows Update Catalog and Windows Update. The new update strategy Second Tuesday of a month : Microsoft will release a single security update containing all patches for a given month but only through WSUS and the Windows Update Catalog. Second Tuesday of a month : A monthly rollup update is released that contains all security and non-security fixes, including all updates from previous monthly rollups. These are released through WSUS, Windows Update Catalog and Windows Update. Third Tuesday of a month : A preview of the upcoming monthly rollup is released. This is classified as an optional update, and is available through Windows Update, WSUS and the Windows Update Catalog. What’s good about the change \nIf you look at the new patching strategy you will notice that patching will get easier on first glance provided that things work. \nUsers who update Windows through Windows Update need to install a single patch instead of several. This may be especially useful when a new system is set up as it may take a while for patches to be retrieved on first use of Windows Update. The downside \nMicrosoft’s new patching strategy is quite problematic for system administrators and many end users. The past has shown for instance that Microsoft does release patches every now and then that cause issues on the operating system. Some issues caused blue screens or endless reboot loops. \nUsers could remove the update responsible for that once it was identified, but that is no longer possible when the new updating system hits. \nThis means that you need to uninstall an entire month worth of security updates, or a monthly rollup update, to resolve the issue. \nThis leaves the system vulnerable to patched security vulnerabilities that did not cause any issues on the device. \nConsidering that it sometimes takes weeks or even longer to produce a working patch, this could leave systems vulnerable for a long time. While that is bad enough, it gets worse. \nIf you don’t trust Microsoft enough because of its actions in the past year — Get Windows 10 or Telemetry are two headwords — then you may not want those cumulative updates. The reason is simple: you cannot block updates that you don’t want anymore. \nIf Microsoft would have launched the new patching strategy earlier, no one would have been able to block Get Windows 10 updates and Telemetry updates from being added to a running Windows 7 or 8.1 system unless Windows Update would have been turned off completely prior to the release. \nAnyone who wants control over which updates get installed or removed cannot do that anymore. It is either all or nothing, with no middle-ground. \nSince the organization will typically be deploying only the security-only fix, see the previous section for full details. In cases where there is a need to deploy one or more non-security fixes, manually approve the latest monthly rollup that contains the needed fixes. This monthly rollup will contain other fixes as well, so the entire package must be installed. Your options \nSo what are the options that you have? There are three: Use Windows Update and install a single cumulative Monthly Rollup patch that includes security and non-security updates. Disable Windows Update , and download Security Patches through Microsoft’s Update Catalog. Disable Windows Update and don’t download and install any patches. \nIf you pick option 1 , you get every update that Microsoft includes in the monthly rollup patches. This includes all security updates, all feature updates and fixes, but also every Telemetry, privacy-invasive or next generation Get Windows 10 update the company produces. \nIf you pick option 2 , you get all security updates but may still run into issues with these patches.You do need to download and install those manually through Microsoft’s Update Catalog though, as you can’t use Windows Update for that anymore. \nYou won’t get feature updates, and likely won’t get the majority of updates that you don’t want either. Microsoft did include non-security patches in security updates in the past, which means that there is a theoretical chance that you still get unwanted updates. \nOption 3 finally leaves your system vulnerable because of missing security updates. It is however the only option to avoid any unwanted updates on the device. \nIf you need additional information, Woody over at InfoWorld has you covered. What Organizations may do \nOrganizations may join Microsoft’s Security Update Validation Program (SUVP) to validate updates before they are released publicly. \nOther than that, the options outlined above apply to organizations as well. \nNow You : What is your take on the change? \nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "on Wednesday November 16, 2016 @03:05PM from the what-a-day dept. On the sidelines of major announcements such as Microsoft joining the Linux Foundation , and Google joining the .NET Foundation , at its Connect(); 2016 developer conference, Microsoft also announced that it bringing Visual Studio for rival platform Mac . The company also announced a preview of the next version of SQL Server, and a preview of Azure App Service support for containers. From a Venture Beat report: \"We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry's shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice,\" Microsoft Cloud and enterprise executive vice president Scott Guthrie said in a statement. \"By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible, and intelligent tools and cloud services, we're helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.\" The fact that Microsoft is bringing its IDE to macOS would have arguably been the biggest news of the day, had the company not leaked the information itself earlier this week. Still, a preview of Visual Studio for Mac is now available, letting developers write cloud, mobile, and macOS apps on Apple's desktop operating system using .NET and C#. It's a big deal, given that Microsoft once made a point of locking in developers by only offering its tools on Windows. This has changed over time, with a big highlight in April 2015 when Microsoft launched Visual Studio Code, its cross-platform code editor, for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

      "title": "Windows 10 Updates Target Ransomware Threats",
      "text": "Windows 10 Updates Target Ransomware Threats Ransomware is a priority in Microsoft's Windows 10 Anniversary Update, a major upgrade to the OS released one year after its public launch. \nThe bundle includes security built to protect businesses by discovering and addressing ransomware threats. According to Microsoft , the number of ransomware variants has more than doubled \n\"Ransomware is what I would call the quick-hit, low-hanging fruit type of opportunity for a threat actor,\" said Chris Goettl, senior product manager for the security team at Landesk. \"You can distribute it to a wider market, you can charge an amount likely to be easily paid you can diversify it pretty well.\" \nTo fight the growing threat, Microsoft has added new security measures to different aspects of Windows 10. These updates were organized into three categories for ransomware prevention, detection, and response. \nof the Microsoft suite, Goettl noted. Some products, like Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender, were strengthened in the Anniversary Updated but aren't as frequently used among businesses. \nFor example, consider the Edge browser. It was updated so Adobe Flash Player, a plugin frequently used by exploit writers, will run in an isolated container. Edge has also been adjusted so an exploit running in the browser cannot execute another program; this blocks malware from silently downloading and executing on users' systems. \nEdge may be safer, but the added protection means little if people don't use it. Microsoft's new browser is not as popular as competitors Chrome and Firefox. \n\"When Microsoft says they've hardened the browser, I have to then adopt that browser and make sure all my users are using that browser,\" said Goettl. \"You're forcing users to use a specific type of technology, but they're going to use what they like to use.\" \nIn other preventive updates, Microsoft improved its email services to block ransomware, developed machine learning models to catch ransomware stored in file attachments, and created a faster signature delivery channel to quickly update Windows Defender running in email. \nTo accelerate ransomware detection, Microsoft improved cloud protection in Windows Defender and improved behavioral heuristics. This way, the tool can determine if a file is performing ransomware-related activities, and quickly take action. \nWindows Defender is getting better with behavioral heuristics, said Goettl, and businesses should have something to detect ransomware. However, the signature-based technology limits its ability to address threats as quickly as other platforms. There are several non-signature-based protection platforms, and many companies won't choose Windows Defender if they're seeking the best value for their dollars, he explained. \nction (ATP) so companies can detect and address attacks. The tool combines security events gathered from machines and sends alerts to enterprise security teams. \nWhen Windows Defender ATP is combined with Office 365 ATP, the two share signals to give a holistic view of enterprise attacks. This gives a higher level of protection, said Goettl, but organizations who want it will have to adopt the full Microsoft model including Windows 10, Office 365 ATP, and Windows Defender. Many businesses are adopting Office 365, but this doesn't necessarily mean they're adopting Office 365 ATP. \nMicrosoft's updates arrive as businesses are struggling to mitigate the risk of ransomware. It's difficult to safeguard against these types of attacks, which trick individual users by mimicking things they know and trust. \n\"Ransomware is one of the bigger challenges facing us today,\" said Goettl, noting how attackers will continue to use the opportunity for quick, repetitive payouts. \"It's here to stay, it's not going anywhere, and it's going to continue to be a threat to our environments.\" ",

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month.\nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,855 to 1,064. On the Nasdaq, 1,353 issues fell and 1,298 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 13 new lows.

      "text": "Microsoft is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member   6:28 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nMicrosoft has been going through some huge changes internally over the last couple of years and it looks like things aren’t slowing down just yet. Today, Microsoft made the surprise announcement that it would be joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member, joining the likes of Intel, IBM, Samsung and Qualcomm. \nLinux and Microsoft have had quite a bit of history as the two competed quite a bit in the 90’s, though since then Windows has gone on to become the dominant PC platform. Now with Satya Nadella now in charge, Microsoft has been embracing open-source more than ever before, which has culminated in the Windows creator now getting onboard with Linux. \nThis news came out of Microsoft’s Connect event for programmers. However, it is important to note that this isn’t Microsoft’s first step to bolster its efforts in the open-source community recently, the company has also brought SQL Server to Linux, open-sourced portions of the .NET platform and has contributed to Linux Foundation projects like the Open API Initiative and the Open Container Initiative. \nAs a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation, Microsoft will contribute $500,000 and John Gossman from the Azure team will join the Linux Foundation Board of Directors. Speaking about Microsoft’s recent induction to the Linux Foundation, Executive Director Jim Zemlin commented that “Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology”, adding that the company has become an “enthusiastic supporter of Linux” and is an important part of many on going projects. \nKitGuru Says: Things have definitely changed a tonne over at Microsoft in recent years. Do you guys think Microsoft’s current direction is the right one? Do you think Microsoft should be getting more involved with open-source projects and Linux?",

Sorry if it seems unbalanced, but they’ve been busy, and putting out things that deserve attention.\nAmazon’s Echo has been a hit since its introduction, and it’s taken more than a year for a challenger to enter the voice-controlled smart home assistant battle. How does Google’s Home measure up? CNET takes a look . Microsoft has released an iPhone app called Color Binoculars that makes it easier for people with color blindness to see the difference between colors they’re likely to confuse . Google WiFi creates a wireless mesh network and spreads strong WiFi love to every nook and cranny of your house. Here’s how it works and how to get it . Taking digital photos of your old printed-out photos isn’t easy. But it just got much better thanks to Google’s PhotoScan app (available for both Android and iPhone) . Google (last one! I promise) is tackling “upsampling,” which is a fancy way of saying “make this junky picture look better.” It’s just a prototype now, but someday soon your pixelated photos might get a second, higher-resolution life.

      "text": "Blog This \nMicrosoft Connect() — Available with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, Dotfuscator Community Edition (CE) includes, for the first time, the ability to inject real-time detection, defense, and notification of unauthorized debugger hacking against production applications. \n“The anti-debugging and tamper functionality was first released in September inside Dotfuscator Professional, the commercial version of Dotfuscator,” said Gabriel Torok, CEO of PreEmptive Solutions. “With the release of Dotfuscator CE 2017, every Visual Studio 2017 user has access to these powerful application and data security controls.” \nDotfuscator Community Edition is included at no cost to licensed Visual Studio 2017 users for personal use, research and testing under licensing terms that are modeled after Microsoft’s own Community Edition of Visual Studio. \n“Development velocity is accelerating and operations are achieving new automation milestones on an almost daily basis,” Torok continued. “Application controls, like Dotfuscator’s debugger hacking defense, must keep pace to effectively prevent operational disruption, data loss, and Intellectual Property and trade secret theft.” \nIn Symantec’s 2016 Internet Security Threat Report, application security software to better manage the application security lifecycle was cited as a “critical control priority” to mitigate 9 out of 10 of today’s top cyber risks. 1 \nA recent survey of over 200 development organizations validated the importance of effective application risk management. 58% reported making sustained investments in application security and 2 out of 3 of those organizations identified unauthorized use of a debugger on a production application as a material vulnerability. 2 \nThe Dotfuscator CE’s debugger-hacking-defense capabilities can be injected with no coding required allowing an application to detect, defend, and report on unauthorized use of a debugger in production. Further, the alerts can be published directly into Microsoft’s Application Insights and Hockey App and even Twitter can be used to provide incident alerts. \n“The real-time defense capabilities now available inside Dotfuscator CE are a powerful complement to the existing obfuscation and tamper defense capabilities,” said Sebastian Holst, CSO PreEmptive Solutions. “For the first time, reliable and resilient defenses can be injected in an automated and scalable fashion – and often without any development effort or licensing fees for the Visual Studio development organization.” \nFor more information on both the Community and Professional editions of Dotfuscator – as well as extended support for Android, Java, and iOS – visit www.preemptive.com . \nAbout PreEmptive Solutions \nPreEmptive Solutions’ software secures and monitors applications across cloud, on-premises, and mobile platforms. 6,000+ development organizations and hundreds of thousands of developers trust PreEmptive Solutions to protect and increase the value of their application development investments.

      "text": "* Microsoft, Amazon, Apple boost S&P, Nasdaq\n* U.S. airlines rise after Buffett's Berkshire buys stake\n* Oil prices jump 3 pct\n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected\n* Dow down 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.46 pct (Updates to open)\nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan\nNov 15 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher on Tuesday, helped by a recovery in tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell after rising for six straight days.\nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since the election, rose 1.07 percent.\nMicrosoft's 1.31 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow, followed by Amazon and Apple.\nBoth indexes had rallied in the past week since the shock victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. election on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations.\nHowever, investors remain uncertain about Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration.\nExpectations Trump's administration will cut taxes, increase spending and accelerate inflation have boosted the dollar and driven bond yields higher.\nThe dollar slipped from an 11-month high, pausing for breath after rallying almost 3 percent since Trump's win.\n\"We're sort of poised for a little bit of a pullback here as people reassess what the new administration is likely to accomplish,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\"The uncertainty is going to hang over the markets for a while. So we may see a lot of this back and forth.\"\nAt 9:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,813.53, the S&P 500 was up 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,166.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,242.48.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 1.65 percent rise leading the advancers.\nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.42 percent as traders cashed in profits.\nOil prices jumped more than 3 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut.\nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month.\nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported third-quarter results.\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Continental Holdings were up between 0.4 percent and 5.5 percent, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had bought shares in the airlines.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,630 to 1,158. On the Nasdaq, 1,337 issues fell and 1,055 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and nine new lows.

      "text": "Microsoft has offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators related to its proposed $26.2 billion acquisition of professional social networking firm LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday without providing details.\nThe offer of concessions comes after EU competition officer Margrethe Vestager expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, Reuters reported.\nThe Commission is expected to rule on the deal by Dec. 6 after gathering feedback from rivals and customers. It could accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.\nMicrosoft declined to comment, Reuters said. The planned LinkedIn deal would be the software giant's largest acquisition ever.\nCritics have suggested the acquisition could hurt innovation and reduce competition, with some also expressing concern about data privacy issues.\nUnder the planned deal, LinkedIn would keep its name and independence, with Jeff Weiner continuing as CEO.\nLinkedIn was founded in 2003 and went public in 2011. This year, it aired its first-ever TV ad during the Oscar broadcast on ABC.\nRead more: Microsoft Buying LinkedIn for $26.2B",

      "text": "Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation as the World Remains the Right Side Up Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation as the World Remains the Right Side Up By 3 \nAlmost 15 years after Steve Ballmer had compared Linux and the open source community to cancer, Microsoft announced today that it was joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. \nThe news isn't surprising in the big picture. For several years Microsoft has been getting friendlier with the Linux community, being one of the most active contributors to the Linux kernel project. Microsoft embraced open-source in recent years \nAs a whole, the company had embraced the open source software model since Satya Nadella took over as CEO. Previously, Microsoft had open-sourced various tools or core technologies behind some of its proprietary software. This includes Edge's JavaScript engine, the .NET compiler, TypeScript, Xamarin, and more. \nAdditionally, Microsoft also partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu on Windows 10, brought SQL Server to Linux, and worked with the FreeBSD, Debian, Red Hat, and SUSE projects to release images for Azure. \nAfter all the technical support Microsoft has been providing to Linux projects, it was only a formality for the Redmond company to officially join the Foundation's ranks. \n\"Linux Foundation membership underscores what Microsoft has demonstrated time and again,\" said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director for the Linux Foundation. \"Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but it’s perhaps bigger news for the open source community, which will benefit from the company’s sustained contributions.\" \nBesides the Linux Foundation, Microsoft is also part of the Node.js Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the Open Container Initiative, the R Consortium, and one of its execs is currently in charge of the Apache Foundation. Google joins the .NET Foundation \nMicrosoft announced it was joining the Linux Foundation today, at Connect(), Microsoft annual developer conference. \nThe company also \"officially\" announced Visual Studio for Mac . The news leaked on Monday when an employee accidentally published a blog post on the MSDN portal. \nAt the same conference, Google joined the .NET Foundation in a role on the Technical Steering Committee.",

      "text": "\nNo, this is not my annual April Fool joke. The ‘arch enemy’ of Linux, Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation as a platinum member in an attempt to “better collaborate with the open source community”. The announcement was made at the ongoing Connect Event .\nTimes flies. Linux is 25 years old now. In the early 2000’s, when a teenaged Linux was gaining popularity, the then Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux cancer .\nFast forward 13 years and the new CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella started showing feelings for Linux and Open Source. It open sourced .NET , openly proclaimed that Microsoft loves Linux and since then has open sourced a number of its products . It is also the biggest contributor to Open Source projects on GitHub .\nMicrosoft also started bringing its Windows only products to Linux. Visual Studio Code was just the beginning. SQL Server on Linux is a reality now as the beta version for Linux is out today.\nIn addition to all this, Microsoft has also got a (sort of) Linux OS of its own .\nAs many have observed, all these efforts are done for the sake of Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform . And it has actually shown results. 1 out of 3 servers running on Azure are Linux servers.\nExecutive director of the Linux Foundation, Jim Zemlin told ZDNet about his thoughts on Microsoft joining Linux Foundation:\n“Our philosophy is that open source should be a big tent where anyone can contribute.\nThere was a time where proprietary versus open source was a winner-take-all proposition, but that’s in the past. Open source is now a major force in software development, and the industry realizes you can make yourself better, while also making others better at the same time. Microsoft has been embracing open source increasingly for the better part of a decade, including contributing to and supporting many Linux Foundation projects, so their decision to take the next step and become a Linux Foundation member didn’t come as a surprise to us.\nMicrosoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology. The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.”\nWhat’s your take on Microsoft joining Linux Foundation? Will it benefit Linux and Open Source in long run or it will be used by Microsoft for its own benefits. Do share your views.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft releases preview edition of Visual Studio for Mac By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 01:09 pm PT (04:09 pm ET) As anticipated earlier this week, Microsoft on Wednesday released Visual Studio for the Mac, bringing over one of its signature Windows developer tools. The Mac edition is currently available only in a free preview build , but takes advantage of technology Microsoft acquired from Xamarin to support C# development for iOS, macOS, Windows, and Android, including access to the Xamarin Test Cloud. For server-based projects, the app supports Azure and .NET Core. Users can integrate NuGet packages, and a number of third-party resources like Git and Subversion. Other features include Intellisense code completion, visual designers, and universal search across files, types, members, commands, and NuGets. Traditionally Microsoft has encouraged developers to remain with Windows, but in recent years the company has become more platform-agnostic, willing to support other devices and operating systems —so long as people use Microsoft software and services.

It used to be that if you reported on Microsoft news, you’d cover Windows PCs and then Windows Phone apps and maybe mention Office for Mac if things go boring. Lately, though, there are so many Microsoft apps across so many platforms that a day doesn’t go by without one update or another. \nToday, OneDrive for iOS got the love, with a small update to version 8.4. Here’s what’s new: \nIn this release we have continued to work on bugs and crashes including:– We now support Office 365 Kiosk plans– Sign in related issues \nThat’s not a hue update, but if you were experiencing sign in issues or wishing you could access your Office 365 Kiosk plan with the app, then it’ll matter to you.

      "text": "Home > Enterprise > Elon Musk’s OpenAI ties up with Microsoft for cloud computing Elon Musk’s OpenAI ties up with Microsoft for cloud computing | 0 Comments \nOpenAI, a non-profit research organisation for artificial intelligence (AI) backed by Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, has tied up with Microsoft Corp’s flagship cloud service, Azure. \n“This will make Azure the primary cloud platform that OpenAI is using for deep learning and AI, and will let us conduct more research and share the results with the world,” OpenAI’s co-founders Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and Sam Altman, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \nOpenAI has been an early adopter of Microsoft’s Azure N-Series virtual machines. N-Series virtual machines are powered by Nvidia Corp’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and provide customers and developers access to accelerated computing and visualization experiences. “Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning — they offer K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale,” the co-founders said. \nThe Azure N-Series will be made available in South Central US, East US, West Europe and South East Asia on 1 December, Corey Sanders, director of compute at Azure, said in a blog post on Tuesday. \nThe N-Series is designed for intense AI workloads such as deep learning, simulations and training of neural networks. \nOpenAI was established in December 2015 by Musk, Brockman, Sutskever and Altman to develop safe AI applications that can be widely distributed. \nMicrosoft has partnered with Nvidia to provide enhanced GPU capabilities via Azure to its customers. Esri, which provides geographic information system (GIS) software, and Jellyfish Pictures, an animation and VFX studio, are some other adopters of Azure. \nGPU-powered computing is used to accelerate applications in deep learning, analytics and engineering. The single-chip processor was introduced and engineered by Nvidia, which designs graphics for gaming companies and develops chip sets for mobile computing and the automobile market. \nMicrosoft has also launched the Azure Bot Service, a server-less environment where developers can develop, deploy and manage bots. “Run on Azure Functions, these bots can scale on demand and you only pay for the resources your bots consume,” Microsoft said in a statement. \n ",

      "text": "Microsoft joins The Linux Foundation at highest membership tier November 16, 2016 | By Alissa McAloon November 16, 2016 | By Alissa McAloon More: Console/PC , Business/Marketing \nMicrosoft is doubling down on its recent support of Linux by joining The Linux Foundation at the $500,000 per year membership tier. In addition, Microsoft’s John Gossman will also join the foundation’s board of directors. \nThe move strengthens Microsoft’s recent change of heart about the importance of open-source software. In addition to benefiting Linux as a whole, this new membership potentially means great things for developers that use the company’s development tools like Visual Studio and the .NET framework. \nAccording to the Linux Foundation’s executive director Jim Zemlin , the move is just as good for Microsoft as it is for the foundation. “Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” he said. \nMicrosoft joins other companies such as Cisco, Fujitsu, HE, Huawei, IBM, Intel, and Samsung as platinum members that contribute $500,000 to the Foundation yearly.

      "text": "\nThe next four years could turn out to be a difficult time for Microsoft, despite Satya Nadella’s attempt to welcome in the new administration in USA.\nIt was revealed today that President-Elect Donald Trump’s Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is not particularly enamoured of Asian CEOs, suggesting in a 2015 interview that they undermined “civic society.”\nHe is recorded as saying “When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think .?.?. A country is more than an economy. We’re a civic society.”\n\nAsian CEOs currently lead both tech giants Microsoft and Google, with the 3rd leg presumably being Tim Cook, who happens to be gay. His publication, Breitbart Media, featured headlines such as “Gay Rights Have Made Us Dumber, It’s Time To Get Back In The Closet,” suggesting Apple is probably not out of the firing line either.\nWe can but hope while now in a position of real power rather than just agitating from the sidelines, such divisive opinions will be shelved and the new administration, like Nadella wished, will indeed work at “fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.”",

      "text": "A A \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. \n© 2016 Thomson/Reuters.

      "text": "Remove the Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam Skip this and learn how to remove Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam! \nThe Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam is a Trojan from the Trojan.Tech-Support-Scam family that displays a fake Windows alert stating that Microsoft Security Essentials detected a problem with a file on your computer .

The good news is that while this screen is minimized you can access your computer as normal. Using this technique we will remove the infection from a computer. How did the Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam get on my computer? \nIt is important to note that this Trojan is installed by other programs that did not adequately disclose that other software would be installed along with it. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to the license agreements and installation screens when installing anything off of the Internet. If an installation screen offers you Custom or Advanced installation options, it is a good idea to select these as they will typically disclose what other 3rd party software will also be installed. Furthermore, If the license agreement or installation screens state that they are going to install a toolbar or other unwanted adware, it is advised that you cancel the install and not use the free software. \nAs you can see, this scam was created to trick you into calling the listed number so that the developers can try and convince you into purchasing unnecessary services or software. For no reason should you call this number, and if you have already have purchased services, I advise you to dispute the charges with your credit card company. To remove this Trojan and any related software for free, please use the removal guide below.

How to remove Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam and Remove the Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam: Step 8: Run Secunia PSI to find outdated and vulnerable programs. 1 \nThis removal guide may appear overwhelming due to the amount of the steps and numerous programs that will be used. It was only written this way to provide clear, detailed, and easy to understand instructions that anyone can use to remove this infection for free. Before using this guide, we suggest that you read it once and download all necessary tools to your desktop. After doing so, please print this page as you may need to close your browser window or reboot your computer. 2 \nThe Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam Trojan includes a built-in backdoor for the remote support company to close the fake crash screen when a victim pays them for services. To get to this screen, simply click on the Remote Support button as indicated by the red arrow in the image below. This will cause Internet Explorer to open to a web site, which you can close. You can then access your computer to perform the rest of the steps. \nOnce the fake alert is closed, you can proceed to the next step where you will terminate the malware process and launch Windows Explorer so you can get your desktop back. 3 \nAs Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam makes it so you are unable to acces your Windows desktop, you need to open the Windows Task Manager from the Windows Security screen. To do this, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys on your keyboard at the same time to display the Windows Security Screen as shown below. \nAt this screen, click on the Task Manager option to start the Windows Task Manager. 4 \nYou will now be at the Task Manager screen as shown below. If you are in Windows 10, you will need to click on the More Details option and the screen will look a little different. Make sure you are in the processes tab and search for the bsodm.exe process in the list of processes. \nWhen you have found the process click on it once to select and then click on the End Process button in Windows 7 or the End Task button in Windows 10. The process should now be terminated. Do not close the Task Manager window, though, as we need it for the next step. 5 \nNow that the process has been terminated we want to start the Windows Explorer. Most of the time this will cause the Windows desktop to appear, but if not, you will at least be presented with a My Computer folder that you can to navigate the file system and launch applications. \nIn Task Manager, click on the File menu option and then click on Run . You will now be at the Run dialog as shown in the image below. \nIn the Open: field, type explorer.exe and then press the OK button. \nYour normal desktop should now appear and you can continue with the rest of the instructions. If the desktop does not appear, then a My Computer window will open that will allow you to navigate the file system to launch programs or delete files. 6 \nTo terminate any programs that may interfere with the removal process we must first download the Rkill program. Rkill will search your computer for active malware infections and attempt to terminate them so that they wont interfere with the removal process. To do this, please download RKill to your desktop from the following link. Rkill \nWhen at the download page, click on the Download Now button labeled iExplore.exe . When you are prompted where to save it, please save it on your desktop . 7 \nOnce it is downloaded, double-click on the iExplore.exe icon in order to automatically attempt to stop any processes associated with Fake Microsoft Security Essentials Tech Support Scam and other malware.

Please review the log file and then close so you can continue with the next step. If you have problems running RKill, you can download the other renamed versions of RKill from the rkill download page . All of the files are renamed copies of RKill, which you can try instead. Please note that the download page will open in a new browser window or tab. \nDo not reboot your computer after running RKill as the malware programs will start again. 8 \nNow please download Emsisoft Anti-Malware, which will scan for and remove any other adware that may have been bundled with this adware. Please download and save the Emsisoft Anti-Malware setup program to your desktop from the link below: Emsisoft Anti-Malware \nThe download is fairly large, so please be patient while it downloads. 9 \nOnce the file has been downloaded, double-click on the EmsisoftAntiMalwareSetup_bc.exe icon to start the program. If Windows Smart Screen issues an alert, please allow it to run anyway. \nIf the setup program displays an alert about safe mode, please click on the Yes button to continue. You should now see a dialog asking you to agree to a license agreement. Please access the agreement and click on the Install button to continue with the installation. 10 \nYou will eventually get to a screen asking what type of license you wish to use with Emsisoft Anti-Malware. \nIf you have an existing license key or want to buy a new license key , please select the appropriate option. Otherwise, select the Freeware or Test for 30 days, free option. If you receive an alert after clicking this button that your trial has expired, just click on the Yes button to enter freeware mode, which still allows the cleaning of infections. 11 \nYou will now be at a screen asking if you wish to join Emsisoft's Anti-Malware network. Read the descriptions and select your choice to continue. 12 \nEmsisoft Anti-Malware will now begin to update it's virus detections. \nPlease be patient as it may take a few minutes for the updates to finish downloading. 13 \nWhen the updates are completed, you will be at a screen asking if you wish to enable PUPs detection.

Please click on the Finish Installation button end the setup and automatically launch Emsisoft Anti-Malware. 15 \nEmsisoft Anti-Malware will now start and display the start screen. \nAt this screen, please left-click on the Scan section. 16 \nYou will now be at a screen asking what type of scan you would like to perform. \nPlease select the Malware Scan option to begin scanning your computer for infections. The Malware Scan option will take longer than the Quick Scan, but will also be the most thorough. As you are here to clean infections, it is worth the wait to make sure your computer is properly scanned. 17 \nEmsisoft Anti-Malware will now start to scan your computer for rootkits and malware. Please note that the detected infections in the image below may be different than what this guide is for. \nPlease be patient while Emsisoft Anti-Malware scans your computer. 18 \nWhen the scan has finished, the program will display the scan results that shows what infections where found. Please note, due to an updated version of Emsisoft Anti-Malware, the screenshot below may look different than the rest of the guide. \nNow click on the Quarantine Selected button, which will remove the infections and place them in the program's quarantine. You will now be at the last screen of the Emsisoft Anti-Malware setup program, which you can close. If Emsisoft prompts you to reboot your computer to finish the clean up process, please allow it to do so. Otherwise you can close the program. 19 \nNow please download AdwCleaner and save it to your desktop. AdwCleaner will scan your computer for adware programs that may have been installed on your computer without your knowledge. You can download AdwCleaner from the following URL: AdwCleaner Download Now 20 \nWhen AdwCleaner has finished downloading, please double-click on the AdwCleaner.exe icon that now appears on your desktop.

After you read it, click on the I agree button if you wish to continue. Otherwise, click on the I disagree button to close the program. If Windows prompts you as to whether or not you wish to run AdwCleaner, please allow it to run. \nIf you selected to continue, you will be presented with the start screen as shown below. 21 \nNow click on the Scan button in AdwCleaner. The program will now start to search for known adware programs that may be installed on your computer. When it has finished it will display all of the items it has found in Results section of the screen above. Please look through the results and try to determine if the programs that are listed contain ones that you do not want installed. If you find programs that you need to keep, then uncheck the entries associated with them. \nFor many people, the contents of the Results section may appear confusing. Unless you see a program name that you know should not be removed,please continue with the next step. 22 \nTo remove the adware programs that were detected in the previous step, please click on the Clean button on the AdwCleaner screen. AdwCleaner will now prompt you to save any open files or data as the program will need to close any open programs before it starts to clean. \nPlease save your work and then click on the OK button. AdwCleaner will now delete all detected adware from your computer. When it is done it will display an alert that explains what PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and Adware are.

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 24 screenshots A powerful software solution that aims to provide a friendly environment for the collaboration between development teams and testers The Test Professional edition of Microsoft Visual Studio focuses on test case management, delivering advanced tools designed to meet the requirements of software testers, analysts, and product managers. It encloses professional collaboration tools that facilitate communication during the product development process, but it is not a fully-featured IDE, such as the other Visual Studio editions. Rich and powerful testing tools Its purpose is to provide users with the power to control test management activities from test planning to execution and tracking. To achieve this, it seamlessly connects to the test managers of Visual Studio Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services, running tests that can offer a real-time insight on the development progress and the way standards are met. Aside from test case management functions, Visual Studio Test Professional is the go-to utility for both exploratory and manual testing. Ad-hoc (or exploratory) tests allow action recording and annotations, as well as bug reporting options, which can be merged to generate other test cases. Manual testing involves the use of a browser (web-based text management and execution) and allows for the tracking of each step, with attached comments and bug reports. Familiar layout with additional testing capabilities Aside from the generous software testing toolset, Microsoft Visual Studio Test Professional delivers the familiar yet completely customizable layout and working environment of all the other editions: a tab-based editor with bookmark support, an integrated object browser, and code definition management, as well as a built-in snippet manager. Its capabilities can be enhanced using extensions. Releases can be easily managed using source control, which makes it easier for developers to automate cross-environment deployment or testing operations. A robust product testing platform for advanced users With professional-grade testing tools and traceability options for the entire development process, Microsoft Visual Studio Test Professional encourages collaboration between all those involved in the creation of a new product, from the development team to the stakeholders and the customer, who can offer valuable feedback. Thanks to the familiar working environment and the empowering testing capabilities, the fluency of the team's workflow can increase, ultimately resulting in higher productivity.

It addresses the commercial environment, providing the tools, services and options required to work on complex, high-scale projects. The Enterprise edition of Visual Studio was born with the launch of the 2015 edition of the popular development IDE, becoming part of the highest tier available for download and purchase. It encloses both the Ultimate and the Premium editions, which will be no longer developed separately. Advanced code editor with IntelliSense technology Targeting the enterprise client, Visual Studio Enterprise does not disappoint when it comes to the feature set. It is compatible with various programming languages (Visual C#, Visual Basic, C++, F#, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, HTML, and many more) and gives developers the freedom to create any type of application and work on projects compatible with Windows or web platforms, Android or iOS, Office, SharePoint, and this is just a small part of a long list. The IDE includes the popular editor with syntax highlighting, bookmarking, and a rich toolbox that allows quick searching, class viewing and code browsing. Furthermore, thanks to the IntelliSense technology, developers benefit from context-aware help, code completion and quick snippet insertion, all to save time. Advanced development tools and focus on productivity The Enterprise edition focuses on teamwork and a streamlined workflow that can reduce the coding and deployment time. Cooperation between team members is encouraged through the use of the VS Team Services, helping even large teams to become efficient and productive, and meet their deadlines. It also comes with advanced coding, monitoring, debugging, profiling, and testing tools (unit testing, load testing, and so on), which work together to allow development teams to ship high-quality results. The available options and features enable users to code faster, manage dependencies with ease, handle large datasets, diagnose and find solutions to the issues that might occur in due time. Furthermore, the Enterprise edition features DevOps support, allowing automatic deployment and offering a more detailed insight of the project. Feature-rich development environment As its name implies and its generous feature set proves, Visual Studio Enterprise is not designed for the non-enterprise customer. It is able to handle any project, no matter its size and complexity, and can be used with large datasets, which is usually the case at this level. Users get a feature-rich IDE for creating their app or interface, accompanied by a generous set of tools that helps them make sure their projects meet the customer’s expectations and quality standards.

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nFor mobile developers that have been looking for an app to act as their control center, Microsoft has presented an option. \nAt their Connect(); 2016 keynote this morning, the company announced that they’ve opened up the preview program for the Visual Studio Mobile Center, which is designed to be “A mission control for mobile apps that brings together all the cloud and lifecycle services that help developers deliver high-quality yet apps faster.” \nYou can find details on the announcement as well as a brief introduction to the program on Microsoft’s official post on the Visual Studio blog . \nUsers who download the preview now can expect these features to be ready to go: Build your apps automatically with every pull request Test apps on thousands of real-world devices Distribute passing builds to beta testers Monitor apps for crashes and bugs Learn about real world usage with mobile analytics Connect to a mobile backend for automatic scaling and to add important cloud services like offline data sync, tabular data storage, and end-user authentication services \nAccording to the post, this is only the beginning of what Microsoft has in store for the Visual Studio Mobile Center. \nIn the future, the team plans to add in expanded support for Cordova and the Universal Windows Platform. They also intend to add in support for cloud services like cloud notifications and “advanced analytics.” No timeline was provided to tell you when these features are expected, but you can bet that they’re in the works now. \nIf you’d like to try out the preview for the Mobile Center and give Microsoft your feedback, you can do so via the app’s official website . Through here, you’re going to be able to request an invitation that – when accepted – will open up access to the preview. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Translate \nMicrosoft is offering the European Commission the concessions it requested to clinch approval for the company’s $26-billion purchase of professional social network LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft’s acquiescence to the European Union’s anti-trust watchdog’s requests comes about a week after the regulator met with Microsoft executives to voice their concerns about the deal, Reuters is reporting. \nNeither the Commission nor Microsoft would discuss the details of the proposed deal. The Commission, which will rule on the matter by Dec. 6, will first seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding if it will accept Microsoft’s concessions. If it does not accept them, the Commission could demand more concessions or opt to embark on a full investigation. \nMicrosoft in June announced its intention to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in cash. The deal is Microsoft’s largest acquisition to-date, and would give the software king access to the professional social network’s 433 million members. \nMicrosoft has said LinkedIn would “retain its distinct brand, culture and independence” and CEO Jeff Weiner would remain the company’s leader, reporting only to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \nThe acquisition has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors for both companies, but must be approved by regulators before becoming reality. The companies had hoped to receive the green light by year’s end. Jennifer Cowan is the Managing Editor for SiteProNews. Related Posts",

      "title": "Code Dx Selected by Bitnami for Microsoft’s Azure Government Cloud Marketplace",
      "text": "Code Dx, Inc., a provider of an award-winning suite of fast and affordable tools that help software developers, testers and security analysts find, prioritize and manage software vulnerabilities, today announced that it has been selected by Bitnami as one of the first applications to be included in Microsoft’s Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. Government organizations are able to easily launch the Code Dx Application Vulnerability Correlation and Management Solution from an environment that adheres to the strict government procurement regulations for cloud technologies. “Government organizations are looking for applications that are accessible in the cloud environment but also meet strict government procurement requirements,” said Anita D’Amico, Ph.D., CEO for Code Dx. “With Code Dx now available in the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace, public entities are able to easily launch their broad application security capabilities directly from the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. This will be particularly valuable to government agencies and contractors who must demonstrate that the software they are developing or running has been tested for security, and complies with the DISA STIG (Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides).”\nThe Microsoft Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is a cloud platform built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy and control, compliance, and transparency. Government organizations (federal, state, local, tribal, and educational) receive a physically-isolated instance of Microsoft Azure offering high-level security and compliance services that are essential to the U.S. government for all systems and applications built on its architecture.\nCode Dx is listed under the “Bring Your Own License” category enabling users to run the current free trial version of Code Dx and/or contact Code Dx to purchase a license. Through Bitnami, Code Dx can be easily deployed for both quick evaluations and production installations, and the process for future upgrades is simplified. After one quick installation, users are able to automatically configure and run Code Dx to consolidate and normalize software vulnerabilities detected by multiple code analysis tools.\n“The Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is an invaluable resource for government entities in search of trusted cloud computing solutions,” said Kevin Franklin, Director of Business Development at Bitnami. “We selected the Code Dx solution as one of the first Bitnami applications to be included in this online marketplace, because it is perfectly aligned with the requirements of most government organizations looking for a reliable solution to help secure their software applications.”\nA joint webinar with Code Dx and Bitnami will be held on December 6, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. PST. This webinar will focus on what government organizations need to know about application security, why it is so important, an overview of the key features and functionality of Code Dx, as well as a demo of the application vulnerability correlation and management system.

      "text": "Newport Beach, CA 11/16/2016 -- What makes companies such Google, Apple, Microsoft great? Is it an effective product? A commitment to help the environment? The ability to adapt to current market trends while simultaneously innovating for the future? The answer is that it's a combination of all these factors and more. It takes tremendous skill, leadership, and dedication to consistently deliver products that benefit everyone customers, retailers, and the environment while continually increasing profits.\n\"You have to consider those around you when you do business,\" said Claude Florent, CEO of Rainguard. \"We have not sacrificed our principles to make a quick buck or gain short-term notoriety because we believe that compromise ultimately does not work for companies who want sustainable success for themselves, their partners, their customers, and the environment.\"\nLike the tech giants, Rainguard truly is a company that does not merely go with the flow. Instead, they pave new paths and new models for other businesses to follow by offering viable solutions that are both long-lasting and highly effective.\n\"We're curating a whole new paradigm by going against the grain both in terms of maximizing efficiency in the supply chain to mitigate costs and increase profits as well as significantly lessening environmental impact,\" shared the ambitious CEO. \"And not just in the home improvement sector, but for countless other industries as well.\"\nAs Amazon and other major online retailers face decreasing profits and increasing logistical costs, Rainguard's response is both financially pragmatic and deeply interwoven with an unshakable stance on protecting the environment. With the current state of logistical affairs and its downward spiral trend, everyone loses in the process Amazon, the supplier, the distributor, the customer. Simply put, shipping is killing business. But with Rainguard, everyone wins. The obvious question then is: how do they do it?\n\"While online retailers most notably Amazon are getting crushed because of freight costs, we respond with real world solutions. We've aggressively assessed every single detail along the supply chain with incredible scrutiny and made every possible adjustment,\" explained Mr. Florent. \"What much of our investigation and subsequent action has boiled down to is pushing our concentrate formula which ultimately means less material, less weight, less volume and therefore lower material and shipping cost leading to an increase in profit and a better deal for the customer. In less than a year, we've seen a 16.2 times growth in online sales activity.\"\nWith their product format, Rainguard ensures the home improvement consumer gets the highest value proposition while the supply chain can sustain the business and that the environment is better for it.\n\"The environment is our home. Let's take care of it,\" continued Mr. Florent. \"By cutting back shipping, freights costs, and tightening up all other factors along the supply chain, we not only cut back on costs for consumers and increase profit margins for retailers, but also do a service to the environment by having less trucks, less materials, less gridlock and lower carbon footprint.\"\nRainguard's products are 100% eco-friendly from beginning to end. They do not contain carcinogens, hazardous by-products nor are they flammable. Simply put, they are obsessed with producing products that will never harm people, pets and plants what they call their 3P Environmental Standard.\nThe future looks bright for Rainguard and they intend to keep it that way with constant innovation.\n\"We are about learning from the past, making things better in the present, and always planning strategically for the future,\" the Rainguard CEO added. \"We're not just interested in selling a product, maintaining the status quo, or doing 'business as usual'. We're interested in re-defining the game in a way where everyone along the supply chain wins.\"\nTo learn more about Rainguard's innovation and sustainability policy, call them today at 800-272-4647 or email them at info@rainguard.com.\nwww.rainguard.com\n949-515-8800\n releases/rainguard-solves-amazons-logistical-cost-problem-for-online-retailers-742244.htm\n Russell Fowler\nDirector of Marketing & Social Media\nTelephone: 949-842-7353\n Russell Fowler\nWeb: https://rainguard.com/\n ",

(Photo : Getty Images/ Neil Godwin) Share This Tweet This \nThe biggest question in everyones mind is when is the Surface Pro 5 coming? Well, its not still mentioned in any of the Windows events when it's going to be launched officially. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 5 is a new desktop PC and right now it's just a rumour. The possible release date of the all new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected in 2017. \nThe next big Windows 10 update isn't coming until Spring 2017, and the speculation is that Microsoft will hold back the Surface hardware untill the update comes. Advertisement \nAs fa as specification concern of upcoming Surface Pro 5 it's expected to come with the latest generation of Intel Processor, some rumors says it will come with sixth-generation Skylake chip and some are suggesting with Kaby Lake. \nIn a report of Tech Advisor suggests the Surface Pro 5 will be equipped with a 2K screen but there is also a probability of getting a 4K model for those who are willing to splash the cash. \nIt will also come up with an upgraded 16 GB Ram, the Surface Pro 5 could be the first in the range to get a USB-C port rather than the USB 3.0 port on the Pro 4. Furthermore, an AMD or Nvidia Pascal GPU is expected to help power the unit. \nCameras are the other components to see for upgrades anyhow Microsoft will work on the upgradation of camera, along with that the latest version of Wi-Fi hopefully MU-MIMO will be supported in the new Surface Pro 5. Advertisement \nNews Everyday has published a report that the Surface Pro 5 Core will start at $899, price an Intel Core i7 model at $999, and offer an i7 Extreme version for $1,599. \nAll though Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to be released sometime in second or third month of 2017, it is possible that another unveiling event can takes place within the second quarter of next year. \n",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface i7 Pro(Photo : TIMOTHY CLARY / Staff) MacBook Pro (Photo : Stephen Lam / Stringer) Share This Tweet This \n\nMicrosoft have Surface Book i7 in their corner, a pumped up upgrated version of the last year flexible laptop. Wher on the other side Apple is with the latest version of MacBook Pro. \nBoth the companies are ready to crash the market with their all new machines, albeit expensive for pockets. Advertisement \nNow the quest arises which one of the two is the best to choose: here are the some difference on several key points below. \nMicrosoft hasn't touched their previous design of the Surface Book, it's still the got the matte grey colour and the funky \"dynamic fulcrum\" hinge that Microsoft is so proud of. \nThis spring like machine basically leaves a niticable gap between keyboad and screen when it's 360 degrees folded, a sheet of paper can be easily passed by that gap. But the important part is that the screen can completely detached from the keyboard, something the MacBook Pro can't offer. \nMeanwhile Apple has a slimmer and lighter MacBook Pro as compare to it's previous models, it also has added the new touch bar above the keyboard. Basically, it works to show the bookmarks and favourites when the safari browser is open, it also suggests words and emojis when typing messages. Advertisement \nWhen it comes to size, the MacBook Pro comes in two variations: 13-inches and 15-inches screen sizes, while the Surface Book i7 sticks to 13.3- inches of screen. But Surface Book i7 comes with a resolution of 3000 x 2000 pixels where MacBook Pro is only 2560 x 1600. \nAccording to a report in Mirror the pricing of both the devices will be bit high, Apple's 13-inches Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID will cost around GBP 1,749 and the 15-inches will cost GBP 2,349 \nMicrosoft's i7 Pro starts with G BP 1,799 which comes with a 265GB SSD hard drive and climb ups to GBP 2,649 for the 1TB version. When it comes to pricing Microsoft easily edges out Apple, \nAs per Laptop Mag's report both the companies has put their full initiative to make there laptop as good as they can, both uses Intel's latest 6th generation processors with i7 and i5 option available. \nBoth use SSD drives and dedicated graphics chips for gaming and video rendering, its hard to say which one will come on th top in the terms of performance battle. \nA choice between the two devices is really very difficult Microsft appears to have superior battery life but iPhone users with a big library of iTunes song can make sense of going with MacBook Pro \n",

      "title": "Microsoft Joins Linux Foundation",
      "text": "SQL Server Will Love Linux in 2017 Advertisement \nThe impossible has happened. Hell has evidently frozen over. This morning at Microsoft's Connect event in New York City, the company announced that it has joined the Linux Foundation as a top level platimum member. What's more, the foundation's executive director, Jim Zemlin, is greeting the company with open arms. This just goes to prove that the more things change, the more they...well, change. \nHyperbole aside, this isn't so surprising. Microsoft has been working with the foundation and Zemlin has been singing the praises of Microsoft at open source events for a long while now. So have Red Hat's CEO, Jim Whitehurst, and Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical/Ubuntu's head honcho, both of whom have been working closely with Microsoft on several major projects. \nTo this long time Linux user and open source advocate, however, this seems to be a sea change and the dawning of a new era. Microsoft now has a direct say in the future development of the little operating system that grew up to be big and bad. \nWhy would Microsoft do this? Because it needs Linux. It has bet its future on it. \nFor the privilege of being a platinum member, Microsoft shells out $500,000 per year. For that, the company gets to appoint one director to represent the company on the foundation's board. By comparison, the foundation's 19 gold members share a total of three directors between them, and the more than 200 silver members share a single director. This give Redmond -- and the 10 other platinum members -- considerable input into not only the future direction of the Linux operating system, but influence over other projects, such as Hyperledger, that are under the foundation's control. \nRepresenting Microsoft on the Linux Foundation board will be John Gossman, who's been at Microsoft for 17 years and for the last four years has been the company's lead architect on Azure. He also serves on the Technical Oversight Board for the Open Container Initiative. At Azure, he's been at least partially responsible for helping Redmond develop and maintain relationships with Red Hat, Docker, Mesosphere, Canonical, Chef and Puppet. \nIt's not surprising that Redmond would appoint someone from Azure to represent them, as that's where most of the company's interest in Linux and open source lies. Currently, a third of all server instances on Azure are some flavor of Linux, a number that's believed to be rising. In addition, Gossman was doubtlessly chosen for his proven ability to nurture relationships with companies and organizations outside of Microsoft, which should come in handy in the foundation's boardroom. \nWhile Microsoft's inclusion as a top level member of the Linux Foundation is sure to be met with more than a little grumbling from some in open source, especially advocates of FOSS and desktop Linux, the company should find immediate acceptance from enterprise open source companies, most of which already have close working relationships with Redmond. And because of the large number of jobs that Microsoft has created requiring open source skills, rank and file devs and DevOps should support today's news as well. \nNo matter how you look at it, it's a new day. The company which was once the biggest enemy of Linux and open source now has a seat at the table where much of the future of open source -- at least on the enterprise level -- is decided. \nMicrosoft also announced today that Google has joined the Microsoft founded .NET Foundation and that Redmond is working with Samsung on a project to enable .NET developers to build applications for Samsung devices.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has joined the Linux foundation. The maker of Windows Operating System (OS) announced the decision at the company’s online developers’ event Connect 2016 with a powerful tagline: “Any developer, any application, any platform.”\nAfter fighting the Linux revolution for a long time, and avoiding open source software and code, Microsoft decided to join the growing community. The Redmond-based company has been openly professing its love for the popular OS and platform for the past couple of years, but took the relation to the next level by signing up with the Linux Foundation. Incidentally, Microsoft chose the Platinum partnership , which costs $500,000 annually, reported Venture Beat . As part of the partnership, John Gossman, the architect on the Microsoft Azure team, will sit on the foundation’s Board of Directors. He will also help underwrite projects.\nAnnouncing #SQLServer on Linux public preview, first preview of next release of SQL Server https://t.co/sNJFZoUFPc pic.twitter.com/oFwiYLLAgp \n— Microsoft News (@MSFTnews) November 16, 2016 \n\nBesides joining the Linux Foundation, Microsoft is also releasing a public preview of the next version of SQL Server for Linux. The highly anticipate port of the relational database software was first announced in March. Additionally Linux developers can also start working on Azure App Service. The service is considered very vital because developers will no longer have to spend considerable resources and man-hours on managing infrastructure for cloud-based apps.\nMicrosoft announces the next version SQL Server for Windows and Linux https://t.co/kb3YdVumpc That's pretty interesting.\n— Dave Barker (@davb5) November 16, 2016 \n\nThese decisions by Microsoft, under the leadership of its current CEO, Satya Nadella, are part of an ongoing effort by the company to adopt and support Linux and open source in multiple ways and levels. During the last decade, Microsoft didn’t like Linux. Jim Zemlin, the Foundation’s executive director had blamed Microsoft for “secretly attacking Linux” after it sold a group of Linux-related patents. About 15 years ago, Microsoft’s outspoken former CEO, Steve Ballmer, had called the Linux OS a cancer . Hinting at the hatred, Zemlin said,\n“Microsoft and the Linux Foundation may have had disagreements in the past, but one thing we’ve always agreed on is that developers are super-important. There’s just too much software to be written for any organization to it by themselves. We need to collaborate on these things…. To the skeptics out there, I’d like to say that… if Microsoft loves Linux, on behalf of the over 800 members of the Linux Foundation… we love you too.”\nIt was Nadella, who went against the company’s unspoken dislike of all things Linux and open source. In 2014, Nadella proclaimed the company loves Linux. Defying the skeptics who chalked up his talks as mere marketing gimmick, Nadella stayed true to his words. He spearheaded other projects like the Red Hat partnership, open-sourcing.NET, and running SQL Server on Linux , that eventually culminated in the partnership with the Linux Foundation, reported Geek Wire .\nMicrosoft joins the Linux Foundation, 15 years after Ballmer called it \"cancer\" https://t.co/8awJi3sE3b pic.twitter.com/81KqKkCew9 \n— The Verge (@verge) November 16, 2016 \n\nWhile Microsoft has just become a platinum member, other big players in the tech industry, including Intel, Oracle, Samsung, and IBM have long associated themselves with Linux.\nAs part of its initiative to enhance collaboration rather than indulge in competition, the MS Office maker will soon make search engine provider Google, who just happens to be Microsoft’s direct competitor in the highly lucrative cloud storage and computing segment, a member of its.NET Foundation technical steering committee.\nMembership is a big step for Microsoft, but it’s perhaps bigger news for OSS, says @jzemlin https://t.co/Ru8quwFDiD (pic via @Microsoft ) pic.twitter.com/rQeNNKj0au \n— The Linux Foundation (@linuxfoundation) November 16, 2016 \n\nBesides Linux, Microsoft is also increasing support for Tizen, an open-source operating system used by Samsung and others. The lightweight OS doesn’t take up a lot of resources, and hence is ideal for smartphones, tables, appliances and other devices. The company is bringing a preview version of Visual Studio tools and a.NET Software Development Kit (SDK) for C# developers meant for the OS.\nIntroducing #SQLServer on #Linux , now in public preview.

After dramatically altering the way its Windows OS is designed and sold, the company appears to have finally realized that developers not just multiple languages, but they have varying preferences. Moreover, developers often use multiple platforms interchangeably depending on the need. Forcing them to choose sides and allegiance would be disastrous in today’s world filled with open source alternatives.\n[Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]\nMicrosoft Joins Linux Foundation As Platinum Member – Company Realizes Software Developers Use Multiple Platforms Interchangeably? is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",
