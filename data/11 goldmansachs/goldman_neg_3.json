      "text": "\nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, notes that the Euro area’s modest recovery during 2015 and 2016 owed to support from a weaker Euro, lower oil prices and an easing in domestic ﬁnancial conditions. \nKey Quotes \n“However, with the impulse from a depreciated currency and energy prices dissipating, and little headroom for further easing in credit conditions now that bank lending rates in the periphery have re-converged to core levels, the broad based support for Euro area growth is fading.” \n“Nevertheless, we expect the Euro area to keep on growing at slightly below 1½% over the forecast horizon (more speciﬁcally at +1.4%yoy in 2017 and 2018, and at +1.5%yoy in 2019 and 2020). The reason for this resilience: easier ﬁscal policy will underpin the Euro area recovery.” \n“Next year we expect ﬁscal policy to contribute 0.5pp to Euro area GDP growth. Prima facie, with headline 2017 GDP growth at +1.4%yoy, the relative contribution from ﬁscal easing in 2017 seems modest. However, given that potential growth is likely just below 1.0%yoy, at least in an accounting sense ﬁscal policy is responsible for almost all above-trend growth.” \n“Fiscal policy’s increasingly important role in supporting the Euro area outlook is facilitated by ECB asset purchases and the ‘ﬁscal space’ they create on heavily indebted governments’ balance sheets. Looking forward, we continue to expect the need to cap peripheral yields in an environment of lacklustre nominal growth and high debt to GDP ratios so as to maintain ﬁscal space to lead the ECB to extend its purchase programme.” \n“More speciﬁcally, we expect the ECB to announce an extension of its asset purchase programme until end-2017 at its December meeting. Should the scarcity of eligible assets in some market segments become a constraint, the existing self-imposed limits on purchases will be relaxed, with a move away from the capital key doing the heavy lifting. But the recent global ﬁxed income sell-off has relaxed these constraints, at least temporarily, giving Mr. Draghi some respite from having to introduce such politically sensitive measures.” RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": "\nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, notes that although 2016 has been a disappointing year overall, global growth is now accelerating to the top of the 3%-3½% range that has prevailed throughout the past ﬁve years. \nKey Quotes \n“The main reason is the swing in the ﬁnancial conditions impulse from sharply negative to modestly positive, both in the US and in parts of the emerging world.” \n“US President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress are likely to pass a ﬁscal stimulus package, which could provide a further temporary growth boost starting in mid-2017. However, aggressive implementation of Trump’s trade and immigration policies would likely weigh on growth.” \n“While Trump’s proposed policies have ambiguous effects on growth, they are likely to reinforce the gradual upward move in inﬂation that is already underway, as output and employment are now close to potential. Moreover, we remain skeptical that the equilibrium interest rate has fallen as much as widely believed. We therefore still expect the Federal Reserve to raise the funds rate substantially more than implied by market pricing.” \n“Tighter Fed policy is likely to put further upward pressure on global long-term rates. Faced with signiﬁcant slack and low core inﬂation, the ECB will try to insulate itself from the resulting tightening in ﬁnancial conditions with an extension of its asset purchase program. The BoJ meanwhile will focus on the implementation of its yield control policy. Greater interest rate divergence should put continued upward pressure on the dollar.” \n“The risks to our baseline forecast are skewed to the downside. First, much remains unclear about the economic policies of the incoming Trump administration, and the positive initial market reaction could reverse if the policy mix looks more unfavorable than now widely assumed. Second, Europe could reemerge as a source of political risk, with the French election at the top of the list of concerns. Third, a stronger dollar could lead to renewed pressure on emerging markets, especially China.” RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": "By Shuli Ren It’s not even Thanksgiving yet, and Goldman Sachs has already put up its top 10 market themes for 2017 . Accompanying these top 10 themes, Goldman has suggested the following top 6 trades:\nTop Trade #1: Transatlantic economic divergences and political risks Long US$ equally weighted against EUR and GBP, with a basket indexed to 100, a target of 110 and a stop at 95. Annual carry on this basket is 1.3%.\nTop Trade #2: RMB weakening: Long $/CNY Long $/CNY via the 12-month NDF, currently at 7.07, for an initial target of 7.30 with a stop at 6.75.\nTop Trade #3: Earning the ‘good carry’ in EM, hedging the China (and CNY) risk Long an equally-weighted basket of BRL, RUB, INR, ZAR versus short an equally-weighted basket of KRW and SGD, with an entry level of 100, total return target of 114 and stops at 93. The expected return, including approximately 7% carry (on an annual basis) and 7% price return, is around 14%.\nTop Trade #4: Long EM equities with insulated exposure to growth Long Brazil, India and Poland equities (BOVESPA, NIFTY, WIG) FX-unhedged , with an entry level of 100, for a target return of 120 and a stop of 90.\nTop Trade #5: The ‘reflation’ theme extends and broadens Long US 10-year US TIPS ‘break-even’ inflation at an entry level of 1.90%, with an initial target of 2.30% and stop at 1.60%, and long Euro 10-year inflation via swaps at an entry level of 1.25%, with a target of 1.60% and a stop at 1.00%.\nTop Trade #6: Long equity-like ‘carry’ with little duration risk through dividends: Long EURO STOXX 50 2018 dividends Long EURO STOXX 50 2018 dividends (BBG: DEDZ8 Index) equity-like ‘carry’ with little duration risk; target 125, now at 112 (12% unfunded return), stop at 105.\nGoldman is decidedly cautious on China, saying that China not only continues to have its own domestic growth risks, but Trump’s win and his protectionist stance are creating additional uncertainties on the yuan. Therefore, Goldman is not keen on China’s proxies Korea and Taiwan , and would rather place the bank’s bet on Brazil, India and Poland, which offer an “insulated exposure” to the EM growth recovery story.\n“In Asia, both India and ASEAN equities offer strong domestically-exposure growth stories; however, we find ASEAN to be much more interest rate sensitive, and would shy away from that exposure in the near term. Indian equities have had a strong run since 2013, and while we believe the majority of the rally is behind us, we continue to see a positive risk/reward relative to other Asian equities that are heavily China exposed,” wrote Goldman.\nIn the chart, you can see that in terms of trade, India is the least exposed to China and the US among emerging Asia countries.\nAmong emerging Asian countries, India is the least exposed to trade relations with China and the US.

      "title": "Goldman Sachs’ trade ideas for 2017 themes of faster growth, stronger dollar",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs has six trades designed to capitalize on its forecast for faster economic growth and a stronger dollar, coupled with more uncertainty. \nAccording to a Goldman note issued on Friday, global economic growth will likely accelerate, spurred by fiscal stimulus across the world and continued quantitative easing from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), but offset by more uncertainty in politics and on Federal Reserve tightening. \nThat was likely to spur a stronger dollar and higher inflation across developed markets, as well as better fundamental support for select emerging markets, the bank said, adding that European dividends were set to outperform. \nGoldman suggested six trades to play those themes. \n1. Go long the dollar against the euro and the pound to play the divergence in economic performance as well as the political risks on both sides of the pond .\n\n\"While the solid shape of the U.S. economy and the prospect of some fiscal stimulus make a more compelling case for a tighter stance of monetary policy and a stronger dollar over the coming months, the recent political gyrations in Europe will continue to weigh on euro and sterling,\" the bank said. \"Brexit negotiations in the U.K. have not yet started and uncertainty around the outcome remains elevated.\" \nGoldman said it did not believe sterling was cheap yet, with a 25-40 percent drop from pre-Brexit levels needed to rebalance the U.K.'s external position. The U.K. has a large current account deficit of around 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); that must be financed with money from overseas, which may further pressure sterling. \nAt the same time, uncertainty over upcoming elections in euro-area countries will weigh on the single-currency, according to the note. \nIn a separate note dated Sunday, Goldman lowered its sterling forecasts to 1.20, 1.18 and 1.14 on a three-, six- and 12-month basis respectively. The sterling was fetching $1.2349 at 9:27 a.m. HK/SIN. \nIt also set its 12-month target for the euro at $1.00. At 9:28 a.m. HK/SIN, the euro was fetching $1.0602. \n\n2. Go long the dollar/yuan to play a weakening Chinese currency, Goldman said, advising using the 12-month non-deliverable forward contract with an initial target of 7.30, compared with current levels around 7.07. \nGoldman said that with dollar appreciation set to continue through 2017, the dollar/yuan would need to rise to keep the yuan's level against its trade basket stable, carrying a risk of re-igniting capital outflows from the mainland. \nIt raised its three-, six- and 12-month dollar/yuan forecasts to 7.00, 7.15 and 7.30 respectively, from 6.70, 6.80 and 7.00 previously. It also now expected the pair at 7.60 at end-2018, compared with its forecast of 7.30 previously. \n3. Goldman advised earning \"good carry\" in emerging markets and hedging the risk from China and a declining yuan. \nTo play that theme, it said to go long an equally weighted basket of Brazil's real , Russia's ruble , India's rupee and South Africa's rand , while at the same time shorting an equally weighted basket of South Korea's won and the Singapore dollar . \nThe \"good carry\" candidates – the real, ruble, rupee and rand – offer generous yields and fundamentals were improving, according to the note. \n\"The 'Trump tantrum' of the past week put meaningful pressure on the four currencies, creating more attractive entry points, and – given that both India and South Africa were net oil importers, while Russia and Brazil were net oil exporters – the basket limited exposure to oil risk,\" it said. \n\"On the short side, the won and Singapore dollar feature low carry, subdued inflation and – given both their high exposure to Chinese demand and their direct competition with China in the export market – allow us to hedge against the left tail risk that a build-up in Chinese debt results in a sharp depreciation of the yuan.\" \n4. Go long emerging market equities with insulated exposure to growth, specifically Brazil, India and Poland, without hedging currencies, Goldman suggested. \n\"We remain positive on the emerging market ex-China growth recovery story heading into 2017 and see a good entry point in expressing this view via emerging market equities,\" the bank said. \"Brazil, Poland and India offer an 'insulated exposure' to the emerging market growth recovery story, without being particularly exposed to China growth or U.S. trade policy.\" \n5. Play the \"reflation\" theme by going long U.S. 10-year TIPS , or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, \"break-even\" inflation and long euro 10-year inflation via swaps, it said. \nGoldman expected that low base-effects from commodity markets would push up headline consumer inflation figures across the major advanced economies. At the same time, inflationary pressures would get stoked by large public sector spending in Japan, China, the U.S. and Europe, it wrote. \nHigher inflation was likely to push up bond yields, a factor that would push up the value of inflation-protection related securities. \n6. Go long Euro Stoxx 50 2018 dividends via a swap trade, it said. \n\"Equities may not benefit from the reflation as much as we would like, owing to already elevated valuations and rising rates capping upside,\" the Goldman note advised. \"In addition, equities have been, and are likely to stay, volatile owing to political risk and elevated uncertainty,\" it said. \"Dividends swaps are less high beta than equities but also have some sensitivity to better growth.\" \nIt expected more than 10 percent potential return from its swap play, higher than the likely upside for the equity market. \n—By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 \n\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nGoldman Sachs has six trades designed to capitalize on its forecast for faster economic growth and a stronger dollar, coupled with more uncertainty. \nAccording to a Goldman note issued on Friday, global economic growth will likely accelerate, spurred by fiscal stimulus across the world and continued quantitative easing from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), but offset by more uncertainty in politics and on Federal Reserve tightening. \nThat was likely to spur a stronger dollar and higher inflation across developed markets, as well as better fundamental support for select emerging markets, the bank said, adding that European dividends were set to outperform. \nGoldman suggested six trades to play those themes. \n1. Go long the dollar against the euro and the pound to play the divergence in economic performance as well as the political risks on both sides of the pond . \n\"While the solid shape of the U.S. economy and the prospect of some fiscal stimulus make a more compelling case for a tighter stance of monetary policy and a stronger dollar over the coming months, the recent political gyrations in Europe will continue to weigh on euro and sterling,\" the bank said. \"Brexit negotiations in the U.K. have not yet started and uncertainty around the outcome remains elevated.\" \nGoldman said it did not believe sterling was cheap yet, with a 25-40 percent drop from pre-Brexit levels needed to rebalance the U.K.'s external position. The U.K. has a large current account deficit of around 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); that must be financed with money from overseas, which may further pressure sterling. \nAt the same time, uncertainty over upcoming elections in euro-area countries will weigh on the single-currency, according to the note. \nIn a separate note dated Sunday, Goldman lowered its sterling forecasts to 1.20, 1.18 and 1.14 on a three-, six- and 12-month basis respectively. The sterling was fetching $1.2349 at 9:27 a.m. HK/SIN. \nIt also set its 12-month target for the euro at $1.00. At 9:28 a.m. HK/SIN, the euro was fetching $1.0602. Matthew Lloyd | Getty Images \n2. Go long the dollar/yuan to play a weakening Chinese currency, Goldman said, advising using the 12-month non-deliverable forward contract with an initial target of 7.30, compared with current levels around 7.07. \nGoldman said that with dollar appreciation set to continue through 2017, the dollar/yuan would need to rise to keep the yuan's level against its trade basket stable, carrying a risk of re-igniting capital outflows from the mainland. \nIt raised its three-, six- and 12-month dollar/yuan forecasts to 7.00, 7.15 and 7.30 respectively, from 6.70, 6.80 and 7.00 previously. It also now expected the pair at 7.60 at end-2018, compared with its forecast of 7.30 previously. \n3. Goldman advised earning \"good carry\" in emerging markets and hedging the risk from China and a declining yuan. \nTo play that theme, it said to go long an equally weighted basket of Brazil's real , Russia's ruble , India's rupee and South Africa's rand , while at the same time shorting an equally weighted basket of South Korea's won and the Singapore dollar . \nThe \"good carry\" candidates – the real, ruble, rupee and rand – offer generous yields and fundamentals were improving, according to the note. \n\"The 'Trump tantrum' of the past week put meaningful pressure on the four currencies, creating more attractive entry points, and – given that both India and South Africa were net oil importers, while Russia and Brazil were net oil exporters – the basket limited exposure to oil risk,\" it said. \n\"On the short side, the won and Singapore dollar feature low carry, subdued inflation and – given both their high exposure to Chinese demand and their direct competition with China in the export market – allow us to hedge against the left tail risk that a build-up in Chinese debt results in a sharp depreciation of the yuan.\" \n4. Go long emerging market equities with insulated exposure to growth, specifically Brazil, India and Poland, without hedging currencies, Goldman suggested. \n\"We remain positive on the emerging market ex-China growth recovery story heading into 2017 and see a good entry point in expressing this view via emerging market equities,\" the bank said. \"Brazil, Poland and India offer an 'insulated exposure' to the emerging market growth recovery story, without being particularly exposed to China growth or U.S. trade policy.\" \n5. Play the \"reflation\" theme by going long U.S. 10-year TIPS , or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, \"break-even\" inflation and long euro 10-year inflation via swaps, it said. \nGoldman expected that low base-effects from commodity markets would push up headline consumer inflation figures across the major advanced economies. At the same time, inflationary pressures would get stoked by large public sector spending in Japan, China, the U.S. and Europe, it wrote. \nHigher inflation was likely to push up bond yields, a factor that would push up the value of inflation-protection related securities. \n6. Go long Euro Stoxx 50 2018 dividends via a swap trade, it said. \n\"Equities may not benefit from the reflation as much as we would like, owing to already elevated valuations and rising rates capping upside,\" the Goldman note advised. \"In addition, equities have been, and are likely to stay, volatile owing to political risk and elevated uncertainty,\" it said. \"Dividends swaps are less high beta than equities but also have some sensitivity to better growth.\" \nIt expected more than 10 percent potential return from its swap play, higher than the likely upside for the equity market. \n—By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

It appears to be ungated: Upside risk for the Aussie: Goldman turns bullish on economy \"The Aussie dollar has been caught in the crossfire between the strong rise in commodity prices and the selloff of yield-based strategies which global investors had expressed in Australian assets\" \"However, as the wash-out in yield strategies matures we believe forex investors will take up the narrative of a sharply improving trade balance, improving private sector demand indicators and the risk that the RBA contemplates hiking rates in 2017 as key reasons for the Australian dollar to commence an upswing.\" \"We now see very limited downside risk for the A$ and considerable upside risk. Indeed, a spike in the $A through US80¢ cannot be ruled out.\" -- Yes, a surprisingly bullish turn. Be wary of further USD strength if you are favouring the AUD at the moment though. LON  ",

      "text": "New York: Investing in emerging markets will be trickier in 2017, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nThe New York-based bank laid out its expectations for developing nations in a report. Below are some of the highlights.\n1. Downside risks have increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential election, which means a rally in local-currency bonds so far this year is unlikely to be repeated, Goldman Sachs said. Still, investors may want to bet on currencies that are less exposed to protectionist trade policies. The bank recommends going long Brazil’s real versus iron ore. Chile’s peso and South Africa’s rand may also appreciate “significantly” in 2017 and the nations’ current-account deficit may shrink next year.\n2. Turkey’s lira and Malaysian ringgit may not fare as well as Goldman Sachs expects to see “discontinuous foreign exchange depreciation if we see a proper rates tantrum over the next 12 months.”\n3. Stability in China is Goldman Sachs’ baseline scenario, but it never hurts to hedge. In addition to shorting the onshore yuan directly, the bank said it makes sense to protect against risks in low-yielding Asian currencies like the South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and the Singapore dollar.\n4. Goldman Sachs said investors should brace for oil-related shocks in the short term and the risk of higher interest rates in the long run. On the bright side, the bank said corporate earnings across developing nations should increase.",

      "text": "Stocks? Don’t think about it. Bonds? No thank you.\nEven while some Wall Streeters are saying Donald Trump’s presidency could result in stronger domestic growth and a boost to the stock market, a team of Goldman Sachs gs analysts led by top strategist Charles Himmelberg are saying, “Not going to happen.”\nThe prediction comes as part of the team’s annual not about the top ten market themes for 2017. Theme No.1: Utter disappointment.\nStocks already look expensive from a historical perspective, the team says. And Donald Trump is not going to help the matter. As a result, the Goldman analysts are expecting the S&P 500 Index to close at 2200CHECK in 2017--just 18 points, or higher than where it is now. Goldman also expects the price of the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond to drop 0.50% in 2017. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, will end the year up at 2.75%.\nTrump’s plans to increase infrastructure spending and lower taxes could lift economic growth, the analysis say, but it will run right into the country’s--and the world’s--biggest problem, which is a shortage of workers. That will mute the amount boost the economy will get from Trump’s stimulus spending, and it will add to inflation.\n \nMeanwhile, the productivity growth of the American worker is expected to continue slowing-- despite improvements in technology --meaning the GDP is not expected to receive a helping hand on that front. Goldman expects GDP to increase just 2.1% next year. That’s a slight increase from last year, but it’s still less than what the rest of Wall Street is expecting.\n“We are skeptical,” the team wrote. “Until more clear evidence accumulates showing that the outlook for productivity and trend growth has improved, the opportunity set for investors is likely to remain low.”\nAnd not even Trump will be able to do anything about that.",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 \n– Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its oil-price forecast for early next year, saying it is “tactically bullish” on the likelihood that OPEC will be able to reach a deal to curb output to steady global markets. \nThe investment bank said it expects oil prices in New York to rise to an average $55 a barrel during the first half of 2017 — from $45 and $50 previously — on the assumption that OPEC will agree to cut output to 33 million barrels a day and that Russia will freeze production. \n“With greater confidence that the global oil market can finally shift into deficit later next year, we now believe that there is a strong rationale for low-cost producers to deliver a swift production cut to normalize inventories,” Goldman analysts including Damien Courvalin said in a research note. \nSince late September, when members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met in Algiers and announced the outline of a deal to limit output, all eyes have been on the group to see how it might follow through with such a pledge. The group is seeking to reach an agreement by Nov. 30, when it meets in Vienna. Nations including Iran and Iraq are seeking special treatment, and prices have slumped to mid-September levels amid doubts that OPEC can succeed in coordinating a cut. \n“Oil fundamentals have weakened sharply since OPEC announced a tentative agreement” and the current glut will increase to about 700,000 barrels a day in the first three months of next year unless OPEC acts, according to Goldman Sachs. Any cut would have to come primarily from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, with other members keeping output steady at current levels through the first half of 2017, the bank said. \nThe market’s shift to a deficit could also be reflected its forward pricing, which may become backwardated, the analysts wrote. Brent futures mostly traded in contango — denoting a short-term oversupply because immediate prices are cheaper than those in later months — since a price slump that began in mid-2014, according to ICE Futures Europe. Backwardation normally indicates a more balanced market. \nRussia Freeze \nOPEC has looked outside of its 14 members — particularly to Russia — for support in its effort to steady markets. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters Sunday in Lima that there is a “strong likelihood” that an agreement will be reached, and that Russia is willing to freeze output at current levels. \nOPEC in October produced a record average 33.6 million barrels a day, according to its own estimates. Russia is now producing at a post-Soviet-era high, data from the nation’s energy ministry show. \nGoldman said it still expects West Texas Intermediate prices to average $52.50 a barrel and Brent crude to average $54 a barrel next year. That’s because OPEC may resume production growth in late 2017 and U.S. shale producers would benefit from a price rally early in the year. It also cautioned that political risks could derail any production deal. SHOW MORE",

Goldman Sachs lowered its rating for 3M to sell from neutral, saying the company's earnings results will come in below expectations in the coming year.\n\n\"While MMM remains a solid franchise with top quartile margins/returns through a cycle, we see downside risk to Street EPS ... owing to growth challenges in electronics as smartphone sales taper and the shift to OLED continues,\" analyst Joe Ritchie wrote in a note to clients Monday. \n\"We also think margins will be pressured from rising raw material costs. Lastly, we believe the multiple (~20x 2017E EPS) could derate if investors rotate to more cyclically exposed industrials.\"",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Goldman Sachs Says Donald Trump Will Be Terrible for Stocks in 2017 \nStocks? Don’t think about it. Bonds? No thank you. \nEven while some Wall Streeters are saying Donald Trump’s presidency could result in stronger domestic growth and a boost to the stock market, a team of Goldman Sachs gs analysts led by top strategist Charles Himmelberg are saying, “Not going to happen.” \nThe prediction comes as part of the team’s annual not about the top ten market themes for 2017. Theme No.1: Utter disappointment. \nStocks already look expensive from a historical perspective, the team says. And Donald Trump is not going to help the matter. As a result, the Goldman analysts are expecting the S&P 500 Index to close at 2200 in 2017—just 18 points, or higher than where it is now. Goldman also expects the price of the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond to drop 0.50% in 2017. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, will end the year up at 2.75%. \nTrump’s plans to increase infrastructure spending and lower taxes could lift economic growth, the analysis say, but it will run right into the country’s—and the world’s—biggest problem, which is a shortage of workers. That will mute the amount boost the economy will get from Trump’s stimulus spending, and it will add to inflation. \n\nMeanwhile, the productivity growth of the American worker is expected to continue slowing— despite improvements in technology —meaning the GDP is not expected to receive a helping hand on that front. Goldman expects GDP to increase just 2.1% next year. That’s a slight increase from last year, but it’s still less than what the rest of Wall Street is expecting. \n“We are skeptical,” the team wrote. “Until more clear evidence accumulates showing that the outlook for productivity and trend growth has improved, the opportunity set for investors is likely to remain low.” \nAnd not even Trump will be able to do anything about that.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story LONDON — Michael S. Sherwood, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman and co-head of its European division, will retire from the Wall Street firm at the end of the year. Mr. Sherwood, who is also known as Woody, had previously been seen as a potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein , the Goldman Sachs chairman and chief executive. Mr. Blankfein revealed last year that he had what he described as a “highly curable” form of lymphoma. Mr. Sherwood’s departure came as Goldman tries to navigate the political uncertainty following Britain’s decision this year to leave the European Union. The outcome of the British referendum has raised questions about whether Goldman and other American banks may be forced to shift operations out of London to continue to serve some European clients. Richard J. Gnodde, who oversaw the bank’s European operations with Mr. Sherwood, will become the sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International after Mr. Sherwood’s departure, according to an internal memorandum reviewed by The New York Times. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Over the course of his career, Michael has played a vital role in establishing and growing our franchise in Europe and around the world,” Mr. Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president, said in the memo on Monday. “His expertise and knowledge across a range of markets, as well as his passion and commitment to our culture, have influenced a generation of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” they added. Mr. Sherwood has been with Goldman for 30 years, joining the bank in 1986. He previously headed its fixed-income, currency and commodities division in Europe and served as global co-head of its securities division. He has been co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International since 2005 and a vice chairman since February 2008. He is one of the firm’s highest-paid employees, earning total compensation of $21 million in 2015, according to its proxy statement . His departure came just over a month after Mark Schwartz, who is chairman of Goldman’s Asia Pacific region and a vice chairman of the firm, announced plans to retire at the end of the year. This year, Mr. Sherwood was one of several Goldman executives called to testify before Parliament over the collapse of BHS, one Britain’s best-known retailers. Goldman served as an informal adviser to Philip Green, the chain’s former owner, in its sale. The department store chain, which employed 11,000 people, was liquidated following its collapse in April just a year after it was sold by Mr. Green to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a former racecar driver and businessman who had previously declared bankruptcy multiple times. \nFollow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray .",

      "text": "by Paul Clarke 14 minutes ago \nMichael Sherwood, the co-CEO of Goldman Sachs in London, has just left after 30 years at the bank.  en/266210/michael-sherwood-goldman-sachs/ \nMichael Sherwood, vice-chairman and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs international in London is leaving . Sherwood was made head of debt syndicate just three years out of university and was promoted to partner when he was 29. He leaves after 30 years and Richard Gnodde is set to take over as sole CEO at Goldman in the UK. \nThis is what you should know about Sherwood. 1. He speaks to his mother every day \nSherwood said there’s “isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t speak to my mum”. 2. He got his first job through “devious” means \nWhen Sherwood was 19 he interned at SG Warburg and was “chief photocopier” on the syndicated loans desk. One of the jobs was photocopying and faxing documents to other banks. “Being devious,” he took a note of the banks and the people he needed to contact. “I didn’t know about Goldman Sachs. I’d worked as a photocopier one summer at SG Warburg. I was attached to the syndicated loans desk. There was a deal involving Fannie Mae and when it came to applying for a job I wrote to all the banks that were listed on the sheet of paper.” 3. He did his important studying early \nSherwood completed his A-levels by aged 16. He spent a year at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before accepting a position at Manchester University and graduated at the age 20. Sherwood said he “wasn’t the best student”, but got through it. A profile by the Independent suggests he was part of a group of rich kids who went around campus driving expensive cars, living in flash accommodation and eating in top restaurants. 4. He joined Goldman Sachs at the right time \nSherwood interned at Goldman Sachs and was offered a job. They told him he had to accept “by next Friday”. However, he was also expecting an offer from SG Warburg and called them to see if this was likely. “The person said, ‘Here at SG Warburg we make our hiring decisions on April 7 at 8pm’. I need to thank that person as it made me accept the Goldman job,” he said. At the time, there were 150 people at Goldman in London. There are over 7,000 now. 5. His first break came through tragedy \nSherwood rose up the ranks very rapidly at Goldman. He was made partner by the age of 29. However, it was when he was just three years into his job that the first very big break came. His boss at the time was onboard the jumbo jet that crashed over Lockerbie in 1988. After his death, Sherwood was offered the job as head of syndicate at Goldman in London when he was just 23. “Most of my competitors were 35-40 years old. It was bizarre really,” he said. 6. He left Goldman Sachs for two weeks \nIn 1994, after what he describes as relentless pursuit by a Swiss-based ultra high net worth who was looking to start a hedge fund in London, Sherwood quit Goldman Sachs and accepted the hedge fund job after demanding “ridiculous” terms. People were calling shortly afterwards asking if he really meant to leave, he said. In the end, his boss Mark Winkelman approached him saying that he had had a, “very long holiday” and it was time to come back. He was made partner the following year. 7. He’s been thinking about leaving for years \n“I’ve been here 23 years. At the start of the year I say to my wife: ‘Just one more year.'” he said in 2008 . “I’ve been saying it for seven or eight years. I’ve got two children, 13 and eight, who demand a lot of my attention and a wife who wants to see more of me.” But he admits: “I still enjoy it. I’m a BlackBerry addict. I can’t stop.” 8. He’s a very talented tennis and table tennis player \nSherwood is a little portly these days, but he has a lot of sporting prowess. He plays table tennis for an hour every week with his close friend Matthew Syed, the former British number one. He also played tennis and, while playing for his school in north London as a youth, came close to make it to Wimbledon. 9. He has the trappings of a rich man, but doesn’t always enjoy them \nThis is from a 1993 profile from the Independent . Things might have changed: “He buys the best theatre tickets but often leaves the show early if he is bored. He eats in the best restaurants, but suffers from nerves and often cannot hold down his food.” 10. Everyone calls him ‘Woody’ \nThe Independent says that everyone calls him Fat Mike. He insists otherwise: “Everyone calls me Woody.” 11. He unwinds by watching football \nSherwood is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur, and has a stake in the club. He also had a stint on the board of Watford FC. and regularly watches soccer. “It’s a family tradition — I used to go with my dad, and now I take my kids,” he said . 12. He prides himself on being forthright \nSherwood is often described as being arrogant. He would probably say he was just being honest. “If you always tell the truth, you never have to remember what you’ve told someone,” he said. “You have to be upfront and tell people what you want to save any pain later.” 13. He never really had a plan \nLike Lloyd Blankfein , Sherwood has an ability to appear very self-effacing when asked about his career while young graduates desperately clamour for some pearls of wisdom. Sherwood’s advice? Don’t plan too much. “In my experience in the industry, people who to plan their careers over multiple years are almost always disappointed. Seize the day,” he said.",

      "text": "By Max Colchester\nLONDON--Michael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe, will leave the bank ending a three-decade career with the Wall Street giant.\nMr. Sherwood, known as \"Woody,\" will retire at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo Monday. Since joining Goldman Sachs in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe. The bank said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde is currently Co-CEO of the unit with Mr. Sherwood.\nGoldman Sachs International deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016 the division's profits fell 21% compared with a year earlier to $1.32 billion.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of Brexit, which could result in it having to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, has at times found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis.\nAnd he recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nOn Wednesday last week Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 shares of Goldman Sachs worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com\n 21, 2016 11:02 ET (16:02 ",

      "text": "By Max Colchester\nMichael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe and a three-decade veteran of the Wall Street giant, on Monday announced a surprise decision to retire.\nMr. Sherwood, who is widely known as \"Woody,\" will leave the bank at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo. Since joining the bank in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe and more recently into emerging growth markets.\nMr. Sherwood, like many in the inner circle of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, came up through Goldman's fixed-income division. He previously chaired Goldman's powerful partnership committee and had been seen as a potential successor to Mr. Blankfein, though some inside the bank believed his odds had lengthened as Goldman's international business had faced setbacks.\nHis departure thins the ranks of the next generation of executives seen to be jockeying for Mr. Blankfein's job.\nGoldman said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde, a South African merger banker who also co-heads Goldman's investment-banking division, is based in London.\nGoldman Sachs international deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016, the division's profits fell 21% to $1.32 billion compared with a year earlier.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit vote, which could force the company to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nGoldman's international division has had other troubles. The firm's work of raising money for a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund, known as 1MDB, has thrust it into a global corruption probe.\nEarlier this year, Libya's government fund sued Goldman over soured derivatives the bank had sold it. Goldman won the trial, but faced testimony that it took advantage of its client's lack of understanding to sell complicated securities.\nAnd Goldman has been cutting jobs in Asia after struggling to book consistent profits in the region, where it faces stiff competition from local banks. Mr. Sherwood's departure comes around the same time as that of Mark Schwartz, who had overseen Goldman's Asia business from Beijing.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, also found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. He also recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy, putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nLast week, Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 Goldman Sachs shares worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMr. Sherwood was the last remaining vice chairman at the firm, a title given to those in Mr. Blankfein's close orbit, following the departures of Mr. Schwartz, John Weinberg and Michael Evans.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com\n 21, 2016 11:51 ET (16:51 ",

      "text": "View All Posts \nLast week, Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini upgraded Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) from “Neutral” to a “Buy,” largely in response to the company’s growth opportunity in cloud computing. Moreover, Bellini upped her price target on Microsoft stock to $68 … 13% better than the stock’s current value. Source: Johannes Marliem Via Flickr \nIt was certainly an encouraging development for owners of MSFT stock. \nYet, those who know the story well will know that rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) owns the biggest piece of the cloud computing market, and besides, MSFT’s cloud margins have been shrinking even as that division’s revenue has grown. \nThing is, both of those things are changing. WhatYou Need to Know About MSFT Stock \nBellini said a lot with her upgrade, but there was little doubt as to the crux of her bullish thesis for Microsoft stock : “Azure is the #2 market share vendor in the cloud space, and has grown 100 percent or more yoy eight of the last ten quarters, and in fact growth accelerated in Q3 16 … With a large Microsoft customer base and strong C-level relationships, we believe Azure can continue to grow revenue and improve margins over time.” \nAs was noted, in conjunction with the upgrade, Bellini thinks the cloud growth opportunity will push MSFT stock up to a price of $68, sooner or later. 7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap Heap \nIf margins improve over time as Azure — the platform MSFT created to manage the cloud — gains popularity, it would be a reverse of the direction things have been pointed for the past few quarters. That is, cloud revenue has been shrinking, while cloud margins have been narrowing. \nFor perspective, in the recently completed Q1 of fiscal 2017, Microsoft turned $6.38 billion worth of revenue into operating income of $2.06 billion. In the same quarter a year earlier, the company only drove $5.89 billion worth of sales, but converted $2.39 billion of that into income. Click to Enlarge Source: Microsoft Corporation \nDon’t jump to conclusions about the trend, however. As the company’s recent quarterly deck explained , “Operating expenses increased $408 million or 21%, mainly due to higher reserach and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses.” \nThat spending won’t go on forever. The ROI on the investment, however, will last in perpetuity. Changes Coming \nStill, the cloud market is dominated by rival Amazon; MSFT is a distant second. Can Microsoft really take what Amazon has? \nA lot of people seem to think so, and for good reason. \nAs of the end of last year, Amazon Web Services controlled 31% of the public cloud market, versus MSFT’s 9% share. In the meantime, while Amazon still controlled 31% of the cloud infrastructure as of the end of the second quarter, Microsoft had upped its share to 11% . Granted, Amazon’s year-over-year growth in cloud revenue was an impressive 53%. Microsoft’s was more impressive though, at 100%. \nThat growth in MSFT’s cloud services (and Azure in particular) isn’t expected to abate anytime soon either. In a poll recently taken by Morgan Stanley, 20% of CIOs said their companies currently use Amazon Web Services, while 10% say they’re using Azure. Within three years, though, 31% of those CIOs anticipate they’ll be using Microsoft’s Azure platform , while only 29% will be using Amazon Web Services.",

Mr. Sherwood, who is also known as Woody, had previously been seen as a potential successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein , the Goldman Sachs chairman and chief executive. Mr. Blankfein revealed last year that he had what he described as a “highly curable” form of lymphoma.\nMr. Sherwood’s departure came as Goldman tries to navigate the political uncertainty following Britain’s decision this year to leave the European Union.\nThe outcome of the British referendum has raised questions about whether Goldman and other American banks may be forced to shift operations out of London to continue to serve some European clients.\nRichard J. Gnodde, who oversaw the bank’s European operations with Mr. Sherwood, will become the sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International after Mr. Sherwood’s departure, according to an internal memorandum reviewed by The New York Times.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “Over the course of his career, Michael has played a vital role in establishing and growing our franchise in Europe and around the world,” Mr. Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president, said in the memo on Monday.\n“His expertise and knowledge across a range of markets, as well as his passion and commitment to our culture, have influenced a generation of professionals at Goldman Sachs,” they added.\nMr. Sherwood has been with Goldman for 30 years, joining the bank in 1986. He previously headed its fixed-income, currency and commodities division in Europe and served as global co-head of its securities division. He has been co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International since 2005 and a vice chairman since February 2008.\nHe is one of the firm’s highest-paid employees, earning total compensation of $21 million in 2015, according to its proxy statement .\nHis departure came just over a month after Mark Schwartz, who is chairman of Goldman’s Asia Pacific region and a vice chairman of the firm, announced plans to retire at the end of the year.\nThis year, Mr. Sherwood was one of several Goldman executives called to testify before Parliament over the collapse of BHS, one Britain’s best-known retailers. Goldman served as an informal adviser to Philip Green, the chain’s former owner, in its sale.\nThe department store chain, which employed 11,000 people, was liquidated following its collapse in April just a year after it was sold by Mr. Green to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a former racecar driver and businessman who had previously declared bankruptcy multiple times.",

      "text": "Michael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe and a three-decade veteran of the Wall Street giant, on Monday announced a surprise decision to retire.\nMr. Sherwood, who is widely known as \"Woody,\" will leave the bank at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo. Since joining the bank in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe and more recently into emerging growth markets.\nMr. Sherwood, like many in the inner circle of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, came up through Goldman's fixed-income division. He previously chaired Goldman's powerful partnership committee and had been seen as a potential successor to Mr. Blankfein, though some inside the bank believed his odds had lengthened as Goldman's international business had faced setbacks.\nHis departure thins the ranks of the next generation of executives seen to be jockeying for Mr. Blankfein's job.\nGoldman said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde, a South African merger banker who also co-heads Goldman's investment-banking division, is based in London.\nGoldman Sachs international deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016, the division's profits fell 21% to $1.32 billion compared with a year earlier.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit vote, which could force the company to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nGoldman's international division has had other troubles. The firm's work of raising money for a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund, known as 1MDB, has thrust it into a global corruption probe.\nEarlier this year, Libya's government fund sued Goldman over soured derivatives the bank had sold it. Goldman won the trial, but faced testimony that it took advantage of its client's lack of understanding to sell complicated securities.\nAnd Goldman has been cutting jobs in Asia after struggling to book consistent profits in the region, where it faces stiff competition from local banks. Mr. Sherwood's departure comes around the same time as that of Mark Schwartz, who had overseen Goldman's Asia business from Beijing.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, also found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. He also recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy, putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nLast week, Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 Goldman Sachs shares worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMr. Sherwood was the last remaining vice chairman at the firm, a title given to those in Mr. Blankfein's close orbit, following the departures of Mr. Schwartz, John Weinberg and Michael Evans.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com\n 13:45 ET (18:45 ",

      "text": "By Max Colchester\nMichael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe and a three-decade veteran of the Wall Street giant, on Monday announced a surprise decision to retire.\nMr. Sherwood, who is widely known as \"Woody,\" will leave the bank at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo. Since joining the bank in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe and more recently into emerging growth markets.\nMr. Sherwood, like many in the inner circle of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, came up through Goldman's fixed-income division. He previously chaired Goldman's powerful partnership committee and had been seen as a potential successor to Mr. Blankfein, though some inside the bank believed his odds had lengthened as Goldman's international business had faced setbacks.\nHis departure thins the ranks of the next generation of executives seen to be jockeying for Mr. Blankfein's job.\nGoldman said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde, a South African merger banker who also co-heads Goldman's investment-banking division, is based in London.\nGoldman Sachs international deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016, the division's profits fell 21% to $1.32 billion compared with a year earlier.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit vote, which could force the company to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nGoldman's international division has had other troubles. The firm's work of raising money for a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund, known as 1MDB, has thrust it into a global corruption probe.\nEarlier this year, Libya's government fund sued Goldman over soured derivatives the bank had sold it. Goldman won the trial, but faced testimony that it took advantage of its client's lack of understanding to sell complicated securities.\nAnd Goldman has been cutting jobs in Asia after struggling to book consistent profits in the region, where it faces stiff competition from local banks. Mr. Sherwood's departure comes around the same time as that of Mark Schwartz, who had overseen Goldman's Asia business from Beijing.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, also found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. He also recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy, putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nLast week, Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 Goldman Sachs shares worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMr. Sherwood was the last remaining vice chairman at the firm, a title given to those in Mr. Blankfein's close orbit, following the departures of Mr. Schwartz, John Weinberg and Michael Evans.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com\n 11:51 ET (16:51 ",

      "text": "View Photo \nMichael Sherwood quits Goldman Sachs role Co-chair of European arm to retire from Wall Street bank after 30-year career that included grilling by MPs over BHS collapse Michael Sherwood appears before MPs at the business, innovation and skills committee in June to discuss the collapse of BHS. Photograph: PA \nOne of the City’s most influential and highest-paid bankers, Michael Sherwood, is leaving Goldman Sachs after a 30-year career, including becoming embroiled in controversy over the collapsed retailer BHS. \nSherwood, a Londoner who joined Goldman after graduating from Manchester University , plans to focus on charitable activities when he leaves the US bank in about six months. \nA former bond trader who was paid $21m (£16.8m) last year, Sherwood usually keeps a low public profile. But this year he appeared before MPs investigating the collapse of BHS, which put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a £571m pension deficit. It was a public appearance that Goldman bankers would usually prefer to avoid. The bank is proud of its work behind the scenes in securing deals and offering advice to governments and big businesses. \nBut Goldman was forced to talk about its relationship with Sir Philip Green when he was selling BHS. Green said he was “1,000,000%” would not have sold the department store chain to Dominic Chappell had the buyer not passed an informal vetting by the bank. \nSherwood denied there had been “sniff test” but also had to apologise to MPs for not disclosing that Goldman been approached by Green about a £40m loan to BHS when it was bought by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. \nThe MPs concluded: “Goldman Sachs should have been either ‘in’ or ‘out’ of the deal, and demonstrably so. As it was, they had authority without accountability.” \nSherwood – known as “Woody” – told the Financial Times that his unexpected departure was not connected to BHS. He was regarded as candidate to replace Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman, whom Sherwood said had spent “most of his time trying to persuade me to stay”. The discussions to leave had started before the BHS blow-up, he added. \n“I didn’t want to have anything out there before I left. On Philip Green, I wish we hadn’t been involved and I certainly don’t think we did anything wrong,” Sherwood told the FT. “It is one blip in a 30-year career and it really played no part in my decision.” \nThe 51-year-old was co-head of Goldman’s European business, which employs 6,000 people and is grappling with the uncertainty caused by the vote for Brexit. Construction of a new head office in London – a stone’s throw from its existing headquarters on the edge of the financial district – is already underway. His co-head, Richard Gnodde, will become chief executive of the European operations. \nSherwood told the FT: “As you know, we were very much in the remain camp … We will readjust, we will have to do what we want. I hope it will be favourable to the UK and we are able to keep a lot of people here.” \nHe achieved the coveted status of partner while he was still in 20s and he told the FT: “I stopped working for money a long time ago … when we went public.” Goldman floated in 1999 , putting value on its partners’ stakes in the business for the first time. His stake is worth more than $70m. \n“I’ve been a Goldman Sachs addict and it’s very hard to come off an addiction,” he added. \nIn a statement to the bank’s 36,800 staff, the two most senior executives at Goldmn paid tribute to Sherwood. \nBlankfeinand Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer, said: “Please join us in thanking Michael, or Woody, as everyone calls him, for his commitment and extraordinary service to the firm, our clients and our people. We wish him, his wife Melanie and their family all the best in the years ahead.” \nHis immediate plan is said to be to focus on charities, including Greenhouse Sports, which helps children in cities access sport. \nGoldman has a long history of filling government and policy roles. Notable alumni include Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England; Hank Paulson, the former US treasury secretary; Lord O’Neill, who drove the Conservative government’s northern powerhouse policy; and Lord Paul Deighton, who was a Treasury minister for George Osborne. \nPoliticians are also attracted to Goldman. Theresa May warned a private meeting of Goldman bankers about the dangers of Brexit a month before the referendum and before she became prime minister. An audio recording of the warning by May – who was then home secretary – was leaked to the Guardian .

      "text": "REUTERS/ Pascal Lauener \nTo get a job at Goldman Sachs, you've got to know your stuff. But financial knowledge alone isn't enough to land you a highly coveted gig at the financial giant.\nTo make the cut, you'll need to prove you have the skills, experience, and motivation to thrive — and you'll also need to prove that you're a good cultural fit. In other words: You'll need to ace the interview.\nWe sifted through reports from Glassdoor to find some of the trickiest and diciest interview questions Goldman has to offer.\nWhether you're applying to be a summer associate or a VP, here are a few questions to master before you walk in the door:\n'If you were an object, what would you be?' — Financial-analyst candidate 'If you were asked to move this 30-plus story building across the Hudson River, what would you do?' — Technology-analyst candidate 'How would your past supervisors describe you?' — Legal entity management analyst candidate 'If you can race only five horses at a time, given 20 horses, what is the lowest number of races you need to host to determine the top three horses?' — Software engineer candidate 'If you had to make a program that could vote for the top three funniest people in the office, how would you do it?' — Technology-analyst candidate 'Sell yourself in 30 seconds.' — Summer analyst candidate 'What would cause you to stop using the internet?' — Extended-managing-director candidate 'Is there anything about this job which makes you nervous?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'Tell me about a time that you failed and weren't able to fix it.' — Summer-associate candidate 'What is one characteristic you have that would prevent us from hiring you?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What frustrates you?' — Financial-analyst candidate 'What do you do if a client insists on making a trade or transaction that you know is not profitable for them in the long run, but it would benefit the bank?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What happens when you type Google.com into the web browser?' — Summer-analyst candidate 'Suppose you had eight identical balls. One of them is slightly heavier and you are given a balance scale. What's the fewest number of times you have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?' — Software-engineering-intern candidate 'What is the most interesting business idea you've ever heard about?' — Analyst candidate 'Can you tell me about a time when you were in a team as a member, not a leader?' — Corporate-service and real-estate candidate 'Do you need us more than we need you?' — Mortgage-private-wealth candidate 'What, in your opinion, led to the financial crisis?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What's your opinion about Adolf Hitler?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'If you were arrested for something that you believed wasn't wrong, what would you do?' — Hedge fund-analyst candidate 'You are a waitress at a restaurant with an employee policy that all tips are put in a jar and split at the end of the day between the wait staff. A very satisfied customer gives you a large tip and tells you not to share it because you deserved it. You also know that some of the other waiters and waitresses have been pocketing their tips. What would you do in this scenario?' — Legal-analyst candidate 'Name a current issue in the news that will affect business at Goldman.' — Analyst-intern candidate 'If I asked one of your honest friends to tell me one good and bad thing about yourself, what would they say?' — Research-associate candidate 'If a trader comes to you with a trade that he wants you to do immediately, but you need to go through the appropriate means to make sure it's good for the company, what do you do?' — Summer-analyst candidate 'How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the US each year?' — Programmer-analyst candidate This is an update of a story originally written by Rachel Sugar. \nNOW WATCH: 9 phrases on your résumé that make hiring managers cringe \n",

      "text": "(Would you be able to guess how many square feet of pizza are eaten in the US each year?REUTERS/ Pascal Lauener) \nTo get a job at Goldman Sachs, you've got to know your stuff. But financial knowledge alone isn't enough to land you a highly coveted gig at the financial giant. \nTo make the cut, you'll need to prove you have the skills, experience, and motivation to thrive — and you'll also need to prove that you're a good cultural fit. In other words: You'll need to ace the interview.\nWe sifted through reports from Glassdoor to find some of the trickiest and diciest interview questions Goldman has to offer.\nWhether you're applying to be a summer associate or a VP, here are a few questions to master before you walk in the door:\n'If you were an object, what would you be?' — Financial-analyst candidate 'If you were asked to move this 30-plus story building across the Hudson River, what would you do?' — Technology-analyst candidate 'How would your past supervisors describe you?' — Legal entity management analyst candidate 'If you can race only five horses at a time, given 20 horses, what is the lowest number of races you need to host to determine the top three horses?' — Software engineer candidate 'If you had to make a program that could vote for the top three funniest people in the office, how would you do it?' — Technology-analyst candidate 'Sell yourself in 30 seconds.' — Summer analyst candidate 'What would cause you to stop using the internet?' — Extended-managing-director candidate 'Is there anything about this job which makes you nervous?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'Tell me about a time that you failed and weren't able to fix it.' — Summer-associate candidate 'What is one characteristic you have that would prevent us from hiring you?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What frustrates you?' — Financial-analyst candidate 'What do you do if a client insists on making a trade or transaction that you know is not profitable for them in the long run, but it would benefit the bank?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What happens when you type Google.com into the web browser?' — Summer-analyst candidate 'Suppose you had eight identical balls. One of them is slightly heavier and you are given a balance scale. What's the fewest number of times you have to use the scale to find the heavier ball?' — Software-engineering-intern candidate 'What is the most interesting business idea you've ever heard about?' — Analyst candidate 'Can you tell me about a time when you were in a team as a member, not a leader?' — Corporate-service and real-estate candidate 'Do you need us more than we need you?' — Mortgage-private-wealth candidate 'What, in your opinion, led to the financial crisis?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'What's your opinion about Adolf Hitler?' — Operations-analyst candidate 'If you were arrested for something that you believed wasn't wrong, what would you do?' — Hedge fund-analyst candidate 'You are a waitress at a restaurant with an employee policy that all tips are put in a jar and split at the end of the day between the wait staff. A very satisfied customer gives you a large tip and tells you not to share it because you deserved it. You also know that some of the other waiters and waitresses have been pocketing their tips. What would you do in this scenario?' — Legal-analyst candidate 'Name a current issue in the news that will affect business at Goldman.' — Analyst-intern candidate 'If I asked one of your honest friends to tell me one good and bad thing about yourself, what would they say?' — Research-associate candidate 'If a trader comes to you with a trade that he wants you to do immediately, but you need to go through the appropriate means to make sure it's good for the company, what do you do?' — Summer-analyst candidate 'How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the US each year?' — Programmer-analyst candidate This is an update of a story originally written by Rachel Sugar. \nNOW WATCH: Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer explains the 3 keys to building a powerful brand \n\nMore From Business Insider \n7 jobs that will make you most welcome in Canada \nHiring managers have figured out a way to trick job candidates into answering one of the toughest interview questions \n28 weird jobs famous people had before making it big",

      "text": "By Max Colchester\nSherwood, known as \"Woody,\" has played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe\nMichael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe and a three-decade veteran of the Wall Street giant, on Monday announced a surprise decision to retire.\nSherwood, who is widely known as \"Woody,\" will leave the bank at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in an internal memo. Since joining the bank in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe and more recently into emerging growth markets.\nSherwood, like many in the inner circle of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, came up through Goldman's fixed-income division. He previously chaired Goldman's powerful partnership committee and had been seen as a potential successor to Blankfein, though some inside the bank believed his odds had lengthened as Goldman's international business had faced setbacks.\nAn expanded version of this article (http://www.wsj.com/articles/michael-sherwood-to-leave-goldman-sachs-1479741602?mod=mktw) appears on WSJ.com\nTop stories on WSJ.com\nVenezuela's nemesis is a hardware salesman at a Home Depot in Alabama (http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-nemesis-is-a-screw-salesman-at-a-home-depot-in-alabama-1479672919?mod=trending_now_1)\nEarthquakes: Reckoning With 'The Big One' in California--and It Just Got Bigger (http://www.wsj.com/articles/earthquakes-reckoning-with-the-big-one-in-californiaand-it-just-got-bigger-1479643228?mod=trending_now_2)\n-Max Colchester; 1532ET\n ",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs’s Michael Sherwood to Leave After 30 Years Dakin Campbell November 21, 2016 — 10:03 AM EST November 21, 2016 — 11:50 AM EST Richard Gnodde to become CEO of Goldman Sachs International Sherwood will become a senior director after departure \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. said Michael Sherwood, co-chief executive officer of the firm’s European operation, will leave the company at year-end. \nRichard Gnodde, 56, will take over as CEO of Goldman Sachs International, the New York-based company said Monday in an internal memo. Sherwood, who’s been at the firm for 30 years, will become a senior director. \n“Michael worked closely with many of our corporate, asset-management and investing clients,” CEO Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said in the memo. “His understanding of corporate strategy combined with a deep sense of the longer-term structural forces shaping markets and economies were the basis for his innovative thinking across industries and products.” \nSherwood, 51, has been a vice chairman since 2008 and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International since 2005, according to the memo. He’s also a member of the management committee, co-chairman of the European-management committee, and chairman of the growth-markets executive group. He once was chairman of the powerful partnership committee, charged with overseeing the naming of new partners, and the business-standards committee. \nThe Financial Times reported Sherwood’s departure earlier Monday. Slowing Down \nIn an interview, Sherwood said he was ready to slow down, disconnect from the bank and spend more time investing his own money and pursuing philanthropic interests. He said he’s known little else since joining Goldman Sachs when he was 20 years old, and doesn’t own a personal e-mail address or have a home office. \n“I’ve got so many other interests and I want to do other things with my life,” he said. “If I told you I hadn’t had 10 days off in a row in 31 years, you would have thought I was a complete nut. But that’s sort of what’s it’s been for me.” \nSherwood said the hardest part of the decision was telling Blankfein, whom he said he considers a close friend. Blankfein was trying to persuade him to change his mind as recently as Sunday, he said. BHS Sale \nSherwood attracted attention in June when he testified at a U.K. parliamentary hearing on the collapse of failed British retailer BHS Ltd. Lawmakers were examining the role Goldman Sachs played in advising billionaire Philip Green in his sale of the chain to former race-car driver Dominic Chappell. Sherwood, who said Goldman doesn’t accept any blame for the retailer’s subsequent demise, said he regretted not keeping a more thorough paper trail over the bank’s role. \nSherwood was named a partner in 1994, the same year as Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s campaign finance chair now under consideration for Treasury secretary.

Including shares he owns or has sold, options he’s exercised, cash rewards in the past two years, and proceeds from his investments in the firm’s own private-equity funds, Sherwood has reaped more than $300 million before taxes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Quiet Life \nThis is at least the second time Sherwood has left the company. In 1994, he resigned to join Swiss securities firm CBI-UBP International. Articles at the time said he and a colleague had tired of the high-stress atmosphere at Goldman Sachs. Sherwood married in 1993, and was still putting in more than 60 hours a week. The quiet life of Swiss private banking appealed to him. \nA month later, he returned to Goldman Sachs, telling International Financing Review magazine that he’d missed “the buzz and excitement.” \nAnother reversal seems unlikely. \n“There is a time in life when you decide and you sort of know,” he said Monday. “I have been wrestling with it for quite a while and it’s time for younger people with more energy to take the mantle.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Global finance and investment firm Goldman Sachs has reportedly dropped out of the R3 blockchain consortium after choosing not to renew its membership on 31 October. The firm was one of the founding members of R3 – a distributed ledger technology (DLT) venture that leads a group of over 70 major financial institutions in conducting research and development into how blockchain can be used to advance traditional banking.\nGoldman Sachs will continue to work with and develop its own DLT technology, a spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal in a statement.\nAn R3 spokesperson said it was \"always expected\" the consortium would change, adding: \"Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.\"\nBlockchain is the decentralised payment processing system behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and maintains a secure 'public ledger' of all existing transactions on a network.\nGoldman Sachs was a lead investor in a $50m fundraising round for bitcoin start-up Circle Internet Financial in April 2015. As noted by the Journal, the financial giant is also in the process of seeking a number of patents for its own digital currency systems.\nIndeed, on 18 October this year, BankingTechnology reported on the patent filings and indicated it was a becoming a contentious issue within the consortium – which is joint-developing an open-source DLT platform called Corda to handle complex financial transactions.\nAccording to BankingTechnology, Kristian Gårder, a representative from Nordic R3 member SEB, said: \"The R3 consortium has applied for a patent for Corda. But both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have applied for their own blockchain patents, and they are not alone in doing so.\n\"Members will obviously worry if some R3 members seek patents that we've discussed together. Now we are beginning to see alliances form. The risk is that Corda is not used by all the banks. If that happens its benefit will be severely limited. It's a huge challenge to get 65 banks to cooperate.\"\nIn any case, it remains unclear why Goldman Sachs chose not to renew its membership. Marc Kaufman, partner at Reed Smith who specialises in technology patent law, told IBTimesUK : \"I have no reason to believe it is about patents. There possibly is a lot at play, including that Goldman is an investor in Digital Asset Holdings which is part of and R3 'competitor' Hyperledger.\"\nAccording to Coindesk, another ongoing issue within the consortium is that R3 is currently seeking funding from its members – a move that has reportedly led to internal disagreements. Other members include Barclays, JP Morgan and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS).\nRelated Articles \nIBT Media to host Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in Capital Markets event Chronicled launches blockchain-registered supply chain and pharmaceutical packaging R3 hosts the Second Smart Contract Templates Summit Goldman Sachs drops out of R3 research consortium but will not abandon blockchain",

The consortium however continues to build momentum since its beginnings with its member ranks growing to more than 70 of the financial services industry’s biggest players. \nThe WSJ reported that Goldman let its membership lapse on October 31st. \nInstead, the bank will focus its blockchain efforts on internal development and investments in specialists. It has already made multi-million dollar bets on two startups in the field: Circle and Digital asset Holdings. \nDistributed ledger technology is best known for supporting bitcoin and other digital currencies. Banks have been interested in using blockchain to speed up transactions from old legacy systems while saving operating costs and to better secure and improve banking infrastructure. \nTurnover like this was expected from R3 who told the WSJ: \nDeveloping technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time. \nIt was just recently announced that Singapore Exchange is joining R3 , becoming the first Asia-Pacific exchange to do so.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Goldman Sachs and Santander Are Bailing on R3’s Blockchain Group \nGoldman Sachs has pulled out of R3 CEV, a blockchain group that counts more than 70 financial firms among its members. \nThe investment bank, which was one of the first nine to join R3 in fall 2015, decided to exit the group after failing to agree on terms of a prospective fundraising deal, sources close to the matter told Fortune . The Wall Street Journal first reported Goldman’s departure on Monday. \nFollowing the news of Goldman’s departure, Banco Santander also withdrew, Reuters reported . Santander’s reasons for leaving are less clear. \nBoth Santander and Goldman are investors in Digital Asset Holdings, a rival blockchain startup headed by headed by Blythe Masters , a former J.P. Morgan top exec. \nThe shakeup indicates that the field is maturing rather than waning. Distributed ledger technologies—which underpin cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin—are gearing up to replace the aging back office software and databases that keep Wall Street humming. As these blockchain solutions come closer to reality, the companies bacting their production are beginning to pick sides. \nFortune has learned Goldman gs informed R3’s member banks that it intended to exit the consortium on a call around the time of the Money2020 financial tech conference in Las Vegas in mid-October. The membership, which cost $100,000, according to a source familiar with the terms, lapsed on Oct. 31, and the bank chose not to renew. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nThe fundraising dispute centered on control. In May, R3 began seeking to raise a $200 million round that would have granted 90% of the firm’s equity to its member banks with 10% retained by R3, a person close to the negotiations told Fortune . \nThe consortium’s 42 original member companies—including J.P. Morgan Chase jpm , Barclays bcs , Deutsche Bank db , UBS ubs , and others—had equal rights under contract to participate in such a Series A deal, a source said. In addition, 31 other members of R3’s development lab would have the opportunity to contribute. \nThat opening bid was renegotiated to a $150 million raise from its member banks—with potential support from outside investors—that would give 60% ownership to the investors and 40% to R3. This deal framework—still a pending option—had been proposed in early fall, a source told Fortune . \nGoldman sought more leverage in the deal, which could have included a board seat or some other element of additional control, sources said. When R3’s member financial firms moved to cap the raise at $150 million, Goldman decided to “exit the conversation and focus elsewhere,” said a source close to the matter. \nA person familiar with Goldman’s internal thinking said that the bank did not expect R3 to mushroom to 70-plus members when it initially joined. The number of participants and competing interests made negotiations more difficult, the source said. For more on blockchain tech, watch: \nGoldman remains committed to blockchain technology, a spokesperson for the firm told Fortune . For instance, the bank co-led with IBM ibm a $60 million investment in Digital Asset Holdings, as well as a $50 million round in Circle , a digital payments startup headed by Brightcove founder Jeremy Allaire. \nSantander, also an investor in Digital Asset Holdings, recently named the startup’s CEO Blythe Masters to the role of senior blockchain advisor. \nThe bank did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment on its exit from R3. \n“As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time,” a spokesperson at R3 told Fortune in a statement. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.” \nFounded in 2014, R3 has attracted membership from top banks, including BBVA bbva , Credit Suisse, State Street stt , Bank of America bam , and Citi c . Last month, R3 decided to open source the code for Corda, the group’s collaboratively developed distributed ledger, through the Hyperledger Project, a blockchain group that operates as part of the non-profit Linux Foundation.

      "text": "Foto anzeigen Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nNot only will OPEC reach a deal this month, but Goldman Sachs' global head of commodities research said the cartel will have to \"take it to conclusion\" once the process starts.\nOPEC members and noncartel producers have been working on an agreement to freeze oil production increases and reduce ouput. In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would look to cut production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels a day.\nJeff Currie told CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" on Monday that OPEC is now less likely to \"fight a losing battle like they were before in the sense that we have in the line of sight the ability for this market to rebalance itself.\" In particular, he said a cyclically stronger demand backdrop will contribute to near-term upside from a potential OPEC production cut.\nIn order for producers to issue equity and debt, Currie said they need low volatility, which they can achieve by lowering inventories away from capacity. He said they will also want to achieve \"backwardation,\" a situation where spot prices trade above those of futures contracts.\nIf near-term oil prices hit $55 a barrel while contracts further from expiration trade near $45, that will prevent U.S. exploration and production companies from hedging forward contracts, which would have allowed them to produce more and encroach on OPEC market share. Currie explained that if the market is in backwardation, it takes away that advantage from U.S. producers.\n— CNBC's Patricia Martell contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Michael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe and a three-decade veteran of the Wall Street giant, on Monday announced a surprise decision to retire.\nMr. Sherwood, who is widely known as \"Woody,\" will leave the bank at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo. Since joining the bank in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe and more recently into emerging growth markets.\nMr. Sherwood, like many in the inner circle of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, came up through Goldman's fixed-income division. He previously chaired Goldman's powerful partnership committee and had been seen as a potential successor to Mr. Blankfein, though some inside the bank believed his odds had lengthened as Goldman's international business had faced setbacks.\nHis departure thins the ranks of the next generation of executives seen to be jockeying for Mr. Blankfein's job.\nGoldman said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde, a South African merger banker who also co-heads Goldman's investment-banking division, is based in London.\nGoldman Sachs international deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016, the division's profits fell 21% to $1.32 billion compared with a year earlier.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of the U.K.'s Brexit vote, which could force the company to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nGoldman's international division has had other troubles. The firm's work of raising money for a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund, known as 1MDB, has thrust it into a global corruption probe.\nEarlier this year, Libya's government fund sued Goldman over soured derivatives the bank had sold it. Goldman won the trial, but faced testimony that it took advantage of its client's lack of understanding to sell complicated securities.\nAnd Goldman has been cutting jobs in Asia after struggling to book consistent profits in the region, where it faces stiff competition from local banks. Mr. Sherwood's departure comes around the same time as that of Mark Schwartz, who had overseen Goldman's Asia business from Beijing.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, also found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. He also recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy, putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nLast week, Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 Goldman Sachs shares worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMr. Sherwood was the last remaining vice chairman at the firm, a title given to those in Mr. Blankfein's close orbit, following the departures of Mr. Schwartz, John Weinberg and Michael Evans.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com\n 21, 2016 13:45 ET (18:45 ",

      "text": "By Max Colchester\nLONDON--Michael Sherwood, one of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives in Europe, will leave the bank ending a three-decade career with the Wall Street giant.\nMr. Sherwood, known as \"Woody,\" will retire at the end of the year, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo Monday. Since joining Goldman Sachs in 1986, Mr. Sherwood played a key role pushing the investment bank's growth in Europe. The bank said Richard Gnodde will take over as sole chief executive of Goldman Sachs International. Mr. Gnodde is currently Co-CEO of the unit with Mr. Sherwood.\nGoldman Sachs International deals with clients across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the business has grown strongly since Mr. Sherwood's promotion to co-run the division in 2005, the results have suffered of late amid challenging economic conditions. In the first nine months of 2016 the division's profits fell 21% compared with a year earlier to $1.32 billion.\nThe bank is also wrestling with the outcome of Brexit, which could result in it having to restructure its operations in the region, further pinching profits. Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, has at times found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis.\nAnd he recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nOn Wednesday last week Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 shares of Goldman Sachs worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com\n 11:02 ET (16:02 ",

Goldman Sachs International now accounts for just over a quarter of Goldman Sachs's total income.\nGoldman's international division has had other troubles. The firm's work of raising money for a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund, known as 1MDB, has thrust it into a global corruption probe.\nEarlier this year, Libya's government fund sued Goldman over soured derivatives the bank had sold it. Goldman won the trial, but faced testimony that it took advantage of its client's lack of understanding to sell complicated securities.\nAnd Goldman has been cutting jobs in Asia after struggling to book consistent profits in the region, where it faces stiff competition from local banks. Mr. Sherwood's departure comes around the same time as that of Mark Schwartz, who had overseen Goldman's Asia business from Beijing.\nMr. Sherwood, a 51-year-old former fixed-income trader, also found himself as a symbol of banker excess in Europe. His multimillion-dollar bonuses raised eyebrows, especially at the height of the eurozone debt crisis. He also recently appeared before U.K. parliamentarians to discuss the bank's role in advising British retail mogul Philip Green in the sale of BHS, a retail chain which subsequently went into bankruptcy, putting thousands of jobs at risk.\nLast week, Mr. Sherwood sold 42,317 Goldman Sachs shares worth $8.75 million, according to a filing by the bank on Friday. He continued to own more than 319,000 shares, directly and indirectly, the filing said.\nMr. Sherwood was the last remaining vice chairman at the firm, a title given to those in Mr. Blankfein's close orbit, following the departures of Mr. Schwartz, John Weinberg and Michael Evans.\nMargot Patrick contributed to this article.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com\n 13:45 ET (18:45 ",

      "text": "Fintech blockchain development group R3CEV LLC (R3) has taken a blow with a number of leading banks deciding to leave the consortium, limiting the startup’s ability to raise funding.\nAt the top of the list was famed merchant bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who left the group at the of October by choosing to not renew its $100,000 annual membership, a decision said to have been made due to a failure to agree on the terms of a prospective fundraising deal according to Forbes .\nGoldman Sachs was not alone however with a separate report claiming that Spanish bank Banco Santander SA, merchant services firm Morgan Stanley, and Australian financial services provider National Australia Bank Ltd. have also decided to not renew their membership of the 70 odd member consortium \nAs a result of the withdraw of prominent members, R3 is said to have reduced the amount it aims to raise from members in its next round to $150 million from an originally planned number $200 million. Under the revised round member banks will be offered 60 percent of R3 versus 90 percent as first planned. \n“As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time,” a spokesman for R3 said in a statement. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.”\nConfidence issues While spinning it as simply a small change, losing two founding members is definitely not a positive for R3, and could indicate deeper problems with the consortium.\n“I’d say it sounds more like a vote of ‘no confidence’ in R3 than in the blockchain itself,” Linchpin Partnerships Founder Chris O’Brien told Bank Innovation . “The interesting question will be: do other prominent banks follow?”\nDespite leaving the group, Goldman Sachs is not abandoning its interest in the blockchain as is instead pursing its own research, in addition to its investments in blockchain companies including Circle Inc., Digital Asset Holdings LLC , and others.\nThe National Australia Bank is also undertaking its own blockchain development in conjunction with Ripple Labs Inc. \nImage credit: gdsteam/Flickr/CC by 2.0 ",

      "text": "Nasdaq and Goldman Sachs sign landmark 'dark pool' deal \nGoldman Sachs has dropped its membership in an influential Wall Street blockchain consortium after losing a power struggle to influence the direction of the new bitcoin-like technology. \nLloyd Blankfein’s bank bailed out of R3, a group of 73 financial companies developing one of the most high-tech — and controversial — technologies in finance aimed at making transactions across Wall Street faster, cheaper and more secure. \nGoldman backed out on Oct. 31, according to two people familiar with the group, although the exit was not known until Monday. \nTurnover is expected, an R3 spokesman told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Goldman leaving the group. \nThe bank, which helped form the R3 group, is invested in several other companies developing bitcoin-like technologies aimed at making Wall Street transactions more efficient. It let its R3 membership lapse after it was denied both a bigger stake than other banks and a board seat. \nGoldman’s dropout comes as R3 launches a $150 million funding round, the people said. The financing from the member banks would give the banks as much as a 60 percent stake. \nThe round was lowered from a $200 million goal that offered as much as 90 percent ownership, the person said. \nR3, which counts JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup among its members, is just one group that’s at the heart of developing the technology, called blockchain, for use at the highest levels of finance. \nNext week, the company is set to publicly release its source code, Corda, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. \nThe program, as it stands, differs from bitcoin because it doesn’t give everyone access to the same information, the person said. Instead, it restricts encoded information about deals to the traders and dealers involved. Share this: ",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs and Santander have both exited one of tech's top blockchain consortiums which is backed by some of the world's biggest financial institutions. \n\nBoth institutions have quit membership of the R3 group and will not be investing in its latest reported funding round.\n\nSantander did not comment on its decision to depart R3, however, it's understood it will focus on other blockchain projects and that its involvement with other groups, including Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) and Ripple, will continue.\n\n*Read more*: Why haven't you invested in Scotland's blockchain sector yet?\n\nDAH's founder Blythe Masters earlier this year was appointed as an adviser on the technology at the bank, which is also an investor in her company.\n\nSantander is one of several financial institutions to back Ripple, which in September raised a further $55m in series B funding, taking its total raised to $93m.\n\nGoldman Sachs is also a backer of DAH. The bank could not be reached for comment at the time of publication, but told the Wall Street Journal it would continue to work with the technology.\n\n\"I think some investors dropping out is expected as the consortium matures. Its a very large group of banks and if 90 per cent of the first round investors are staying in for the second round, considering the track record of market utilities, that's not a bad outcome at for R3 at all,\" said Ajit Tripathi, a director at PwC's blockchain practice, adding that these collaborative groups are just one of the ways banks can gain a competitive edge in the market\n\nR3 has more than 70 members including banks, insurers and credit card companies. They are interested in the power of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to speed up transactions and reduce the costs of processing them.\n\n*Read more*: Metro Bank, Deloitte and Setl test blockchain contactless card\n\nIt is working on a smart contracts platform called Corda which was first publicly demonstrated with Barclays in London back in April.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the firm has reduced its fundraising target to $150m, and Morgan Stanley and National Australia Bank will not participate in the round.\n\nR3 could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.\n\nSimon Taylor, co-founder of blockchain consultancy 11:FS and former head of blockchain at Barclays said: \"I think you're seeing the ones that had already made other bets now back those more fully rather than hedging.\"",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs has pulled out of R3 CEV, a blockchain group that counts more than 70 financial firms among its members.\nThe investment bank, which was one of the first nine to join R3 in fall 2015, decided to exit the group after failing to agree on terms of a prospective fundraising deal, sources close to the matter told Fortune . The Wall Street Journal first reported Goldman’s departure on Monday.\nFollowing the news of Goldman’s departure, Banco Santander also withdrew, Reuters reported . Santander’s reasons for leaving are less clear.\nBoth Santander and Goldman are investors in Digital Asset Holdings, a rival blockchain startup headed by headed by Blythe Masters , a former J.P. Morgan top exec.\nThe shakeup indicates that the field is maturing rather than waning. Distributed ledger technologies--which underpin cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin--are gearing up to replace the aging back office software and databases that keep Wall Street humming. As these blockchain solutions come closer to reality, the companies backing their production are beginning to pick sides.\nFortune has learned Goldman gs informed R3’s member banks that it intended to exit the consortium on a call around the time of the Money2020 financial tech conference in Las Vegas in mid-October. The membership, which cost $100,000, according to a source familiar with the terms, lapsed on Oct. 31, and the bank chose not to renew.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nThe fundraising dispute centered on control. In May, R3 began seeking to raise a $200 million round that would have granted 90% of the firm’s equity to its member banks with 10% retained by R3, a person close to the negotiations told Fortune .\nThe consortium’s 42 original member companies--including J.P. Morgan Chase jpm , Barclays bcs , Deutsche Bank db , UBS ubs , and others--had equal rights under contract to participate in such a Series A deal, a source said. In addition, 31 other members of R3’s development lab would have the opportunity to contribute.\nThat opening bid was renegotiated to a $150 million raise from its member banks--with potential support from outside investors--that would give 60% ownership to the investors and 40% to R3. This deal framework--still a pending option--had been proposed in early fall, a source told Fortune .\nGoldman sought more leverage in the deal, which could have included a board seat or some other element of additional control, sources said. When R3’s member financial firms moved to cap the raise at $150 million, Goldman decided to “exit the conversation and focus elsewhere,” said a source close to the matter.\nA person familiar with Goldman’s internal thinking said that the bank did not expect R3 to mushroom to 70-plus members when it initially joined. The number of participants and competing interests made negotiations more difficult, the source said.\nFor more on blockchain tech, watch: \nGoldman remains committed to blockchain technology, a spokesperson for the firm told Fortune . For instance, the bank co-led with IBM ibm a $60 million investment in Digital Asset Holdings, as well as a $50 million round in Circle , a digital payments startup headed by Brightcove founder Jeremy Allaire.\nSantander, also an investor in Digital Asset Holdings, recently named the startup’s CEO Blythe Masters to the role of senior blockchain advisor.\nThe bank did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment on its exit from R3.\n“As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time,” a spokesperson at R3 told Fortune in a statement. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.”\nFounded in 2014, R3 has attracted membership from top banks, including BBVA bbva , Credit Suisse, State Street stt , Bank of America bam , and Citi c . Last month, R3 decided to open source the code for Corda, the group’s collaboratively developed distributed ledger, through the Hyperledger Project, a blockchain group that operates as part of the non-profit Linux Foundation.",

      "text": "U.S. companies will devote $150 billion in repatriated overseas cash for stock repurchases next year if Congress enacts President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to lower taxes on such moves, says Goldman Sachs.\nThe top five overseas cash holders are Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google-parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and Oracle ( ORCL ).\nTrump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. This plan would indeed spur companies to bring back overseas cash, says Goldman Sachs.\nIn 2017, for only the second time in 20 years, stockrepurchases will account for the largest share of cash used by S&P 500 companies, forecasts Goldman Sachs. Share buybacks will rise by 30% to $780 billion in 2017, says the investment bank.\nIBD's TAKE: Apple has been raising its dividend aggressively. On Nov. 10, the iPhone and MacBook giant paid 57 cents a share in cash to shareholders. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor .\n\"We estimate that $150 billion out of $780 billion of S&P 500 buybacks in 2017 will be driven by repatriated overseas cash,\" said Goldman Sachs in a research report. \" We forecast that S&P 500 companies will repatriate close to $200 billion of their $1 trillion of total overseas cash in 2017, which will be directed primarily toward share repurchases.\"\nMoody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, by far the most of any company. No. 2 is Microsoft at $113 billion, then comes Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Alphabet at $49 billion.\nBiotech companies with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen ( AMGN ), Medtronic ( MDT ) and Gilead Sciences ( GILD ), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Coca-Cola ( KO ).\n\"The probability of significant legislative activity has increased as a result of single-party control for the first time since 2010, and Republican single-party control since 2006,\" said the Goldman Sachs report. \"In addition, tax reform appears to be prominent on the policy agenda in 2017. We expect to see initial tax reform proposals around March or April and possible enactment during the second-half of the year.\"\nApple and Alphabet shares rose more than 1% in the stock market today , while Microsoft rose a fraction, Oracle was flat and Cisco slipped a fraction.",

      "text": "REUTERS/Natalie Behring\nA Goldman Sachs executive considered a potential candidate to succeed CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Monday said he is retiring from the firm.\nMichael Sherwood, a vice chairman and co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, decided to retire after 30 years at the firm , according to an internal memo.\nIn case his departure raises any questions about who might eventually take the reigns after Blankfein, who is 62 and says he has no plans to retire, we have put together a list of the key executives at the firm.\nThese are the executives behind the big three at Goldman: Blankfein, CFO Harvey Schwartz and president Gary Cohn.\nThey come from across the firm — banking, sales and trading, investment management, and even technology. They've worked around the world, and are mostly now based in New York and London.\nCheck out Goldman Sachs' top power players, listed below in alphabetical order.\nView As: One Page Slides R. Martin Chavez — Chief information officer Getty Images/ Fernanda Calfat Chavez is the person tasked with leading Goldman Sachs' technology efforts, and he led the development of the firm's own programming language for risk calculations.\nHe also breaks the mold of a typical Wall Street executive. A onetime tech startup founder, he is part of a small group of senior Latino executives at Goldman; just 3.5% of the firm's senior officials and managers identify as Hispanic or Latino.\nWhen he joined the bank in 1993, he was one of the first openly gay employees. He sports a sleeve of tattoos.\nEdith Cooper — Global head of human capital management Bloomberg TV Cooper is one of only two women on the list, and is arguably one of the most high-profile women on Wall Street.\nBefore taking over human capital management in 2008, Cooper led a number of businesses within the securities division, including the energy sales group, futures business, and the commodities business in Europe and Asia.\nA graduate of Harvard and Northwestern's MBA program, Cooper grew up in New York City with four siblings. As a child, she wanted to go into fashion, according to a Forbes profile , and dreamed of opening a boutique shop on Madison Avenue called \"Classics.\"\nCooper recently wrote a candid op-ed about race in the workplace in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests.\nShe joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and made partner in 2000. She's been an executive vice president since 2011 and sits on the management committee, and is vice chair of the partnership committee.\nMichael Daffey — Global cochief operating officer of the equities franchise Goldman Sachs London-based Daffey is co-COO of equities with Paul Russo, with the former sales specialist complementing Russo's trading background.\nDaffey joined Goldman Sachs back in 1994, making partner in 2002, and has previously headed global equities sales and head of fixed income and foreign exchange sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nBack in 2008, he was described as the \"unofficial gatekeeper\" to a $1 million fantasy football league , and he also features in Greg Smith's book Why I Left Goldman Sachs, where he has described as a \"rising star\" and a \"social genius.\" New York Magazine called him the \" the moral hero of the book .\"\nWith Russo, he runs a business that generated $5.3 billion in revenues in the first nine months of the year, putting it on a par with the fixed income, currencies and commodities unit.\nIsabelle Ealet — Global cohead of the securities division Goldman Sachs Ealet joined the firm as a commodities trader in 1991 and made partner in 2000. Before becoming global cohead of securities in 2012, she was global head of commodities. She is sometimes called the \"Queen of Commodities.\"\nThough Ealet tends to avoid public attention, she is an advocate for promoting women in finance.\nShe was once thought of as a potential candidate for CEO, but has since taken more of a backseat, as the fixed income, currencies, and commodities business, which is her area of expertise, has become less of a revenue producer for the firm.\nEalet sits on the management, European management, firmwide risk committees, among others. A French citizen, she was granted the insignia of Chevalier in the Ordre National de la Légion d'Honneur in 2015.\nJim Esposito — Chief strategy officer of the Securities Division and cohead of global FICC sales Goldman Sachs Esposito, who is based in London, is chief strategy officer of the securities division and cohead of global fixed income, currencies, and commodities sales.\nHe was promoted to those roles earlier this year from his position as cohead of the global financing group.

He served on the partnership committee from 1999 to 2004, and has served on the management committee since 2003.\nGnodde played an important role in building Goldman's mergers-and-acquisitions franchise in Europe, before moving to Asia to work in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and help secure access to the local Chinese securities markets.\nBack in London, he became co-CEO of GSI in 2006 and cohead of the investment banking division in 2011.\nKen Hitchner — President of Asia Pacific ex-Japan Goldman Sachs Hitchner, a former lieutenant commander and naval aviator in the US Navy, started out as a summer associate at Goldman Sachs in 1991, joining the corporate finance department a year later.\nHe went on to become a founding member of the healthcare banking group in 1995, eventually rising to be global head of the healthcare banking group and global cohead of the technology, media and telecom group.\nHe moved to his new role in Asia in 2013 , and cochairs the Asia Pacific Management Committee with Masanori Mochida, president of Goldman Sachs Japan.\nGoldman Sachs ranked joint third for investment bank revenue in Asia Pacific in the first six months of the year, according to Coalition, equal with Morgan Stanley.\nEric Lane — Global cohead of the investment management division Goldman Sachs Lane coheads the investment management division — a business that has been posting strong growth — with Tim O'Neill.\nHe joined the bank back in 1996, making partner in 2002, and was COO of the investment management division before getting the call up to cohead the business in 2011 . The IMD business had $1.35 trillion in assets under supervision at the end of the third quarter, a record high, after posting $14 billion in inflows in the third quarter.\nThe business has generated $4.2 billion in revenue over the first nine months of the year.\nGregg Lemkau — Cohead of global mergers and acquisitions Screenshot/Bloomberg TV Lemkau was promoted to Goldman Sachs' inner circle in December after a speedy rise up the bank's ranks. The business he leads has been crushing it, topping the league tables for the first nine months of the year with a 24.8% market share, according to data from Dealogic.\nHe has held a bunch of top roles at the bank across regions and different industry groups, and was also COO of the investment-banking division for a time, a role usually reserved for those destined for the top at Goldman Sachs.\nLemkau is from a finance family — his father worked at Merrill Lynch for a long time , his brother also works at Goldman Sachs , and his sister works at JPMorgan .\nHe has also been known to hang out with Gwyneth Paltrow .\nMarc Nachmann — Head of the global financing group and head of Latin America Goldman Sachs Nachmann has had a big 12 months, joining the management committee in December, and adding responsibility for Latin America to his financing group role earlier this year .\nNachmann's financing group houses equity and debt capital markets and the bank's loan business.

Before his current position, he was cohead of global natural resources.\nTim O'Neill — Global cohead of the investment management division Goldman Sachs O'Neill joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and made partner five years later. As global cohead of Investment Management, he also sits on the management committee.\nHe and his cohead, Eric Lane, were behind Goldman's March 2016 acquisition of Honest Dollar , the financial technology company that helps small businesses establish retirement savings accounts for employees.\n:Together, we have the potential to help millions of people achieve their investing goals,\" the coheads said at the time.\nOn a Goldman Sachs podcast last year , O'Neill advocated for the importance of active investing, as opposed to passive investing, which has boomed in recent years.\n\"The problem for passive is that its size, at a certain point, may be too much for the market to handle — and it's also all on autopilot,\" he said. \"So in terms of the size, a market needs both active and passive investing because if everybody's a passive investor, there's no one to buy from.\"\nPaul Russo — Global cochief operating officer of the equities franchise Goldman Sachs Russo is a trader by training.

Redick.\n\"What differentiates David from a lot of bankers is he’s a great leader and manager,\" Alan Schwartz, the former CEO of Bear Stearns and now executive chairman at Guggenheim Partners, told Reuters in 2011 . \"A lot of people are just practitioners, but he knows how to inspire, manage and lead other professionals.\"\nIn a less traditional path to Wall Street than many of his peers, Solomon skipped the Ivy League and studied political science at Hamilton College in upstate New York. He has said that he values his liberal arts education for the communication, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills it afforded him.\nAshok Varadhan — Global cohead of the securities division Goldman Sachs Varadhan is the most recent addition to the triumvirate at the top of the securities business, becoming cohead of securities in 2014 alongside Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet.\nHe joined Goldman Sachs in swaps trading in 1998, making managing director two years later and partner two years after that. At the time, he was just 29, making him one of Goldman Sach's youngest ever partners.\nHe held roles across rates, currencies, emerging markets and commodities, before becoming global head of macro trading in 2012.\nHe moved to London in 2015 . His father, Srinivasa S. R. Varadhan, is a prize-winning mathematician . His brother, Gopal, was a trader at Cantor Fitzgerald and died in the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks .\nJohn Waldron — Cohead of the investment banking division Goldman Sachs Waldron, like many on this powerlist, was made partner in 2002, when he coheaded the media and entertainment group.\nHe then coheaded leveraged finance and the financial sponsors group before becoming global head of client coverage for the investment banking division.\nHe has worked on transactions including Silver Lake's deal for Skype, and Blackstone's purchase of SeaWorld, according to The New York Times , and he worked on the split of 21st Century Fox and New Corp.\nHe was promoted to his current role in 2014, working alongside Richard Gnodde and David Solomon, when John S. Weinberg stepped down .\nSEE ALSO: One of Goldman Sachs' most senior executives is leaving the firm More: Goldman Sachs Investment Banks Wall Street Lloyd Blankfein",

      "text": "Maybe the trading floor isn’t that exciting after the world’s largest particle accelerator.  en/141013/goldman-sachs-hires-particle-physicist-from-the-large-hadron-collider/ \nIf you’ve previously worked as a researcher for the world’s most powerful particle accelerator at CERN in Switzerland, maybe the structured products division of an investment bank doesn’t seem like such a challenge. \nRyan Buckingham, a particle physicist with a PhD from Oxford University who joined the credit and mortgage structuring team at Goldman Sachs in 2013, has now moved on from a brief foray in investment banking to become a secondary school physics teacher in London. \nBuckingham had risen up the ranks at Goldman Sachs pretty quickly. He joined as an associate in 2013 – a grade that normally requires three years before a promotion – but was an executive director in structured credit trading at the time of his departure. Nonetheless, he decided to move into teaching and is currently at St Paul’s secondary school in London. \nNot that Buckingham has chosen to move to just any school. St Paul’s School is an exclusive boys’ school in West London that costs £11,723 a term to attend as a boarder. It’s an institution of choice for well-heeled financiers who wish to send their children into a school that feeds into top universities. In any given year, St Paul’s says that around a third of its graduating class to Oxford and Cambridge, while others end up at Warwick, LSE, or Imperial and 20 boys each year accept places at Ivy League universities. \nTeaching has nonetheless been a relatively common career switch for those in investment banking, but it was most prevalent in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis when heads were being cut drastically. More recently, Brian Daly, who was head of futures and options sales at Royal Bank of Scotland, left for a “second career” in education . \nBut CERN has also been an effective feeder into financial services careers. Alexey Afonin, a vice president in strats and modelling at Morgan Stanley used to work there. Martin Jamack, who is now a market modeller at J.P. Morgan, spent 14 years as a researcher at CERN before moving into banking in 2004. \nIt’s also a good thing to have on your CV at entry level. Annabel Downs, a CBS trader at Goldman Sachs, interned at CERN as did Walid Hatimy, who now works in equity derivatives at J.P. Morgan.",

      "text": "Should you study finance or liberal arts if you want to get into Goldman Sachs?  en/252925/why-lloyd-blankfeins-careers-advice-is-wrong/ Bring on the liberal artists \nShould you study finance or liberal arts if you want to get into Goldman Sachs? Jeff Goldenberg, a long-standing Goldman Sachs partner and head of portfolio strategy in Goldman’s private wealth management group, has come firmly down on the side of liberal arts. \nIn an interview with Bowdoin College , the private liberal arts institution which was his alma mater, Goldenberg said he’s encouraged his own sons not to study finance, but rather to opt for a liberal arts education at the University of Pennsylvania. Finance as a “vector” is “too narrow,” said Goldenberg: if you want to be “interesting”, a liberal arts education is best. \nGoldenberg isn’t the first Goldmanite to disparage finance majors. Back in August , Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein accused some students of being too goal-oriented and narrowly focused. You don’t have to study economics or finance to get into banking, said Blankfein: there’s always history; if you study history you’ll understand that there are people who tried and tried and tried again before they succeeded. \nAccording to Goldman’s own figures , liberal arts majors are the second most populous group at the firm, ranking behind finance majors, but ahead of majors in economics and engineering. This seems curious for a organization that proclaims itself a technology company above all else. Our own research, shows that Goldman mostly hires finance and economics majors into its front office analyst positions. \nNonetheless, there might be something in the study liberal arts meme. Goldenberg said a liberal arts education makes it easier to communicate with clients, many of whom studied liberal arts too. “The world is made up of people and to have an ability to be an interesting person, to have a diverse background of intellectual curiosity puts you in a position to be a more interesting person in your interaction with…the clients you’re working with,” he said. \nJames Gorman expressed a similar opinion in 2014, when he argued that bankers who spend too much time at work become boring people and, “uninteresting advisers to companies because they bring a very narrow perspective.” Time to study philosophy of mind?",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs quits R3 blockchain consortium US bank decides against taking part in a $150m funding round Read next by: Ben McLannahan in New York \nGoldman Sachs has left the powerful R3 blockchain consortium, in a sign of tensions emerging as the big banks try to place their chips on a technology that could cut tens of billions of dollars of costs from the financial sector. \nThe Wall Street bank had been one of nine original members of R3, which was assembled last year to find ways to eliminate the clunky processes that govern payments and settlements behind the scenes. The group has since swelled to more than 70 fee-paying members, with the recent addition of Synchrony, the credit card company, Dutch bank ABN Amro and Fifth Third Bank of Ohio. \nGoldman baulked at being asked to chip in for a $150m “Series A” funding round, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. One said that Goldman was unwilling to invest alongside dozens of co-investors, and wanted more operational control. \nIn a statement, R3 said: “As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time. Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.” Related article Banks will not adopt blockchain fast It will take longer than expected for the technology to go mainstream, writes Oliver Bussmann \nGoldman declined to comment on its withdrawal, except to confirm that it was no longer paying dues to R3 as of the end of October. \nBlockchain works as an electronic ledger of payments that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared between parties on computer servers and protected from tampering by cryptography, doing away with the need for a central authority. \nIts supporters believe the technology could cut hidden expenses in the financial system by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance, across areas such as payments, trade finance, syndicated loans and equity clearing. Such cost savings would be welcomed in an era of ultra-low interest rates, heightened capital requirements and tougher regulations. \nBut R3 is not the only group developing blockchain technology. Others include Digital Asset Holdings, run by Blythe Masters , the former JPMorgan head of commodities, which is working with the Australian Securities Exchange to move its clearing and settlement system on to blockchain.

He stressed that bringing more banks on board was a critical element of R3’s strategy. \n“How good would a fax machine be if you had no one to communicate with?” he said. “The power of this technology is in the network effect; the multiplier is really profound.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc is already preparing for 2017. In a note to clients, a team led by Chief Credit Strategist Charles Himmelberg released its Top 10 market themes for next year.\n“High growth, higher risk, slightly higher returns,” is how the strategists view the year ahead — and it’s clear that their outlook has been heavily influenced by the pending regime change in Washington, D.C. Here’s a brief summary of each of the ten themes Goldman sees as forming the backdrop for investing in 2017.\nExpected returns: only slightly higher\nRelative to its 2016 forecasts, the team says owners of financial assets can reasonably able to expect more upside — but stress that these returns will still likely remain low. “The best improvement in the opportunity in global equities is in Asia ex-Japan, where we forecast returns of 12.5 per cent (versus 3.8 per cent for 2016),” the strategists write.\n“At the other end of the equity spectrum, in Japan we are forecasting declines of -3.7 per cent on the Topix (versus 5.2 per cent for 2016).” \nUS fiscal policy: a pro-growth agenda\n  Trump’s focus on infrastructure spending during his victory speech — rather than trade protectionism or immigration restrictions — catalysed the risk-on sentiment that’s pervaded markets, according to Himmelberg.\n“Markets are starved for growth. This is plainly visible in the eagerness with which markets seized on Trump’s growth-focused message,” he writes. “It is also visible in the speed with which the market’s narrative on the economic outlook under Trump has shifted from ‘uncertainty’ to ‘growth’.”\nFiscal stimulus in the US will help reflate the economy, and stands a good chance of passing through Congress, the team reckons.\nUS trade policy: concerns are likely overdone\nGoldman doesn’t see an imminent trade war on the horizon, and expects any renegotiation of agreements currently in place (like NAFTA) to focus on attempts to improve the prospects for the US manufacturing sector.\n“We think the popular media narrative on the downside risk of a trade war is overstated,” the strategist writes. “Our tentative view is that Trump’s use of punitive tariffs will be just as pragmatic as President Obama’s, albeit more vocal.”\nEmerging markets risk: ‘Trump tantrum’ is temporary\nEmerging market assets have been crushed since the election, as the rise in Treasury yields has reduced the need to reach for yield overseas, and the potential for protectionist trade policies threatens to curtail growth opportunities.\nInvestors are voting with their feet, heading out of EM equity and bond exchange-traded funds in droves. But Goldman doesn’t see a continuation of the EM rout as a theme for the year ahead.\n“We have consistently found that when stronger US growth accompanies higher US rates, EM assets can prosper, especially EM equities and spreads,” writes Himmelberg.\nTrump and trade: hedge with RMB\nThe president-elect has blasted China as a currency manipulator. Lately, Beijing has done more to keep its currency artificially high than weaken it, using its hoard of foreign reserves to defend the yuan. Managed depreciation has been the order of the day for the Chinese yuan: the surprise devaluation in August 2015 roiled financial markets, and Goldman’s team expects this to continue in 2017.\n“Our forecasts ($/CNY at 7.30 in 12 months) call for a depreciation that is well beyond forward market pricing, thereby implying positive gains even accounting for the negative carry,” the strategist writes. “And beyond the usual reasons for wanting to hedge exposure to ‘China risk,’ we think it will also hedge the risk of a ‘Trump trade tantrum’.”\nMonetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation\nTo Goldman, the Bank of Japan’s move to yield curve control is the canary in the coal mine for a new swath of policy innovations “that target the intermediary cost of supplying short-term bank credit rather than the market cost of borrowing via long-term public debt.”\nFocusing on that element of the transmission mechanism and moving towards measures like “funding for lending” schemes, they argue, is what will have the most impact on real economic activity, chiefly investment.\nBetter-targeted monetary stimulus could help avoid some negative side effects associated with quantitative easing and negative rates that inhibit credit creation, Goldman argues.\nCorporate revenue growth recession: signs of inflection\nFor years, S&P 500 companies have exceeded analysts’ expectations on the bottom-line more often than the top line during quarterly earnings seasons, as a combination of cost-cutting and shrinking share count, rather than soaring sales, fuelled the growth in earnings per share.\nHowever, the strategists “expect 2017 to confirm that the US corporate sector has emerged from its recent ‘revenue recession’.”\nA firming global economy and recovery in oil prices from their February lows significantly buoys the outlook for revenue growth stateside. “For 2017, our US Portfolio Strategy team expects that modest improvements in the macroeconomic backdrop will help lift S&P 500 operating EPS by 10 per cent to $116 and they have a year-end S&P 500 target of 2200,” writes Himmelberg.\nInflation: moving higher across developed markets\nMarket-based measures of inflation expectations in the US have spiked since the election, as traders bet that Donald Trump will be the inflation president.\n“What seems clear to us, as argued above, is that economic issues, notably tax cuts, infrastructure spending and defence spending, are high on the agenda — a recipe for reflation,” writes Goldman’s team. “We are forecasting large boosts to public spending in Japan, China, the US, and Europe, which should fuel inflationary pressures in those economies.”\nThe strategists think central bankers in developed nations will be willing to tolerate an overshoot in inflation should that arise, since price pressures have been below their targets for an extended period of time.\nThe next credit cycle: kinder and gentler\nWhile commodity-sensitive segments of the credit market have suffered pain in 2016, there hasn’t been much in the way of contagion. Goldman’s team expects more of the same in 2017, with the credit cycle not making a turn for the worse.\n“Regardless of the state of balance sheet fundamentals, recessions lead to a meaningful acceleration in defaults while expansions keep defaults low. We expect the same playbook in this cycle,” they write. “The strong ‘business cycle’ component in the behaviour of high yield defaults, and our view that US recession risk remains low in 2017, leave us comfortable with the view that the inflection point is unlikely to materialise next year, despite the weak state of corporate balance-sheets.”\nThe ‘Yellen Call’ 2.0: now with ‘contingent knock-in’\nAt this time last year, Goldman’s team argued that conventional wisdom surrounding the Federal Reserve — that it would work to keep financial assets aloft by easing policy in response to any market turbulence — was moving in the opposite direction. Now, an easing of financial conditions would enable the central bank to withdraw policy more expeditiously, ultimately capping the valuation of financial assets.\n“For 2017, this intuition seems as relevant as ever, especially given that President-elect Trump has promised a material fiscal stimulus,” writes Himmelberg. “A ‘contingent knock-in’ has been added to the ‘Yellen Call’ — that is, conditional on a large fiscal stimulus in 2017, the FOMC will be obliged to respond more aggressively to an easing of financial conditions, all else equal.”\nHowever, Goldman cautions that it’s no sure bet that financial conditions will ease in the year ahead, noting the recent rise in bond yields and the US dollar.",

      "text": "Around the same time as influential Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs confirmed it would be leaving the R3 blockchain consortium – set up to probe the possibilities of emerging fintech technologies – reports say Santander has also left the group. While official statements remain thin, the move is not believed to be related to the Sachs departure. According to one report on Coindesk, an unnamed spokesperson from Santander bluntly confirmed: \"We have made the decision to abandon the consortium.\"\nAdditionally, Reuters reported (21 November) an upcoming R3 equity funding round is still set to go ahead but the amount it aims to raise from the banks has been slashed from £200m to $150m. The structure of the deal is also changing, Reuters said.\nWhile Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander have decided not to renew their memberships with R3, two other major banks, Morgan Stanley and National Australia Bank, are reportedly not participating in the funding round, an unnamed insider source told Reuters.\nThe source said R3 will give bank members a 60% equity stake in exchange for the funding and that while \"most other banks\" have agreed to the terms of the deal R3 is not expecting the participation of every institution. It is believed funding will be raised in phases over the next year.\nAdditionally, Reuters reported the consortium's original 42 members will be given the first chance at investing and if the $150m target is not reached it will be opened up to a wider audience.\nAn R3 spokesperson said it was \"always expected\" the consortium would change over time, adding: \"Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change.\"\nR3 currently boasts the involvement of over 70 fee-paying financial institutions from around the world, including Barclays, JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). It is developing an open-source blockchain platform dubbed Corda.\nLike Goldman Sachs, Santander – which joined the consortium on 17 December last year – is likely to continue its own research and development into how blockchain and its related technologies can be used to shake up and revolutionise traditional banking structures.\nEarlier this year, it became the first bank in the UK to use blockchain technology for international payments. Using Ripple, the application was offered to staff as a pilot system designed to allow them to instantly process payments of between £10 and £10,000.\nBlockchain, the decentralised payment processing system behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, maintains a secure shared ledger of transactions on a network. Many financial (and non-financial) entities are now exploring blockchain use cases, with the promise of cost-savings and efficiencies.\nRelated Articles \nFactom secures important paper documents on the blockchain with Smartrac R3 hosts the Second Smart Contract Templates Summit Goldman Sachs drops out of R3 research consortium but will not abandon blockchain Santander 'abandons' R3 blockchain consortium following Goldman Sachs exit",

      "title": "Demonetisation: Goldman Sachs revises India GDP growth target to 6.8%",
      "text": "New Delhi : Goldman Sachs has forecast a deceleration in India’s GDP growth to 6.8% this fiscal, down from 7.6% last financial year, due to demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes. According to the global financial services major, post the ‘dramatic currency reform’ the liquidity shortage would be a significant constraint on domestic activity, which in turn would affect GDP growth. “In the short term, the liquidity shortage appears likely to be a significant constraint on domestic activity, leading us to forecast a deceleration in GDP growth to 6.8% in FY17 (below consensus), down from 7.6% in FY16,” Goldman Sachs said in a research note. \nEventually, the currency reform should help to move economic activity into formal channels, accelerate financial inclusion, and increase government revenue, it added. According to the report, the “large, young, lower-income” economies of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines have higher growth potential — in theory. But in practice, much will depend on domestic policy and the pace of economic reform. \n“In this regard, we continue to see India as the most promising, with a major currency reform providing an emphatic demonstration of the Modi administration’s reform commitment—albeit at the price of serious short-term disruption,” the report added. Moreover India is also relatively more insulated given lower exposures to these external risk factors and a reasonably positive domestic backdrop in the medium term. \nOther key reforms in 2016 include the approval of goods & services tax (GST) structure, passing of the new bankruptcy code, formation of the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee and formalisation of inflation target framework. \nApart from these, several “nuts and bolts” reforms have also been carried out including further measures to ease doing business, scrapping outdated laws, boost infrastructure investment, direct transfer of subsidies to bank accounts using the unique Aadhaar ID, easing in FDI restrictions in defence, aviation, retail and ecommerce, among others. “For 2017, we think that the implementation of above reforms—particularly the successful resolution of the demonetisation effort and GST reform—will be the main focus of policymakers,” the report said. \nOther likely areas of emphasis in 2017 are further progress in ongoing reform in power distribution, a new fiscal policy framework, and ongoing measures to address stressed banking sector balance sheets, it added.",

The Indian American executive recently completed a two-year prison term for insider trading. (Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — Former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta has assumed a new role as chairman of a U.S.-based non-profit organization, a gradual return to a normal life after completing a two-year prison term on insider trading charges. \nGupta, 67, is chairman of the WHEELS Global Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on applying technology to uplift rural communities and provide technological solutions to global challenges in six areas; water, health, education, energy, lifestyles and sustainability. \nThe non-profit was founded in 2013 by a group of alumni from IIT, all prominent entrepreneurs and financial executives. \nA source told PTI that the Indian American executive assumed the role of chairman in October this year. \nAccording to his profile on the WGF website, he \"serves on its board as a key strategist in defining direction and focus of the non-profit organization.\" It said Gupta brings his \"considerable skills to WGF, along with his leadership associations and advisory roles to many other non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\" \nHis profile further adds that the IIT-Delhi and Harvard Business School alumnus and former McKinsey head is a \"leading Indian American businessman and philanthropist\" and is \"widely regarded as one of the first Indians to successfully break through the glass ceiling, as the first Indian-born CEO of a multinational corporation (not just a consultancy).\" \nGupta was one of the highest-profile defendants convicted in the government’s crackdown on insider trading and was sentenced to two years in prison. \nHe served his term in a federal prison in Ayer, Mass., and walked a free man in March this year after completing his sentence. \nProsecutors had accused Gupta of passing confidential boardroom information about Goldman Sachs to now jailed hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. \nGupta is still fighting in an appeals court to have his insider-trading conviction thrown out.

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 45 minutes ago \nUsually, the Friday after Thanksgiving is reserved for analyst and associates. This year might be a little different.  en/266446/quants-investment-banking/ Some traders will be taking their leftovers into work on Friday \nUsually, the Friday after Thanksgiving is reserved for analyst and associates . While managing directors and VPs fly home to spend the occasion with their families, banks’ most junior staff are left to man the trading desks. This year may be a little different. \nWe understand that some of Goldman’s more senior U.S. traders are planning to come in on Friday specifically to take advantage of the dearth of experienced hands at other banks. “The Friday after Thanksgiving is the only day that every desk is staffed by new analysts and associates,” says one insider. “For aggressive hedge funds, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel. They can take advantage of the illiquid random prices and run over all the bank newbies. Some funds make their month on the Friday after Thanksgiving.” \nWith this in mind, some of Goldman’s senior traders who’ve had a bad month and need to make up their numbers are said to be coming in on Friday. “It’s an opportunity to take advantage of other banks,” says the insider. \nBanks’ trading desks and hedge funds excepted, the rest of the U.S. financial infrastructure will be staffed by junior staff until Monday. “The juniors usually have to work a bit on Thanksgiving itself and again on Friday,” says one MD. “They don’t get the time to go home to their families. – When I was a junior I had Thanksgiving with my boss, who invited me to her family party.” \nFor more senior bankers, Thanksgiving is very different. Last year, the MD says a senior colleague invited him to share his private jet, “to avoid the insane traffic. Thankfully I didn’t have to pay.” \nNeedless to say, there are some senior bankers who do work over the Thanksgiving period. One fund manager said he works a bit from home, but that clients are usually busy anyway. In his book, Exile on Wall Street, banking analyst Mike Mayo details Fridays after Thanksgiving spent working alone in the office with his a graduate student, Jackie, after which they’d treat themselves to a “greasy noodle” dinner. Equally, during the 1998 Asian crisis, senior bankers and members of the U.S. Treasury worked throughout Thanksgiving to stave off the bankruptcy of the Indonesian government. \nOn the whole, however, Thanksgiving is a rare occasion when many people on Wall Street actually stop working. European and Asian markets are still open, but this is by-the-by. “Thanksgiving is important for America because it unites all religions under one nation,” says one trader. This year that seems more important than ever.",

      "text": "In 2008, a few months before millions lost their jobs in the global economic crisis, Vijay Pasupulati took the biggest risk of his life: he quit his high-paying corporate job.\nBy then, Pasupulati had been a vice-president at Goldman Sachs in India for four years and was among the few handpicked by the New York-based investment bank to set up operations here.\n“We were riding high. Business was well and I was doing well. That’s when I decided to quit,” 43-year-old Pasupulati said in an interview on Nov. 22. “I had this urge to do something on my own.” So, he shifted from Mumbai to Hyderabad, his wife’s hometown, to become an entrepreneur. “I have always believed we shouldn’t be a small fish in a big pond. But rather, a big fish in a small pond.”\nThe small pond that Pasupulati wanted to swim in and explore was India’s online education sector.\n“Education is the one sector that can create an impact, and at the same time be a business opportunity,” Pasupulati explained.\nEight years on, Pasupulati’s gamble seems to have paid off.\nHis company, GreyCampus Edutech, is India’s fastest-growing technology company, according to a study by consultancy firm Deloitte . The Hyderabad-based startup provides online training for professional certification courses across areas such as project management, complex data, service management, and quality management.\nBetween 2013 and 2016, Pasupulati’s company grew by a staggering 1,622% in terms of revenue. The Deloitte study required companies to have a base year operating revenue in excess of $50,000.\nSmall town boy to Wall Street In many ways, Pasupulati’s has been the quintessential Indian middle-class story.\nPasupulati’s father was employed with Tata Steel in Jamshedpur. His mother was the vice-principal of a local school. “My interest in the education sector was inspired by mother,” Pasupulati said.\nVijay Pasupulati A good student, Pasupulati was fascinated by computers and graduated with a degree in computer science from the prestigious National Institute of Technology in Warangal, a town in Telangana. “That was the time email was fairly new and we had one common email for the students of the entire college. So if someone sent us an email, it was read thoroughly before being printed and passed on to us,” said Pasupulati.\nAfter graduating in 1996, Pasupulati was picked by Tata Consultancy Services, currently India’s largest IT outsourcing firm, for a job in Singapore. A few years later, he moved to Citibank and then to New York to work for the Zurich-based Credit Suisse. In the meantime, he pursued a part-time MBA at New York University’s Stern School of Business. By 29, he was vice-president at Credit Suisse.\nIn early 2005, Pasapulati joined Goldman Sachs in New York and was soon sent, along with nine others, to India to set up operations. “We worked from under tin roofs in Bangalore to build what has now become Goldman Sachs’ second-largest office after New York,” said Pasupulati, who set up the technology needed for the trading floor in India.\nHits and misses By 2008, he was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug, and quit his job. “I knew I wanted to be in the education space. But it took us a long time before we finalised and locked into a model that could be scaled up,” he said. The same year, Pasupulati registered GreyCampus in Hyderabad. He also brought on his friend, IIT Kanpur alumnus Sarath Sura, as co-founder. Sura had earlier founded Sierra Atlantic, an IT firm later sold to Hitachi.\nMuch of the initial funding came from World Bank. The Washington DC-based organisation had a program called Sponsored Research and Development (SPREAD) in partnership with ICICI Bank, which offered grants between Rs1 crore and Rs10 crore to technology businesses.\nInitially, the company developed a virtual classroom under the name Learningware.in where it offered classes for engineering students. However, despite a user-base of some 30,000, Pasupulati realised that Indians weren’t willing to pay for such services at that time.\nThe big break finally came in 2013. The company tied up with some of the “world’s best certification programs” to offer online training programs and raised money from a few Hyderabad-based angel investors. GreyCampus would develop the modules and content that would be empaneled with the certifying agencies, but the intellectual property rights remained with the company. The certifying agencies included the International Association for Six Sigma Certification and Project Management Institute (PMI).\n“We sensed an opportunity, one where we could develop a product that could be driven from India and sold anywhere in the world,” said Pasupulati. Today, GreyCampus offers programs such as Java script training, cloud computing, and Adobe, among others.\nIt has trained some 30,000 professionals across the US, Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. While some of the programs cost $400 for a few sessions, others are also offered at $40.\n“Even today, most of the certification programs are run by brick & mortar companies,” reckoned Pasupulati. “They probably have 75% of the market and the online companies haven’t been able to scale up as much as they wanted to. So that’s where the opportunity lies for us.”\nPasupulati’s competitors in the online certification space currently include homegrown players such as Simplilearn and Talentedge as well as global players like Coursera. “This industry is still in its early stages,” Aurobindo Saxena, the head of education practices at consultancy firm Technopak said. “We need to wait for a few years to know how useful these certification courses are to a professional. Credibility is the key to the success of these companies.” \nNext stop: Test preparations Over the past few years, the online education has caught the attention of investors.\nThis year, private equity firms pumped in $208 million into the education sector. Most of this went to the online space, which is expected to be worth $70 billion by 2017. The kindergarten-to-grade 12 range is estimated to comprise around 40% of this.\n“What was not possible two years ago is entirely possible now,” said Pasupulati. “Ease of access to the internet has improved so much.” With growing smartphone penetration, GreyCampus has also been building products that need much lesser bandwidth.\nThe company now plans to launch another portal, Fabmarks, through which it will focus on providing test preparation contents and training students for various exams such as GRE, GMAT, and SAT. Pasupulati sees a huge market for online test preparation in the coming years. Already, Byju’s, an online education portal, has clocked revenue growth of 470% in this space in the last three years, according to Deloitte.\n“There is huge potential that we are seeing in these sectors,” Pasupalati said. “We have already built up a technology platform that will help us adapt to new requirements.” Soon, GreyCampus will introduce a language certification and compliance training programs too.\nSo how will he fund these new projects? “We are about to raise our series A funding soon,” said Pasapulati.\nAnd, that shouldn’t be a difficult task. “The online certification program is asset-light and therefore a low hanging fruit. That has also raised tremendous interest from investors,” said Saxena.",

      "text": "26 mins ago Quartz india \nIn 2008, a few months before millions lost their jobs in the global economic crisis, Vijay Pasupulati took the biggest risk of his life: he quit his high-paying corporate job. \nBy then, Pasupulati had been a vice-president at Goldman Sachs in India for four years and was among the few handpicked by the New York-based investment bank to set up operations here. \n“We were riding high. Business was well and I was doing well. That’s when I decided to quit,” 43-year-old Pasupulati said in an interview on Nov. 22. “I had this urge to do something on my own.” So, he shifted from Mumbai to Hyderabad, his wife’s hometown, to become an entrepreneur. “I have always believed we shouldn’t be a small fish in a big pond. But rather, a big fish in a small pond.” \nThe small pond that Pasupulati wanted to swim in and explore was India’s online education sector. \n“Education is the one sector that can create an impact, and at the same time be a business opportunity,” Pasupulati explained. \nEight years on, Pasupulati’s gamble seems to have paid off. \nHis company, GreyCampus Edutech, is India’s fastest-growing technology company, according to a study by consultancy firm Deloitte . The Hyderabad-based startup provides online training for professional certification courses across areas such as project management, complex data, service management, and quality management. \nBetween 2013 and 2016, Pasupulati’s company grew by a staggering 1,622% in terms of revenue. The Deloitte study required companies to have a base year operating revenue in excess of $50,000. Small town boy to Wall Street \nIn many ways, Pasupulati’s has been the quintessential Indian middle-class story. \nPasupulati’s father was employed with Tata Steel in Jamshedpur. His mother was the vice-principal of a local school. “My interest in the education sector was inspired by my mother,” Pasupulati said. Vijay Pasupulati \nA good student, Pasupulati was fascinated by computers and graduated with a degree in computer science from the prestigious National Institute of Technology in Warangal, a town in Telangana. “That was the time email was fairly new and we had one common email for the students of the entire college. So if someone sent us an email, it was read thoroughly before being printed and passed on to us,” said Pasupulati. \nAfter graduating in 1996, Pasupulati was picked by Tata Consultancy Services, currently India’s largest IT outsourcing firm, for a job in Singapore. A few years later, he moved to Citibank and then to New York to work for the Zurich-based Credit Suisse. In the meantime, he pursued a part-time MBA at New York University’s Stern School of Business. By 29, he was vice-president at Credit Suisse. \nIn early 2005, Pasapulati joined Goldman Sachs in New York and was soon sent, along with nine others, to India to set up operations. “We worked from under tin roofs in Bengaluru to build what has now become Goldman Sachs’ second-largest office after New York,” said Pasupulati, who set up the technology needed for the trading floor in India. Hits and misses \nBy 2008, he was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug, and quit his job. “I knew I wanted to be in the education space. But it took us a long time before we finalised and locked into a model that could be scaled up,” he said. The same year, Pasupulati registered GreyCampus in Hyderabad. He also brought on his friend, IIT Kanpur alumnus Sarath Sura, as co-founder. Sura had earlier founded Sierra Atlantic, an IT firm later sold to Hitachi. \nMuch of the initial funding came from World Bank. The Washington DC-based organisation had a program called Sponsored Research and Development (SPREAD) in partnership with ICICI Bank, which offered grants between Rs1 crore and Rs10 crore to technology businesses. \nInitially, the company developed a virtual classroom under the name Learningware.in where it offered classes for engineering students. However, despite a user-base of some 30,000, Pasupulati realised that Indians weren’t willing to pay for such services at that time. \nThe big break finally came in 2013. The company tied up with some of the world’s best certification programs to offer online training programs and raised money from a few Hyderabad-based angel investors. GreyCampus would develop the modules and content that would be empaneled with the certifying agencies, but the intellectual property rights remained with the company. The certifying agencies included the International Association for Six Sigma Certification and Project Management Institute (PMI). \n“We sensed an opportunity, one where we could develop a product that could be driven from India and sold anywhere in the world,” said Pasupulati. Today, GreyCampus offers training programs on Java script, cloud computing and Adobe, among others. \nIt has trained some 30,000 professionals across the US, Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific regions. While some of the programs cost $400 for a few sessions, others are also offered at $40. \n“Even today, most of the certification programs are run by brick & mortar companies,” reckoned Pasupulati. “They probably have 75% of the market and the online companies haven’t been able to scale up as much as they wanted to. So that’s where the opportunity lies for us.” \nPasupulati’s competitors in the online certification space currently include homegrown players such as Simplilearn and Talentedge, as well as global players like Coursera. “This industry is still in its early stages,” Aurobindo Saxena, the head of education practices at consultancy firm Technopak, said. “We need to wait for a few years to know how useful these certification courses are to a professional. Credibility is the key to the success of these companies.” Next stop: Test preparations \nOver the past few years, the online education sector has caught the attention of investors. \nThis year, private equity firms pumped in $208 million into the education sector. Most of this went to the online space, which is expected to be worth $70 billion by 2017. The kindergarten-to-grade 12 range is estimated to comprise around 40% of this. \n“What was not possible two years ago is entirely possible now,” said Pasupulati. “Ease of access to the internet has improved so much.” With growing smartphone penetration, GreyCampus has also been building products that need much lesser bandwidth. \nThe company now plans to launch another portal, Fabmarks, through which it will focus on providing test preparation content and training students for various exams, such as GRE, GMAT, and SAT. Pasupulati sees a huge market for online test preparation in the coming years. Already, Byju’s, an online education portal, has clocked revenue growth of 470% in this space in the last three years, according to Deloitte. \n“There is huge potential that we are seeing in these sectors,” Pasupalati said. “We have already built up a technology platform that will help us adapt to new requirements.” Soon, GreyCampus will introduce a language certification and compliance training programs too. \nSo how will he fund these new projects? “We are about to raise our series A funding soon,” saidPasapulati. \nAnd that shouldn’t be a difficult task. “The online certification program is asset-light and therefore a low-hanging fruit. That has also raised tremendous interest from investors,” said Saxena. Read full story",

      "text": "By Sandeep Kanihama \nMichael Cahill, Research Analyst at Goldman Sachs, chose to go long the Dollar versus an equally-weighted basket of EUR and GBP (with a targeted upside of 10 percent and a stop loss of -5 percent) to highlight the emerging role of the populist shift in politics. \nKey Quotes \n“While this is no doubt true in the US as well, the political shift in the US looks likely to lead to more expansionary ﬁscal policy and possibly more protectionist trade policy, all of which would be more inﬂationary at a time when the US is already close to full employment. The Fed would need to respond, as both Chair Yellen and NY Fed President Dudley said.” \n“On the other hand, the populist shift in the UK has consequences that – at least from an economic standpoint – are ﬁrst and foremost about trade policy, and our models suggest that Sterling needs to fall around 20-40 percent from pre-Brexit vote levels, consistent with our new forecast for GBP/$ to fall to 1.14 in 12 months. As BoE Deputy Governor Broadbent said this week, the BoE faces a more complicated policy tradeoff given the expected decline in business investment.” \n“A common pushback we hear is that the Brexit process could be delayed, and may never even happen. Proponents of this view point to the recent High Court decision and speech by Lady Hale, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court. But our read is that both the High Court decision and the point raised by Lady Hale are essentially about the order of the process, i.e. when does Parliament need to be involved, and how detailed does the Parliamentary action need to be? The point raised by Lady Hale – that Parliament potentially needs to repeal and replace the 1972 European Communities Act (ECA) before triggering Article 50 – is really a question of timing.” \n“While there was some debate about the timing and the form it might take, it was always generally assumed by both sides that an Act of Parliament would be required to repeal and replace the ECA at some point before formally exiting the EU. That is because, after more than 40 years of EU membership, the UK needs to somehow disentangle itself from EU laws without creating a legal vacuum in the UK. This is not about renegotiating all of the UK’s laws right away, only about how much needs to be done before triggering Article 50. But our main point in all of this is that the timing questions are procedural, and while they could ultimately delay the process, they are not about directly challenging the outcome. On that front, Prime Minister May has been unambiguous and, if anything, more resolute.” \n“By choosing to also include EUR on the short leg of the trade, we are essentially taking an agnostic view with regard to EUR/GBP. Indeed, our new EUR/GBP forecast is 0.90, 0.88 and 0.88 in 3-, 6- and 12-months. The slew of elections slated to take place across Europe this year present a number of catalysts for the trade, and we have kept our call for EUR/USD parity on a 12-month horizon unchanged. Given that the ECB is so far from its inﬂation target, it should not respond to any rising inﬂationary pressures in the same way as the Fed, although premature tapering from the ECB is a risk to the trade.” RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg  38   \nNEW YORK (Nov 24): Forget the stagflation of the 1970s. Higher oil prices would be a boon for the global economy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \nPricey crude means economies such as Saudi Arabia take in more money than they can spend, which financial markets help distribute through the rest of the world, boosting asset values and consumer confidence, the bank’s analysts Jeff Currie and Mikhail Sprogis wrote in a Nov 22 research note. \nIt’s a counter-intuitive notion, especially for anyone who lived through the 1970s, when Middle East turmoil hiked oil prices and pushed much of the developed world into recession. Back then, high oil prices meant money flowed from developed economies where consumption was high to emerging economies where consumption was low, taking money out of circulation and stagnating the economy. \nThings changed in the 2000s, Currie and Sprogis wrote. Modern financial systems took savings that were building up in lower-consumption, oil-producing countries and circulated them around the world. The theory helps explain why the global economy surged in the 2000s as oil climbed above US$100 a barrel and then slowed amid the recent crude crash, according to Goldman. \n“The difference between today and the 1970s is that oil creates global liquidity through a far more sophisticated financial system,” Currie and Sprogis wrote. “More sophisticated financial markets in the 2000s were able to transform this excess savings into greater global liquidity that increased asset values, lowered interest rates, and improved credit conditions that spanned the globe.” \nGoldman earlier this week raised its forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the first quarter to US$55 a barrel, from US$45, as it expects the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on a production cut next week. Such a boost should be viewed as a positive for global growth, Currie and Sprogis wrote. WTI for January delivery traded at US$48.01 a barrel, up 10 cents, at 3.40pm Singapore time. \nExcess savings \nGoldman is the biggest commodities dealer on Wall Street by sales and for that reason the views of its analysts carry extra weight among natural resources investors. \nFrom 2001 to 2014, excess savings outside the US grew to US$7 trillion from US$1 trillion as oil climbed, according to Currie and Sprogis. The savings helped drive up values of things like homes and financial assets and loosened credit markets for consumers. \nIn 2014, when oil prices began to fall, Middle Eastern economies began eating into their savings to meet budget requirements, reducing global liquidity. The correlation between oil prices and global growth won’t last forever. When these economies set their budgets so that spending and oil revenue are the same, the financial spillover effects will stop as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, Currie and Sprogis wrote.

If an investor takes a position in the EURO STOXX 50 Dividend Index, the duration risk will be lower, as the payout will happen in 1Q17. \nThe company also explained, “Shorter-dated dividends are less driven by changes in equity valuations and more closely linked to underlying earnings and cash flows. Despite little earnings growth in 2016, EURO STOXX 50 2017 dividends delivered a return of 6 percent with a volatility of 7 percent year-to-date.”  [\"EZU\",\"VGK\",\"IEV\",\"HEDJ\",\"FEZ\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"iShares MSCI EMU Index (ETF)\",\"Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF\",\"iShares S&P Europe 350 Index (ETF)\",\"WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF\",\"SPDR EURO STOXX 50\"]} X",

Before the announcement of the election’s outcome, global markets showed huge sell-offs. \nAfter the announcement of the election’s outcome, S&P 500 futures ( SPY ) and Dow futures recovered some points, closing positively at the end of the day. However, other developed markets ( EFA ) and emerging markets ( EEM ) ( VWO ) closed on negative notes. \nAs global markets are still showing some nervousness, investors across the globe are worried about their investments in various asset classes. \nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) recently shared its top recommendations for 2017 in various instruments across the globe in a note to its clients. Goldman Sachs’ views \nAccording to Goldman Sachs, there will be volatility in the market in 2017. Many market participants believe Trump’s win will provide a change in the economic environment for the United States ( QQQ ) ( IVV ). \nHowever, according to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, “ A return to protectionism and trade wars would make the world economy poorer over time .” Krugman said, “We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.” \nGoldman Sachs has highlighted some of the instruments that could provide good returns in 2017, including the following: positive stance on the US dollar ( UUP ) weakness in the Chinese ( FXI ) ( YINN ) yuan to continue long on emerging market stocks with “insulated exposure to growth” such as Brazil ( EWZ ), India, and Poland long on 10-Year US Breakeven Inflation long on the Europe Dividend Growth Index \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll analyze Goldman Sachs’s view on the US Dollar Index.

By Sarah Sands | Nov 24, 2016 2:27 pm EST The US dollar \nGoldman Sachs recently wrote to clients that the US dollar could be the biggest trade of 2017. After the announcement of the US presidential election’s outcome, the US Dollar Index showed a huge positive movement. \nBefore the election, the index also showed a huge positive movement on expectations of an interest rate hike. On October 12, 2016, it was at a six-month high . \nCurrently, the US Dollar Index ( UUP ) is rising gradually. From November 9 to November 22, 2016, it rose nearly 2.6%. It’s currently trading at $101.04. The rise in the index indicates that the US economy ( QQQ ) ( SPY ) is gaining strength, and confidence in the economy is improving. However, a stronger dollar always hampers the country’s exports. Later, we may see the impact of the stronger US dollar on US GDP. \nThe PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF ( UUP ), which tracks the performance of the US Dollar Index, rose nearly 2.5% between November 9, 2016, and November 22, 2016. The UUP hit an annual low of $23.96 on May 2, 2016, and rose nearly 9.1% from May 2, 2016, to November 22, 2016. \nGoldman Sachs said in a note to its clients, “In the U.S., events have moved in a U.S. dollar-positive direction, between the rising likelihood of fiscal stimulus, more protectionism and immigration controls, all of which add up to a more inflationary mix and tighter-than-otherwise monetary policy setting.” The rising dollar is a threat to emerging markets \nThe one-month correlation between the US ( SPY ) Dollar Index and emerging markets ( EEM ) ( VWO ) is -48.2%. This figure indicates that emerging markets and the index tend to be negatively correlated. In some situations, the correlation has been positive, but there’s mostly been a negative correlation . \nAs the dollar index strengthens, we should see an outflow of money from emerging markets and an inflow to the dollar index. In the previous part of this series, we looked at the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( EEM ), which tracks the performances of emerging markets. EEM fell 7.3% between November 9, 2016, and November 16, 2016. \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll analyze Goldman Sachs’s view on the Chinese yuan’s movements.

      "text": "Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Ronald Keung Just a question. Can you share a bit on the competitive landscape and how you're seeing the industries developing? We've seen some expansion, so during the Singles Day obviously [indiscernible] from Baba and on Maytuan and some recent developments on Airbnb. Just want to hear your thoughts on the industry landscape and whether you're confident in just growing faster than peers in each of your segments and if you could also share some of the take rates and coupon rates. I think the previous person also asked on this question as well. Thank you. Jane Sun Okay. Thanks for your question. In terms of competition, because travel is such a promising industry, everything will join the company, there is newcomers every year. Our belief has always been we need to build up our strengths in terms of technology, service, product offering and branding. If we can be very strong in this perspective, it will make the newcomers very difficult to compete with us. So we just need to further penetrate into the new verticals that is associated to travel and also for the penetrate into the lower-tier cities, it's an ongoing effort for us. And this year, internationalization also is a very important step for us to make. So the investment we made in Skyscanner will be -- enable us to extend our air ticketing business to a much bigger footprint in the global place. So that's our focus right now. James Liang The margin on the international expansion, I think the margin will gradually improve as we continue to gain market shares and achieve scale. But on the low end, second, third-tier cities will continue, we'll expect to have continued ongoing very competitive price competition going forward. So we don't expect any meaningful margin expansion in the lower end. And of course, our competitors probably will have even lower margin than us, because that's the general picture going forward. Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu with CICC. Please proceed. Natalie Wu Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. My question is mainly related with the acquisition of Skyscanner. So I noticed that Skyscanner's revenue in 2015 was roughly 150 million with 30% year-on-year growth. So, just wondering, what's the growth rate this year and also in the future of this business should we be expecting? And what kind of margin profile does it have compared with Ctrip? Will this acquisition have any kind of impact on your longer-term margin target? Thank you. Cindy Wang Yes. For Skyscanner, they published their financials on their website in the last two years. And their revenue, total revenue, will be roughly about 6% to 7% of Ctrip's total revenues. But Skyscanner only since later part of last century, they already achieved their profitability. They have a very healthy margin level at around 20% to 25% in their history. And going forward, Ctrip has the confidence that we can leverage our experience, our technology, as well as our booking capabilities to help Skyscanner improve their, for example, the cross-selling capability to drive their growth as to be a more comprehensive travel search provider. So we have the confidence, we, together with Skyscanner's management, have the strong confidence that they can still maintain mid to high double-digit growth rate in the next, in the years to come. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Jed Kelly Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us 4Q guidance around -- for your non-GAAP operating income and the diluted share count? Cindy Wang Sure. On the margin, in the third quarter, because this is the peak season for Ctrip, we have -- we achieved the highest non-GAAP operating margin level since early 2014, and most importantly, this actually is the first quarter that Qunar had a positive non-GAAP operating margin. Moving into the fourth quarter, I think it's comparatively slow season for the travel industry, but we still forecast that we can deliver RMB400 million to RMB500 million non-GAAP operating profit. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang with HSBC. Please proceed. Chi Tsang Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions, and Jane, congratulations on the promotion. I wanted to ask you about sort of -- can you comment on up, down trends please? I'm interested in seeing how that's going. And secondly, I was very curious about your comments on gross margins and how the very strong gross margins this quarter was reflecting the synergies from invested companies. I was wondering if you can expand on that please. Thank you. Jane Sun Sure. I will take the first question and Cindy will take on the second question. For outbound business, we do see a strong growth trajectory in the market. As income per capita is increasing, more and more Chinese travelers will be able to afford going abroad. And secondly, a lot of countries are relaxing their visa restrictions to the foreign countries and to welcome Chinese travelers. And thirdly, a lot of airlines are establishing new routes, which have direct connection for Chinese travel into their city. So with all this support, it gives us a very good foundation to expand our outbound business. So, Ctrip offers international air tickets, and when we know where the customer goes, then we will be very targeted when we offer the hotel products to them. We also have car services, local attractions, Euro trains, etc. And our review site also are very strong. It includes all the reviews for travelers to plan their trips. And as James mentioned in his script, that we also started a smiling review site which is a review generated by our user to rank the restaurants for the most favored restaurants ranked by our travelers. So with all these comprehensive offerings and 24 hours service around the world, we'll be able to attract and support a lot of customers when they travel around the world. So that is our focus for the next few years, to make sure our service, product, IT and branding all support this growth. So it's very promising. And I will turn to Cindy for your gross margin comment. Cindy Wang Yes. I think the gross margin, first of all, because the third quarter is the peak season for us, so we can achieve a very high gross margin. But it's also because of the -- we have a continuously closely monitor and improve our operational efficiencies. For example, our call center headcount decreased 16% year over year and 6% quarter on quarter, despite we have a very strong business growth and improved the service qualities in our invested companies, thanks to our continuously process optimization as well as automation technology. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please proceed. Justin Patterson Great. Thank you very much, and Jane, congratulations for the promotion. Just wanted to expand on that question around automation and process improvement within the call center. How early are you in that process right now? Should we think of those gains persisting into the fourth quarter? And then secondly, around the Skyscanner acquisition. Can you talk about whether or not that was a competitive bidding process, and just how you got comfortable with the valuation? Thanks. Jane Sun Sure. First of all, on the automation. Yes, it has been our focus for the past few years. When we push all the products onto mobile, that gives us the leverage for us to save many steps and a lot of steps becomes very automatic. And it's a continuous effort. For example, for air ticketing every year, in the past three years, we have been able to achieve more than 40%, 50% growth, yet the headcount did not increase but decreased. So, for each business line, we work very hard to make sure if the machine can provide the service, and do the calculation. We will make sure our big data and also our system will be very powerful to provide these services. But for certain events, for example, earthquake or tsunami in Japan, political turmoil, this kind of situation, then our staff will reach out to our customers to make sure that we're taken care. So it's a balance between standard of service versus emergency services in our team. And we will make sure our customers are well protected and served throughout the process. The second thing is Skyscanner. We looked at their past performance; the team is very strong, very lean, quick learner, very aggressive in expanding their brand and services. And we also looked at the synergies the two teams can achieve if we work together. Skyscanner provides the front end on search and Ctrip will have the opportunity to pass on our experience in the booking, and then how much more money we can make. So the valuation is very much based on how much we can make in the next five to ten years, and both teams are highly motivated to achieve that target. Operator Our next question comes the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. Mike Olson Hey, good morning, and congratulations, Jane. I just had a couple of questions. First, you've seen margin expansion play out faster than you anticipated. And based on that, can you talk about what you're expecting 2017 operating margins could look like? And then secondly on Skyscanner, obviously gets you better positioned for metasearch internationally. Can you talk about the current dynamics for travel metasearch in China and how Ctrip is positioned if metasearch continues to grow as a category in China? Thanks. Jane Sun Sure. The margin expansion is very much based on our increased efficiency and it has been our focus in the past couple of years. We will give solid guidance when we move into Q4, but we do expect a long term margin of operating income similar between 20% to 30% is very much achievable and sustainable. But we need to get better visibility when we move into Q4 and give you quarter -- Q1 guidance. And then the second thing is on the metasearch market. In China, Ctrip offers a metasearch product offering, so they do price comparison, and Ctrip is very much on the backend providing the booking services. So it's complementary. Globally, I think Skyscanner is one of the strongest players globally, offering very strong technology capability and branding also in this space. So we feel, if our booking capability is passed on to Skyscanner team, the synergy will be great. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wen with Blue Lotus. Please proceed. Eric Wen So again on Skyscanner. We know brand formation is very difficult in travel and congratulations on the acquisition. Can you elaborate on how do you plan to integrate with your acquisition of Travelfusion last year to combine these two assets to leverage our market position in the value chain? How many people do we have on Travelfusion and what is the geographic coverage in Europe right now? Jane Sun For Travelfusion, it's a B2B business. They are a traffic hub for low-cost carrier. They are located in London. And Skyscanner is also in UK, in Scotland. So the two teams definitely will meet in the future and see how much they can work together to achieve greater synergy. Both teams have common characteristics. It's very technological driven. Travelfusion is IT-driven company; total employee is about 150 employees, they're relaying very fast and sharp. Skyscanner also has a very strong technology team. Almost all the services are empowered by that backend technology platform to go globally. So the team has similarity and we very much look forward to bringing all the teams together and discussing future cooperation among them. Cindy Wang And just to comment on Jane's point, Travelfusion is more, in terms of traffic funnel -- Skyscanner, because it's metasearch, so it's more towards the high end of the traffic funnel, and Travelfusion is more on the supply side. So we do have the plan that going forward Skyscanner will gain access to both Ctrip's flight offerings as well as Travelfusion's product offerings. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jialong Shi with Nomura. Please proceed. Jialong Shi I have a few quick questions about your transportation business. I just wondered if management can provide any colors about the revenue contribution from air, train and bus. And for the air ticketing business, what is the split between your direct sales and marketplace by the air ticketing volume for Q3? And also a follow up on the Skyscanner's deal, and my understanding is Skyscanner's primary users are foreign tourists. So, I just wonder if this acquisition is mainly aimed to prepare Ctrip to penetrate western travel market and to target western tourists. Thank you. Jane Sun Thank you. So within the transportation revenues, train and bus, as well as ground transportation, accounts for roughly about 10% to 15% of the total revenues. And regarding the air ticket, because of the new policies that airline implemented from the third quarter, the platform model, it used to be contribute roughly about 60% of our traffic volume, now decreased significantly decreased, to 30%. But the take rate Ctrip's take rate remained Ctrip and Qunar's take rate remained very consistent within the original level. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Huang with Macquarie. Please proceed. Wendy Huang Thank you. First, on your comment made earlier about the take rate. So, with increasing cross selling, especially on the Qunar's volume, how should we expect the blended take rate to play out on the air ticketing side? And also on the hotels ASP and take rate, can you give us some updates and also the update on the hotel couponing and subsidy wise? Lastly, on the international business, can you give us a breakdown or the international exposure by different business lines, and also what are your top overseas destination right now? Thank you. Cindy Wang Thank you, Wendy. So for the hotel take rate, yes, we are helping Qunary to continuously improve the cross selling. So their take rate gradually moving up. But because Ctrip and Qunar, we capture different market segments, Qunar is more toward the mid to lower end, so their take rate is still lower than Ctrip's level. On the hotel side, we have a stabilized take rate. On the couponing, the couponing is still at mid to higher range of mid to high end of the compared with last few quarters. On the higher end of the hotel, we actually minimize the coupon that we offer to our end users, but on the lower, mid to especially the lower end of the hotel market, as Jane explained, we still will be very aggressive pricing competition to put pressure on any potential competitors. Regarding the international product, the hotel volume international hotel accounts for roughly 10% to 15% of total hotel room nights, and contributes 15% to 20% of total hotel revenues. And air ticket, international air ticket contributes to roughly 30% of our total air ticket volume. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin with 86Research. Please proceed. Juan Lin Congratulations on the promotion. Thank you for taking my question. I have one quick question, on the consolidation of Qunar's packaged tour business. I'm wondering whether the packaged tour business unit itself will operate independently going forward. And I understand that Qunar's hotel booking and air ticket booking business are currently still relatively independently operating. I'm wondering whether we'll see similar consolidation in Qunar's hotel and air business going forward. Thank you. Jane Sun Yes. So for us each vertical business line, we try to create very entrepreneur spirit within a big organization. So each business line is equipped by their own CEO, CTO, CFO and their own set of financials. So they are empowered to do everything they can to drive up the market share as well as to drive the bottom line. So Qunar and Ctrip have two different brands and different methods. The Qunar model is a platform model, which enable them to have a very wide coverage in terms of product offering and pricing. And also it's targeted at younger generation, more price-sensitive customers. Ctrip mainly sells packaged tour focused on business travelers and also mid-to-high-end customers. So the focus is a little bit different. Our product presentation, the apps on the PCs are also quite different. So we try to differentiate different products and services under the different brand to cover both high end of the market as well as the young, energetic, price sensitive customer pool. By doing that, Ctrip's market share will be extended through both brands. So for all the business lines we encourage the CEOs, think broadly, not only focusing on the first tier, second tier cities but also aggressively penetrate into the lower tier cities. So it's a good complementary products and services by utilizing both brands. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Alex Yao I just want to follow up on Jialong's question regarding the acquisition in Skyscanner. We understand the vast majority of your outbound travel is actually driven by China towards types of the demands. Does this acquisition indicate that you guys are expanding the China towards a model, towards more of a wall-to-wall model? How should we think about the long-term growth opportunities in the so called wall-to-wall travel? Thank you. James Liang Yes. Ctrip will gradually but steadily pursue international opportunities. Ctrip already has a very strong technology platform and a very broad, wide and deep product coverage, especially in China and in Asia. But it takes a while to establish our brand names in other markets, other countries. So we will pursue both an organic growth strategy and also help with, by our acquisitions. So I think Skyscanner acquisition is one of the very prominent, very successful companies, especially in Europe and we will continue to look for other potential acquisition targets around the world and we will continue to pursue international opportunities and acquisition targets, especially within Asia, to grow our global presence. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Chen with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Amanda Chen Hi, good morning management. Thank you for taking my question. First question is regarding the corporate travel. We noticed that this quarter the revenue growth is very strong. Can we know the reasons behind that? And also, how do we see the competitive landscape in China, because we know the competitors recently quite active in this space. And the second question is a quick one regarding our packaged-tour GMV growth in Q3. Is that in line with our revenue growth and what's the trend in Q4? And number 3 is regarding the [Dashit Home]. We want to know, I think the Company will be consolidated in Q4, right, so what's the revenue contribution from Dashit Home? Thank you. Cindy Wang Sure. First of all, on corporate travel, yes, our team have been working very hard to innovate the model. So they were the first who built the APP which enabled the managers to follow where their employees are. And it's very easy for employees when they are traveling on-road they can submit their application and their OA system is linked and approval process is linked and we can issue the ticket to get the reimbursement then, all on the app while they are on the road. So that is innovation in the industry. In terms of the volume, I think our corporate travel is a leading player , number 1 player, more than number 2 and number 3 combined. So they are extending their leadership in this field every year. So that's the first question. The second one is on the GMV. Yes, we are very much on track with our target to reach our 2020 goal of GMV [RMB1.2 trillion to RMB1.4 trillion]. So we are on target for that. [foreign language]. Home, the revenue contribution will be very small, immaterial. So it mainly enables us to further penetrate into the lower tier cities. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Jiang with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst Hi, management. This is [Mira Ma] on behalf of Alvin Jiang. Thank you for taking our question. We have just a quick question on outbound travel. So can we get some update regarding outbound travel for the second half this year and also the outlook for next year? Thank you. Jane Sun Yes, outbound travel it's one of the faster-growing segments in all our business lines. So they have contributed more and more in terms of both of the volume as well as our revenues. For each business item, we see we will sustain a very much higher growth percentage than the average industry growth moving into fourth quarter as well as next year. Operator Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Ella Ji with China Renaissance. Please proceed. Ella Ji Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, regarding the Skyscanner acquisition, I wonder how big is China-related business was in this total. I would assume this is not very large. Then I'm just curious, what is Ctrip's value proposition to this Company? What made this Company agree to sell to you? I'm just curious about that. Then second question is regarding your 4Q guidance. If I took down correctly, I think the three major business segments' growth expectation, the low end are all a little bit lower than 3Q, while high end is about the same. Can you just provide more color about that? And just lastly, given that we are seeing continuous -- on the depreciation, I wonder if you can talk about the impact on the outbound travel. Are people switching from relatively high-end luxury travel to relatively low-end international travel? Thank you very much. James Liang Yes, I'll take the first part. I think Skyscanner is -- has an outstanding team and they also have a global aspiration. They already are the dominant player in the (inaudible). Ctrip can work with Skyscanner to achieve a lot of synergies. Ctrip is already up there in terms of volume; it's already the largest ticketing and transportation ticket travel agency in the world. We have a lot of experience with building search technology for international airfares and also for human technologies for international airfares, and these will be shared with our Skyscanner team and they will be able to realize more efficiency gains in terms of procurement and search technology. So I think that this is a very good merge, a very good investment both from Ctrip's point of view and Skyscanner point of view. We have very high expectations; together they can grow their market share in their market share in their markets and possibly in Asia markets, especially in the air ticketing arena, yes. We have quite optimistic targets in these markets combining the strength of both companies. Jane Sun Yes, on the guidance, the current guidance reflects our current visibility on the business but as always, our team will do our best to achieve a good result as we can. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will take one final question. That question will come from the line of Thomas Chong with Bank of China International. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst Thank you very much for the opportunity. I have two questions on behalf of Thomas Chong. The first one, can you provide guidance on non-operating items that we have to take into consideration, for example the interest rate, the minority interest and tax? And the second question is how should we think about the negative seasonality during Chinese New Year in the first quarter of next year? And any color about Q-on-Q and year-on-year growth in particular the apple-to-apple comparison on Qunar consolidation. Thank you very much. Jane Sun Yes. So the second half of last year, Qunar had a pretty high base, especially on the hotel business by introducing the merchant model, which bring a huge loss on their bottom line. But after we worked together with Qunar's team, provide the hotel inventories especially high-end hotel inventory, Qunar has significantly reduced their loss in this third quarter due to their hard work as well as Ctrip's help to provide inventory to them. They achieved the profitability on a non-GAAP operating margin level. So going forward, both Ctrip and Qunar team will work very hard to have a very healthy growth on both the top line as well as the bottom line. Thank you. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back to Shiwei Zhou, Senior Director, for closing remarks. Shiwei Zhou Thanks to everyone for joining us today, especially on the Thanksgiving Eve for our U.S. investors. You can find the transcript and webcast of today's call on ir.ctrip.com. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Thank you and have a good day. Cindy Wang",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg | November 24, 2016 : 6:38 PM MYT NEW YORK (Nov 24): Forget the stagflation of the 1970s. Higher oil prices would be a boon for the global economy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nPricey crude means economies such as Saudi Arabia take in more money than they can spend, which financial markets help distribute through the rest of the world, boosting asset values and consumer confidence, the bank’s analysts Jeff Currie and Mikhail Sprogis wrote in a Nov 22 research note.\nIt’s a counter-intuitive notion, especially for anyone who lived through the 1970s, when Middle East turmoil hiked oil prices and pushed much of the developed world into recession. Back then, high oil prices meant money flowed from developed economies where consumption was high to emerging economies where consumption was low, taking money out of circulation and stagnating the economy.\nThings changed in the 2000s, Currie and Sprogis wrote. Modern financial systems took savings that were building up in lower-consumption, oil-producing countries and circulated them around the world. The theory helps explain why the global economy surged in the 2000s as oil climbed above US$100 a barrel and then slowed amid the recent crude crash, according to Goldman.\n“The difference between today and the 1970s is that oil creates global liquidity through a far more sophisticated financial system,” Currie and Sprogis wrote. “More sophisticated financial markets in the 2000s were able to transform this excess savings into greater global liquidity that increased asset values, lowered interest rates, and improved credit conditions that spanned the globe.”\nGoldman earlier this week raised its forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the first quarter to US$55 a barrel, from US$45, as it expects the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on a production cut next week. Such a boost should be viewed as a positive for global growth, Currie and Sprogis wrote. WTI for January delivery traded at US$48.01 a barrel, up 10 cents, at 3.40pm Singapore time.\nExcess savings\nGoldman is the biggest commodities dealer on Wall Street by sales and for that reason the views of its analysts carry extra weight among natural resources investors.\nFrom 2001 to 2014, excess savings outside the US grew to US$7 trillion from US$1 trillion as oil climbed, according to Currie and Sprogis. The savings helped drive up values of things like homes and financial assets and loosened credit markets for consumers.\nIn 2014, when oil prices began to fall, Middle Eastern economies began eating into their savings to meet budget requirements, reducing global liquidity. The correlation between oil prices and global growth won’t last forever. When these economies set their budgets so that spending and oil revenue are the same, the financial spillover effects will stop as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, Currie and Sprogis wrote.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/how-boost-global-economy-higher-oil-prices-goldman-sachs-says\nShare this More articles on Good Articles to Share >>\nSC adds 34 companies to shariah-compliant list, drops 30 others - Nov 25, 2016 India's solar farm is now the largest in the world - Nov 25, 2016 Airbus's largest A350 jet stages maiden flight - Nov 25, 2016 PNB to create value in strategic investments via spinoffs or demergers - Nov 24, 2016 AirAsia to sell leasing arm in early 2017, posts fourth straight profitable quarter in 3Q - Nov 24, 2016 China will defend WTO rights if Trump moves on tariffs - official - Nov 24, 2016",

      "text": "South Korea’s Daesung Industrial Gases, nearly half-owned by Goldman Sachs, will be put up for auction with first-round bids due in early December – a deal reportedly worth about 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion).\nGoldman owns 48% of the company through an investment unit while Daesung Group Partners owns 40%. Daesung Group is keen to sell its stake to cut debt, a spokesman for the South Korean company said.\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment.\nNewspaper Korea Economic Daily reported this month that the deal, in which 100% of the company will be sold, is likely to be worth around 1.5 trillion won based on an expected EBITDA of 150 billion won this year. More than 10 parties have received information about the sale, domestic media have also said.\nGet Term Sheet , Fortune's daily email about deals and deal-makers. \nIn 2014, Daesung Group sold a 68% stake in the industrial gas maker to a consortium led by Goldman Sachs for about $400 million.\nDaesung Industrial Gases produces industrial gases like nitrogen and oxygen, used in the steel, petrochemicals, refining, electronics and medical sectors. It is South Korea’s No. 2 maker of industrial and special gases, with a 25% market share.\nFor more on Goldman Sachs , watch Fortune’s video: \n\nIts major customers include LG Display, SK Hynix, GS Caltex and LG Chem, according to a company filing.\nA spokesman for SK Holdings, the largest shareholder of industrial gas maker SK Materials, said it had received information about the sale but it has yet to decide on whether to bid.",

      "text": " count=\"107\" data-total-count=\"107\"> Goldman Sachs , long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks — debt happens. On Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals — even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range — out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan.\nThe c ampaign’s 15- and 30-second video ads , which will appear on Facebook, Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not shameful overspending on unaffordable luxuries. A car gets a cracked windshield while parked at a Little League game. A couch gets chewed up by a new puppy. A child gets new braces. Or a water heater springs a leak.\n“Debt happens. It’s how you get out that counts,” the ads say.\nDustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman’s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank’s aim was to “destigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.”\nThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple. Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans “can be a better option,” Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research.\n Mr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut.\nThrough the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals.\nGoldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its “vampire squid” reputation.\nPhoto Goldman Sachs will place 15- and 30-second video ads on YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and Hulu for its new service, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. But these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman’s longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets.\n“The real driver” of the new Marcus lending push is “the way the capital rules are,” Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. “We are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it’s easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,” Mr. Blankfein added.\n The last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley, which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley’s earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter’s steadier fee-driven revenues.\nAlthough the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010.\nMarcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman’s head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. “We were looking for something different, something new” that wouldn’t compete with Goldman’s existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said.\nGoldman’s growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. “They’ve gone from great to merely good,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk.\n Goldman’s push into retail markets also includes getting consumer deposits online , a business that received a lift in April when Goldman bought a $16 billion consumer deposit portfolio from General Electric.\nIt is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. “Digital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,” Mr. Scherr said.\nLending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. “The thing to worry about, when you’re refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,” she said.\nThe small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future.\n“I think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,” said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “Then three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.”",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs: How to Trade First Year of Trump (GS)",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs: How to Trade First Year of Trump (GS) By Matthew Johnston | Updated November 25, 2016 — 5:01 AM EST \nWith the new year a month away, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS ) have released their top trade recommendations for 2017. Some of the major themes motivating the recommendations include the expected economic policies of newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump, growth in China and the rise of populism in Europe. \nTrade Recommendation 1: Go long the U.S. dollar ( USD ) vs the pound ( GBP ) and euro. \nInflationary expectations in the U.S. are rising as Trump’s economic policies are likely to include a significant increase in fiscal stimulus, increasing trade protectionism, immigration controls and a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. Against this backdrop, uncertainty over the Brexit process in the UK as well as the rise of populism in Europe will weigh on the pound and the euro, respectively. (For more, see: With Trump, Bond Bubble Is Out, Inflation Is In . ) \nTrade Recommendation 2: Go long USD vs the yuan ( CNY ) via the 12-month non-deliverable forward ( NFD ) contract. \nWith China’s current currency regime characterized by fixing the yuan to a basket of currencies, the relative strengthening of the dollar will push the USD/CNY higher. \nTrade Recommendation 3: Go long equal-weighted basket of the Brazilian real ( BRL ), Russian ruble ( RUB ), Indian rupee ( INR ) and South African rand ( ZAR ), while shorting the South Korean won ( KRW ) and the Singapore dollar ( SGD ). \nFollowing the U.S. election, a number of the higher-yielding currencies mentioned above experienced considerable depreciation as emerging market assets were sold-off, meaning now would be a good time to buy them. These currencies are also somewhat insulated from the possible U.S. protectionist trade policies. \nTrade Recommendation 4: Go long emerging market (EM) equities with “insulated exposure to growth” \nBrazil, Poland and India are amongst the EM’s that are likely to experience growth while having limited exposure to both Chinese growth and U.S. trade policy. Goldman’s recommendation suggests taking a currency unhedged basket, equally weighted amongst the Warsaw Stock Exchange Total Return Index, the Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index and the NSE Nifty 50 Index. \nTrade Recommendation 5: Go long 10-year U.S. ‘break-even’ inflation ( TIPS ) and European Inflation \nAlong with the inflationary pressures in the U.S., the analysts see strengthening energy prices, and weakening support for austerity and central banks less worried about inflation rising above target to drive higher inflation in both the U.S. and Europe. \nThe final trade recommendation is to go long European dividend growth via a currency-hedged position in the Euro Stoxx 50 2018 dividend futures. \nAlong with these trade recommendations it is worth noting that in a note issued last Friday, Goldman Sachs is expecting S&P 500 stock buybacks to increase by 30% in 2017, making it just the second time in two decades that “repurchases will account for the largest share of cash use by S&P 500 companies.” As much as 20% of these buybacks are expected to be driven by repatriated profits, encouraged by a tax reform proposal by Trump. (For more, see also: Goldman Predicts Surge in Buybacks . ) \nFurther, GS expects S&P 500 operating EPS growth of 10% from $105 in 2016 to $116 in 2017, compared to the bottom-up consensus for adjusted EPS growth of 12% from $119 in 2016 to $133 in 2017.

      "text": "How Goldman Sachs expects emerging market economies will fare in 2017 Published by Business Insider on Fri, 25 Nov 2016 Its going to be an interesting year ahead for emerging market economies in the wake of Donald Trump being elected as the next president of the United States.What will it mean for growth, monetary policy settings, currency movements and inflation'Its a question that many investors are asking themselves right now. Some have already made up their minds, yanking capital out of emerging markets to park in US assets, particularly in stocks.Its all very uncertain.However, thats not stopped some from speculating on whats likely to occur.Caesar Maasry, Jane Wei and Olivia Kim, emerging market strategists at Goldman Sachs, are among those who have been brave enough to put forward their views on whats likely to happen, at least on the economic front, releasing forecasts for growth, inflation, monetary policy and currencies for major emerging market economies in the year ahead.Here they are:In a nutshell, and from a broader perspective, Goldman thinks that economic growth and inflation will accelerate.In terms of monetary policy, they expect most central banks to lower benchmark interest rates while the US dollaron a rampage right now having hit a fresh 14-year high on Thursdayis expected to strengthen against almost all emerging market currencies tracked in the year ahead.Of particular interest, Maasry, Wei and Kim expect growth in Chinanot only the largest emerging market economy but also the second largest in the world behind the United Statesto moderate slightly to 6.5%, down from 6.7% in 2016.They also expect that the yuan will continue to weaken sharply, falling to 7.3 against the US dollar over the next 12 months.That created havoc in financial markets earlier this year due to concerns that accelerated capital flows would weaken Chinas financial system, and is just one of the obvious risks that investors will be watching closely in the year ahead.SEE ALSO:JPMorgan has made an important hire from Goldman Sachs, and it hints at the future of tradingJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies",

      "text": "U.S. banks led by Goldman Sachs are seen to be the biggest winners in any overhaul of global banking norms, expected to be announced at the year-end or in early 2017. In contrast, European banks could face a 20% downside if the so-called Basel IV regulations require banks to maintain higher capital, Morgan Stanley, which evaluated the potential impact of new rules on 75 global banks, said in a research note Nov. 21.\n\nThe report titled, “Insight: ‘Basel IV’ – Exploring the Next Wave of Bank Regulation ,” expressed caution on banks in Australia, where local regulators back stiffer standards.\nBasel IV Would Be A Relief For U.S. Banks \n“ U.S. banks would look best placed. In addition to being a play on steepening yields, Basel IV would not bring any additional impact for credit risks. We think Goldman would be likely to see the greatest relief from any softening in the FRTB proposals, and our work reinforces our broader positive view on U.S. large cap banks, with up to 10% median EPS upside potential (20%+ for biggest beneficiaries) if all excess capital is returned, positive for Citi, JP Morgan and BoA.” \n\nAmerican banks, which already face stringent standards under the Dodd-Frank Act , may have further upside. President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office in January, has pledged to reduce regulation and cut taxes. He also could impose a moratorium on new regulation and dismantle some parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, Morgan Stanley said.\n“Trump’s success may not necessarily signal a material change in this area of the proposals, though we believe could improve the odds should the U.S. becomes less committed to the drive to lower variability of models,” the report said.\n\nA global panel is evaluating a new set of proposals intended to bring global banks closer together in how they weigh asset risks. While European banks seek a more favorable capital regime, Australian banks favor tighter regulations.\nHowever, a pragmatic set of regulations with “no significant increase in capital’ is expected, Morgan Stanley said. “In our base case we (and consensus) assume the Basel Committee softens the current proposals to minimal RWA inflation given the growth that is imperative in Europe and elsewhere,” the report said.\n\nA bear case in which banking norms are not softened, Morgan’s bottom-up scenario analysis suggests, would imply additional capital of between €250 billion and €410 billion for global banks excluding the U.S.\nMorgan Stanley’s downbeat outlook for European banks, is based on capital erosion, given the implied 20-30% RWA inflation in the “bear case.”\n\nDutch, Nordics and U.K. banks are seen to be the most vulnerable, reinforcing “caution” on ING and Handelsbanken. A bear case outcome could challenge overweight ratings on Lloyds and ABN.\nSpanish banks would be among the least affected and also “among the most geared to any steepening in yields,” Morgan Stanley said, while reinforcing its positive view of Bankia and Caixa.\nMorgan Stanley expressed caution on Commonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank, saying any likely outcome would not positively impact Australian banks . That is because local regulators see will be Basel-IV as a minimum standard and resolve to push for “unquestionably strong” capital.\nThe post Basel IV: Goldman Could Be Winner, European Banks Losers appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Topics: Bank of China , Deutsch Bank , Donald Trump , Goldman Sachs , India , Russia , Saudi Arabia , News , Politics News Donald Trump, right, sits with, from left, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump during a ground breaking ceremony for the Trump International Hotel on the site of the Old Post Office, on Wednesday, July 23, 2014, in Washington. (AP Photo) (Credit: AP) \nBecause Donald Trump hasn’t released his tax returns, it’s impossible to know the extent of the conflicts-of-interest that could impede his ability to executive his presidential responsibilities in good faith. Nevertheless, even this comparatively brief list of his real and potential financial conflicts is quite sobering. \nI mean, it’s not like Trump tried to tweet promotions of businesses during his campaign that have literally just been discredited in a court of law? After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016 \nOh right… \nDonald Trump’s children are promoting their brands during presidential events \nAs The Huffington Post explains , conflict of interest regulations do not apply to the president, although previous presidents have voluntarily abided by them in the name of demonstrating good faith to the public. Trump, on the other hand, has entrusted his business empire to three of his children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka. While he refers to their control as a “blind trust,” the very fact that they’re his children precludes the possibility of this arrangement meeting that term’s definition, particularly considering that they’re also set to be among his closest advisers. For instance, his children are set to benefit from any business that those Trump properties which he saw fit to advertise on his taxpayer-subsidized presidential transition website. \nDiplomats are staying at Trump’s hotel in DC so they can curry favor with him \nThe Trump International Hotel in Washington DC exists because Trump was given the right to lease the Old Post Office building in 2012. As a result, Trump could influence the terms on which it is leased to the president based on who he appoints to run the General Services Administration. More troublingly, there are already reports that foreign diplomats have taken reservations at this hotel in order to get on the president-elect’s good side. This could be construed as a violation of the emoluments clause — the only conflict of interest law that does apply to the president — which bars foreign interests from lavishing money or gifts on the commander-in-chief in order to buy influence. \nDonald Trump has a personal reason to fight a labor dispute among Las Vegas workers \nThe Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas is currently in the middle of a labor dispute with the culinary workers union. Because the National Labor Relations Board is appointed by the president, Trump could use that power to appoint officials who will rule in a way amenable to his business interests. \nThe bank that loaned him a lot of money is in the middle of a settlement with the Department of Justice \nThis German bank is the biggest lender to Trump’s business empire. It is also currently working on a settlement with the Department of Justice because of “toxic” mortgages that it sold during the housing crisis. As of September, the expectation was that a $14 billion fine would be levied against the bank. Trump, however, has approximately $360 million in loans from this bank tied to properties in Florida, Chicago, and Washington. \nMatthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.
