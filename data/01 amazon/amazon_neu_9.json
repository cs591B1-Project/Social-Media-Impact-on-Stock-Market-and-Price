      "text": "Akoni Homeware’s brand new Salt & Pepper Grinder Set has gained its first Amazon badge – #1 New Release.\nBeaverton, United States – December 3, 2016 /PressCable/ —\nSince launching their debut product a week ago, Akoni Homeware have seen a flurry of sales, have received new customer feedback and have gained their first Amazon badge. Badges from Amazon are notoriously coveted and competition is high for them. Akoni Homeware have succeeded in gaining a #1 New Release badge, a badge only awarded to products that have received the most orders in the category since launching.\nThe new Salt & Pepper Grinder Set is the first time that Akoni Homeware have sold a product on Amazon. The brand are relatively new and the grinders are their debut product. The set contains two stainless steel and clear glass grinders with a black collapsible silicone funnel and a strong but small cleaning brush.\n“Our brand name, ‘akoni’, means ‘hero’ in Yoruba, a tribal language from West Africa. All of our products are designed to help the heroes of the home (moms and dads) to be the very best that they can be.” said Lisa from Akoni Homeware, “We have only just launched our debut product onto Amazon but we already have other products lined up ready to launch when the time is right.”\nAkoni Homeware have made it clear that if their Salt & Pepper Grinder Set continues to be a success on Amazon.com then they are prepared to explore the options for other Amazon marketplaces around the world.\n“Launching a product on any marketplace is very scary but now we’re up and running, we’re very confident about the whole experience.” continued Lisa, “When the time is right and we’re out of the launch phase for our salt and pepper grinders in the U.S then we will look into launching in Europe and Asia too.”\nAkoni Homeware’s brand new Salt & Pepper Grinder Set is now available from Amazon.com. The tall grinders have a 180ml capacity and offer a fully adjustable grinding mechanism on the top of the product: https://www.amazon.com/Akoni-Homeware-Salt-Pepper-Grinder/dp/B01M0258GE\nContact Info:\nName: Lisa Miller\nOrganization: Akoni Homeware\nAddress: 9450 SW Gemini Dr #29796\nRelease ID: 150764\n ",

Amazon explained the rules for entering Skypiea and asked for an immigration fee of 1,000,000,000 - equal to 100,000 - per person. \nAfter the Straw Hats told her that they cannot afford it she informed them that they can pass if they wanted to; however, she did not tell them that they would become outlaws for doing so.

She was panicking because she had never had that many people come through the gate at once. \nShe is seen once more during the celebration following Enel's defeat, dancing with Nami . From the Decks of the World \nAmazon is seen after the timeskip, being responsible for selling tickets in the new theme park, Rubber Band Land, in Skypiea. [3] References",

His opinions are his own. AWS re:Invent 2016 Can any cloud company keep up with Amazon? Last week’s AWS re:Invent conference celebrated the cloud—and Amazon’s dominance of it Network World | Dec 5, 2016 6:32 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Related Can any cloud company keep up with... Show More \nI spent last week in Las Vegas, along with 32,000 of my closest friends—or at least, with 32,000 other cloud computing devotees attending Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference . Packed to the gills, the event had the excited hum of a fast-growing industry confident it was riding the wave of technical disruption toward market dominance. \nBut amidst all the mechanical bulls, massive EDM dance parties, TV show premieres—not to mention all of the geeky, deep-dive technical sessions that form the backbone of the show—Amazon’s two main keynote sessions made it clear that the company doesn’t merely plan to ride that wave; it figures to own it outright. Andy Jassy’s AWS re:Invent keynote was all about the enterprise \nOn Wednesday, AWS CEO Andy Jassy introduced a long list of new features, including everything from new machine-learning tools to a variety of new sizes of AWS instance types and sizes , plus a super-easy, low-end service called Amazon Lightsail and a new AI implementation dubbed Amazon Athena . AWS Greengrass , meanwhile, was intended to bring the power of AWS to simple IoT devices with limited processing capabilities and dodgy internet connections in applications such as smart homes, agriculture and manufacturing, Jassy said. \nThe company also upgraded its Snowball data transfer appliance with the Snowball Edge , then pulled a major stunt by driving a semi-trailer onto the keynote stage to tout the new AWS Snowmobile , a h ge new “exabyte-scale” data storage and transfer device designed to help enterprises more easily move even the largest databases into the cloud. \nAnd that was only the first of two major keynote announcements. Werner Vogel’s AWS re:Invent keynote focused on developers \nOn Thursday, the iconic AWS CTO, Werner Vogels, rolled out a whole raft of more technically oriented products and services, including AWS Shield , a new service designed to help protect its customers from DDoS attacks, and AWS Glue , a new data analysis tool. And then there was the AWS X-Ray debugging tool and AWS CodeBuild, a fully managed continuous integration service . The screenshot below holds a full list of the two day’s announcements. Though many of the individual products and services were impressive, sorting them out isn’t really the key takeaway from AWS re:Invent. AWS \nInstead, pay attention to the sheer number of new product announcements and forced-march pace of new upgrades and enhancements. And then couple that with the list of vanity metrics Jassy shared. \nMillions of active customers, including Coverage of every key vertical market 2,300 government entities 20,000 non-profits Thousands of system integrators \nThen note that re:Invent has exploded from just 4,000 attendees four years ago to attracting eight times as many participants (not to mention 50,000 more folks watching the keynotes on Amazon’s live stream). \nThe real lesson from AWS re:Invent is that cloud momentum keeps growing. The continued growth of all the big cloud players proves it, but Amazon remains the big daddy of them all. Jassy claimed AWS is the fastest-growing, $1 billion-plus enterprise-technology company ever, and he quoted Gartner estimating that AWS was several times the size of the next 14 competitors combined. \nPut it all together, and you couldn’t miss the industry’s growing sense of inexorable dominance in Las Vegas last week—nor how much fun the ascendant cloud players were having in disrupting the traditional IT model.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nAmazon.com Inc.'s new bricks-and-mortar grocery store doesn't have at least one thing that supermarkets have - queues at the checkout counter. \nThe online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot convenience store, Amazon Go, in Seattle uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they don't put it back. \nAmazon Go, currently available only for its employees, is expected to be publicly available early next year, the company said on Monday, Dec. 5. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.

      "title": "Will Amazon Go Put Grocery Stores Out of Business?",
      "text": "Amazon has once again challenged what we think we know about shopping by unveiling a physical grocery store in its hometown of Seattle. Called Amazon Go , this new store purports to be in-person shopping’s frictionless future. When you enter you scan your phone, wander the aisles, pocket whatever you need, and leave. The store’s sensors are intelligent enough to know what you took and how much to charge you. It’s fittingly called “just walk out technology” — if Amazon’s system flies true, then the new normal grocery run will look a lot like plain-sight shoplifting.\nRELATED: 13 Tips to Get More Out of Your Amazon Echo\nThough the company is most famous for its gigantic online store, this is not Amazon’s first rodeo in physical retail space. It already operates bookstores out of California, Oregon, and Washington, and is due to expand this component of its business.\nThe company is keeping many details of Go close to the chest, not revealing much about the technology that goes into making the store work. All we know is that it depends on computer vision and artificial intelligence. Basically, intelligent security cameras track people and record what they pick up from store shelves. When a person leaves the store, their Amazon account is charged for whatever they took.\nRELATED: How to Make Cocktails At Home With Amazon's Alexa\nRight now the store is open only to Amazon employees and is slated to open to the public in early 2017. Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment on where else the new retail technology will appear in the future.",

      "text": "\nAmazon\nSelf-checkout lanes at grocery stores were, in the early 2000s, supposed to herald a robot revolution . Soon, everything in retail would be done by robots! Teenagers would have to find new gainful employment! Needless to say, if you’ve been to a grocery store lately, you know it didn’t really work out that way. But Amazon wants to try again, by turning the whole store into a giant self-checkout lane, called Amazon Go.\nThe idea, on the consumer level, is simple: Boot up the Amazon Go app, scan the barcode at the subway-esque turnstiles, walk into the store, and start dumping stuff into your bag. The store will track what you pick up, create a virtual cart for you, and charge your credit card when you walk out the door with your food. Amazon claims it does this with a mix of machine learning, computer vision (i.e. cameras tracking your every move) and other technology. \nIt all looks so good, doesn’t it?\n\n\nThere are a few questions Amazon hasn’t answered yet, however, that might keep this from being more than a novelty. For one thing, if you watch the video closely, you’ll notice it’s really more of an automat than a grocery store, with most of the food prepackaged. Amazon’s system might not be able to handle produce yet. Another question is what happens if, say, your phone dies in the middle of shopping, or has a brain fart and has to reload. And, of course, there’s the class issue: While 68% of Americans have smartphones , that still leaves nearly a third of them unable to get into Amazon’s fancy grocery store, and this assumes the Amazon Go app won’t be limited to the latest version of Android and iOS. \nOh, and considering the less-than-great track record the tech industry has with privacy , you may reasonably be asking just what Amazon would do with a complete list of what you eat, gathered over time, and collated against your other purchases. Do you really want to walk out the door having bought your first cupcake in months, and the next email you get is Amazon recommending exercise classes in your area? Right now the concept’s being tested in Seattle by Amazon employees and some civilians recruited as beta testers, so we’re sure they’ll find a few bugs. Really, though, grocery stores might be the wrong place for this technology. We can think of a lot of things at the drug store, for example, that we’d really rather buy without talking to another person.\n(Via Gizmodo )\n",

      "title": "The busiest Amazon ’employee’ ever? Execs explain their plan to put Alexa everywhere",
      "text": "Amazon is taking steps to expand its Alexa voice assistant well beyond its own devices. (Amazon Photo) Amazon is crafting its Alexa voice-based digital assistant to be like one of its employees, and now, with the introduction of several new services at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference, it’s taking steps to put that “employee” almost anywhere.\nMike George, Amazon’s VP of Alexa, Echo and the Appstore, at re:Invent, December 1, 2016 (GeekWire Photos / Dan Richman) “We have a very long-term view of how we think she (Alexa) should interact with our customers,” said Mike George, VP of Alexa, Echo and the Appstore, in an interview with GeekWire at the conference. “We want her to possess the same traits that we like in our employees. We want her to be smart, and helpful, and a little humble, and we want her to be funny once in a while. . . . We want her to be able to answer any questions that you ask.” \n\nAlexa got her start in 2014 when Amazon released the Echo, a hands-free, voice-controlled device that communicates by means of technology in the cloud. Alexa will play music, provide information, control a smartphone and allow Prime members to re-order items. She learns speech patterns and personal preferences and over time increases her vocabulary. Then came Alexa in the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, Amazon Dot (a compact version of the Echo) and Tap (a touch-to-activate variant on the Echo), and the Fire Tablet.\nBut those are only Amazon’s own products. Amazon in June 2015 made the Alexa APIs available , letting developers incorporate her capabilities into both Amazon and non-Amazon devices, such as the Triby smart speaker. Developers have so far created and posted to an online marketplace more than 5,400 “skills” that Alexa can execute, such as playing Jeopardy, asking Lyft for a ride and keeping a shopping list current. Amazon envisions Alexa being available in “things like consumer electronics, appliances, automobiles and wearables,” George said.\nHe declined to specify how many non-Amazon devices now have Alexa capabilities but said, “We have a great deal of activity going on right now,” including with startups. One is Nucleus , a maker of home intercoms.\n“We’re seeing interest from pretty much everyone . . . (even) spaces we didn’t necessarily set out to interact with,” George said. “We’re seeing that once someone interacts with Echo in their home, they want to interact in their car, at their work, in their hotel and in their whatever. We’re investing a great deal of time and energy in (voice interaction), because every data point we get from our customers is that it’s taking things they’ve found complicated and making them simple.”\nAl Lindsay, VP of Amazon speech and Echo software, at re:Invent, Dec. 1, 2016. Amazon hopes Alexa will help it win the battle for home-control networks, which is littered with the remains of many companies and projects that have tried and failed over the years. “We’re getting great feedback from customers that what we’ve done to control smart-home devices has simplified it, so that it’s within the reach of mere humans to actually set up” a controllable system, George said.\nAt re:Invent, Amazon took steps to further Alexa’s reach. It released Lex, a service allowing developers to build complex natural-language conversational speech and text-to-speech capabilities into applications. Lex is based on the same deep-learning technologies behind Alexa. Another new offering, Polly , gives developers the same text-to-speech capabilities that work in Alexa, using deep learning to synthesize speech that sounds a lot like a real human voice . The draw behind these services is that developers can take advantage of Amazon’s work in machine learning without having to do that complex, difficult work themselves.\nAmazon Web Services CTO Werner Vogels offered a full description of the new services i n this blog post .\n“We’re seeing a great deal of activity and the simplification of smart home controls, in both things we’re doing and things we’re doing through third parties,” George said. “I think over time she’s just going to get more and more naturally conversational and be able to do much more, answer many more questions.”\nMachine learning underlies Alexa’s technology. That means “it learns to better adapt to your speech, the things that people say, so as she gets smarter and smarter, understanding all the different variants or ways that someone might express a desire to know what time it is, or a desire to listen to a particular type of music,” said Al Lindsay, VP of Amazon speech and Echo software, during the interview.\nMachine learning is also being used by Amazon to improve the naturalness of Alexa’s spoken voice and her ability to navigate complexities like the differing pronunciation of “read” depending on its use in a sentence.\nGeorge and Lindsay didn’t have much to say about competing voice services: Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. “I’m glad we’re all investing in voice, though,” George said. “I think it’s going to help customers in general.”\nWhat will Alexa be like by the time next year’s re:Invent rolls around?\n“She’ll be smarter, able to answer more questions, probably a little more conversational,” George said. “She’ll have many more capabilities, from us and from third parties. You’ll see Alexa manifest herself on more and more of other people’s hardware, doing more and more things.”",

      "text": "2 Hours Ago | 02:43 \nWhile Amazon' s new shopping experiment is already prompting doomsday headlines for retail workers, human employees are still key to the retail experience, one technology investor said. \n\"The human beings are really a positive part of the experience,\" Roger McNamee, co-founder of technology investment firm Elevation Partners, told CNBC's \" Squawk Alley \" on Monday. \"I don't expect this to take over the world. It just doesn't seem like an earth-shattering thing.\" \nThe new Amazon Go , announced today, has no registers. Instead, shoppers (for now, Amazon employees) scan into the store with their free Amazon Go app, shop as normal, and leave the store with snacks and packaged meals billed to their Amazon.com account. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images Customers use self checkout desks to pay for goods after shopping inside a Sainsbury's supermarket store. \nImmediately after the announcement, reporters at Quartz and The Wall Street Journal cried the experimental store might signal the end of \" millions of cashier jobs .\" But while there would be some employment impact of a widespread application of Amazon Go technology, humans remain a very positive part of retail, McNamee said. \nUnlike other shopping experiences that marry in-store and online shopping, the app doesn't require shoppers to individually scan each items. Rather, the company uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to sense what shoppers are buying. \n\"I think this is part of a continuum that began a number of years ago when folks like Home Depot, and then CVS and Albertsons, Walmart and others have experimented with self-checkout,\" McNamee said. \"And that has been a mixed experience....These things have all had rough moments, and the consumer experience has been everywhere from fantastic — for the person who otherwise would have been in line for a long time — to just dreadful. And I don't think it's been as good for the companies as they'd like to think.\" \nIndeed, Home Depot has had one of the most successful implementations of mobile and self-checkout, McNamee said, after introducing features like in-aisle location early on. But the company has also faced challenges, including a data breach on its self-checkout terminals. \nEven Howard Schneider, who invented an early version of the self-checkout machine in the 90s, has been frustrated that the technology has languished since he got of out of the business, he said in an interview with NPR's \" Planet Money \" earlier this year. \n\"The early result from checkout indicates that, in fact, self-checkout works in a relatively narrow set of circumstances — with today's technology,\" McNamee said. \"Amazon's moving the technology forward.\" \nWhile it may not completely eliminate cashiers, Amazon's model could help eliminate some of the hiccups of the self-checkout model, McNamee said, such as \"shrinkage,\" or inventory loss due to miscounting or theft. It could work better in places like grocery stores, as opposed to an Apple or Tiffany store, where the luxury treatment is central to the brand, he said. \nSixty-five percent of U.S. consumers who have never purchased groceries online said they simply preferred shopping in-store, according to a survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers taken by Cowen analysts. \n\"Amazon's model .... is way more consumer friendly, so I really do hope it works,\" McNamee said. He added: \"I think this is another example of Amazon really pushing the envelope in really interesting ways.\"",

It is slated to open to the public next year, according to The Seattle Times. \n\"We view Grocery as AMZN's biggest potential source of revenue upside over time with Go being another layer of AMZN's multi-platform Grocery strategy,\" analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note to clients Monday. \n\"Amazon Go utilizes a variety of advanced technology including computer vision, sensors and machine learning to revolutionize the in-store shopping experience. Customers scan their smartphone when they walk in, select the items they want and walk out without ever having to wait in line or check out.\"",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe producers of Good Girls Revolt thought they had a hit on their hands, so the news late last week that Amazon was cancelling the series came as a shock. Despite rumors that the show was one of the most popular series on the platform, Amazon passed when given the opportunity to order a second season. \nThe historical drama about female journalists struggling for professional equality in the late 1960s debuted to largely positive reviews at the end of October. Even more significantly, media ratings company Symphony Advanced Media claimed the 10-episode first season of Good Girls Revolt racked up more views than most of Amazon's other series. \nThat's why it was so surprising that Amazon opted to end the series just weeks after its introduction. Rumor has it that Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, doesn't like the series and thinks it's unlikely to win any awards - something that, presumably, is important to the studio. It's hard to imagine, though, that Amazon would kill one of its best-performing series just because it won't win an Emmy. \nThere's also the possibility that Good Girls Revolt isn't as popular as we've been led to believe. Symphony's ratings numbers, which are based on unproven technology, are controversial, and Netflix has called the company's data \"remarkably inaccurate.\" Netflix and Amazon know exactly how many people are watching each of their series, and they don't need to rely on guesses by outsiders. \nWhatever the reason, Good Girls Revolt won't be back, at least not on Amazon. That has left the show's producers and an unknown number of fans in shock.",

      "text": "Amazon will give you a month of HBO for free Maren Estrada View photos The deal of cable television is within sight… Amazon announced last week that two new channels were coming to its cord cutter haven, Amazon Channels. This great product, which is available to Amazon Prime subscribers, allows users to subscribe to channels or to watch content from various TV networks without the need to subscribe to a conventional pay TV package from a cable company or satellite TV provider. The two new channels, as you might recall, are HBO and Cinemax. The former costs the standard $14.99 monthly fee while the latter is $9.99, but we have some great news: Amazon is offering a full 30 days of HBO for free. It couldn’t be easier to take advantage of this promotion. Just visit this link on Amazon’s website to sign up, and you’ll be walked through the process. As you might have guessed, the promotion obviously requires you to be an Amazon Prime subscriber, since all of Amazon’s services like Prime Video are available only to subscribers. Once you get that taken care of, you’ll be able to start your month-long HBO trial so you’ll finally be able to chime in the next time your friends talk about that robot orgy scene from Westworld .

      "text": "Peter Donnell / 1 min ago \nAmazon is making some more sweeping changes with their next big project, product, idea, whatever you want to call it. Amazon Go is going to take supermarkets and bring them into the modern age, by doing what Amazon does best, cutting out human interaction. \nDescribed as “the world’s most advanced shopping technology.” If you’re tired of walking into the supermarket, shopping around for what you need, then having to wait like a chump for a checkout, dig the change out of your purse or wallet, screw a receipt up into your pocket, then pack your shopping and go, the Amazon Go is perfect for you. \nYou walk into the shop, grab what you need from the store and go. Say you need milk, walk in, put it in your bag and leave. While that sounds like shoplifting, smart technology is in play here. \n“Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” said Amazon. “Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store.” \nThe goods you take with you will automatically charge to your normal Amazon account and payment method, and you receipt, should you need one, will appear in your Inbox. \nThe first store is an 1800sq ft retail space in Seattle and will be available as part of their Beta program in Early 2017 using their Amazon Go app. Share this:",

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday How Amazon's AI-powered store might work its magic Amazon Go is billed as a checkout-free store powered by AI and machine learning. Here's what might be going on behind the shelves InfoWorld | Dec 5, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Samsung CES 2015 keynote in two minutes \nAmazon Go sounds like the ultimate retail experience: No checkout lines, no registers. Just walk in, grab what you want, and leave. \nBut what’s most eye-opening about the retail and cloud giant’s first foray into a brick-and-mortar presence is Amazon's claim that its “Just Walk Out” store is powered by “the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.” [ The InfoWorld review roundup: AWS, Microsoft, Databricks, Google, HPE, and IBM machine learning in the cloud . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nThe details provided so far are sketchy, but based on what Amazon has revealed—and what’s already state-of-the-art for those technologies—it’s possible to make some educated guesses about what Amazon has put together and how others may benefit from it in time. Attention shoppers \nThere is a promotional video for Amazon Go that depicts the process of shopping in the automated store, the first of which is set to open in Seattle in early 2017. \nCustomers enter the store and swipe through a turnstile using a smartphone app. Anything taken from the shelves is added to a virtual shopping cart. Put things back, Amazon states, and the items will be automatically removed from the cart. To make a purchase, just leave the store and one’s Amazon account is automatically debited for the items in the virtual shopping cart. \nAmazon credits the way all this works to “computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, much like you’d find in self-driving cars.” The first of those three provides the biggest hint as to how the system might work: Once users enter the store and log in, their presence could be captured on camera. Their general presence—the look of the person on camera, their gait, and so on—could be tracked as they move through the store by way of already-extant algorithms designed to recognize such things. \nLikewise, when a shopper takes a product from the shelf it could be tracked using the same motion-detection and object-association algorithms. It seems easy enough to correlate the image of a product or its placement on the shelf with the item added to the cart, as object recognition algorithms are already commodity machine-learning components. Machine learning isn’t the only secret sauce \nWhat’s less clear is whether Amazon Go is powered entirely by the machine-learning/AI mix described above, or also uses more mundane technologies that have long been mentioned as ingredients for a checkout-less store. \nFor instance, it’s possible that each shelf is equipped with sensors to detect items being removed or added. Taking an item from a shelf could prompt the machine-learning back end to look for something resembling an act of removing an item, making it easier in the long run to detect such things by movement alone. \nAnother tech that is likely used is RFID technology, which is already widely used in retail to track goods through the supply chain. Smart self-checkout by way of RFID-tagged goods has been discussed for years , but it hasn’t taken off for consumer checkout for a variety of reasons , including the cost of tagging every item; how to deal with items that have to be weighed at checkout; the fact that RFID scans weren’t fast enough to catch all the items as they were walked out of the store; and so on. \nAmazon’s reference to “sensor fusion” is the tipoff to possible RFID use. But instead of relying on RFID alone, Amazon may be using RFID tagging as one part of the checkout process—a way to provide more confirming information to the store’s AI rather than as the only source of data for what’s being bought. \nA lot of what Amazon is claiming for Amazon Go is already possible for machine learning: recognizing people as they walk into a store, identifying the objects they take from the shelves, and tracking whether those objects make it out the door or not. Enough of that tech is out there, and in commodifiable forms (like open source) to boot. \nThe trick is to make all that work in concert, in real time, and with a high enough level of accuracy that it requires no human supervision. That’s what Amazon is likely to bring to this game—not the tech itself, but the way it all works together. But it isn’t likely to be long before others pick up the same pieces and follow suit.

      "text": "View photos\nAmazon\nSelf-checkout lanes at grocery stores were, in the early 2000s, supposed to herald a robot revolution . Soon, everything in retail would be done by robots! Teenagers would have to find new gainful employment! Needless to say, if you’ve been to a grocery store lately, you know it didn’t really work out that way. But Amazon wants to try again, by turning the whole store into a giant self-checkout lane, called Amazon Go.\nThe idea, on the consumer level, is simple: Boot up the Amazon Go app, scan the barcode at the subway-esque turnstiles, walk into the store, and start dumping stuff into your bag. The store will track what you pick up, create a virtual cart for you, and charge your credit card when you walk out the door with your food. Amazon claims it does this with a mix of machine learning, computer vision (i.e. cameras tracking your every move) and other technology.\nRelated Links:\nYou Can Make Amazon Echo And Google Home Talk To Each Other Forever\nIt all looks so good, doesn’t it? There are a few questions Amazon hasn’t answered yet, however, that might keep this from being more than a novelty. For one thing, if you watch the video closely, you’ll notice it’s really more of an automat than a grocery store, with most of the food prepackaged. Amazon’s system might not be able to handle produce yet. Another question is what happens if, say, your phone dies in the middle of shopping, or has a brain fart and has to reload. And, of course, there’s the class issue: While 68% of Americans have smartphones , that still leaves nearly a third of them unable to get into Amazon’s fancy grocery store, and this assumes the Amazon Go app won’t be limited to the latest version of Android and iOS.\nOh, and considering the less-than-great track record the tech industry has with privacy , you may reasonably be asking just what Amazon would do with a complete list of what you eat, gathered over time, and collated against your other purchases. Do you really want to walk out the door having bought your first cupcake in months, and the next email you get is Amazon recommending exercise classes in your area? Right now the concept’s being tested in Seattle by Amazon employees and some civilians recruited as beta testers, so we’re sure they’ll find a few bugs. Really, though, grocery stores might be the wrong place for this technology. We can think of a lot of things at the drug store, for example, that we’d really rather buy without talking to another person.\n(Via Gizmodo )",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nWe're going to buy our kids a DVD for Chanukah . Amazon says that it comes with a digital code. I assume that means I can upload it to an iPad. \n\nTypically, with these digital codes, will it go into iTunes or some other storage place on the iPad. Also, I know that if it is in iTunes, the kids can watch it on separate devices. I don't know about any other media software. How does it usually work when it comes to watching a movie on multiple devices simultaneously?\n\nThanks,\nMike ",

Amazon testing cashier-free retail store Tue, 06 Dec 2016 7:46 AM Share Credit: AFP \nAmazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out - with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe 1 800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumoured to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books. \nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering. \nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported. \nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand. \nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart.

      "text": "Amazon to open new physical store Customers pay with phone app CNN Published on Dec. 6, 2016 \nAn Amazon video shows how a new store in Seattle will operate without checkout lines. It is open only to employees now, but it will be available to the public next year. \nAMAZON \nAMAZON Enlarge \nSEATTLE — Amazon.com has gone after book stores, retail chains, and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Customers will be able to scan their phones at the entrance using a new app. The technology will track what items they pick up or even return to the shelves and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time, according a video Amazon posted on YouTube. Customers are charged on their Amazon account once they leave the store. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is based. It is open only to employees now, but is to be opened to the public next year. \nFor years, there has been speculation the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon’s move into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be seen as a threat to the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

      "text": "\nThe Seattle-based commerce company has once again made it easier to shop with the introduction of the Amazon Go . It basically eliminates the need to fall in line when you shop for groceries.\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is to go inside the Amazon Go store, scan the app on your phone at the entrance, get the necessary items, and leave. Using advanced technologies like computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, the store ‘knows’ what you pick up from the shelf and once you leave the place, items checked out will be reflected on your Amazon account.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1,800-square-foot store will be open to the public “early 2017” at the company’s home turf in Washington. Watch the video above to see how this could reshape the future of shopping for groceries.\n\n{ Source }\n\nThe post Amazon introduces Go, makes falling in line a thing of the past appeared first on YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews .\n",

      "title": "Nvidia Stock: Will this Amazon Report Kill NVDA Stock? - Profit Confidential",
      "text": "Nvidia Stock: Will this Amazon Report Kill NVDA Stock? By Stephen Karmazyn Published : December 6, 2016 Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images \nSome investors are worried that Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has hit its peak after its huge gains in 2016, due to an announcement by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) that it may sign up with other chipset providers for “Amazon Web Services” (AMS). \nOther analysts remain bullish on Nvidia stock, not seeing these other chipmakers as a threat. \nNVDA stock is having an absolutely fantastic year. Nvidia stock is up 178% since the beginning of 2016, and it has been one of the best stock picks. But last week, NVDA stock dropped about six percent after Amazon.com’s “AWS re:Invent” conference, where it was suggested that Amazon may use other chips besides Nvidia’s. (Source: “S hould You Buy NVIDIA Stock Following The Recent Pullback? NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), ” Amigobulls , December 5, 2016.) \nA part of Nvidia stock’s success this year is attributed to the increased usage of its chips in deep learning and machine learning development, two areas that are set to expand in the next few years. \nWhile Amazon Web Services has suggested that it has now begun allowing field-programmable gate array chips access to certain functions, that doesn’t necessarily mean they will replace Nvidia stock’s chips. \nFor instance, some believe that the two chips will work together, rather than separately, or at least have very different areas of application. \nOthers speak of the strength of Nvidia’s chips in the deep learning and machine learning development to support why NVDA stock is still a winner. \nThe case for Nvidia stock from the bulls, if you boil it down, is that those who view deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as areas set to grow in coming years would do well to look into NVDA stock. \nBut the picture isn’t totally rosy. For instance, Trinity Street Asset Management reduced its stake in NVDA stock by 46.41%, showing that not all are bullish on the chip producer. (Source: “ Ownership Change Worth Mentioning: Trinity Street Asset Management Llp Position in Nvidia Corp (NVDA) Has Cut as Stock Value Rose, ” Chester Independent , December 5, 2016.) \nWhichever camp you fall into, however, NVDA stock is certainly one to watch. Whether its meteoric rise will parallel the development of AI or Nvidia stock will eventually fall behind, we’ll be following the tech giant very closely. \nEditor’s Note : Hi, Stephen Karmazyn here.

Literally!\nAmazon is branching out beyond their online marketplace and getting into the brick and mortar grocery store business starting in early 2017. However, this will be unlike any grocery store you’ve ever seen.\nAmazon Go stores won’t have cashiers, lines, or even registers. Instead, the stores will be using walkout technology. When entering the store, you simply swipe your phone. After that, the app will track everything you pick up or put back, charging it straight to your account. When you’re finished shopping, it will send the receipt right to your phone.\nJust one question…who will clean the bathrooms?\n \n",

But in typical Amazon fashion, the company is prepared to completely backpedal on AWS' profits in order to beat out the competition and grab an even bigger piece of the market down the road.\nLast month, AWS announced its most significant price cuts since 2014. Storage pricing is down 16% to 28% depending on region, and its other cloud services are down 5% to 25% depending on the type of service and geography. Competitors like Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary, plan to consistently cut prices every year, so Amazon is pressured to continue dropping prices itself. As a major driver of Amazon's profits, here's what investors need to know about the potential impact of these price cuts on Amazon's results.\nContinue reading ",

The company has just opened a grocery store in Seattle that allows people to go shopping and then pay online through Amazon Prime. The new shopping service is called Amazon go . It uses sensors and artificial intelligence to figure out what items a customer has picked out. The item is then added to their Amazon Prime shopping cart. When the customer leaves the store, they are charged through their Amazon Prime account. (USA Today) \n2. The Bellevue Police Department recently found a festive pup roaming around a Washington park. He was sporting a Christmas sweater, a pair of blue pants and a bad attitude. “Is this your dog? Caught by Officer at Robinswood Park. Was wearing a sweater and blue pants, and very angry,” the department Tweeted along with a photo. Police officials were able to safely catch the dog and put him in the care of Kings County Pets, which is working to find the canine’s original owners. If no one comes forward to claim this Scrooge-spirited dog, he will be put up for adoption sans outfit, which might help his sweet side shine through a little easier. (People) \nIs this your dog?
