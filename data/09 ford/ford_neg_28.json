      "text": "Maximize Your Returns in Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Buy Ford stock with a 13% discount, or simply collect some income and massive upside profits, too By Chris Tyler , InvestorPlace Contributor | Dec 2, 2016, 9:31 am EST Source: Sean Davis via Flickr (Modified) \nWell, it could mean it’s time to shift into a new strategy to maximize your returns. \n“Trump, dump and now jump.” Immediately following Donald Trump’s Nov. 8 election win, investors decided to take The Donald at face value on his pledge to “Make America Great Again.” Interestingly, that was bad news for F stock. \nShares of Ford sank back toward multiyear lows as Trump’s blustering hardline stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement spooked Wall Street. If a new policy were initiated down the road, the impact would be a negative for Ford due to its operations in Mexico. \nFast forward a couple weeks, and let’s just say the initial worry has worn off. Prior to Thursday, F stock gained about 9% off its “Trump and dump” low of $11.07 on Nov. 9. \nIt’s likely investors have embraced a more realistic wait-and-see approach with Ford stock. That’s probably smart, considering there’s uncertainty over what any wheeling and dealing by the incoming administration might actually look like when all is said and done. 10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 \nAs well, there are always other catalysts just around the corner that force investors to shift gears and race in the other direction. Thursday was one of those days for F stock courtesy of stronger-than-forecast SUV, truck and Lincoln brand sales data . Rival General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) provided some encouraging data, too. \nThe even better news for Ford investors? F stock’s recovery has now turned an important corner on the monthly price chart. F Stock Daily Chart \nClick to Enlarge About two months ago, I presented a bullish, but contrarian case emphasizing F stock’s daily chart. Shares are about 3% higher. Truthfully, that’s not exactly eye-catching, and it’s even less impressive when the increase is offered up as a gain of 33 cents. \nBut in looking at F stock’s monthly chart, the action is considerably more bullish.",

      "text": "Ford: Five to play, but Eagles coach Doug Pederson looks further Updated: December 2, 2016 — 1:03 PM EST 1 Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 28 \nIt didn't take long - the time between the end of Monday's loss to Green Bay and when Doug Pederson arrived at the podium to explain it - for the rookie head coach to switch perceptibly from the present tense to the future tense when talking about his team. \n\"Are we there yet? No. Are we heading in the right direction? Yes,\" Pederson said. \"Again, it may not show up right now in wins and losses, but I see that potential.\" \nThe assertion that the Eagles, while not good enough to contend at the moment, are creating the foundation of a much better team might turn out to be correct. They have the quarterback the organization believes it can build around and they have . . . well, did we mention the quarterback? \nStill, contending teams have been constructed before on nothing more than a great, young quarterback, smart draft picks and signings, and a lot of patience. The Eagles could pull that off, too, but there will be a lot more future tense being conjugated until then. \nFor the purpose of this season, the Eagles are finished, and deserve to be. The hope of making the postseason, buoyed by their unexpected 3-0 start, was extinguished against the Packers. If they won their final five games, sure, they could get in, but having gone 1-4 in their previous five leads to the inescapable conclusion they are a lot closer to being that team than to one that could hitch up its drawers and run the table. You can still focus on the present if you like, but the head coach isn't doing so any longer. \nBeing beaten soundly at home by Green Bay, which came in with a four-game losing streak and allowing an average of 32 points in its road games, was the dividing line. The offense was toothless and the defense scattered and porous. Not replacing skill players who were discarded and enduring upheaval within the line, the offense's struggles aren't surprising. The defense doesn't have the same excuses. Twice this season, on the road against Detroit and Dallas, the defense surrendered fourth-quarter leads. Against Green Bay, it simply didn't have the talent to win battles either at the line or in the defensive backfield. \n\"We didn't do anything to help our team win,\" defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz said. \nPederson has been picked at, with some justification, for various in-game decisions this season - and he also chose the wrong time to let Nelson Agholor meditate on his inner beauty - but the Eagles have played exactly to their talent level, maybe even a little better. \nLet's say the NFL schedule computer churned out a different order of games back in April and the team began with a 2-6 record and then won three straight to sit at 5-6. Nobody would be screaming if the coach, aware his defense is spitting the bit, threw a challenge flag to give it a two-yard better chance to make a stand with a game on the line. \nPederson has made mistakes, and some have been howlers, but he's been trying to win the Kentucky Derby with plow horses, and he got them farther around the track than other coaches might have. That is the takeaway from this season, now that the perspective has moved to a more distant horizon. The coach isn't perfect, but you can't tell yet if he's a winner because his team isn't yet capable of proving or disproving the theory. \n\"We're in this business to win games. That's why we're here,\" Pederson said. \"But at the same time, I look at the process. I look at the plan . . . You build your team through the draft. You pick up a couple good free agents in the offseason. You continue to work. You watch these young kids develop and turn into ballplayers and you see the potential. . . . That's what I see with these guys.\" \nThat process, that plan, that work, continues Sunday in Cincinnati. The first season of the new era has been an extremely mixed bag. A good deal of it was sacrificed to get the quarterback, and some more in order to hand out big contracts to \"core\" players, a few of whom have either underperformed or overdosed. The combination left the roster thin and inexperienced. Pederson says he sees potential there, however. \n\"The wins and losses, yeah, you've got to look at that,\" Pederson said. \"But what I see on a daily basis in practice, too, with some of the youth that we have, with Carson [Wentz], with a Wendell Smallwood, with a Jalen Mills, we've got pieces. We keep adding to [them] and down the road . . . these games go in our favor and that's what you want.\" \nDown the road. Down that long drive into the future tense. Doug Pederson began to steer there as Monday became Tuesday and the Eagles finally stopped being the team that opened with three straight wins. Now they are a losing bunch hoping to drag themselves through December on brave words and breaks. \nThat's not usually a winning combination, and they know it. With four months of togetherness since the start of training camp, they know a lot. For one thing, they know the coach is right. This one is over. \n@bobfordsports",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co.'s stock slumped 1.5% in midday trade Friday, reversing an earlier 1.2% intraday gain, after the auto maker issued two safety recalls involving more than 650,000 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ model cars. \"In the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner could cause pretensioner cables to separate, which may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford said in a statement. The recall is for Fusions built from 2013 to 2016 and for Lincolns built from 2013 to 2015. Ford said 680,872 vehicles are affected, including 602,739 in the U.S., 35,614 in Canada and 8,665 in Mexico. Ford shares had closed Thursday at a two-month high after Ford's November sales report. They have now shed 13% year to date, while General Motors Co.'s stock has gained 4.5% and the S&P 500 has climbed 7.2%.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 1308ET\n ",

      "title": "Trump's Carrier Talks Up the Ante for Ford",
      "text": "By John D. Stoll\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier this week to keep some jobs from moving to Mexico raises the stakes for another company that faced substantial criticism during the campaign: Ford Motor Co.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker offered an olive branch to Mr. Trump last month by deciding to keep production of a low-volume Lincoln product in Kentucky, rather than stick to its plan to eventually build it in Mexico. That is just a minor victory for the incoming administration because Ford is well on its way to spending $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico for production of much higher-volume compact Focus cars.\nHere's the background on where things stand:\nWhat's behind Ford's Mexico strategy?\nFord's Mexico plan has been long in the making and is the only way that executives expect they can stanch the losses associated with small-car production. Compacts, sedans and coupes aren't popular and command far lower prices than the trucks and SUVs that deliver most of the profits for auto makers selling in the U.S. Still, many industry participants see them as necessary to meet fuel-economy standards because they help bring down the fleet average. That is why cars like the Focus are referred to as \"compliance cars\" in the industry.\nMr. Trump's administration is expected to take another look at stringent fuel-economy standards in place through 2025, but auto makers need to make investment decisions several years before they actually produce a car. Mexican production not only cuts the labor costs going into a Ford Focus, it also opens up more markets for export seeing that Mexico has dozens of free-trade agreements. More export destinations lessens the potential for unused factory capacity, which is the most common reason that auto makers burn cash.\nIs moving to Mexico the only way to deal with unprofitable small car production?\nNo.\nGeneral Motors Co. builds several models of small cars in the U.S. and has made no indication it plans to change that strategy. In 2009, as part of terms of its government bailout, the auto maker agreed to keep a small car plant open in Michigan. That factory operates well below its capacity, but it appears to be under no threat of closing. The auto maker also utilizes other factories in Michigan and Ohio for small-car output. GM hasn't disclosed the financial performance of its individual vehicle lines.\n(GM's CEO is among a group of business leaders set to meet periodically with Mr. Trump beginning in February).\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV doesn't see small-car sales as a key method for meeting fuel-economy requirements. As a result, it is converting all of its U.S. car-assembly capacity into light-truck capacity. This means that Dodge Darts and Chrysler 200s are no longer made in the U.S. as of Friday. Next year, the company will complete costly conversions of plants in Illinois and Michigan for production of the small Jeep Cherokee SUV and the large Ram pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler cut 1,300 jobs earlier this year due to slack demand for the 200; the company estimates 1,000 will be added when the converted factories begin humming again.\nDo Detroit auto makers rely much on Mexico?\nAbout 17% of the Detroit 3's North American output is currently sourced from Mexico, according to WardsAuto.com, but all three auto makers could see that percentage increase in coming years due to planned investments. That compares to 21% for the broader auto industry.\nHow many people will lose their jobs due to Ford's Mexico move?\nFord has repeatedly said no one will lose their jobs as a result of moving small cars to Mexico. Here's why: U.S. auto factory workers are relatively expensive and executives want them building their highest-margin vehicles. In the case of Ford, that means taking the United Auto Workers members currently assembling Focuses and redeploying them in 2018 to make a new model of a pickup truck and a new SUV. Because so few people want a Ford Focus these days, the transition could actually be a win for the UAW.\nBut it isn't all good news. It wasn't too long ago Ford was saying UAW labor could profitably build small cars. The company has thrown in the towel on that idea, and so there will be thousands of new workers on Ford's payroll who aren't located in the U.S. -- and that is a defeat for the UAW and ultimately a blow to U.S. manufacturing.\nAnd, Ford is putting all its American manufacturing eggs in the light-truck basket, a move that could come back to bite the company if gasoline prices were to spike and demand for pickups and SUVs plummets as a result. More than 60% of vehicles sold in November were light trucks; but it was only a few years ago when that light-truck mix was well below 50%. Memories don't need to be too long to remember when Ford and its domestic counterparts cut a lot of jobs because truck demand was drying up.\nHow would a Trump tariff of 35% affect the price of a Ford Focus?\nA basically equipped Ford Focus can currently be had for about $15,000, factoring in incentive, making it one of the more affordable cars on the market. To get Ford's most basic SUV, the Escape, the price tag goes up to about $23,000 even though the two vehicles aren't radically different when it comes to underlying parts.\nMr. Trump has proposed slapping a 35% tariff on a product like the Focus if it were to move to Mexico, and that would jack the price tag to above $20,000. Based on today's sales levels of between 150,000 to 200,000 Focuses sold a year, such a tax would add hundreds of millions in additional cost that the buyer or the auto maker would need to shoulder.\nWrite to John D.

      "text": "By John D. Stoll\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier this week to keep some jobs from moving to Mexico raises the stakes for another company that faced substantial criticism during the campaign: Ford Motor Co.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker offered an olive branch to Mr. Trump last month by deciding to keep production of a low-volume Lincoln product in Kentucky, rather than stick to its plan to eventually build it in Mexico. That is just a minor victory for the incoming administration because Ford is well on its way to spending $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico for production of much higher-volume compact Focus cars.\nHere's the background on where things stand:\nWhat's behind Ford's Mexico strategy?\nFord's Mexico plan has been long in the making and is the only way that executives expect they can stanch the losses associated with small-car production. Compacts, sedans and coupes aren't popular and command far lower prices than the trucks and SUVs that deliver most of the profits for auto makers selling in the U.S. Still, many industry participants see them as necessary to meet fuel-economy standards because they help bring down the fleet average. That is why cars like the Focus are referred to as \"compliance cars\" in the industry.\nMr. Trump's administration is expected to take another look at stringent fuel-economy standards in place through 2025, but auto makers need to make investment decisions several years before they actually produce a car. Mexican production not only cuts the labor costs going into a Ford Focus, it also opens up more markets for export seeing that Mexico has dozens of free-trade agreements. More export destinations lessens the potential for unused factory capacity, which is the most common reason that auto makers burn cash.\nIs moving to Mexico the only way to deal with unprofitable small car production?\nNo.\nGeneral Motors Co. builds several models of small cars in the U.S. and has made no indication it plans to change that strategy. In 2009, as part of terms of its government bailout, the auto maker agreed to keep a small car plant open in Michigan. That factory operates well below its capacity, but it appears to be under no threat of closing. The auto maker also utilizes other factories in Michigan and Ohio for small-car output. GM hasn't disclosed the financial performance of its individual vehicle lines.\n(GM's CEO is among a group of business leaders set to meet periodically with Mr. Trump beginning in February).\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV doesn't see small-car sales as a key method for meeting fuel-economy requirements. As a result, it is converting all of its U.S. car-assembly capacity into light-truck capacity. This means that Dodge Darts and Chrysler 200s are no longer made in the U.S. as of Friday. Next year, the company will complete costly conversions of plants in Illinois and Michigan for production of the small Jeep Cherokee SUV and the large Ram pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler cut 1,300 jobs earlier this year due to slack demand for the 200; the company estimates 1,000 will be added when the converted factories begin humming again.\nDo Detroit auto makers rely much on Mexico?\nAbout 17% of the Detroit 3's North American output is currently sourced from Mexico, according to WardsAuto.com, but all three auto makers could see that percentage increase in coming years due to planned investments. That compares to 21% for the broader auto industry.\nHow many people will lose their jobs due to Ford's Mexico move?\nFord has repeatedly said no one will lose their jobs as a result of moving small cars to Mexico. Here's why: U.S. auto factory workers are relatively expensive and executives want them building their highest-margin vehicles. In the case of Ford, that means taking the United Auto Workers members currently assembling Focuses and redeploying them in 2018 to make a new model of a pickup truck and a new SUV. Because so few people want a Ford Focus these days, the transition could actually be a win for the UAW.\nBut it isn't all good news. It wasn't too long ago Ford was saying UAW labor could profitably build small cars. The company has thrown in the towel on that idea, and so there will be thousands of new workers on Ford's payroll who aren't located in the U.S. -- and that is a defeat for the UAW and ultimately a blow to U.S. manufacturing.\nAnd, Ford is putting all its American manufacturing eggs in the light-truck basket, a move that could come back to bite the company if gasoline prices were to spike and demand for pickups and SUVs plummets as a result. More than 60% of vehicles sold in November were light trucks; but it was only a few years ago when that light-truck mix was well below 50%. Memories don't need to be too long to remember when Ford and its domestic counterparts cut a lot of jobs because truck demand was drying up.\nHow would a Trump tariff of 35% affect the price of a Ford Focus?\nA basically equipped Ford Focus can currently be had for about $15,000, factoring in incentive, making it one of the more affordable cars on the market. To get Ford's most basic SUV, the Escape, the price tag goes up to about $23,000 even though the two vehicles aren't radically different when it comes to underlying parts.\nMr. Trump has proposed slapping a 35% tariff on a product like the Focus if it were to move to Mexico, and that would jack the price tag to above $20,000. Based on today's sales levels of between 150,000 to 200,000 Focuses sold a year, such a tax would add hundreds of millions in additional cost that the buyer or the auto maker would need to shoulder.\nWrite to John D.

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

(Source: Ford/CNN) \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "By John D. Stoll\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier this week to keep some jobs from moving to Mexico raises the stakes for another company that faced substantial criticism during the campaign: Ford Motor Co.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker offered an olive branch to Mr. Trump last month by deciding to keep production of a low-volume Lincoln product in Kentucky, rather than stick to its plan to eventually build it in Mexico. That is just a minor victory for the incoming administration because Ford is well on its way to spending $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico for production of much higher-volume compact Focus cars.\nHere's the background on where things stand:\nWhat's behind Ford's Mexico strategy?\nFord's Mexico plan has been long in the making and is the only way that executives expect they can stanch the losses associated with small-car production. Compacts, sedans and coupes aren't popular and command far lower prices than the trucks and SUVs that deliver most of the profits for auto makers selling in the U.S. Still, many industry participants see them as necessary to meet fuel-economy standards because they help bring down the fleet average. That is why cars like the Focus are referred to as \"compliance cars\" in the industry.\nMr. Trump's administration is expected to take another look at stringent fuel-economy standards in place through 2025, but auto makers need to make investment decisions several years before they actually produce a car. Mexican production not only cuts the labor costs going into a Ford Focus, it also opens up more markets for export seeing that Mexico has dozens of free-trade agreements. More export destinations lessens the potential for unused factory capacity, which is the most common reason that auto makers burn cash.\nIs moving to Mexico the only way to deal with unprofitable small car production?\nNo.\nGeneral Motors Co. builds several models of small cars in the U.S. and has made no indication it plans to change that strategy. In 2009, as part of terms of its government bailout, the auto maker agreed to keep a small car plant open in Michigan. That factory operates well below its capacity, but it appears to be under no threat of closing. The auto maker also utilizes other factories in Michigan and Ohio for small-car output. GM hasn't disclosed the financial performance of its individual vehicle lines.\n(GM's CEO is among a group of business leaders set to meet periodically with Mr. Trump beginning in February).\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV doesn't see small-car sales as a key method for meeting fuel-economy requirements. As a result, it is converting all of its U.S. car-assembly capacity into light-truck capacity. This means that Dodge Darts and Chrysler 200s are no longer made in the U.S. as of Friday. Next year, the company will complete costly conversions of plants in Illinois and Michigan for production of the small Jeep Cherokee SUV and the large Ram pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler cut 1,300 jobs earlier this year due to slack demand for the 200; the company estimates 1,000 will be added when the converted factories begin humming again.\nDo Detroit auto makers rely much on Mexico?\nAbout 17% of the Detroit 3's North American output is currently sourced from Mexico, according to WardsAuto.com, but all three auto makers could see that percentage increase in coming years due to planned investments. That compares to 21% for the broader auto industry.\nHow many people will lose their jobs due to Ford's Mexico move?\nFord has repeatedly said no one will lose their jobs as a result of moving small cars to Mexico. Here's why: U.S. auto factory workers are relatively expensive and executives want them building their highest-margin vehicles. In the case of Ford, that means taking the United Auto Workers members currently assembling Focuses and redeploying them in 2018 to make a new model of a pickup truck and a new SUV. Because so few people want a Ford Focus these days, the transition could actually be a win for the UAW.\nBut it isn't all good news. It wasn't too long ago Ford was saying UAW labor could profitably build small cars. The company has thrown in the towel on that idea, and so there will be thousands of new workers on Ford's payroll who aren't located in the U.S. -- and that is a defeat for the UAW and ultimately a blow to U.S. manufacturing.\nAnd, Ford is putting all its American manufacturing eggs in the light-truck basket, a move that could come back to bite the company if gasoline prices were to spike and demand for pickups and SUVs plummets as a result. More than 60% of vehicles sold in November were light trucks; but it was only a few years ago when that light-truck mix was well below 50%. Memories don't need to be too long to remember when Ford and its domestic counterparts cut a lot of jobs because truck demand was drying up.\nHow would a Trump tariff of 35% affect the price of a Ford Focus?\nA basically equipped Ford Focus can currently be had for about $15,000, factoring in incentive, making it one of the more affordable cars on the market. To get Ford's most basic SUV, the Escape, the price tag goes up to about $23,000 even though the two vehicles aren't radically different when it comes to underlying parts.\nMr. Trump has proposed slapping a 35% tariff on a product like the Focus if it were to move to Mexico, and that would jack the price tag to above $20,000. Based on today's sales levels of between 150,000 to 200,000 Focuses sold a year, such a tax would add hundreds of millions in additional cost that the buyer or the auto maker would need to shoulder.\nWrite to John D.

      "text": "  10:26 am Ford has announced two separate recall campaigns involving the Fusion and related sedans.Technicians will install insulation to protect the front driver and passenger seat-belt pretensioners to prevent cable separation in a crash. The defect affects approximately 650,000 vehicles including the 2013-2016 Fusion, 2015-2016 Mondeo and 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ .\"In the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner could cause pretensioner cables to separate, which may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford said in a statement.The company is aware of at least two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue.The second campaign is much smaller in scope, listing just 27 Fusion sedans from the 2017 model year. The vehicles may have been built with improperly welded pivot pins on the left-rear seat-back frame. The botched welds may fail to retain cargo in a crash.The company has not announced a repair schedule for the recalls. \n ",

      "text": "Auto 2016 L.A. Auto Show | All New EcoSport – Ford’s Smallest SUV Ford continued its focus on developing smaller, ecology-themed vehicles wth its reveal of the EcoSport at the L.A. Auto Show. Nov 21st, 2016 \n\nWhile Ford still builds the Mustang and its GT supercar, there’s no question the automaker is fully committed to future themes of economy and ecology over horsepower. To that end, it’s even calling itself a “mobility company” more than just a car builder. \nNaturally enough, Ford introduced its smallest and most fuel efficient SUV at the L.A. Auto Show – the Ford EcoSport. Resembling a larger, taller hatchback than what we’ve called an SUV in the past, the EcoSport will arrive in 2018 with 1.0 liter three cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost or 2.0 liter four cylinder engine Also: 2016 L.A. Auto Show | 2017 Honda Civic SI Prototype Joins the Family \nThe EcoSport will offer four trim levels — the S, SE, SES and Titanium. The SES builds in the most features, including, intelligent four wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension and steering and unique styling with copper accents for the interior and sport seats. All trim levels can come in 10 exterior color choices and seven ambient lighting options. \nInside, Ford looks to serve up the best possible infotainment system with an available premium B&O PLAY audio system from HARMAN. That 675-watt B&O PLAY system is standard on the EcoSport Titanium, features 10 speakers, including B&O PLAY-branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors and a subwoofer in back. All trims of the EcoSport provide HD Radio technology, SiriusXM satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna. \nInterior technology includes Ford’s reinvented SYNC 3. Owners will also have the ability to start, lock, unlock and locate their vehicle from using available SYNC Connect with the FordPass mobile app. The little SUV gives the driver two USB ports, a 12-volt power outlet, a 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet in the rear seat.

      "text": "Here's Your First Extremely Brief Glimpse Inside the Ford GT Road & Track 1 day ago Brian Silvestro © Ford Here's Your First Extremely Brief Glimpse Inside the Ford GT Ken Block is very active on social media. He posts almost everything he does on his Instagram , giving us an inside look at the life of Ford's social-media-famous factory driver. Earlier this week he was at Ford's headquarters in Michigan, and got to check out some prototypes of the upcoming Ford GT supercar .\nThis short video, posted to Block's Instagram page today, shows the rallycross driver walking up to what looks like a nearly production-ready cherry red Ford GT, and taking a very quick peek inside.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Let's see what we can tell about the GT's interior from this teensy little peek:\nMmmm Ford GT… I just want to drive it! Ha. I have been seeing these GT prototypes and test cars at car shows all over the world for the past couple years, but I haven’t been able to drive one yet. Here’s a quick video of what it’s like to climb into one of their current test cars. #AWSM #testcar #FordGT #FordPerformance #redbutton\nA video posted by Ken Block (@kblock43) on Nov 30, 2016 at 12:37pm PST\nThe first thing we're able to notice is the spring-loaded flap that covers the door handle, to keep aerodynamic drag to a minimum.\nAs Block swings open the butterfly door, we're greeted by a huge gap in between the bottom edge of the door and the doorsill, some exposed carbon fiber body panels, and at the leading edge of the door opening, what looks to be a channel to help funnel air throughout the bottom of the car.\nNext, as he hops in, Block gives us our first look at what the Ford GT's interior might look like in its final form. From what we can see, a number of controls are handled by steering-wheel buttons, much like a Ferrari or Lamborghini setup, and shifting is handled by a dial selector for Park, Reverse, Neutral, and Drive, with a button in the middle for Sport on the center console.\nWe can't say for certain this is a full production-spec car-the exposed wiring in the footwell indicates this car is still undergoing testing. Still, it's more of the GT's interior than we've seen before.\nIt seems Ken Block can add \"Spy Videographer\" to his impressive resumé.\nRelated Video: Ford GT Aerodynamics Test\nReplay Video Play Pause Seek i Volume Volume Volume Mute Unmute CC SETTINGS OFF HQ HD HQ SD LO Full Screen Exit Full Screen Play Pause Volume Volume Follow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump (center) speaks to the media with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, right, and First Lady-elect Melania Trump after a meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 10, 2016. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Pete Marovich. (Pete Marovich / Bloomberg) Thomas Black,Richard Clough and Mark Niquette, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nPresidential jawboning is back. American companies beware. \nDonald Trump isn't even president yet but in a span of just 12 days he's twice claimed victory in getting major U.S. corporations -- Ford and Carrier Corp. -- to keep manufacturing jobs in America. \nRegardless of how substantive the deals prove to be, the strategy signals that the man who prides himself as a master negotiator will use his bully pulpit to cajole companies into toeing the administration line, a tack reminiscent of the bygone interventionist policies of Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Teddy Roosevelt. \nMany experts say the piecemeal approach, while saving some jobs, is probably too little, too late to reverse the long-term decline in manufacturing employment in America. \nWhat's more, for companies caught in Trump's cross-hairs, risks abound. For one thing, no CEO or company wants to be a highly-public target of the president's ire. (Carrier barely even tweeted about the discussions before the deal was reached.) And even if they're granted financial incentives to keep jobs at home, corporations may find themselves stuck using antiquated technology at high costs, putting them at a disadvantage to rivals who have shifted jobs to low-cost countries. \n\"If Congress wants to erect some kind of financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from locating productive assets abroad, let them pass a law,\" said Daniel Griswold, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. \"But let's not have our president bullying U.S. companies to retreat from global supply chains and global markets.\" \nTrump made reversing manufacturing job losses a staple of his presidential campaign, thrilling Midwestern crowds with promises to scrap or renegotiate trade deals and slap tariffs on imports if necessary. It's likely no coincidence that Ford and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp., are the first to announce pullbacks from Mexico. They were two of his favorite targets during the campaign. So too were Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies, and Apple Inc. \nMike Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez, said the company has spent $450 million since 2012 to modernize domestic factories and remains \"committed to investing in our U.S. manufacturing network where it makes business sense to do so, as we seek to become more efficient, effective and competitive.'' Apple said it was \"investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.'' \nThe Trump-Carrier deal will be officially unveiled Thursday in Indianapolis. Carrier will keep about 1,000 jobs at a factory in Indiana, the company said in a statement late Wednesday. Incentives offered by the state were \"an important consideration,\" it said, without elaborating. \nMoving the operations would have saved the company about $65 million a year, which translates to a relatively insignificant 2 cents a share in earnings, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. Trump has pledged many times to cut corporate tax rates and regulations to spur job growth. \nUnited Technologies, a major defense contractor, may be currying favor with the incoming administration, said John Mutz, chairman of the policy committee of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. \"When you're a supplier and the new administration is coming in, you want them to think favorably of you as a supplier,'' Mutz said. \nWhat landed Carrier on Trump's radar was its announcement in February that it was cutting 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. Trump highlighted the news at rallies across the country. The threat of a 35 percent tariff on air-conditioning units and goods returning to the U.S. would scare Carrier executives into reversing their decision to move the jobs, he said. \n\"Here's what's going to happen,'' Trump said during an April 27 rally in Indianapolis. \"They're going to call me and they are going to say 'Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.''' \nOn Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that he had reached a deal with the company. \nTrump also put Ford on the hot seat during the campaign for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico. But the circumstances of the automaker's retreat from Mexico are even murkier than the Carrier deal. In a tweet on Nov. 17, Trump appeared to claim responsibility for Ford changing course on moving production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle, the MKC, to Mexico. He posted the tweets after Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, told him that the automaker no longer planned to move MKC production to Mexico. \nFord, though, never planned to close its Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Mexico and is still planning to move all its North American small car production to Mexico. \nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent in recent American history. Back in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson was quick to call up corporate executives he was unhappy with. Johnson's obsession was fighting inflation, though, not protecting jobs. \nWhen Bethlehem Steel raised prices, he labeled the company unpatriotic and bullied it into backpedaling. And when he realized he had little ability to force farmers to scale back egg price increases, he ordered his surgeon general to issue warnings on the health hazards that eggs pose, Robert J. Samuelson wrote in \"The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath.\" \nJohnson's efforts were largely unsuccessful. By 1968, the last year of his administration, inflation had jumped to 4.7 percent. \nTrump's jawboning is trying to reverse a trend that goes back decades. U.S. manufacturing jobs have fallen by 29 percent in the last 20 years to a preliminary figure of 12.3 million in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nAdvances in productivity, aided by factory automation and technology such as 3-D printing, will ensure that most of the lost jobs won't return, said Jefferies's Rubel. \n\"Manufacturing jobs represent a smaller part of the economy today than they ever have, and they can't come back,\" he said. \nEven as Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are heralding the Carrier news in Indiana, for example, officers with United Steelworkers Local 1999 are negotiating with Milwaukee-based Rexnord Corp. on severance benefits for about 350 Indianapolis workers, union secretary Lisa Duncan said. The company is closing its plant there by June 2017 and shifting much of its bearings manufacturing to Mexico, she said. \nA Rexnord spokesman didn't respond to a phone message seeking comment. \nOther experts suggest that Trump's approach, even if successful at times, will harm the economy and companies. If firms like United Technologies retreat from global markets, they will become less profitable and competitive, creating fewer jobs, said George Mason's Griswold. \nBesides, it's ridiculous to think that Trump will go around the country hounding companies to save jobs in dribs and drabs, said Lee Branstetter, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \n\"It would be an enormous amount of effort and after a while people would start tuning out,\" he said. \"The 27th time he tries this, it's just not going to have the same punch and he knows that.\" \nPerhaps, but right now, the jawboner-in-chief appears to be just warming up. \n--- ",

      "text": "The Risk Of Ford At $13 - The Fed, China And The Upcoming Recession (7 January) Reaction The chart below shows how Ford shares reacted to the announcement of November US auto sales on Thursday. At one point during the trading session, Ford stock hit $12.80 (up 7% around noon), which is only $1.58 away from its 52-week high. Ford shares have fallen 11% so far this year, having struggled to recover since the group lowered guidance for core earnings earlier this summer. (Source: marketwatch.com) Incidentally, given the sensitivity of auto stocks to interest rates, its performance on the stock exchange was remarkable on Thursday, because it came when 10-year Treasury yield hit a fresh 17-month high . Click to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg.com) F is not cheap because its trading multiples are low, but because it is possible that strength in the broader auto industry both Stateside and elsewhere will spur more appetite for equity risk across the industry. Chronic overcapacity persists in parts of the world, but the bulls have other things in mind following the latest beat. (Source: Fordinsidenews.com) And they were proved right this week. Estimates Several automakers destroyed sales estimates in November, as the table below shows. Click to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg.com) This is what Bloomberg had to say on latest sales figures: \nFord was the biggest beneficiary, with its stock jumping after it posted a 5.1 percent sales increase that far exceeded the average estimate . General Motors (NYSE: GM ) Co.'s 10 percent sales gain was aided by incentives topping $10,000 on some Silverado pickups and Suburban SUVs. Even the scandal-tarnished Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) brand got a holiday bonus: Its deliveries rose for the first time in more than a year.\" Click to enlarge For its part, Reuters reported that \"some analysts worried that near-record high discounts, also called incentives, were artificially inflating demand to extend a sales boom that began after the 2008-09 economic crisis.\" There are signs that is not all gold that glitters. Transcript Excluding the nitty-gritty details of total vehicle sales and their break-down that can be found in the official announcement , I think it would be worth flagging a couple of the key elements that emerged in a call with analysts and journalists following the release of US auto sales on Thursday. Ford's Mark LaNeve - Vice President, US marketing, sales and services - noted that: \nOur early read is a total sales including medium and heavy trucks came in at approximately 1.41 million vehicles last month. This will correspond to a total industry SAAR of about 18.3 million vehicles , providing the overall industry with an approximate 5% increase versus a year ago. \nOur outlook for the year remains unchanged at 17.8 million total vehicles. We had a strong sales in November, which places the year-to-date pace at a level consistent with the year ago, with 2015. And we are maintaining our guidance for 2017 as well at 17.7 million vehicles.\" Meanwhile, senior economist Bryan Bezold discussed the macroeconomic outlook, essentially arguing that short-term risks are unlikely to be material; \"economic data showed a trend of relatively healthy household sector , an improvement in the corporate sector extending into the fourth quarter ,\" Mr Bezold noted. I am inclined not to disagree with him. Full Swing However, at a time when risk-on trades are in full swing, certain fundamental risks persist. In the Q&A session, Dan Levy from Barclays noted: \" there was an Edmonds article from a couple of weeks ago in which they mentioned about a third of the trade-ins that we've seen for new car sales this year, they've had negative equity. \" \nI 'm wondering if you are seeing a similar trend, can you give us a sense first of all for us, what percent of your new car sales involves trade-ins and are you hearing more plus from your dealers for greater trade allowances that they can accommodate consumers with negative equity . \" You want to know more about negative equity , and why related news is bad for your investment in Ford? Mr Bezold's words do not necessarily clarify the matter, but can be found here. Click to enlarge So, end of the story? No, really. Zero Tolerance? In a must-read article titled \"Negative Equity Rolled Into New Car Purchases Reaches Record High\", Zero Hedge wrote this week: \nOf course, that's no problem when you can simply roll that negative equity into a brand new 7-year loan at a 2% interest rate. Sure, with the average car priced at $33,000, that means your starting principal balance is 115% of your new car's value but that's no big deal, right? That just means you'll have to roll over even more negative equity in 4 years when you buy your next brand new vehicle.\" Click to enlarge (Source: Zerohedge.com) \"We have frequently written,\" it continued, \"about the unsustainable trends in new car sales in the United States created by the combination of lower rates, loosening underwriting standards and voracious demand for new securitizations by wall street and pension funds that will do just about anything for an extra 20bps of yield.\" Given Ford's current valuation and trading metrics, this could be just a nuisance trough to the first quarter, and I doubt the short-term risk associated to the equity story of Ford has officially heightened. While these risks might be priced into the stock, though, certain trends and news should be closely monitored by shareholders who want to avoid being caught off guard. That said, Ford remains a hold for me. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Technology in general has always fascinated me — I’m always a first adopter. Having to wait a few weeks to get the new iPhone model just about kills me. And I’m definitely a geek when it comes to auto technology. \nSo getting the chance to borrow a 2017 Ford Escape Titanium for the week actually made me a little giddy. It has all the bells and whistles you could want, and then some. And I confess, I was sad when the vehicle loan ended and I had to give it back. \nSome folks might have a little sticker shock at the $30,850 base price — but when you read the list of what’s standard, it makes sense. Once you’ve enjoyed features like adaptive cruise control, the hands-free lift gate and reverse sensing system, it’s hard to live without. \nThe item I enjoyed the most seems so simple that you have to wonder why all vehicles don’t have it. It’s called intelligent access, and with it you can unlock, lock, and start your vehicle without having to reach for your keys. It is beyond convenient to walk up to the door and have the locks open automatically without having to find the key fob and hit it, especially when you have your arms full with shopping bags or whatever. The same applies when you walk away; it locks automatically as long as the key is with you and not in the vehicle. The key fob must be inside the vehicle to activate the push-button start system.\nThe Escape is the first Ford model to receive the brand's Sync Connect treatment. The mobile technology is likely to be especially attractive to Millennials, who are used to doing everything on their smartphone. The app enables users to remotely start their vehicles, check tire pressure and schedule future starts. If you know you are going to leave the house every week day at 7 a.m., you can program your vehicle to start at 6:50 a.m. and warm up or cool off the interior for you.\nThe vehicle I drove had the optional 2.0L Ecoboost engine, which added $1,295 to the sticker. I was happy to have that plenty-powerful engine every time I merged onto the freeway. There was no snow or off-road driving to put the 4x4 through the paces, but I did drive in a fair amount of rain, which is treacherous in and of itself. The vehicle nicely hugged the road and gave me a feeling of security. \nAnother standard feature is blind-spot warning, which is an easily visible orange dot on the side view mirror. It’s so helpful and practical, it’s another feature that truly should be on every car. \nThe interior design was very thoughtful with a place for your cell phone near the USB plug along with generous cup holders and ample storage space in the console and inside each door. It’s a simple thing, but the overhead light turns on by just pressing the light itself. You don’t have to look for a corresponding button. \nThe adaptive cruise control, which senses if you are coming up on another car and slows you down, is easy to operate, as is the navigation system. The map and the all-important time/miles to destination are easy to read. \nThe Sync Connect easily links your smartphone to the car, which makes using the navigation system even easier. It automatically offers your home location (because your smartphone knows where you live. I know, creepy, right?) and other likely destinations. My phone knows I have a standing appointment on Monday evenings. When I got in the vehicle on Monday and connected my iPhone to the USB plug, sure enough, the navigation system offered it as a destination. If you have privacy concerns, this might freak you out. But if you are like me and don’t care who knows your GPS location at any given time, it’s unbelievably convenient. \nAnother small but pleasing feature is the capless fuel filler. If you have butter fingers like me and have ever dropped a gas cap and had it roll under the car, you will appreciate this more than words can say. \nThe gas mileage is a little lower than desirable. Although the sticker says it gets 20 mpg city and 27 mpg highway for an average of 23 mpg, my experience was an average of about 20 mpg of mostly highway driving. It’s the tradeoff to that fantastic engine pickup I mentioned earlier. I paid $1.83 a gallon to fill up at Costco, so it wasn’t a concern. \nThe concept of driverless cars has plenty of consumers intrigued, and the Escape is almost there with its plenitude of technology. For consumers who need the room of an SUV and don’t mind sacrificing a little on gas mileage, it’s definitely worth checking out.",

      "text": "2018 Ford Fiesta The Ford Fiesta wasn't a hit in the Indian market, however, it was quite popular internationally. The current, sixth-generation, Fiesta was introduced more than eight years ago and was waiting for a generation change. And in accordance with the same, Ford has finally decided to introduce the all-new, seventh-generation Fiesta.\nOn 29 November, at an event called ‘Go Further’ in Cologne, Germany, Ford showcased the seventh-gen Fiesta to its dealers, employees and journalists. The company has introduced the new Fiesta in four trim levels – Titanium, Vignale, ST-Line and Active. The Titanium is the standard car, Vignale is a more luxurious and fashionable model, the ST-Line is the performance-inspired model (don't confuse it with Fiesta ST which is likely to be launched later) and the Active is the new Fiesta-based crossover.\nThe new-gen Fiesta is based on a fine-tuned version of the current generation's B platform. In terms of design, the new Fiesta isn't entirely different. The headlights and front grille look inspired from its elder sibling, the Focus. However, it appears wider and lower than the current generation. Ford claims that the new car is more responsive and efficient, and smoother than the outgoing model.\nThe new Fiesta features better quality of material in the cabin, panoramic sunroof, eight-inch floating screen with SYNC 3 infotainment system, new sound system, and safety systems like forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control. Though Ford revealed that it will offer a 1.0-litre EcoBoost three-cylinder engine with cylinder deactivation feature, none of the other mechanical details have been made public.\nIt's not known which of the trims will make their way to the Indian market and include which features if Ford decides to launch one here. However, the Titanium seems like a safe bet. With the premium hatchback market in India growing, and cars like the Hyundai i20 and Suzuki Baleno doing pretty well, Ford might just introduce the Fiesta hatchback in the country.\nSource: CarDekho.com",

Advertisement \nDuring an appearance on \"The View\" on Wednesday , Ford said he had been asked to dress Melania Trump \"quite a few years ago\" and declined because \"she's not necessarily my image.\" \nFord said he is a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, but added that even had Clinton won, she shouldn't have worn his clothes because \"they're too expensive.\" He said his clothes cost a lot to make and the president needs to \"relate to everybody.\" \nAsked if Melania Trump should wear expensive clothes, Ford replied: \"I'm going to leave that to Melania.\" \nDesigner Sophie Theallat wrote an open letter last month urging colleagues not to dress Melania Trump.

Dealer Selection Receive your free dealer pricing information by completing your contact information! \nThe Ford Fusion sedan is part of a large recall due to an issue with seat belt pretensioners. Also involved is the Lincoln MKZ. The automaker says the recall includes more than 602,000 vehicles in the U.S. from model years 2013-2016. \nThe Problem: The automaker discovered that a cable within the seat belt pretensioners could separate, decreasing the effectiveness of the restraint system during a crash, which could increase the risk of injury. According to Ford, the cable may separate due to the high temperatures generated when the pretensioner is deployed. The automaker attributes two injuries to this issue. \nThe Fix: Ford says it will inject the pretensioner with a coating to protect it from exposure to high temperatures. The fix will be performed at no cost to the owner. \nNumber of Vehicles Potentially Affected: The recall includes 602,739 vehicles in the U.S. A number of model-year 2013-2016 Ford Fusion sedans are affected, as well as 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ vehicles. \nSource: Ford",

      "text": "Ford’s Figo & Aspire now get ABS,EBD in Trend variant Posted on by Bharat Iyer \nFord has always been adamant on offering cars with high levels of safety features in India. When it was introduced, both the Figo and the Aspire were the first vehicles in their respective segments to feature 6 airbags. Now the company has silently added ABS and EBD to the lower Trend variant as well, something that was only on offer in the premium Titanium and Titanium+ variants previously. \nFord previously offered driver’s airbag as standard on all the variants of the Figo and Aspire and offered dual airbags from the Ambiente version onwards. With this addition, only the base version of the Figo and the Ambiente version of both the Figo and the Aspire are left out without having ABS and EBD on offer. \nWhat ABS does it that it prevents the wheels from locking up under heavy braking and thus allows for directional control of the vehicle. In simpler words, even while braking hard, you can steer away from the obstacle if your vehicle has ABS. This is done by varying the pressure applied to each individual wheel with the help of a seperate controller unit. It doesn’t necessarily help to reduce braking distance though, unlike what most people might think. \nCurrently, Toyota and VW are the only two companies that offer ABS and dual airbags as standard across the range of vehicles they sell in the country. The Government of India is in the process of passing a law that will demand airbags and ABS as standard across all models in the coming years. Ford already offers dual airbags as standard across all the variants of the Ecosport and save for the base variant of the Figo, the Figo and Aspire also get dual airbags as standard. It is good to see companies taking the innitiative to add safety features to their vehicles to keep the consumer safe. India is one of the very few countries where crash testing norms aren’t yet in place, something that will change by next year.",

      "text": "More Ford on Friday announced the recall of nearly 650,000 cars in North America over defective seat belts that can fail in a crash. The automaker said two accidents and two injuries have been blamed on the defect, which involves overheating of the cables in the pre-tensioning system of the seat belts, which can prevent them from functioning correctly in an accident. Of the total recalled, 602,000 were sold in the United States, 35,600 in Canada and 8,600 in Mexico. The recall covers the 2013-2016 Ford Fusion and the 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ, produced at plants in Flat Rock, Michigan and Hermosillo, Mexico. Some Ford Mondeos also have been recalled but they are not in North America. In the United States, vehicle manufacturers are legally obliged to publicly announce recall operations to correct defects found on their vehicles. Reblog",

Chhavi Kaushik Twitter 0 \nFord India has silently introduced ABS (Antilock Braking System) with EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution) on the ‘Trend’ trim of the Figo hatchback and Aspire compact sedan . Earlier, this safety feature was available only on the top-of-the-line Titanium and Titanium + trims of both the cars. With this move, the American carmaker has made it clear that the passengers’ safety is their top priority. Just so you know, Ford already offers driver airbags as standard feature across its entire lineup in India. \nIn order to promote safer cars for India, several car manufacturers have begun offering a range of safety features to their models. Recently, Volkswagen India introduced ABS and dual airbags as standard on the Polo hatchback and Vento sedan . The country’s largest passenger carmaker, Maruti Suzuki has also announced ISOFIX mounts across all variants of the Ciaz . \nThe incorporation of safety features is also because of the Indian government’s plan to make it mandatory for all new cars to have airbags, reverse gear sensors for child pedestrian safety, seatbelt reminder system and speed warning systems as standard from October 2017. For the existing models, the timeline has been set for October 2018. Besides this, the government is also planning to set up Bharat National Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) to rate safety of the vehicles. \nThe road transport and highways ministry had announced that the new model cars will have to pass frontal and side crash tests along with pedestrian protection tests. The speed norms for the frontal and side crash tests are 64kmph and 50kmph respectively. \nYou May Also Like –",

EST December 02, 2016 (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP / Getty Images, This content is subject to copyright.) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nDETROIT -- Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File A Ford Fusion seen on a Miami dealership lot on September 26, 2014. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Americans To Spend 1.5 Times More on Christmas For Pets It looks like pets made Santa's \"nice\" list this year, as Americans are set to spend 1.5 times the amount of cash on their furry friends as they did in 2015. (Published Friday, Dec. 2, 2016) Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. issued two safety recalls Friday for more than 680,000 vehicles to fix issues that could pose problems during an accident.\nThe first recall was issued for about 680,000 2013-2016 Ford Fusion and 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ cars to insulate seat belt anchors so they can effectively work during a crash, according to a release.\nThe second was issued for 27 2017 Ford Fusion vehicles to replace a passenger seat frame that may not adequately work in an accident, the release said.\nThe Dearborn, Mich.-based company said that there has been a total of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issues. Dealers will be fixing the problems at no costs to the customers.\n► READ MORE: Dawne Gee begins rehab from stroke\n► READ MORE: Is the discount on bridge tolls attainable\nThe following is a list of affected cars:\n2013-15 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 2, 2012, to July 31, 2014 2013 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 13, 2012, to Nov. 1, 2012 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014, to April 2, 2016 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014, to Feb. 22, 2016 2014-15 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, April 12, 2013, to July 31, 2014 2013-15 MKZ vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 14, 2012, to July 31, 2014 2017 Ford Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Sept. 27, 2016, to Sept. 28, 2016 According to the release, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor in the older Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ models could cause them to separate. Dealers will inject a conformal coating into the pretensioners to protect cables from increased temperatures during deployment.\nIn the 2017 Ford Fusion models, the seats may have been built with improperly welded pivot pins, which may not adequately retain cargo in a crash. Dealers will replace the second-row left-rear seat back frame.\nTo find a dealership near you, visit Ford.com .\n► READ MORE: Metro Council sidelines Yum!

      "text": "Redfin From this 22nd floor co-op, you’ll have views of the Detroit River, Lafayette Park, and Ford Field (maybe you can watch the stadium give off a purple glow in the evenings). This is a big corner unit, at over 1,600 square feet with three bedrooms and a large living room. But there’s a big price tag on all of this. The HOA fees (which we’ll talk more about below) are a whopping $1,657/month and the listing price for the co-op is $312,495. This unit was originally a four bedroom, but two were combined to form a large master bedroom. It has two and a half baths and a smaller kitchen with an open concept into the living space. The views and convenience are big sellers here, though. It’s close to downtown without being directly downtown. The lush Lafayette Park is right outside the door. The HOA fees cover taxes, heat, a/c, water, maintenance, and more.",

      "text": "Grand Traverse County Dealership Reacts To Ford Recall Posted: \nHundreds of thousands of Ford Sedans are being recalled, the seat belts inside may not be able to keep you safe. \nFord is worried heat could cause cables to break that are connected to seat belts. \nIn about 680,000 cars. \nIf those cables snap the seat belts might not hold the people using them in the event of a crash. \nSpecifically 2013-2016 Ford Fusions. \nThe 2013 through 2015 Lincoln MKZ. \nAnd the 2015-2016 Ford Mondeo. \nSo far, there are 2 known injuries. \nAnd the recall begins on January 16th. \nWe talked to some local dealerships about what to do if you drive one of these models. \n\"If Ford Motor Company in their letter to you says not to drive it then don't drive it, but if they say you can contact our dealer of the parts need to be replaced then do it. But if they don't put any measure in the bulletin that's gets mailed then they should be able to drive the car,\" said Steve Gloshen. \n\"If it's going to be tied up in the shop for awhile I'm hoping they'll provide me some sort of transportation, because I can't do my job without my car so that's my biggest concern right now,\" said Chris Natzel. \nChris Natzel drives his 2015 Ford Fusion as far as Big Rapids from Traverse City for work. He just found out about the recall. And even though he plans to still drive it if he can, he's worried about what would happen if he gets in a crash. \n\"Safety is going to be the biggest concern for anyone. If I get in a crash I would hope the seat belt would help me survive the crash not further impact the damage so I am concerned,\" said Chris Natzel. \nSo far Fox Grand Traverse hasn't had anyone come in with faulty seat belt cables. But they say if people are worried they can schedule an appointment. \n\"We can look at the cable and again all we can do is inspect it based on what we know about the part right now. So if there's something there that's messed with the integrity of the engineering we can look at it and at least make a determination to be safe,\" said Steve.

      "text": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 4th Update December 02, 2016, 05:48:  By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector \nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S. \nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday. \nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase. \nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade. \n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan. \nHe added that Ford'sU.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford'sU.S. plants. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border. \nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House. \nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\" \nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending. \nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico. \nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers. \nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico. \nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect. \nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards. \nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel- economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018. \nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. \n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview. \nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend. \nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil. \nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\" \nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change. \nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take. \nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com  161748ET  ",

      "text": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 3rd Update December 02, 2016, 05:33:  By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector \nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S. \nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday. \nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase. \nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade. \n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan. \nHe added that Ford'sU.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford'sU.S. plants. \nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border. \nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House. \nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\" \nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending. \nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico. \nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers. \nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico. \nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect. \nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards. \nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018. \nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20. \n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview. \nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend. \nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil. \nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\" \nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change. \nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take. \nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com  161733ET  ",

Getty Images Advertisement \nFord Motor Co. plans to lobby President-elect Donald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules that hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand. \n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Mark Fields, chief executive officer of Ford, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Southfield, Michigan, office Friday. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nThis is not a formula for success, he said. “At the end of the day, you’ve got to have customers, so obviously, there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market,” he said. \nIn 2011 -- when Ford and other automakers agreed with President Barack Obama to double average fuel economy that’s now projected at 50.8 miles per gallon by 2025 and to work with California to sell more zero-emission cars -- the companies counted on a mid-term review starting this year to see if the rules were working out as planned. \nBut the Environmental Protection Agency made a preliminary determination Wednesday that there’s no need to change the 2025 targets. In Friday’s interview, Fields warned that the agency’s action will disrupt the planned mid-term review. Popular Now",

      "text": "Is Tesla (TSLA) About To Hit The Ditch?   04:29 PM \nOn a week where GM and Ford had nice positive pushes, Tesla (TSLA) fell almost 8%. So how do we handle Tesla from here? It looks to me that Tesla is testing this major support area after breaking it back in January. How investors treat the stock is critical at this juncture. First of all, the SCTR is under 5. So 95% of the stocks are behaving better than TSLA. That's a problem. If support breaks here, this looks like a big potential drop. Secondly, we can see that TSLA's SCTR has been unable to stay in the top 25% for the last year. This poor performance is increasing as we see the SCTR being down around 10% for 3 full months now. With this weeks candle moving from one trend line down to the support line, any higher high would be a bullish breakout. Conversely, if next few weeks price action starts to drop below the horizontal support line, this might be a better short than a long. \nTesla is a media darling stock that gets all kinds of press. However, the problem for Tesla now is that 5 of the last 6 weeks have been on higher than average volume. If the stock starts to sell off aggressively, this could really break down. With a negative MACD and a consistent slope down, this will need some buyers to step in soon to change this trend. \nIf I had to decide, I would suggest lower is the more probably outcome. The Solar City merger that was just completed might actually be what pushes the stock down in the near term. Almost everyone who has bought this stock in the last three years is under water. If the SCTR can get an upward move towards 30, this might rejuvenate buyers. For existing shareholders, this is a good weekend to have a plan for either outcome.

      "text": "By : Chris Bruce , Editor Active versions of the Mustang GT or Focus RS would be ridiculously cool. \nFord’s new Fiesta Active features a higher ride height and body cladding that makes it look like the compromise between a supermini hatchback and a crossover. The Blue Oval already expects the trim to be a success and is considering Active versions of other models. \n“I think we’ll continue to look at this,” Ford of Europe boss Jim Farley told Auto Express . “The Fiesta is going to be step one, and we’re bringing it to the market next summer, so we’ll know more there.” \nJoseph Bakaj, Ford Europe’s VP for Product Development, also confirmed the possibility of adding more Active models to Auto Express . The company doesn’t anticipate the rugged-looking version stealing crossover sales, either. \nFord’s most obvious choice for building more Active models would likely be applying the same formula to the Focus . The amount of necessary engineering work would be negligible, and the result would be a larger option for customers who need something bigger than the Fiesta . \nAnother option would be an Active trim for the Fusion (Mondeo in Europe). A high-riding sedan might look a little awkward, but the Volvo S60 Cross Country (below) proves the idea can conceivably work. \nAs performance fans, the folks at Motor1 immediately started considering the more exhilarating possibilities for the Active trim. A Mustang version was the first that came to mind. Imagine a high-riding version of the GT, complete with body cladding and big mudguards. If Ford really wants to get creative, the engineers could work out a way to add all-wheel drive, and the result would be a model to challenge the venerable Subaru WRX. The idea isn’t too insane because Dodge is introducing an all-wheel drive Challenger next year. \nAssuming Ford creates a Focus Active, a limited-run in RS trim could be very cool. Give it a vintage rally-inspired livery, and we suspect they would sell out quickly among nostalgic fans.",

(Photo: Ford Motor Company) \nFord Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks likes many of the pro-growth, pro-business polices that Donald Trump's incoming administration wants to pursue even though the president-elect has repeatedly threatened to punish the automaker for moving small car production to Mexico. \n\"I think governing and the campaign are two different things,\" Shanks told the Free Press. \"I am hopeful and optimistic that this change in tone will carry forward into policies that ... will be quite different than the prior administration but will be positive for growth.\" \nShanks said Ford hopes Trump's administration will consider easing greenhouse gas regulations and fuel economy regulations scheduled to take effect between 2020 and 2025. It also hopes for corporate tax reform. \nThis week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decided no changes are needed to stricter greenhouse gas regulations despite aggressive lobbying by the auto industry to ease the rules. The industry argued the requirements will drive the prices of cars higher than what consumers are willing to pay. \nShanks said Ford hopes the Trump administration explores whether \"there some adjustment that can be made to the present regulatory framework that recognizes the market realities.\" \nBut that doesn't mean Ford isn't worried about Trump's free-trade polices and potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n\"Trade probably is one (area) that we are concerned about,\" Shanks said. \"On trade we will have to see...I think he is starting to put people around him who know part of that business….and recognize the incredible integration of Mexico and Canada and the United States.\" \nOn the campaign trail Trump often singled out Ford for its plans to move small car production to Mexico even though nearly all other global automakers also are building plants and expanding production in Mexico. Time line: A look at the Trump/Ford feud on jobs, Mexico \nIn recent years, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota and Volkswagen have all announced plans to either expand existing plants or build new ones in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also has said it is considering an expansion of its production there. \nBy 2020, Mexico is expected to build one in four vehicles in a North American industry producing 8.6 million units a year. \nThe other company most frequently targeted by Trump is Carrier, a unit of United Technologies that said earlier this year it would move production of furnaces from Indianapolis to Mexico and cut 1,400 jobs. But Carrier reached an agreement earlier this week with Trump to keep \"close to 1,000 jobs\" in the city, a deal that included up to $7 million in state tax incentives. \nTrump also recently took credit after Ford decided to continue to produce the Lincoln MKC at its Louisville (Ky.) Assembly Plant — a plant where Ford also builds the Ford Escape SUV. Only about 9% of the SUVs produced at the plant are Lincolns while the other 91% are Escapes. \nFord, unlike Carrier, did not get any new tax incentives to keep Lincoln in Kentucky. \nStill, Shanks acknowledged that Ford's discussions with Trump helped lead to the decision to continue producing the MKC in Louisville. And as U.S. vehicle sales have peaked, pressure has eased on Ford to build more Ford Escapes at the plant. \nWhat was the bigger factor? Trump? Or the realization that fewer Escapes are needed? \n\"It was both. It was utilizing our existing assets in Louisville … and discussions with the new administration about what the economic outlook and policies would be,” said Bruce Hettle, Ford's group vice president of manufacturing and labor affairs. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "title": "CEO Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico",
      "text": "Ford Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products—zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 17:48 ET (22:48 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 3rd Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 17:33 ET (22:33 ",

EST December 02, 2016 The Lincoln MKZ on display at the Los Angeles Auto Show at Los Angeles Convention Center on November 29, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo: Todd Oren/Getty Images for Lincoln) CONNECT TWEET PINTEREST \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Check to find out if your car is on the recall list . Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies will face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to move production of the Focus small car from a Michigan factory to a facility in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's margins increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan under way. He added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever.\"\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\"\nMr. Trump has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 16:41 ET (21:41 ",

The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 17:33 ET (22:33 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies will face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to move production of the Focus small car from a Michigan factory to a facility in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's margins increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan under way. He added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever.\"\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\"\nMr. Trump has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 16:41 ET (21:41 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 2nd Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 17:20 ET (22:20 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 4th Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 17:48 ET (22:48 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged that companies will face \"consequences\" for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to move production of the Focus small car from a Michigan factory to a facility in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars with profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming, amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers will keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's margins increase.\nMORE TO COME\nDecember 02, 2016 16:28 ET (21:28 ",

      "text": "Home > Transport Ford open to deals with Trump to keep jobs in US: CEO Ford Motor Co is willing to work with Donald Trump to keep jobs in the US if he puts the right policies in place, the automaker's chief executive officer said. PHOTO: AFP Dec 3, 2016 9:05 AM \n[SOUTHFIELD, Michigan] Ford Motor Co is willing to work with Donald Trump to keep jobs in the US if he puts the right policies in place, the automaker's chief executive officer said. \n\"We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,\" Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan. \"We'll continue to advocate for currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure fuel-economy standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.\" \nAfter his election, Mr Trump phoned executive chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker's plan to move production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Mr Fields said. The discussion helped convince Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the US. \nMr Trump did influence the decision \"because of what he's talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it's tax reform or otherwise,\" Mr Fields said. On the campaign trail, the company was a favourite target of Mr Trump, who lambasted it for producing cars south of the border. \nFord still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory, but the automaker has said it believes it can work with the new president to encourage economic growth in the US. \nMr Trump the candidate threatened to slap a 35 per cent tariff on cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the US. He made a similar threat against Carrier after the unit of United Technologies Corp said it was moving production to Mexico and cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana. Instead, Mr Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get US$7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. About 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area will still lose their jobs despite the agreement. \nMr Fields said Ford would consider working with Mr Trump to keep production in the US, but said the automaker's situation is different than Carrier's. The small cars Ford is moving out of the Michigan factory are being replaced by two other models \"and not one job is being displaced,\" Mr Fields said. \n\"Our position is very different than the Carrier position,\" Mr Fields said. As for any Trump administration policies to keep jobs in the US, \"we'll always take those into account, understanding that some of the things being proposed would impact the entire industry, as opposed to giving special deals to individual companies.\" \nMr Fields said he didn't know whether Mr Trump would carry through with his pledge to impose the 35 per cent tariff on Ford's Mexican-built cars, but he said he doubted that any such duty would be applied to only one company. \n\"If a tariff was imposed, it would be imposed on the entire industry, not just singling out a single company,\" Mr Fields said. \"When you look at the production and supply chains and how they're integrated between the three countries\" - Mexico, Canada and the US - \"putting a tariff on that would have a negative impact on all the economies.\" \nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, but the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It's building a US$1.6 billion new small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020. \nFord has said it is just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it's the top automotive manufacturer in the US. Ford said it has added nearly 28,000 jobs in the US over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the US and 8,800 in Mexico. \nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors Co, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced investments of more than US$24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 per cent lower than in the US. Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \nMr Fields has undertaken an expensive effort to transform Ford into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis - without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals - on the road in five years. It's also investing US$4.5 billion to convert 40 per cent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \nThe second-largest US automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by US$600 million, to US$10.2 billion from at least US$10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs. Last month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by US$300 million, to US$1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results. Ford shares have gained 6.6 per cent since the Nov 8 election. \nBLOOMBERG ",

PHOTO: AFP Dec 2, 2016 10:16 PM \n[BENGALURU] Ford Motor Co said on Friday it was recalling about 650,000 vehicles in North America to fix issues that could prevent seat belts from functioning properly in a crash. \nThe recall includes certain 2013-16 Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ cars, Ford said. \nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said. \nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags. \nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "CEO Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico The Wall Street Journal. 7 hrs ago Christina Rogers, Mike Spector © lucy nicholson/Reuters Ford Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nQuote: s in the article United Technologies Corp UTX\n▲ 108.22 +0.74 +0.69% Ford Motor Co F\n▼ 12.24 -0.19 -1.53% Ford’s plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn’t expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n“We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we’re making that investment now,” Mr. Fields said. “When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that’s to make room for new products—zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.”\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford’s operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field’s remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.’s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier’s parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n“This isn’t a Carrier situation,” Mr. Fields said of Ford’s plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle’s price in line with customer expectations. “In our business, it’s a long-lead investment,” Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nAlso from The Wall Street Journal: Car Sales Mixed in November\nClick to expand Replay Video Nation's largest mall hires its first black Santa This weekend, the nation’s largest mall is hosting its first-ever black Santa Claus.

The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford’s U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana’s governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer “leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.” He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. “Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,” said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. “We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.”\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had “an influence” on the auto maker’s decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. “We had been looking at it,” Mr. Fields said, adding that it “made sense” to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump’s positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford’s decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford’s move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn’t expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n“We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting” the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. “We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,” Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were “unprecedented.”\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a “comprehensive review” of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. “We’ll work with a new administration on a way forward,” Mr. Fields said, adding it isn’t yet clear “what form or fashion” that would take.\nCorrections & Amplifications: Ford is moving output of its Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the cost of the Mexican plant.

Fallon/Bloomberg) \nFord and General Motors saw sales surge in November, helped by rising consumer confidence and Black Friday deals that drew shoppers to the car lot. \nU.S. automakers had two additional selling days during the month and have continued to benefit from lower gas prices, falling unemployment and easy credit. Consumer sentiment has also jumped 8 points since before Donald Trump's victory , which bodes well for retailers heading into the end of the year. \n\"Now that the presidential election is over, shoppers have more confidence in the economy than they had just a month ago, and that gives them extra motivation to make big-ticket purchases,\" said Jessica Caldwell, the executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com. \nThe strong November performance comes after three straight months of year-over-year sales declines. Automakers have been running heavy discounts and promotions in an effort to boost sales but which ultimately eats into their bottom line. They say, however, that higher-margin SUVs and trucks help offset this spending. \nIn November, Ford sales rose 5% to 197,574 vehicles, driven by demand for the F-Series truck and the company's entire line of SUVs. General Motors sales climbed 10% to 252,644 vehicles, with its Buick, Cadillac and GMC brands all posting double-digit gains. \nFiat Chrysler fared the worst out of the big three automakers and said sales declined 14% to 160,827 vehicles, as both retail and fleet sales fell. \nAll in all, November sales are expected to come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.7 million, according to Bloomberg. That's down from a rate of 18.1 million a year ago but some analysts say the industry could still manage to have another record-breaking year. Even if they don't, business is clearly booming. \n\"From a historical context, 2016 will go down as a blockbuster year in terms of new car sales and the overall health of the automotive industry,” said Eric Lyman, chief industry analyst at TrueCar. \nShares of Ford jumped 4% on Thursday morning, while GM was up 3% and Fiat Chrysler edged down less than 1%.

      "text": "Japanese ID number : MA-15 Accessories: Missile Longarm transforms into a Ford F-350 tow truck, capable of towing another toy thanks to his hook-arm. This arm becomes a hand-held \"quagma cannon\" spring-loaded missile launcher in robot mode that is affixed to his right hand via a screw. The missile launcher can also be used in vehicle mode, as a notch is cut out of the front bumper, presumably for making surprise attacks (since other drone characters have similar weapons). There is a single, nigh-insignificant automorph feature; the emergency lights on top of the gun/tow rig are geared to fold simultaneously. This makes Blackout's knees almost look interesting. Unlike all of the other \"drone\" toys in the line, Longarm's robot mode is totally different from the CG design developed for the game; even his head resembles neither the Autobot or Decepticon drone heads. And by \"totally different,\" we mean \"has Generation One Hoist 's head.\" Were future redeco possibilities in mind? The gun is not meant to be removable, but is easily unscrewed. The loose gun won't fit on the right hand without the screw, but will peg into the left hand via the connection used to hold the gun/crane steady in vehicle mode. The figure is still capable of full transformation and the loose crane fits tightly in vehicle mode. It is however difficult to transform him while keeping the loose gun attached to his left hand. Longarm features a minor mis-assembly problem, in that the strut between the crane section and the hook itself is reversed. It is easily fixed by popping off the hook and turning it around, then unscrewing the crane part and flipping the strut. This allows the gun to fit together much better, as depicted on the packaging. Towed to Safety (Multi-pack, UK 2007) Accessories: Missile Double box set This set, available in the UK in 2007, features an unaltered Deluxe class Longarm figure and a Deluxe class 1976 Camaro Bumblebee figure. The window box features a diorama background of the battle in Mission City that was also used in the Bumblebee Vs. Barricade pack. Final stand Final Stand (Screen Battles, 2007) Japanese ID number: SB-02 Accessories: Missile This Screen Battles pack comes with a Longarm figure redecoed in the same paint job as the tow truck Mikaela Banes uses to tow Bumblebee to safety. The \"Orson's Towing\" markings have been replaced by the \"Mike's Towing\" markings seen on the actual truck used in the movie. Longarm's interior features a non-removable figurine of Mikaela where the driver's seat would be, plugged into one of the screw holes in the dashboard piece. The pack comes with a battle-damaged posable Bumblebee figure similar to the Robot Replicas toy. This set comes in a special window box featuring a diorama background of the battle in Mission City. Revenge of the Fallen Autobot Strike Mission (Deluxe class figure multipack, 2009) Accessories: Missile Sold as a Sam's Club - exclusive , Longarm was packed with Revenge of the Fallen Breakaway , Rampage and a battle damaged Sideways . Merchandise Edit \nTemplate:Screenshot * Longarm (3D Battle Card, 2007) In the Transformers 3D Battle Card Game , the Longarm is on the Autobot side, but features the Decepticon-style head. Pieces punched out from two different cards can be assembled to form a tow-truck or a robot, while a third double-sided card gives its stats and attacks for each mode. He uses the same piece layout as Bonecrusher , just turned around in vehicle mode so the extension is in the back. Notes Edit Longarms vehicle mode in the movie. Longarm's vehicle mode is modeled after the tow truck Mikaela Banes uses in the movie to carry the damaged Bumblebee into battle. While the markings and paint job are similar, the truck in the film is of GMC make while the toy is modeled on a Ford F-350. While the movie tow truck has \"Mike's Towing\" on the doors, the game model and carded release of the Deluxe-class toy have \"Orson's Towing\" instead, a reference to Transformers design director Aaron Archer 's old screen name \"ORSON\" on the TFW2005.com boards . The Screen Battles multi-pack version retains the \"Mike's Towing\" markings, however. The only exception to Longarm's ability to send a Transformer flying far backwards when hit by his tow is Starscream , who is just knocked backwards: something even Blackout , who is even larger than him, or Megatron is incapable of doing. Longarm can have face, and be Autobot, or have a one-eyed head and be decepticon. Hmmm . External links",

      "text": "\n(Adds sales figures for Ford) \nBy Allison Lampert \nMONTREAL, Dec 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co on Thursday reported a double-digit rise in their Canadian sales for November, compared with the same month a year earlier, fueled by strong demand for SUVs and light trucks and two extra selling days. \nGM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, an increase of 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date. \n\"November was an outstanding month for sales of cars, trucks, crossovers and electric vehicles to consumers in all regions of Canada,\" said John Roth, vice president, sales, service and marketing for GM Canada. \nFord said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis. \nLast month had 26 selling days, while November 2015 had 24 selling days. \nAnalysts expect Canadian auto sales to set a new record in 2016, rising to 1.96 million vehicles, up from a record-breaking 1.90 million units last year. But after a strong first half this year, sales have declined in August, September and October on an annual basis. \nIn the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 percent and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday. \nThe record discounts, also called incentives, have some industry analysts concerned that the auto sales boom since the 2008-2009 financial crisis will end or at best keep sales at current levels into the next few years.

Seat belt pretensioner cables cause Ford to recall 680,000 Fusion, Mondeo and Lincoln MKZ cars. \nDecember 2, 2016 — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 cars in two recalls to fix problems with seat belt pretensioners and faulty seatback welds. Ford Fusion, Mondeo and Lincoln MKZ Recall \nAbout 680,872 of the cars are the 2013-16 Ford Fusion, 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ and 2016 Ford Mondeo that have front driver and passenger seat belt anchor pretensioner cables that can break in a crash. \nPretensioners help to protect an occupant by quickly and forcefully pulling the occupant into the seat during a crash. The automaker says it knows of two accidents and two injuries associated with breaking cables, a problem Ford blames on increased temperatures that occur when the pretensioners deploy. \nAccording to Ford, about 602,739 of the Fusion and MKZ cars are in the U.S., 35,614 are in Canada, 8,665 in Mexico and 653 in federalized territories and the rest, including the Mondeo, are located outside North America. \nFord dealers will inject a coating into the seat belt anchor pretensioners to protect the cables from the heat caused in a crash. \nSeparately, an additional 27 model year 2017 Ford Fusions are recalled to replace the second-row left-rear seatback frames. Ford says the seatback frames may not have been welded properly and can fail in a crash. \nAny cargo in the seat can turn into projectiles if the improperly welded pivot pins fail in the seatbacks. While catapulting cargo isn't a good thing, Ford says it doesn't know of any accidents or injuries related to the faulty welds. \nThe 2017 Ford Fusions were built in a one-day period, from September 27-28, 2016. \nThe automaker says 25 of the cars are located in the U.S. and another two cars are in Canada. \nFord dealers will replace the seat frames once the recall begins. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn't announced when the Ford Fusion, Ford Mondeo and Lincoln MKZ recalls will begin, but concerned owners can always call Ford at 866-436-7332. \nCarComplaints.com will update this page when additional recall details are released.",

Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford’s operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field’s remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.’s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier’s parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n“This isn’t a Carrier situation,” Mr. Fields said of Ford’s plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle’s price in line with customer expectations. “In our business, it’s a long-lead investment,” Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nAlso from The Wall Street Journal: Car Sales Mixed in November\nClick to expand Replay Video Martin Shkreli goes on a raging tweetstorm in response to high school students recreating his $750 drug for $2 Martin Shkreli was not happy when news broke that a group of high school students recreated his drug for a cheaper price.

The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford’s U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana’s governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer “leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.” He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. “Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,” said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. “We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.”\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had “an influence” on the auto maker’s decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. “We had been looking at it,” Mr. Fields said, adding that it “made sense” to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump’s positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford’s decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford’s move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn’t expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n“We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting” the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. “We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,” Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were “unprecedented.”\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a “comprehensive review” of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. “We’ll work with a new administration on a way forward,” Mr. Fields said, adding it isn’t yet clear “what form or fashion” that would take.\nCorrections & Amplifications: Ford is moving output of its Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the cost of the Mexican plant.

PST December 02, 2016 Ford Fusion will come in a hot Sport version (Photo: Ford) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nSeat belts prone to fail during accidents have prompted a new recall of more than 680,000 vehicles globally at Ford Motor. \nThe Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker said Friday that it would recall certain versions of the 2013 through 2016 model-year Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ to fix the defect. \nThe problem stems from faulty seat belt anchor pretensioners that can overheat and cause the cable to snap during deployment in a crash. \nThe issue \"may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford said in a statement. \nThe company said it had linked at least two injuries and two accidents to the matter. \nThe recall covers 602,739 vehicles in the U.S., 35,614 in Canada, 8,665 in Mexico and 653 elsewhere. \nRepair staff will inject a coating to insulate the cables from heat and prevent breakage. \nVehicle owners will be notified if they are affected by the recall, which affects models built during certain time periods at plants in Michigan and Mexico. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey . \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Test drive: Ford's F-250 Super Duty strictly for the trucker Friday Dec 2, 2016 at 9:30 PM Truckers will appreciate that it can carry a ton of stuff and tow prodigious loads, but it's also a gigantic, expensive gas-guzzler that's a challenge to park. By Frank A. AukoferSpecial to The Journal \nThe 2017 Ford Super Duty pickup truck, the first complete makeover of this burly hauler in 18 years, will be hailed by truckers but perplex the rest of us. \nIt's gigantic, expensive, luxurious, guzzles fuel, is difficult to park almost anywhere and has an intimidating personality that appeals to road-going bullies. At the same time, from a trucking standpoint, it is state-of-the-art, can carry a ton of stuff, tow prodigious loads and likely has enough power to pluck municipal Christmas trees from Mother Earth while delivering luxury-car amenities and comfort. \nAll of that is true if the choice of many versions matches the truck tested here: Ford F-250 Super Duty 4X4 Crew Cab with the King Ranch trim and Ford's 6.7-liter diesel V8 engine, which quietly delivers 440 horsepower and, more important, a mind-boggling 925 pound-feet of torque, or twisting force. \nSpecifications tell part of the story. The Super Duty Crew Cab 4X4 measures almost 21 feet long with the short (6 feet 10 inches) cargo box. It's 6.5 feet tall, requiring driver and passengers to step up to a high running board and then step up again into the cabin. Once there you get a commanding view over lesser vehicles. \nCurb weight is nearly four tons and the Super Duty can carry a payload of 2,039 pounds. It also can tow a trailer that weighs up to 15,000 pounds. If that doesn't cut it, get up to 32,500 pounds with the heavier duty and more expensive F-450 model. \nThe tested F-250 likely won't be the choice for Charley, your local handyman, who uses his truck for work every day. It's more for wealthy ranchers in wide-open spaces, no doubt the reason it was named \"Truck of Texas\" by the Texas Auto Writers Association. \nDriving it, especially on narrow rural roads or clogged freeways and city streets, is not for the faint of heart. It demands the driver's full attention despite the luxury ambiance. The ride is pickup-truck choppy because of a suspension system that is designed to handle even heavier loads than the actual rating because customers sometimes overload their rides. \nManeuvering in a shopping center parking lot is something akin to walking on eggs. Spaces barely accept the Super Duty side-to-side but are too short. Backing in works best, which is when the optional outside view cameras come in handy — you can order as many as five for different uses, such as hooking up a trailer. It's likely that most people will just park far away and get good exercise by walking to the store. \nThe Super Duty has a Darth Vader presence on the highway. If you're tooling along in your Hyundai Accent, watching one bear down on you from behind can be intimidating, especially if the nose tackle wannabe at the wheel also enjoys tailgating. \nIf you have some interest in trucks and are the sort of person who enjoys solving puzzles, you might enjoy an afternoon sit-down where you sort out the all the various iterations of the new Super Duty, which likely run into the thousands. The rest of us will continue in our bemusement. \nBecause the government classifies it as a commercial vehicle, it does not publish fuel economy ratings. Yet even with the usually more economical diesel engine, the F-250 is way thirsty—as the choice of 29 to 48 gallon fuel tanks can attest. \nLike its lighter duty brother, the F-150, the Super Duty now is constructed of high-strength aluminum, albeit with a beefy steel frame that extends the entire length of the truck. Ford calls it \"military-grade aluminum alloy\" and it is used for the entire body and cargo box. \nWith the $2,950 King Ranch package and other options, the tested F-250 Super Duty came equipped with safety, convenience and comfort items that would do justice to any number of luxury cars and SUVs. \nA partial list included plush leather upholstery, adaptive steering and cruise control, lane-keeping alert, blind-spot warning, large outside dual mirrors with power telescoping for trailer towing, heated seats, an off-road package with skid plates, a preparation package for fifth-wheel towing, twin-panel sunroof, spray-in bed liner and 20-inch cast aluminum wheels. \nNone of this, of course, comes cheap. The tested F-250 Super Duty carried a base sticker price of $55,455. With all the options, including $8,595 for the powerful diesel engine, the bottom-line suggested delivered price came to $73,170. \nSPECIFICATIONSS \nModel: 2017 Ford F-250 Super Duty 4X4 Crew Cab King Ranch pickup truck. \nEngine: 6.7-liter V8 diesel, turbocharged, 440 hp, 925 lb-ft torque. \nTransmission: Six-speed automatic with four-wheel drive. \nOverall length: 20 feet 10 inches. \nEPA passenger volume: 136 cubic feet. \nWeight: 7,961 pounds.",
