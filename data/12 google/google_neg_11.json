      "text": "Jagdish Chandra Bose was one of the pioneers of radio communication, and discovered millimetre length electromagnetic waves, invented many components still used in microwave communications, and was one of the first to use a semiconductor to detect radio waves. His research into radio waves were during the same time period when Marconi, widely credited to be the inventor of the radio was researching into radio communications. The experiments by Bose were geared towards understanding radio microwaves, rather than using it as a form of communication.\nBose held an early public demonstration of wireless communication in the Kolkata Town Hall in 1894. Bose ignited gunpowder, and rang a bell from a distance. Bose is credited with the invention of wireless communications. However, Bose was not interested in patenting his inventions, and allowed them to be used for free, including commercial reasons.\nHe conducted various experiments on plants, and proved that plants conducted stimuli through electricity and not through chemicals, as was previously thought. Bose invented the device known as crescograph, which can measure the growth of plants with high precision. Bose showed the similarities between animals and plants, and demonstrated that both reacted similarly to external stimuli. He is well known for his theory that plants can feel pain and have emotions. Bose also wrote science fiction, and was one of the earliest Bengali science fiction writers.\nThe doodle is appearing on a number of countries including India, United States, Peru, Cuba, Iceland, Sweden, Poland, France, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The Google Doodle does not appear in Bangladesh, where Bose was born in 1858.\nThe post Jagdish Chandra Bose’s 158th birthday commemorated by Google Doodle appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Google celebrated St. Andrew’s Day, Scotland’s national day, on Nov. 30 with a brand new Google Doodle.\nThe day marks the feast of St. Andrew, Scotland’s patron saint, and is also the nation’s official flag day. The Scottish flag, known as the Saltire or Cross of St. Andrews is flown from buildings across the nation.\nAlthough people in Scotland have celebrated St. Andrew as their patron saint for centuries, it wasn’t until 2006 that St. Andrew’s Day was officially declared a public holiday.\nTraditionally, Scots celebrate the holiday with feasts of haggis ( savory pudding containing sheep’s heart, liver and lungs), neeps (rutabaga or swede), and tatties (potatoes) alongside parades, dances and festive music.\nGoogle’s doodle pays homage to Scotland’s pristine beauty, illustrating the flag as it’s hoisted amid scenes of the country’s famous landmarks: Cuillin Hills, Ben Nevis, Broch of Mousa, Isle of Skye and Loch Lomond.\n",

      "text": "Google Earth, the Google application that lets you look at any corner of the earth as if viewed from a satellite has announced a major update. You will now be able to see a Timelapse of the earth from 1984 to 2016. Along with timelapse, Google Earth is also set to get four new layers of imagery and overall a sharper image quality.\nTimelapse feature was introduced back in 2013, to let you see the earth’s changing surfaces. The new update will add four additional layers of imagery and petabytes of new data to get a sharper vision of our planet from 1984 to 2016.\n\n“Leveraging the same techniques we used to improve Google Maps and Google Earth back in June , the new Timelapse reveals a sharper view of our planet, with truer colors and fewer distracting artifacts.” said The Keyword blog. \nSome of the Timelapse GIFs shared on the site include Shirase Glacier in Antartica, O’Hare airport in Chicago, San Francisco Bridge and so on.\n\nGoogle used the Google Earth Engine to sift through around three quadrillion pixels – 3 followed by 15 zeros – from over 5mn satellite images. Google has used imagery from the Landsat Global Archive Consolidation Program, along with two new satellites – Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2.\nGoogle used the best pixels from these satellites to create 33 images of the entire planet with each image corresponding to a year. “We then encoded these new 3.95 terapixel global images into just over 25,000,000 overlapping multi-resolution video tiles, made interactively explorable by Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab’s Time Machine library, a technology for creating and viewing zoomable and pannable timelapses over space and time,” said the blog.\nThese timelapses are available on the Earth Engine website for you to check our how your neighbourhood evolved since 1984. Else you can check out this playlist which shows the timelapse from various regions across the planet.\nThe post Google Earth updates: Timelapse from 1984 to 2016 to get four new layers of imagery appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Thomas Farragher globe columnist November 30, 2016\nKristen Wainwright\nMichela Harriman in Tanzania in 2003.\nCAMBRIDGE — Even when she was a little girl, there was something magnetic about Michela Harriman. Her brown eyes impossibly big, she sought people out and she built sturdy bridges. She connected with people. Connections that were genuine, solid, and made to last.\n“A real recruiter,’’ her father, Rick Harriman, called her.\nAdvertisement\nShe was reading by the first grade, discussing Ancient Greece by Grade 4, and developed a love for animals so deep that when she swam with the dolphins off Florida’s coast she pronounced it the happiest day of her life.\nThrough it all — tennis, squash, soccer, boarding school in Marlborough — she was smart and headstrong. A girl with a tough exterior and a heart of gold.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. During a family trip to Tanzania in 2003, she found out that the world had another side to it. A side where homes had earthen floors, women cooked over open fires, schools went without running water for months. A place where the blackboards were warped and there was little shelter from the rain.\n“That was kind of a shock to all of us,’’ her mother, Kristen Wainwright, told me this week. “And that had a huge impact on Michela.’’\nTwo years later, she was a rising high school senior with dreams of film school when she died in a one-car crash after, police theorized, she swerved to avoid a deer. Through the haze of grief and loss, her parents crafted an obituary. In lieu of flowers, they asked for donations to help build a classroom in Tanzania.\nAdvertisement\nWithin days, $76,000 poured in. And the seeds of Michela’s movement had been planted.\n“We sat as a family and said, ‘Let’s do this right,’ ’’ Rick Harriman said. Doing it right meant doing what the Tanzanian villagers needed and wanted. Focusing on education. Building bridges. Bringing people together.\nThe fruit of those social justice seeds can be seen in the Ganako Secondary School in the Karatu District in rural Tanzania. The school needed a dining room that could serve as a community center. Initial donations would pay for half of that. Fund-raisers were organized. School kids sold lemonade. The building was dedicated six years ago.\nThe needs are still vast. Wells need to be drilled. A new kitchen is envisioned. But reinforcements have arrived. Babson College has stepped in with an entrepreneurial program led by Babson students. The college’s fifth weeklong workshop begins in January.\n“It’s exciting,’’ Rick Harriman told me this week when we talked in the living room of his home here. “So little does so much.’’\nKristen Wainwright said she can feel her daughter’s spirit guiding the efforts.\n“Michela is at our side the whole time,’’ she said. “It’s bigger than Michela, but it’s so in her spirit. She would be so mind-blown by what’s happening. She’d be over there fixing stuff. She would be — and maybe is — completely pleased.’’\nOn the last day of her life, before she jumped into the car that would careen into a median and flip over into a clear summer night on a remote Vermont roadway, Michela Harriman sat down to write her college essay.\nShe imagined herself as a beret-wearing filmmaker, eyeglasses on a beaded chain around her neck, traveling to Tanzania to document life in a poor village hidden deeply away from the eyes of the world.\nIt was a poignant, wonderfully detailed lyrical effort written by a young woman with wisdom and not a little whimsy.\n“In my own films I can leave this world for a moment if it becomes too noisy or crowded or scary,’’ she wrote as a 17-year-old perched on life’s launching pad. “I can fall in love when I’m lonely or be loved when I’m forgotten. I can talk to that someone I miss or change a part of the past I regret. I think maybe it’s freedom I want above all else.’’\nThere are kids in a Tanzanian village who dream of their freedom, too. And they are at work shaping it today in a shining new place that everybody calls Michela’s Room.\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist. He can reached at thomas.farragher@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nDoug Mills/New York Times/File 2013\nFormer President George W. Bush has refrained from publicly criticizing his successor, President Obama.\nBy Jeff Jacoby Globe Columnist November 29, 2016\nIn the months and years ahead, tens of millions of Americans will have strong feelings about Donald Trump’s presidency, and most won’t hesitate to express their views. One American who should is Barack Obama.\nAs he reverts to a private citizen come Jan. 20, Obama will have the same right as any American to speak his mind in public. Yet it’s a right he should refrain from exercising when it comes to his successor. In the modern era, most former presidents have taken pains not to openly criticize or second-guess those who succeed them in office. That reticence is commendable.\nAdvertisement\nDavid Axelrod, the chief strategist for Obama’s presidential campaigns and a senior adviser during the president’s first term, speaks glowingly of the way George W. Bush treated the man who followed him in the Oval Office. Not only was Bush “very gracious to us during the transition,” Axelrod told The New York Times a few months ago, but he “has been unfailingly gracious and respectful since.” In fact, Axelrod Quote: s Obama as saying that Bush had “taught him lessons in how to be a former president.”\nSince the election, however, Obama has suggested that he may not take those lessons to heart.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning “I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance,” Obama said at a press conference on Nov. 19. But immediately he added: “As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it’s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I’ll examine it when it comes.”\nObama’s words were understood as a signal that he may not shy away from publicly criticizing Trump — a signal reinforced by his comments to the liberal activist group Organizing for Action about returning to the political fray once he leaves the White House. “You’re going to see me early next year,” he promised. “We’re going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff to do.”\nObama will be sorely, and understandably, tempted to push back if Trump moves to unwind achievements that Obama considers integral to his legacy — the Iran nuclear deal, the Affordable Care Act, nondeportation of illegal immigrant “dreamers.” He would be wise to resist that temptation and hold his tongue, just as Bush did when Obama routinely condemned his record and worked vigorously to overturn it.\nAdvertisement\nBush steadfastly refused to critique Obama’s performance, even when prodded by reporters to do so.\n“I don’t think it does any good,” he said in a 2013 interview . “It’s a hard job. He’s got plenty on his agenda. It’s difficult. A former president doesn’t need to make it any harder.” Repeatedly, Bush has stressed that it’s bad for the country “to have a former president undermine a current president.”\nEx-presidents of both parties have agreed. After leaving the White House, Lyndon Johnson didn’t trash Richard Nixon; Gerald Ford didn’t publicly undercut Jimmy Carter; George H. W. Bush was unfailingly respectful of Bill Clinton; and Clinton didn’t exploit his popularity to snipe at Bush 43. The only real exception has been Jimmy Carter, who has blasted his successors on numerous occasions, with little effect except to cement his reputation as a self-righteous nag.\nIn our angry and polarized culture, former presidents do more good when they don’t pour partisan fuel on political fires. Trump, like every president, will face a chorus of opposition. Critics will be legion, with or without Obama. Far rarer will be voices of reconciliation and moderation — especially voices reflecting the rare experience of having been chief executive.\nAs a former POTUS, Obama will have ready access to Trump. Nothing will impede him from communicating his concerns and rebukes in private conversation (which is where they are likeliest to have the greatest impact). In public, however, Obama ought to follow his predecessor’s example: Be a model of gracious respect, and let others fling the brickbats.\nJeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nWin McNamee/Getty Images/File\nSenator Elizabeth Warren is coming out against the bill, aimed at boosting medical innovation.\nBy Victoria McGrane Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren launched an all-out assault this week on a sweeping $6.3 billion bill aimed at boosting medical innovation, claiming the legislation, after two years of bipartisan effort, has been hijacked by greedy pharmaceutical companies.\nHer opposition puts the liberal firebrand at odds with powerful home state interests that support the legislation, known as the “21st Century Cures Act,” including the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical-device industries.\nAdvertisement\n“Any effort to delay or oppose this package serves only to maintain a status quo where it takes too long and costs too much to bring treatments to patients in need,” Robert K. Coughlin, president and chief executive of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, said in a statement to the Globe.\nWarren’s stand also potentially splits her from the White House and other Democrats who are keen to secure various elements of the bill, which includes funding for Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative and its goal of accelerating advances in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. It also includes $1 billion over two years to combat the national opioid crisis, which has hit Massachusetts and the rest of New England hard.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break In the House, six Massachusetts Democrats were cosponsors of the original bill that passed in July 2015. Massachusetts’ junior senator, Ed Markey, has pushed hard for the opioid funding included in the bill, a cause that has been the centerpiece of his tenure in the Senate. Spokesmen for the lawmakers either did not respond to requests for comment or said their bosses were reviewing the latest version of the 900-plus-page legislation — released with little fanfare by Republicans over the Thanksgiving weekend. Republicans plan to bring it to a vote in the House Wednesday, with Senate action to follow early next week.\nView Story Watch: Warren’s remarks on bill The following is text of US Senator Elizabeth Warren’s full remarks on the 21st Century Cures bill, as provided by Warren’s office.\nTo Warren, the stakes are higher than just the legislation at hand. She is painting this as an early test of Democrats’ willingness to stand up to Republicans and block unpalatable legislation when Washington enters unified Republican rule next year. While they’re in the minority, Democrats will have enough seats next year to mount a filibuster against bills they don’t like, the only leverage they’ll have once Donald Trump occupies the White House.\nIn her speech Monday night, Warren pointed to all the voters who elected Democrats to represent them in the Senate, along with Hillary Clinton’s popular vote victory over Trump. They didn’t cast those votes “so we could come back to Washington and play dead,” Warren said. “They sent us here to say no to efforts to sell Congress to the highest bidder.”\nAdvertisement\nOr as she put it more bluntly in a series of tweets after her floor speech: “Show some spine & fight back.”\nWarren’s challenge to the bill is backed by Senator Bernie Sanders.\n“This is a bad bill which should not be passed in its current form. It’s time for Congress to stand up to the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, not give them more handouts,” Sanders said.\nDemocratic leaders so far have been silent on this latest version of the bill. The new version includes cuts to Medicare and looser rules to allow drug makers to market their products to treat conditions that were not part of their Food and Drug Administration approval.\nAnother deal-breaker for Warren: New research funding for the National Institutes of Health morphed from guaranteed money in the earlier House version to so-called discretionary funding in the latest bill. That means most of the $4.8 billion the bill would provide to the NIH over the next 10 years would be released in future years only if Congress votes to do so, which critics consider a dubious prospect.\nThat is a particularly hard blow for Massachusetts and other economies with large academic and private-sector research clusters.\nAnother surprise addition, a provision that would have loosened rules requiring drug and device makers to report payments they make to doctors, was removed under pressure Tuesday. Warren had singled the provision out in her critique — claiming the language would enable bribery.\nSenator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a longtime critic of some drug company sales tactics, also objected and threatened to block the bill.\nWarren has been closely involved in the negotiations over the 21st Century Cures bill for two years. But, she said Monday in her floor speech, while the package contains some good pieces, a few she wrote herself, “I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the difference between compromise and extortion.”\nRepublicans argue the bill would cut out unnecessary red tape in the FDA’s processes, including easing the way for breakthrough medical devices that would boost both the economy and patient health.\nCritics have raised concerns that the bill would weaken FDA oversight too much and jeopardize patient safety.\nRepublicans, at least, are bristling at Warren’s tactics. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, speaking Monday on the Senate floor after Warren, criticized her for leveling “personal attacks” and “name-calling” against supporters of the bill rather than discussing policy.\n“If our Democratic colleagues like the result of the election that just occurred on Nov. 8, I would say: Keep on keeping on,” Cornyn said. “I think what they told us on Nov. 8 is that they actually would like to see us accomplish some things.”\nIt remained unclear Tuesday how persuasive Warren’s pitch to fellow Democrats would be.\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, backed the package, which includes a mental health overhaul bill he has worked for years to advance.\n“I’m excited Republicans and Democrats have put politics aside and reached a compromise that will allow a mental health reform bill to pass side by side with major new funding to confront the nation’s opioid crisis,” Murphy said in a statement.\nThe GOP’s point man on the bill in the Senate predicted plenty of Democrats would follow suit. “I expect a big vote” in favor of the bill, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said on the floor Tuesday afternoon, “because I don’t expect there are a lot of senators who want to vote ‘No’ on a billion dollars in funding for opioids abuse in their home state. I don’t think there’ll be a lot of senators who want to vote ‘No’ on more money to fight cancer.”\nVictoria McGrane can be reached at victoria.mcgrane@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @vgmac .",

Holland Associated Press November 29, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Civil rights groups called for President-elect Donald Trump to forcefully and publicly denounce racism and bigotry, pointing to more than 860 bias-related incidents recorded in the 10 days following his Nov. 8 victory.\nAfter running a divisive campaign, Trump promised — after winning — to be a president for all Americans, said representatives of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Council of La Raza, and the American Federation of Teachers.\nAdvertisement\nTrump needs to follow through on that pledge and publicly denounce the bias- and hate-related incidents that popped up around the country, said Richard Cohen, SPLC’s president.\n‘‘One of our great, great hopes at the Southern Poverty Law Center is that Mr. Trump mightily disappoints the white supremacists, the white nationalists who are celebrating his victory now,’’ Cohen said.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break In an interview on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ Trump — when told about some of the harassment — said if it was his supporters for them to ‘‘stop it.’’ In an interview with The New York Times, Trump denounced the white supremacist movement when asked. But he needs to do more, the groups said.\n‘‘A president-elect has to create a climate that keeps all Americans safe,’’ said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.\nIn the 10 days following the November election, SPLC collected 867 hate-related incidents on its website and through the media from almost every state, with Hawaii, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota the only exceptions. Their numbers exclude reports of online harassment. The group has not independently verified each claim but said it has weeded out any reported hoaxes.\nAdvertisement\nAnti-immigrant hate incidents targeting Latinos, Asians, and Africans made up the largest number of claims, even though many Latinos and Asians in the United States are second- or third-generation American citizens. Those incidents were followed by anti-black and anti-Semitic incidents.\nSchools and universities were the most common places for incidents to happen. Most often, the incidents were through graffiti and verbal harassment, according to SPLC’s information.\nFor example, SPLC said a Colorado mother reported that her 12-year-old African-American daughter was approached by a boy who said, ‘‘Now Trump is president; I’m going to shoot you and all the blacks I can find.’’ A Washington state teacher reported that ‘‘Build a wall’’ was chanted in their lunchroom the day after the election.\nA Louisiana woman said she was getting ready to cross the street when a truck with three white men pulled up and shouted vulgar words at her. ‘‘One began to chant ‘Trump’ as they drove away,’’ the black woman said. And a lesbian couple in Austin, Texas, reported that ‘‘DYKE,’’ ‘’Trump’’ and a swastika were painted on their door.\nIn a separate survey, more than 10,000 teachers told SPLC they knew of more than 2,500 fights, threats, and other incidents related to election rhetoric, and reported an increase in slurs and derogatory language, swastikas, Confederate flags, and Nazi salutes.\n‘‘This polarized and divisive election has left its mark on all of us, but most tragically on our children,’’ said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. ‘‘We have heard countless stories of harassment, intimidation, and bullying of Latino and other students in schools around this country. This cannot stand.’’\nThe number of incidents has slowed but anyone expecting the hate to just vanish is being naive, Cohen said. ‘‘It’s not just going to go away,’’ he said.\nThe groups expect more hate-related incidents around Inauguration Day, said Brenda Abdelall, charities program director of Muslim Advocates. ‘‘To bring us together as a nation, [Trump] will need to disavow dangerous proposals and ideas that single out and demonize Muslims and other communities,’’ she said.\nWade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said it is clear that not all Trump supporters are racist. But Trump ‘‘needs to lead by example in both words and in deed,’’ Henderson said. ‘‘The nation — and the world — are watching.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nAssociated Press/File\nUS Representative Tom Price of Georgia in January.\nBy Astead W. Herndon, Robert Weisman and Priyanka Dayal McCluskey Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump named his top health care team Tuesday, making picks that signal a strong, rightward ideological shift in powerful agencies that manage a vitally important swath of America’s economy, particularly in Massachusetts.\nTrump announced he would nominate Representative Tom Price of Georgia, one of the fiercest critics of the Affordable Care Act, to lead the Health and Human Services Department. Price, an early adherent of the Tea Party movement who also has deep experience in health policy, has spent years working to repeal President Obama’s signature accomplishment. He has also advocated for privatizing Medicare, something that Trump has not endorsed.\nAdvertisement\nFor another crucial post, the director of the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid, Trump named Seema Verma, an Indiana health care consultant who worked with the state government of Vice President-elect Mike Pence. She is a proponent of establishing health savings accounts within Medicaid and requiring some Medicaid recipients to work as a condition of receiving coverage.\nIn selecting Price, 62, for health secretary, Trump gave his first indications of how he might fulfill one of his oft-repeated campaign promises — to “repeal and replace Obamacare,” which the law is colloquially called. Unlike some other conservative lawmakers — and Trump himself — Price has offered detailed legislation that would supplant the health law with an option that relies heavily on the private sector.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break In Boston, where changes in the health care industry could send shock waves through the local economy, industry leaders, many of whom favored the expansion of health insurance in the state and nationally, reacted with caution.\n“If there’s a repeal of the ACA, there’ll have to be a replacement,” said Bob Coughlin, president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, an industry trade group. “I’d hate to see us go back to a day where so many people are uninsured or can’t get insurance because of preexisting conditions.”\nEven though Massachusetts consumers are insulated from some changes in national health policy because the state passed its own health reforms under former governor Mitt Romney, any changes in a Trump administration could still have far-reaching effects, experts said.\nAdvertisement\n“Based on the strength of his views about undoing the ACA, it causes a concern,” said Lynn Nicholas, president of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association. “Fundamentally, it’s like a sweater with threads, if you pull a few out, you gotta repair that somehow.”\nTrump’s choice of Price was praised by Republicans and slammed by Democrats, who characterized Price as a far-right hard-liner intent on shrinking programs that help low-income families.\nBut it was working-class families, particularly whites, who supported Trump in the presidential election, attracted by his promise to shrink government. As a Trump spokesman reiterated Tuesday, the administration still plans to begin working to reverse the Affordable Care Act on “Day 1.”\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, another critic of the health care law, praised Price as an “excellent nomination” by Trump.\n“This is the absolute perfect choice,” Ryan said. “As a legislator, he has played a leading role in developing conservative health care solutions that put patients first. We could not ask for a better partner to work with Congress to fix our nation’s health care challenges.”\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democratic minority in the House, said the selection of Price could prove disastrous for those who rely on government for insurance.\nAs of March 2016, nearly 20 million Americans had received coverage through the Affordable Care Act, according to the Obama administration.\n‘It causes a concern . . . it’s like a sweater with threads, if you pull a few out, you gotta repair that somehow.’\nLynn Nicholas, Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association president, on selection of Tom Price “If Tom Price has his way with the Affordable Care Act, millions of families who have finally found affordable coverage for themselves and their children will be pushed back into the cold,” Pelosi said.\nBefore beginning his political career in 1996, Price was an accomplished doctor and hospital administrator. A third-generation physician, he ran multiple orthopedic clinics in the Atlanta area for 20 years, including at Grady Memorial Hospital, the largest hospital in the state. He later was elected to the state Senate in Georgia, and in 2004 to the House of Representatives.\nIn a statement announcing both selections, Trump called Price a “renowned physician” who has a “reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy.” Price and Verma are a “dream team that will transform our health care system for the benefit of all Americans,” Trump said.\nTo serve, both will have to be approved by the GOP-controlled Senate.\nFor years, Price has introduced legislation that would replace the Affordable Care Act with a system that offers tax credits to subsidize the purchase of individual or family health insurance policies. Price’s plan would steer individuals who cannot afford coverage and have a preexisting condition into a high-risk pool backed by a $3 billion investment, but unlike the current health care law, it would not force insurance companies to offer coverage. The plan also allows companies to penalize consumers for a lapse in coverage, according to copy posted on Price’s website.\nOver the years, Price has expressed interest in increasing private involvement in Medicaid and Medicare, two popular government programs that provide health coverage to low-income families, people with disabilities, and people 65 and older.\nBut how much license Trump will give him to drive change in those programs remains to be seen. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump promised voters he would protect entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nVerma has called for Medicaid recipients , most of whom are low-income families, to have more “skin in the game,” including requiring some beneficiaries to get jobs and pay for a portion of their own care, according to STAT, a health and science news site.\nQuestions also loom about the future of Medicaid funding for the state.\nThis month, Governor Charlie Baker’s administration reached a five-year agreement with federal officials that includes $29.2 billion from the federal government. But that deal may have to be revisited if the Trump administration fundamentally changes the way Medicaid works.\nMassachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said, at this time, she’s pushing ahead with implementing the new agreement, as she has received no indication to do otherwise.\nPrice is a staunch abortion opponent who has advocated stripping all federal funds from Planned Parenthood. He once said the organization participated in barbaric practices.\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will be minority leader in 2017, highlighted Price’s opposition to Planned Parenthood in his statement explaining his opposition to Trump’s selection.\n“Congressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood,” Schumer said. “Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.”\nAstead W.

      "text": " Google+\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\nDemonstrators chant as they gather in front of the White House in Washington, on Sept.13, to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n November 29, 2016\nT he US Army Corps of Engineers is known for many things — the Panama Canal, the Cape Cod Canal, the Washington Monument. But it’s not necessarily an expert in crowd control, or in managing the increasingly dangerous standoff in North Dakota over the construction of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.\nThe pipeline , which would carry oil from western North Dakota to Illinois, would cross the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The tribe — and the “water protectors” protesting alongside — say the pipeline would trammel on sacred lands and could contaminate the local drinking water supply if it leaks or ruptures.\nAdvertisement\nStudies on transporting oil and gas don’t completely support the claims of environmental protesters, however. A study in Canada, conducted in 2015 by the pro-fossil-fuel Fraser Institute , found that moving oil and gas by pipeline was more than four times safer than moving it by rail. (The boom in tar sands oil shipped by train in Canada and the United States has led to an increase in spills caused by derailments, including the 2013 explosion of an oil train in Quebec that killed 47.)\nBut discussion of the underlying environmental arguments for pipelines versus trains should be reserved for another day. Winter is coming, and conditions at the protesters’ Oceti Sakowin camp are deteriorating quickly. On Tuesday, after the governor ordered the camp evacuated and a winter storm swept in, officials said they would begin blocking supplies. The protesters vowed to stay put.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Local law enforcement officers, meanwhile, have escalated their tactics, spraying icy water and firing rubber bullets into the crowd. Sophia Wilansky , a recent graduate of Williams College, was badly injured last week. Her family says she was struck by a concussion grenade tossed by police, but police blame the explosion on the protesters themselves.\nView Story Sheriff on pipeline protests: ‘My job is to enforce the law’ Don’t look for apologies from the North Dakota sheriff leading the response to the Dakota Access oil pipeline protests.\nThe scene at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in North Dakota Cause of severe injury at pipeline protest becomes new point of dispute\nThe corps ratcheted up tensions even further in the last few days by sending an eviction notice to Standing Rock tribal chairman Dave Archambault II. While corps officials gave a nod to the right to peacefully assemble, by promising to maintain a free-speech zone in a different location, they declared that the camp will be closed to the public as of Dec. 5 and that anyone remaining will be subject to arrest. A local police chief, asked in an interview whether use of force was necessary in a recent confrontation, answered, “It was effective. Wasn’t it?”\nBy issuing an ultimatum, the corps is in effect setting a deadline for an almost-certain confrontation — one that could draw hundreds more protesters to the scene and end tragically. The Obama administration temporarily blocked the pipeline from crossing under the Missouri River in September. Indeed, the White House has called for restraint. But the corps is part of the Department of Defense; what better time for Obama to show he is commander in chief and intervene, in the interest of negotiating a peaceful solution to a standoff that could have fatal consequences.",

      "title": "Former workers say shuttered Texas Instruments uranium plant in Attleboro caused cancer, death",
      "text": " Google+\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nThe former Texas Instruments plant in Attleboro processed uranium.\nBy Dan Adams Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nMore than two dozen former employees of a shuttered Texas Instruments Inc. plant in Attleboro that fabricated uranium fuel for nuclear reactors have sued the Dallas company in federal court, saying it failed to protect them from radiation and toxic chemicals at the site.\nThe plaintiffs — a group that includes the estates of former employees who have since died — alleged they have been stricken with cancers and other serious ailments from exposure to dangerous materials such as uranium that the company handled in fulfilling government contracts at its 100-acre campus on Forest Street in Attleboro.\nAdvertisement\nAlleging Texas Instruments had lax safety standards, recklessly disposed of radioactive and toxic waste, and hid the danger from its employees, the workers are seeking tens of millions of dollars in compensation.\nAccording to the lawsuits and federal regulatory records from the 1970s and ’80s, Texas Instruments routinely burned and buried radioactive scrap metal and toxic chemicals at the Forest Street facility and at a nearby private dump called the Shpack landfill that closed in the 1960s and later became a Superfund cleanup site.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. The extensive contamination of the area by radioactive metals, waste acids, and toxic chemicals such as PCBs, the workers said, meant they were exposed to radiation and poison simply by showing up for work. They said Texas Instruments did not provide protective gear or limit their access to radioactive areas, test them for exposure at the time, or contact them later when the full extent of the problem became clear.\nAerial Photos of New England\nA 1966 photo taken from the air above showed the sprawling Texas Instruments facility in Attleboro.\nTexas Instruments “failed to keep the property safe and take reasonable steps to protect all occupants, and intentionally kept secret the existence of these unsafe materials,” the lawsuits said, and that “all passersby, invited guests, and other nearby landowners were exposed to radioactive material and contamination and other toxic chemicals daily.”\nA spokeswoman for Texas Instruments and attorneys representing the company in the case did not respond to requests for comment. In legal filings, the company argued the workers’ claims are employee-employer disputes that fall under the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Act and don’t belong in federal court.\nAdvertisement\nFiore Porreca, the Attleboro attorney representing the workers, declined to comment.\nSome former Texas Instruments employees have already received compensation under a US Department of Labor program that pays them $150,000, plus free medical care. The program has paid out more than $50 million so far in benefits to employees of the Attleboro facility, mostly to those who worked there between 1952 and 1967.\nTexas Instruments acquired the Forest Street operation in 1959 when it merged with Metals and Controls Corp., a local company that made thermostats and motor controls but had recently launched a nuclear division. By the 1960s, it had become Attleboro’s largest employer, with roughly 6,000 workers toiling in 23 buildings.\nThe division handled a variety of work, such as making strips of copper and nickel for the US Mint. And it also produced enriched uranium fuel elements and other radioactive metals for the US government beginning in the 1950s, and made thermostats and switches painted with highly radioactive, glow-in-the-dark radium-226 for visibility.\nNuclear operations stopped in 1981. Only 1,100 were employed there when Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006 for about $3 billion, and fewer than 200 were involved in manufacturing.\nAs part of the sale, Texas Instruments agreed to retain liability for environmental contamination of the site. In corporate filings from 2014, the company has told investors its liability was unlikely to exceed $200 million.\nBain later spun off the unit into Sensata Technologies, which sells industrial and automotive sensors and controls, and still occupies several buildings near the Forest Street campus. Other parts of the site have been cleaned up and repurposed; Bristol Community College has a satellite campus there, for example.\nThe plaintiffs — who according to court filings now live in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, and North Carolina — had jointly sued Texas Instruments earlier this year along with a number of other former workers, but a judge ordered them to file separate complaints, which many did last week in US District Court in Boston.\nOne of the workers who sued, James Cauger, 82, said in his complaint he was diagnosed in 2013 with cancer and carcinoma in his nose and mouth, and peripheral neuropathy in his legs and feet — ailments he claims are a direct result of working at the Texas Instruments plant in the late 1950s. Cauger alleged he was further exposed to radiation at the landfill, which was near his home at the time. He is seeking $60 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Cauger could not be reached for comment.\nOther plaintiffs worked at the Forest Street facility for decades, and similarly blame cancer diagnoses and deaths on exposure to radiation there.\nThe Attleboro sites became notorious in the late 1970s after a local college student detected radiation in the Shpack landfill and reported his findings to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. According to federal records, investigators for the agency surveyed the landfill and found “large quantities of depleted uranium and small quantities of normal and enriched uranium were present,” along with containers stamped with the names of Texas Instruments and its local subsidiary.\nIn 1979 the NRC said Texas Instruments was the “likely” source of the radioactive waste, having ruled out the only other local companies that handled such material.\nAccording to the NRC, workers at the Forest Street plant burned zirconium and depleted uranium “chips” in open trays that frequently spilled over or broke, then shoveled the ashes into barrels that were dumped at the Shpack landfill.\nThe NRC has said the Forest Street facility was “satisfactorily remediated of byproduct material (i.e., uranium)” by 1997, though other federal documents indicate Texas Instruments is still operating several ground-water treatment and pumping systems there. One structure, the vacant “Building One,” remains contaminated with radium , which must be cleaned up before the structure can be demolished or sold.\nIn 2012, Texas Instruments agreed to pay the US Army Corps of Engineers $15 million to help complete the Shpack landfill’s cleanup, which began in the 1980s.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nDan Adams can be reached at daniel.adams@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nThe rising sun cast a glow over Presque Isle, Maine. An economist calls the town one of the nation’s most anxious.\nBy Brian MacQuarrie Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nPRESQUE ISLE, Maine — Four hundred miles north of Boston, past wilderness where townships have numbers for names, there is a quiet place where not much ever happens. It’s not the kind of place you would expect to be declared the nation’s “epicenter of anxiety.”\nBut that is what a Harvard-educated economist, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, deduced when he analyzed a transcontinental lode of anxiety-related Google searches.\nAdvertisement\nThe survey found that Maine is the most anxious state in the nation — with anxiety levels 21 percent above the national average — and that isolated Presque Isle is the most anxious place in the state.\n“There is increasing evidence that searches on a health condition highly correlate with the number of people suffering from that condition,” wrote Stephens-Davidowitz, who studied search terms such as “anxiety help,” “anxious,” and “anxiety symptoms.’’\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. If Presque Isle’s anxiety can be measured by dumbfounded stares by people along Main Street, then the economist is on to something.\n“Who pinned that on us, an outsider?” snorted Dick Graves, a 74-year-old optometrist, when told about the survey.\n“I don’t feel that anxious, I guess,” said 35-year-old Chris Morton, a musician who peddles guitars inside King Morton’s Hall of Music. “But there’s always small things like, ‘What do I want for supper?’ ”\nAdvertisement\n“Do I worry? No, life’s good,” barber Dwight Helstrom, 69, said near closing time. “And this is the first time I’ve sat down since 6:30 in the morning.”\nDespite the disbelief along much of Main Street, some in Presque Isle — a 9,500-person “metropolis” of Aroostook County known as the capital of potato country — said the ranking has merit.\nBert Cloukey, a 74-year-old who takes anxiety medication, blamed too much tough weather and too little wealth. “Our winter is just starting,” Cloukey said. “It costs us so much to live, and people get depressed because they don’t have money to buy fuel or provide the clothes that they need.”\nStephens-Davidowitz, whose study was published in August as a New York Times opinion piece, also said searches for anxiety tend to rise in rural areas with lower income and less education. He could not be reached for comment.\nOn the surface, the low-income, less-education criteria apply to Presque Isle, where less than 20 percent of residents have a bachelor’s degree, 21 percent live in poverty, and median household income was $36,706 in 2014, nearly one-third below the national figure of $53,482.\nThe economist also argued that recessions cause anxiety and that panic attacks associated with opioid withdrawal can trigger Google searches. Maine has been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic, and methamphetamine labs have been a particular problem in Aroostook County. Considering that the nearest large hospital is three hours away in Bangor, the Internet sometimes serves as a surrogate clinician, health workers said.\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nBarber Dwight Helstrom gave Willis Brown a haircut inside his Presque Isle shop.\nDavid Prescott, a psychologist who directs health care studies at Husson University in Bangor, said the volume of anxiety searches makes “you worry that they don’t have anybody else to ask.”\n‘Do I worry? No, life’s good. And this is the first time I’ve sat down since 6:30 in the morning.’\nDwight Helstrom, barber, giving a customer a trim But does scouring the Internet for advice mean someone is ridden by anxiety? Raymond Rice, president of University of Maine Presque Isle, thinks such searches also indicate something else — resourcefulness.\n“The Internet is such a source of support for people who don’t have a higher education degree,” Rice said. The findings, he added, are “a bit misleading because it points to the fact that in Aroostook County, what they pride themselves on is self-reliance. They will look for answers themselves.”\nStill, Rice said, anxiety is a thread in the fabric of life here.\n“Academic and mental health support for anxiety is pretty common with our students,” many of whom are the first in their families to attend college, Rice said.\nTelepsychiatry services — sessions conducted with providers from as far away as Arizona — are available at The Aroostook Medical Center in Presque Isle. Overall, however, the county’s mental health needs are not well served, said Brent Scobie, senior director of clinical services at Acadia Hospital, a Bangor facility that belongs to the same health system.\nPart of the challenge, Scobie said, is recruiting therapists to move to such a remote area. “It can be a very lengthy process to find a therapist,” Scobie said.\nThere are fewer family farms in the area now; fewer acres are being harvested by the agribusinesses that replaced them; and the county — larger in area than Rhode Island and Connecticut combined — still hasn’t recovered from the closing of Loring Air Force Base, a Cold War mainstay, in 1994.\n“Population is declining all the time, and that might make for a little more anxiety,” said Tom Chasse, who owns a sporting goods store on Main Street.\n“There’s nothing here for our youth,” added Scott Haggerty, a customer. “It’s a good place to raise children, but it’s hard to keep them.”\nHowever, City Manager Martin Puckett insisted that tiny Presque Isle is peppered with positives. An average of 18,000 vehicles — nearly double the population — pass through town every day, Puckett said. A $7.5 million community center opened recently. It’s a place where high schoolers still take a three-week break to help with the harvest.\nGraves, the downtown optometrist, didn’t take kindly to the “epicenter of anxiety” label, but he also gave the idea a thoughtful scrub. Together with a lifelong friend — Milford “Miff” Dow, a 71-year-old retired potato farmer — they ran through possible reasons during a leisurely afternoon chat.\nGraves cited the exodus of young people. He mentioned the need for good jobs. And then this: “We worry that dope is coming up from down south,” Graves said.\n“What else is there, Miff?” the optometrist asked. The two of them — with more than 140 years combined in Presque Isle — paused and pondered for several long, quiet seconds.\n“I don’t know,” Dow finally answered. “A bad potato?”\nMap: Where is Presque Isle?\nBrian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy James Pindell Globe Staff November 29, 2016\nLive Free or Die . . . or secede?\nNew Hampshire residents have long thought their state motto had just two options, but the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire has endorsed a third way.\nAdvertisement\nThe five-member executive committee met last week and adopted a resolution calling for New Hampshire to secede.\n“Recognizing that libertarianism is defined as self-ownership, and recognizing that both our federal and state founding documents make it clear that we have the right of peaceful secession. I’m pleased that the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire has resolved its support,” said Rodger Paxton, vice chairman of the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The resolution cites the New Hampshire Constitution that “whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered” the people have the right to establish a new government.\nThe idea of secession has been kicking around in Libertarian circles for a few years. There is now a separate group called the Foundation for New Hampshire Independence pushing the idea.\nJames Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .

      "text": "\nFlipkart’s having a really bad year. Just yesterday one of its investors took a chopping axe to its valuation table, and today the company has lost two more senior executives.\nThe company’s vice-president and private label head Mausam Bhatt, and senior vice-president of engineering Peeyush Ranjan are the latest to quit the online shopping company. For those who don’t remember, this is on top of a series of senior execs leaving these past months – including product head Punit Soni, finance chief Sanjay Baweja , chief business officer Ankit Nagori, and legal head Rajinder Sharma.\nSee: Flipkart now worth just $6b, says Morgan Stanley \nA Flipkart spokesperson said Mausam’s move was linked to personal reasons, while Peeyush’s had to do with a change in roles at the company. The India engineering team was reporting to engineering chief Ravi Garikipati for the past few months, while Peeyush was overseeing a company research centre in Palo Alto . “His role had been deeply truncated,” the spokesperson said.\nAs technology head, Peeyush worked on features such as Flipkart Lite and in-app chat service Ping, along with product head Punit Soni. Flipkart canned Ping a few months ago, and Punit quit.\nEarlier this year Flipkart hired Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who re-joined the team from Tiger Global earlier this year, to clean house, even as the VC was tightening its grip on Flipkart.\nSee: Flipkart has a new messiah, but the company needs to learn from history\n\nPeeyush, who had joined the Bangalore-based company from Google, is going to join Airbnb, Mint reported today.\n“A few months ago, I had to move to the US due to personal reasons. Around that time, we had set up a research lab in Palo Alto that I was overseeing – we’re doing some very cool things in the lab there. However, due to the personal reasons I spoke about, around that time it became clearer that I would have to spend a considerable time in the US, which is why I have decided to move on,” he told the paper in an interview.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear where Mausam, an old hand at Flipkart, was going.\nThis post https://www.techinasia.com/flipkart-loses-more-execs appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

Since the events on both devices are set for 6:00PM, Alexa and Google Assistant would likely be thrown off after 6:00PM has come and gone, but a workaround shouldn't be difficult to figure out at all. \nThe robots are coming for us.

      "text": "On a Sunday afternoon, a relative calls. She is at a party and wonders if I can help a friend of a friend.\n“Her brother is having cancer treatment and wanted to talk to you.”\n“You know I don’t like doing this, especially if there is another oncologist involved.”\n“I know,” she says contritely. “But she is so shocked and I thought just your words might help.”\nSuppressing a groan, I ask: “What kind of cancer does he have?”\n“It’s some form of blood cancer.”\n“He needs a haematologist. I can try to suggest one.”\n“Oh, that won’t do,” she says. “He lives in Germany.”\n“Germany has really good healthcare! He doesn’t need my advice, especially on a disease I don’t even treat.”\n“But people like us, we hear the word ‘cancer’ and freak out.”\nWe could prevent millions of cancer deaths with knowledge we already have | David Hunter Read more \nThe friend of a friend is a wreck and I can’t bear to turn down her request. So although there is very little I will say, I patiently hear her out. Her brother indeed has cancer and has met his German oncologist, commenced chemotherapy, and seems to be doing OK. He has young children and the family is anxious about prognosis. The friend asks me many times if he will die from his disease. I tell her as many times as I can that he seems to be in competent hands and that the question about prognosis should be directed towards his treating doctor.\nI long to tell her that he has a highly curable disease but without knowing all the details, this wouldn’t be right. I end the call feeling somewhat like a politician, having batted away every meaningful question with a platitude but my hands feel tied.\n“If I have cancer, will I die?”\nAs an oncologist, it’s both interesting and poignant to know that this is one of the most common answers people seek from Google . Dispensing with the obvious, “Everyone must die”, the answer I hope Google would give is: “Tell me more.” Google should ask for not just the type of cancer but the colour of your skin, the language you speak, how much you earn, what country you live in, the distance to the nearest cancer centre, and crucially, if you are married.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The disparities in cancer outcomes based on the socioeconomic gradient are significant and sadly familiar to every oncologist.’ Photograph: Enrique Castro-Mendivil/Reuters \nIn the developed world, cancer survival rates are increasing. An Australian patient diagnosed with cancer today has a 67% chance of being alive in five years . Cancer Research UK states that cancer survival rates in the UK have doubled from 24% to 50% in the past 40 years . A recent American Cancer Society report calculates five-year survival for all cancers as having risen from 49% to 69% in the past 40 years.\nIf you have survived the first five years, the chance of long-term survival is increasingly optimistic, more than 90% for all cancers combined. These improved outcomes are attributed to early diagnosis and better treatments. Modern chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens are unrecognisable compared to earlier decades. The march of immunotherapy continues, with new drugs able to delay cancer progression and extend survival in traditionally bleak scenarios including melanoma and lung and bladder cancer.\nWe now know that cancer is actually many different diseases , cancer cells are extraordinarily smart at outwitting the body’s defences, and a reasonable goal ought to be keeping cancer patients better for longer rather than expecting to banish cancer altogether. Amid the high survival rates for common cancers such as bowel, breast and prostate, detected early, the outcomes for brain, pancreas and stomach cancers remain dismal, with most patients expected to live for only a few years.\nThe secret life of an oncologist: witnessing the most painful and intimate moments of life | Anonymous Read more \nBut apart from tumour biology, what else affects survival? Being male, an ethnic minority and being non-English speaking confers poorer outcomes as does social disadvantage, illiteracy, poverty and living far away from the full suite of services that modern treatment demands. The disparities in cancer outcomes based on the socioeconomic gradient are significant and sadly familiar to every oncologist, who nonetheless spend most of their time prescribing drugs because this is what they feel best equipped for.\nInterestingly, marriage (but not living with a friend or a child) conveys a consistent and substantial impact on cancer detection, outcome and survival. Married people seek earlier attention for concerning symptoms, are more compliant with treatment, and die with greater psychological support. Married men benefit somewhat more than women but in the case of five common cancers, the overall impact is greater than published results of chemotherapy, leading the Journal of Clinical Oncology to state baldly: “Marriage is as protective as chemotherapy.”\nIt’s fair to say that if you are a cancer patient lucky enough to live in the rich world, you can be increasingly optimistic about your chances all along the continuum of cancer care, from diagnosis to terminal care. But what if a person living in a poorer country asks the same question? Unfortunately, the answer is more likely to be a straightforward: “Yes, you will die.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Have scientists found the cure for cancer? \nThere are 14m new diagnoses and 8m cancer deaths each year. A staggering 70% of deaths happen in Africa, Asia and Central and South America . Poverty, poor governance, inadequate infrastructure and scarce specialists all play a role. Many countries have pockets of excellence but there is no comprehensive and easily accessible programme of cancer education, screening, treatment and palliative care.\nGlobally 20% of cancers are related to tobacco , use of which remains common, cheap and unregulated. Another 20% are attributed to vaccine-preventable infections such as Hepatitis B and C and the human papillomavirus. Patients suffer from the twin curse of living in cancer-promoting environments and lack of access to help when they need it.\nHow do people die from cancer? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Ranjana Srivastava Read more \nBut even if one took the sanguine view that everyone must die of something, it is the abject state of palliative care that should jolt us from complacency. While we may be occupied by opioid abuse, access to morphine remains a pipedream for most people around the world. Fully 90% of the world’s morphine is used by patients in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia.\nMeanwhile, the vast majority of cancer presentations in developing countries are with advanced disease, where effective palliative care is not only the most practical but also the most compassionate intervention. But oncologists there have stories, such as the dying patient with a bleeding, infected and painful cancer who has travelled hundreds of kilometres in search of pain relief only to be sent home with paracetamol or ibuprofen, or nothing at all. Morphine is arguably the cheapest and most effective drug for palliation and is on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medications but due to health illiteracy, stigma, misguided fears and misinformed government policy, dying with dignity is no more than an aspiration for most patients around the world.\nAs an oncologist, I am regularly humbled by patients’ disclosure that they lost track of everything else I said after the word “cancer”. Treatable or not, the very encounter permanently alters the lives of those who suffer and those who must watch on. No one, no matter where in the world, is “lucky” to develop cancer, but the next time you turn to Google and ask “If I have cancer, will I die?”, it may help to know what a loaded question it really is.",

The data comes from Localytics analyzing customer activations from Black Friday, Nov. 24 through Cyber Monday, Nov. 28. Localytics draws its data from more than 2.7 billion devices worldwide.\nIt’s hard to say exactly what caused the massive discrepancy in activations during the holiday weekend. Localytics said in a statement that its data will “confirm what many have believed since the device was released in October : the Pixel is a very impressive device.” The company also acknowledged that the iPhone 7 experienced strong demand when it was released in September, and there might be fewer people looking to buy the new handset.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nHowever, Localytics added that iPhone models released in years past have actually done better than the iPhone 7. Apple’s AAPL iPhone 6s, which was released in 2015, for instance, saw its holiday weekend activations soar last year.\n“During last year’s Black Friday weekend, the newest Apple models fared much better,” Localytics said, referring to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. “The iPhone 6s And 6s Plus saw lifts of 36% and 29%, respectively.”\nRegardless, it’s clear that Google GOOGL is on to something with Pixel, the first handset the company has designed and engineered on its own. The Pixel, which was unveiled last month, is the 5-inch version. A larger Pixel XL comes with a 5.5-inch screen. Both models come with what Google calls the “highest-rated smartphone camera,” long-lasting battery life, and a high-end processor for performance.\nAlthough analysts don’t expect the Pixel line to match Apple’s iPhone in overall sales, they have said there’s strong demand for the device. Earlier this week, in fact, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted Google would sell about 3 million Pixel devices in the fourth quarter, and another 5 million to 6 million next year. If Google can extend its partnerships with other companies, the analysts say, it could boost those estimates.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nGoogle surprised some industry watchers at its device unveiling last month when it said it was partnering with Verizon as its carrier partner. Now a month later, Verizon VZ is the only carrier selling Google’s smartphone. Expanding those relationships to other carriers could help Pixel’s sales, analysts say.\nStill, the Pixel is available unlocked at Google’s online marketplace, allowing customers to pay full price--the handset’s pricing starts at $649--and run it on the carrier of their choosing.\nAccording to Localytics data, 46% of the Pixel handsets activated over the holiday weekend were done so through Verizon. The remaining 54% of Pixel handsets were unlocked and brought to other carrier networks.\nOne other tidbit from the Localytics data: consumers activated more smartphones on Thanksgiving Day than any other day during the holiday weekend.",

      "text": "11/30/16 AT 8:55 AM Close \nGoogle has often used its homepage “Doodle” to celebrate famous but perhaps lesser known figures from science and world history, and Wednesday it stayed true to form by honoring scientist and pioneer Jagdish Chandra Bose on his 158th birthday. \nBose, who was a multi-faceted mathematician and scientist on a number of subjects, was born in then British-controlled India – now Bangladesh – on Nov. 30, 1858, and until his death in 1937 was renowned for his work in physics, biophysics, radio science and the invention of the crescograph. He’s also credited with inventing Bengali science fiction writing \nThe crescograph, which is the main feature of Bose’s “doodle,” is used to measure plants reactions to “various stimuli, proving a parallel between animal and plant tissues,” according to CNET . The discovery essentially proved that plants have nervous systems and do react to the world similar to that of other animals. \nBut perhaps his greatest achievement, as he’s known to some as the “father of wireless communication,” came in November 1895 when, according to Quartz , Bose fired off an electromagnetic wave 75 feet across a room in Calcutta’s Town Hall to “remotely ring a bell and to explode some gunpowder.” Related Stories Do Solar Neutrinos Affect Radioactive Decay Rates? \nBose was also the first to use semiconductor junctions to find radio signals and found electromagnetic waves measuring one millimeter in length. \nAnd though he might not be known in mainstream society, Bose’s fellow scientists have shown him recognition in one of the more unique ways. In 1970, a crater on Earth’s moon was named after Bose. \nBose’s life began in India and he eventually studied physics at Calcutta University, before moving on to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, where he would study under and conduct research with Nobel Prize winner and physicist John William Strutt. \nBose also made his first entry into the science fiction world in 1896, when he published the short story “The Story of the Missing One,” which stands as one of the first forays into the genre in Bengali literature.

      "text": "Shutterstock \nAnyone running an older version of the Android operating system, be warned: Malware is infecting 13,000 Android devices every day, putting at risk the private details of more than 1 million Google accounts. \nThat's according to cybersecurity software company Check Point , which discovered a new piece of malware called \"Gooligan\" that's infecting Android phones and stealing email addresses. \nUsers who download Gooligan-infected apps or click links in phishing messages are being exposed to the malware, which allows attackers to access sensitive information from Google apps like Gmail, Drive, and Photos. \nOnce attackers hack into the device, they're buying apps on the Google Play store and writing reviews posing as the phone's owner, Check Point says. \nAnyone who owns a device running Android 4 and 5 — that includes Android Jelly Bean, KitKat, and Lollipop — is most at risk, according to Check Point, and those devices make up nearly 75% of Android users. \nCheck Point has made an online tool to check if your phone is infected with Gooligan. By typing your Google address into the Gooligan Checker, you can find out if you've been hacked. \nSecurity issues on Android are aren't exactly uncommon, since Android runs on third-party devices that are in charge of their own security and can be slow to update. Back in July , Check Point discovered another breach that affected 85 million Android phones. The devices were infected with malware that was generating $300,000 every month in ad revenue. And in August , hackers began using Google AdSense to target Android users and steal their banking data. \nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest breach.",

Image: Landsat /Copernicus/Google \nGlobal warming might be a Chinese conspiracy to president-elect Donald Trump , but Google's new 30-year time-lapse view from space still underlines the big changes that Earth has undergone. \nEven if you don't believe humans have caused climate change, the new set of time-lapse satellite images from 1984 to 2016 offers a fresh insight into our shifting environment. \nThe 10-second snapshots of Earth from space over 32 years captures urban sprawl, deforestation and reforestation, receding glaciers, and major engineering feats, such as the Oresund Bridge connecting Denmark to Sweden, or the spread of the Alberta Tar Sands in Canada. \nGoogle launched Timelapse in 2013 with a time-lapse from 1984 to 2012. It has now updated the project with the same methods it used to sharpen images and remove clouds in Google Maps and Earth in June. It also has updated it with four years' worth of images from between 2013 to 2016. \nGoogle Earth engine program manager, Chris Herwig says it created the new \"annual mosaics\" by stitching together 33 images of the Earth, each representing one year. Each image contains 3.95 trillion pixels, cherry-picked from an original set of three quadrillion pixels. \n\"Using Google Earth Engine , we sifted through about three quadrillion pixels, that's three followed by 15 zeroes, from more than 5,000,000 satellite images,\" Herwig said. \n\"We took the best of all those pixels to create 33 images of the entire planet, one for each year. We then encoded these new 3.95-terapixel global images into just over 25,000,000 overlapping multi-resolution video tiles, made interactively explorable by Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab's Time Machine library, a technology for creating and viewing zoomable and pannable time-lapses over space and time.\" \nThe satellite images come from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and US Geological Survey. Since 2015, they also contain some data from the European Space Agency's Copernicus Program and its Sentinel-2A satellite. \nGoogle has once again partnered with TIME magazine to published a selection of compelling locations to view in 10-second frames. \nIn 2013 TIME drew attention to Las Vegas' urban sprawl, rapid development in Dubai, and the slow death of Alaska's Columbia glacier. \nThis year it focused on the expansion of the Panama Canal, which TIME considers was improvement for the 21st century, while Brazil's Jirau Dam brought mixed blessings, helping improve electricity service but covering 1,400 miles of jungle in electrical cables.

      "title": "Android malware exposes 1 million Google accounts, see if you’re affected",
      "text": "  \nIf you needed yet another reminder not to install untrusted applications without fully knowing where they come from, here it is: researchers with Check Point Software Technologies recently published details on new Android malware named “Gooligan” that has compromised more than 1 million Google Accounts. Check Point said that figure is increasing by an additional 13,000 accounts as users continue to download infected applications. \nSnap Point traced Gooligan’s roots back to an app named “SnapPea,” which it identified as malware last year. It has since popped up in “dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores,” the research firm explained. Third party app stores aren’t controlled by Google, which is why Google always recommends its users download applications from Google Play, where they can be scanned for malware and other issues. \nAs Check Point explains, Android users often seek out illegitimate third-party app stores as a way to find free versions of paid applications. It might work most of the time, but it also exposes you to malware and, in this case, very dangerous malware that can gain access to your entire Google account. “Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services,” the company explained. Check to see if you’re account is exposed to Gooligan \nA device infected by Gooligan is potentially granting access to data stored in any of Google’s applications including Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos, Gmail and Google Play. The majority of infected accounts, 57 percent, are in Asia, according to Check Point. 19 percent of accounts originate in the Americas, 9 percent are infected in Europe and 15 percent of affected accounts are in Africa. \nAttackers get more than private data, however. They can actually turn your Android device into a money-making machine. Check Point said attackers will first steal your account and authentication token information, and then use your credentials to install adware that ends up generating revenue. They also use infected accounts to “install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation.” That explains why you sometimes see really terrible apps with high ratings. \nCheck Point said it believes this is the “largest Google Account breach to date” and said it has alerted Google to the problem. “We’re appreciative of both Check Point’s research and their partnership as we’ve worked together to understand these issues,” Google’s director of Android security Adrian Ludwig told the researchers. “As part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the Ghost Push family of malware, we’ve taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall.” \nCheck Point has a tool that allows you to check if your account is affected, so be sure to run yours through it (it was down at the time of publication, sadly enough, but be sure to check back.) Hit the source for more information, including a full list of apps that are infected with Gooligan. Topics # Google # Android # Gooligan # Malware # Privacy # Security  ",

And while the spotlight may be on Wifi as the new toy in town, that doesn’t mean Google has forgotten about its first router experiment, OnHub , which is now available on Amazon for a substantial discount.\nThe original TP-Link OnHub router is available for $117.49 , over 40 percent off its usual $200 price tag (although it’s currently sold out), while the ASUS model is even cheaper , at $105.99. Both of those prices are well below the new Wifi routers, which starts at $129.99 for a single unit , and $299.99 for a pack of three .\nAlso, Google is updating the OnHub models with support for Wifi’s mesh networking, so if you’re planning on building out a multi-router network or considering an upgrade to the newer Wifi routers later on, the discounted OnHubs will still work great in that setup.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nNot your average Android news -- a diverse mix of advice, insight, and analysis with veteran Android journalist JR Raphael. Try it with margarine for a low-cal treat! Android Intelligence Analysis The real effect Google's Pixel phone is having on Android To get at the Pixel's actual impact, you have to look beyond the surface -- and beyond the basic numbers. Computerworld | Nov 30, 2016 8:36 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Some important things to know about... Show More \nIf there's one thing worth remembering about Google's Pixel phone , it's that the device itself -- what we see on the surface -- is but one piece of a much larger puzzle. \nWe've talked before about how the Pixel is more than the sum of its parts . The phone effectively lets Google have its cake and eat it, too -- by leaving Android open to manufacturers while also providing a holistic Google-controlled version of what an Android device ought to be. \nGoogle is giving us an option to enjoy Android at its best, in other words -- the way it intended it to be experienced, from end to end -- while still giving other phone-makers the ability to use the software as a canvas for their creations. \n\"But wait!\" you say. \"That's all fine and good, but most normal people are just gonna waltz into their local carrier store and buy the latest (non-exploding) Samsung phone, anyway -- so what does it even matter?\" \nThat's a valid point, Paco; the Pixel phone presently makes up a very small piece of the overall Android pie. But again: big picture. \nThe real effect of the Pixel is something we're already seeing in reviews around the web. First and foremost, it's setting a new bar for what an Android device can be. \nTake, for example, the \"best Android phone\" recommendation from the folks at The Wirecutter -- who in past years have pointed buyers to Samsung's Galaxy S line: \nSamsung’s software has improved ... but it still has some redundancy and bugs that make us yearn for the Pixel, and it’s a couple Android versions behind. \nAndroid Central reaches a similar conclusion in its latest \"best phone\" recommendation: \nWhile the phone lacks waterproofing and expandable storage, Samsung's Galaxy S7, our former recommendation, is still two major Android revisions behind, and its software can't match the effortless polish of the Pixel. \nAnd then there are everyday reviews of other Android phones, like this one focused on the LG V20 from The Verge : \nI’ve been using a Pixel XL alongside this, and LG’s effort just doesn’t match up. Google's first phone reminds us of the wonderful complete package that's possible from a company with unified control over everything. The V20 can't do that. \nI could keep going, but you get the point: The Pixel has become a standard of comparison to which other Android devices are now being held -- generally not to their benefit -- and irrespective of any sales success, that's a pretty significant feat for Google to have achieved with its first fully controlled effort. Creating that sort of mainstream-ready gold standard is something the company was never able to accomplish with its less holistic (and generally more compromise-requiring ) Nexus phones of yore, despite those devices' immense enthusiast appeal. \nAnd remember: From Google's perspective, Pixel phones have the core benefit of putting Google services front and center in a way that lets them shine (and in a way other Android manufacturers often opt to avoid). If the company can do that while also providing an unmatched user experience for consumers -- one that, from the ecosystem-wide cohesive interface to the league-of-its-own post-sales support, makes other Android devices look like second-rate choices in comparison -- well, you can see how this could become a pretty big deal over time. \nFor now, early sales estimates actually suggest the Pixel phones are off to a fairly solid start. A new Morgan Stanley report predicts Google will have sold about 3 million of the things by the end of 2016 and 5 to 6 million more throughout next year, generating a total of nearly $6 billion from hardware alone. (The Pixel has also reportedly done relatively well at Verizon , specifically, as well as throughout India .) \nBut the bright minds at Morgan Stanley echo what we've been discussing all along: the fact that these basic numbers are only one small part of the story. Per Business Insider : \nFeatures unique to the Pixel, such as the Google Assistant, the Pixel camera, and Daydream ... plus the smartphone's deeper app integration [and] increased prominence of Android Pay ... will ultimately lead to users spending more money on Android, according to the research note. \nMorgan Stanley's analysts also predict that these features could see the Pixel driving higher mobile search monetization for Google as advertisers will spend more to reach the consumers who spend the most on their mobiles. \nAnd there you have it. The Pixel is ultimately a vessel for Google to bring its own mobile vision directly to mainstream users. That benefits Google as a company, and it benefits us as consumers who carry Android phones. \nWhat we're seeing now are just the earliest seeds of change from those efforts. If things continue along this same path , it won't be long before those seeds start to blossom -- and the broader Android ecosystem starts looking a wee bit different, one flower at a time.

      "text": "  \nMalware scares are by and large common at this point, but a new concern has popped up that deseves some attention. Check Point, the security research team who has uncovered a lot of this stuff as of late, has discovered a new form of malware that they’re calling Gooligan. \nGooligan is based on the Ghost Push malware that came into prominence last year, where the malware installs a rootkit on the user’s phone and uses API tricks to hide itself from malware-busting checks. For this battle, Gooligan has taken on a form that gives it an ability to intercept Google account tokens from Google apps, which it then uses to inject code into Google Play Services to secretly download fraudulent apps. \nIt’s said that over 1 million Google accounts have been affected by this issue, but before you freak out let’s consider a few things: Google says that the malware’s behavior is similar to the intent of other Ghost Push-based methods in that it’s only interested in using their capabilities to push apps and adware, and not necessarily stealing user data. For their part, they say no user data has been compromised on their end. The issues affect Android 5.0 Lollipop and earlier, with Android 6.0 and higher being safe. Even still, it’s unlikely that this malware made it through Google Play’s security platform, and Google says there’s no evidence of that, either. As such, this issue likely affected users who get their apps from untrustworthy third-party app stores. \nFor those potentially affected, Google says they’ve already taken precautionary and reactionary methods, including revoking account tokens for those affected and using Verified Boot on newer platforms to ensure no illegal modifications have been made to the system partition. Beyond that, Google says they’re continuing to work with device manufacturers and service providers to keep as many devices updated as they can to ensure users are shielded from these sorts of attacks in their ongoing effort to strengthen internet security.

Photo by CNET \nMore than a million Google accounts have been hit by malicious software, a security firm said Wednesday. \nCheck Point said in a blog post that the attack campaign, known as Gooligan, is expanding to an additional 13,000 devices a day. It is malware that infects devices and steals their authentication tokens to breach data from Google Play, Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suite, Google Drive and other programs. \nGooligan features a Trojan horse type of attack, in which the malicious software poses as legitimate apps for Android smartphones and tablets. Names of the malicious apps include StopWatch, Perfect Cleaner and WiFi Enhancer, according to the Wall Street Journal . Once installed, these apps automatically install other apps, some of which can steal user names and passwords to post fake reviews. \nThe company said Gooligan is a variant of an Android malware campaign found by researchers in the SnapPea app last year. \nGoogle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nPeople worried that their Google accounts may be compromised can check on the Check Point website .

      "title": "Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs is eyeing a contest to build its own internet city",
      "text": "For months, it was rumored that Sidewalk Labs, the Google spinoff focused on smart city solutions, wanted to build its own city-within-a-city to trial self-driving cars, public Wi-Fi, new health care solutions, and other city planning advances that modern technology makes possible. Today, the company confirmed that it was indeed interested in creating its own urban district “from the internet up,” and hinted that it may even make a contest out of it.\nDan Doctoroff, CEO of Sidewalk Labs, made it official in a Medium post today celebrating the company’s first year in existence. In it, he claims that by experimenting with new technologies in “real-world conditions,” there is the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to two-thirds, shorten commutes by an hour, and slash the cost of living for local residents by as much as 14 percent.\n“A large-scale district holds great potential to serve as a living laboratory for urban technology.” “A large-scale district holds great potential to serve as a living laboratory for urban technology  —  a place to explore coordinated solutions, showcase innovations, and establish models for others to follow,” Doctoroff writes.\nHe credits “internet rumors” with fueling heightened interest in Sidewalk Labs’ urban experiment. Indeed, the rumor mill has been churning about a mythical “Google Island” since even before the company spun-off Sidewalk Labs as its smart city incubator . This led to speculation that Sidewalk Labs was looking to purchase land on which to build a planned community that could house thousands of people. But in his essay, Doctoroff dismissed the idea of a walled-off district separated from the wider city. \n“Whatever we do, we know the world doesn’t need another plan that falls into the same trap as previous ones: treating the city as a high-tech island rather than a place that reflects the personality of its local population,” he said. \n\nPhoto by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for New York Times Doctoroff says Sidewalk Labs is currently speaking with mayors and community leaders around the country about this project. “We might even hold a competition or challenge to motivate broader participation among mayors and local leaders,” he added. That suggests that Sidewalk Labs will soon begin to accept bids from cities interested in hosting the company’s ambitious experiments. \n“There are no magical fixes to tough urban problems.” He also cautioned against seeing this experiment as a silver bullet for the problems of urban living. “There are no magical fixes to tough urban problems,” he says. “Anything we try will require lots of discussion, refinement, and adaptation.”\nIn addition to its city-within-a-city, Sidewalk Labs will also set up “eight or nine” labs within the next six months to churn out products focused on improving transportation, health care delivery, housing affordability, and Internet connectivity in cities. “Led by entrepreneurs-in-residence, these labs will consist of hyper-focused, cross-disciplinary teams of policy experts, engineers, product managers, and designers — a full range of urbanists and technologists,” Doctoroff says. \nNo word on where those labs will be located, but Doctoroff says he hopes they will eventually spin out their own companies, thus creating a network of tiny Sidewalk Labs clones all over the country.",

      "title": "Google Doodle: Why should we know about Jagadish Chandra Bose?",
      "text": "To celebrate a pioneer of radio, botany, and even Bengali science fiction, Google is featuring a doodle of Jagadish Chandra Bose on what would be the polymath’s 158th birthday.\nThe doodle illustration, showing Dr. Bose with the crescograph instrument he invented to measure plant growth and movement, shows up on the Google home page for users in several countries including the United States, France, Japan, and, of course, India – Bose’s home country (although his birthplace is in modern-day Bangladesh).\nA Google Doodle is a celebration of interesting events and anniversaries \" that reflect Google’s personality and love for innovation .\" The first doodle ever publicly featured on the Google home page was a depiction of Bastille Day.\nRecommended: 10 futuristic ideas from the Pentagon It’s easy to see why Google would commemorate a Renaissance man like Bose, too.\n10 futuristic ideas from the Pentagon Bose laid the groundwork for our understanding of plant empathy. He used the crescograph instrument he invented to magnify plants by 10,000 times. In doing so, he measured plant growth and movement with extraordinary accuracy, revealing that plants’ growth changes according to different stimuli.\nPleasant sounds, he found, encouraged growth, while harsh ones stunted it. He argued that this proved that plants , like humans, possessed a nervous system. He went on to test how plant tissues react to seasonal changes, chemical inhibitors, and temperature variations – all to prove they “ feel pain and understand affection ,” according to the British online newspaper The Independent. That idea – that plants feel, breathe, and reproduce much like humans – is now taught in middle school, as Quartz writes.\nWhile Bose is best known for his work in biophysics, he is also considered a father of the radio. In 1895, he demonstrated the science of electromagnetic waves. In a public demonstration in Calcutta (now Kolkata), he sent electromagnetic waves across 75 feet and through a wall to remotely ring a bell and explode gunpowder , according to India Today.\nHe also invented the Mercury Coherer , a radio wave receiver that was used by Guglielmo Marconi to build an operational two-way radio. While the Italian inventor was recognized for his two-way radio, Bose remained relatively unknown because he reluctant to patent his inventions.\nMuch like Anton Chekhov in Russia, Bose was in the vanguard of literature in his native India. Bose is considered to be the patriarch of Bengali science fiction. In one of his books, “ Palatak Toofan ,” he described how a bottle of hair oil could quell a cyclone.\nBose, who died at the age of 78, received a lasting tribute several decades ago: a small crater on the moon is named after him. The Bose Crater, 56 miles in diameter, is located on the far side of the moon.",

      "text": " Google+\nJim Davis/Globe staff\nMany residents of Cambridge spoke in favor of being a “sanctuary city” during a City Council meeting last week.\nBy Maria Sacchetti Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nBulletproof vests for 20 Lawrence police officers. Sidewalk ramps for wheelchair users in Northampton. Fuel aid for struggling Cambridge residents this winter.\nCity officials across Massachusetts say these are the types of services that would be affected if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his threat to cut millions in federal dollars from cities that limit their cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nAdvertisement\n“He’s going to have to hurt a lot of people to make a political point,” said Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera, whose mostly Latino city receives $36 million a year in federal funding, in addition to a budget of $260 million. “And his time would be better spent fixing immigration. Which is what everybody wants him to do.”\nOn the campaign trail, Trump criticized cities and towns that refuse to turn over unauthorized immigrants they arrest for any crime to ICE. Trump calls them “sanctuary cities” and says they obstruct immigration enforcement. Federal officials have said there are more than 200 municipalities, including Boston and about nine others in Massachusetts, that refuse to cooperate with ICE in some way.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here City officials say having local police help enforce federal laws on immigration could frighten immigrants or lead to racial profiling. Policies vary by city and town, but several have passed ordinances or executive orders in recent years saying the police may only turn over immigrants to ICE if they have serious criminal records or outstanding criminal warrants.\nTrump’s threat has mayors poring over their budgets, including in Boston, which receives over $250 million in federal funding each year. While federal dollars are often a small fraction of their budgets, city officials say the money pays for fire trucks, police cruisers, special education, and other significant items.\nIn Northampton, Mayor David Narkewicz said part of the city’s $3.3 million a year in federal funding pays for vital home repairs for the elderly and others who cannot afford them. In Somerville, the $6 million a year funds drug treatment programs, school lunches, and other services.\nAdvertisement\nIn Holyoke, Mayor Alex Morse said his city’s $1.5 million a year in federal aid helped pay for a commercial kitchen at a food pantry that trains unemployed people to work in the food industry. Morse said 85 percent of the enrollees, including homeless people and former inmates, have found jobs. He called Trump’s plan “counterproductive” and said cities would fight it in court.\n“We’re talking about cities the size of Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco,” Morse said. “Millions and millions of Americans live in these communities and the thought of a president with a stroke of his pen taking billions of dollars away. ... I can’t fathom that happening.\n“But it’s Donald Trump,” he added, “so you never know.”\nIn denouncing sanctuary cities on the campaign trail, Trump often invoked the case of Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot last year in San Francisco allegedly by a felon from Mexico who had been released by the county sheriff without notifying ICE. The man’s trial starts next year.\n“If the local politicians simply said ‘OK, we will comply with federal law,’ then they wouldn’t have this issue,” said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which backs restrictions on immigration.\nBut officials from Boston to Northampton vowed to remain steadfast, saying they are concerned that local police do not have the authority to detain someone for a civil immigration violation.\n“At this point, I have no plans to rescind the order,” said Narkewicz, the Northampton mayor.\nOthers are not so sure. The Brockton City Council is considering limiting police cooperation with immigration officials, but some residents have expressed concern about losing federal funds.\nTrump’s rhetoric has created widespread confusion over what the term “sanctuary city” means — and there is no official definition in federal law, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump’s transition team did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but his platform defines sanctuary cities as those that refuse to cooperate with ICE.\nSanctuary cities have evolved over the years. Some trace their roots to the 1980s, when advocates and churches shielded immigrants from deportation to war-ravaged nations in Central America. Others followed workplace raids.\nAnd some cities never made that declaration but were dubbed sanctuaries more recently because they passed ordinances such as the Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local police and ICE.\nLocal officials cannot block immigration agents from their cities and towns, but some have gradually made it more difficult for ICE to carry out its work.\nCambridge has redefined its sanctuary status several times since 1985. when it protected people from El Salvador, Haiti, and other nations from deportation, said Alice Wolf, the former city councilor who led the effort. The city renewed its status in 2006 and again in 2014, when it restricted police cooperation with ICE.\nCambridge reaffirmed its sanctuary status again last week at the City Council meeting.\n“It’s not a matter of money; it’s a matter of principle,” said city councilor Nadeem Mazen, the city’s first Muslim councilor and a supporter of the measure. “I don’t think there’s anyone saying that we would take any dollar value in exchange for the values of diversity, safety, and egalitarianism in this city.”\nMeanwhile, other cities were unsure if they were sanctuaries.\nSpringfield is listed as a sanctuary city by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors immigration restrictions. But the mayor insists that Springfield cooperates with immigration officials.\n“I don’t think we should lose a dime,” said Mayor Domenic Sarno, a Democrat who said his city receives millions of federal dollars. “I’d like to actually get more money.”\nThe center says Amherst, Boston, Cambridge, Hampden County, Holyoke, Lawrence, Northampton, Somerville, and Springfield are sanctuary cities. Chelsea, however, also calls itself a sanctuary city. Amherst did not respond to a request for comment.\nMaria Sacchetti can be reached at maria.sacchetti@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAndrew Harnik/AP\nFirst lady Michelle Obama.\nAP November 30, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has tamped down any speculation that first lady Michelle Obama may one day run for office herself.\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner conducted the day after the presidential election earlier this month, Obama said, ‘‘Michelle will never run for office.’’\nAdvertisement\nHe added, ‘‘She is as talented a person as I know. You can see the incredible resonance she has with the American people. But I joke that she’s too sensible to want to be in politics.’’\nObama also said in the interview published online Tuesday that once he leaves office in January, he and his wife will ‘‘continue to be very active’’ on their belief that ‘‘when you work with people on the ground at a grassroots level, change happens.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi.\nBy Erica Werner AP Congressional Correspondent November 30, 2016\nWASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats re-elected Nancy Pelosi as their leader on Wednesday despite disenchantment among some in the caucus over the party’s disappointing performance in elections earlier this month.\nThe California lawmaker, who has led the party since 2002, turned back a challenge from Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. The secret ballot vote was 134-63.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘We need the very best to lead us,’’ Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Democrats in nominating Pelosi. ‘‘No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi.’’\nThe 76-year-old California Democrat was forced to promise changes to the caucus to answer complaints from lawmakers fed up with being shut out of the upper ranks of leadership, especially in the wake of a devastating election that installed a GOP monopoly over Congress and the White House.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here A half-dozen Democrats delivered testimonials to Pelosi in nominating speeches, but the disenchantment was evident.\n‘‘I think Tim Ryan would be a great leader. He’s a new generation and I think he would appeal to a lot of millennials and young people in this country,’’ Rep. Steve Lynch, D-Mass., said as he headed into the session. ‘‘He brings a certain excitement and also a bit of common sense from Youngstown, Ohio.’’\n‘‘Our base is working people and we've got to talk about that. We've got to tell working people in this country that we care about them,’’ Lynch said.\nAdvertisement\nLeadership elections were originally scheduled to be held before Thanksgiving but were delayed to give Democrats more time to discuss and process the election results and consider a path forward. Many are discouraged after losing the White House and making smaller than expected gains in both chambers of Congress.\n‘‘I believe we must do more than simply paper over the cracks,’’ said Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, one of a handful of House Democrats to endorse Ryan. ‘‘We can’t just say the right things — we must take concrete steps to move our party in the right direction.’’\nNonetheless Pelosi projected confidence heading into the vote. Known for her vote-counting skills, the Californian asserted she had support of two-thirds of Democrats locked up.\n‘‘Leader Pelosi is honored to receive the overwhelming support of her colleagues,’’ said spokesman Drew Hammill. ‘‘That so many members are so enthusiastic and eager to take active roles in the caucus is music to her ears.’’\nOther top leadership posts are uncontested, with Steny Hoyer of Maryland in the No. 2 job of whip, and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina in the No. 3 position of assistant leader. The position of conference chairman is term-limited, and Xavier Becerra of California was replaced by Joe Crowley of New York.\nOn the eve of the House leadership elections, 85-year-old Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he will not seek re-election to the panel post, clearing the way for a younger lawmaker to move into the spot on the powerful committee. Becerra and Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts told House Democrats they are interested in the position.\nRepublicans are on track to hold at least 240 seats in the House next year. Democrats, who had high hopes of significant gains in the election, picked up just six seats on Election Day earlier this month and remain in the minority with 194 seats.\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Teresa Hanafin Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nThe Fast Forward e-mail newsletter has the news that you need to launch your day. Sign up here .\nHere’s some news and information as you rev up for the day.\nWhat’s it like outside? Still pretty warm, but cloudy in the morning and rainy in the afternoon and all night. Getting a little tired of this act.\nAdvertisement\nWhile you were sleeping: What weather watchers think was a tornado killed three people in Alabama overnight ... A firefighter was injured and several homes were destroyed by fire in Lawrence ... There’s a huge water main break downtown that’s flooding the intersection of Washington and Kneeland streets in Chinatown ... More than 160 unhappy Southwest Airlines passengers are still cooling their heels at Logan after their flight from Baltimore to Albany was diverted because of fog , saying the airline provided no information about alternative flights ... A Saudi prince is calling for women in the ultraconservative Islamic nation to be allowed to drive .\nHey, sport: The Celtics hope to beat the Pistons for the second time this season at TD Garden at 7:30 tonight (CSNHD and 98.5 FM). The Bruins fell to the Flyers in a shootout last night, 3-2.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Under fire for maintaining ties to his global business empire even as he prepared to become president, Donald Trump announced this morning that he will leave his company , presumably turning everything over to his kids. He’ll hold a press conference Dec. 15 after the lawyers figure everything out.\nHarvard students and community groups were all geared up to rally outside the Kennedy School at Harvard today in protest of an appearance there by Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist who promotes racist and anti-Semitic views on his website Breitbart. Alas, he has canceled his attendance at a conference featuring campaign managers that starts today, but protesters said they still would rally against the school’s invitation to Bannon, which they said helps to normalize what should be condemned. Kellyanne Conway is scheduled to be on a panel tomorrow.\nNot sure who Trump is interviewing today, but chameleon Mitt Romney emerged from a dinner with Trump last night praising the president-elect, leading some to speculate that his groveling is a prerequisite for landing the secretary of state job. Trump is expected to make it official today that he is nominating Wall Street insider Steven Mnuchin for Treasury and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce .\nAdvertisement\nThe CDC released data today that shows that far fewer families are struggling to pay medical bills, STAT reports. Five years ago, 21 percent of people under age 65 were in families having a tough time paying for health care; today that’s 16 percent. About 29 percent of families without insurance have problems paying those bills.\nStaying in the medical realm, did you ever wonder who decides on those recommendations we try to follow, such as how often to get colonoscopies and when to take statins? Well, there’s a panel of 16 experts called the US Preventative Services Task Force that comes up with those recommendations. Predictably, not all medical specialists agree with their guidelines, and today those differences will be aired -- including the debate over PSA tests for prostate cancer -- at a US House hearing.\nSpeaking of the House, it’s scheduled to vote today on the 21st Century Cures Act , legislation designed to speed federal approval of new drugs and medical devices and boost funding of medical research. But US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have condemned the bill , arguing that it fails to deal with sky-high prescription medicine prices and is basically a handout to pharmaceutical companies.\nBrazil is beside itself with grief over the deaths of nearly the entire Chapecoense soccer team in a plane crash in Colombia late Monday night on its way to a championship tournament. The team was living a Cinderella story of success as it improbably rose through the ranks of Brazilian soccer and garnered devoted fans across the country. Three players, two crew members, and a journalist survived.\nGovernor Charlie Baker is in D.C. today: He has a meeting at the Pentagon to discuss the state’s military bases , then chats with the CEO of Amtrak. He wraps up his visit by accepting Governing Magazine’s Public Official of the Year award , one of eight honorees this year.\nIt’s opening night of the monthlong Boston Holiday Pops , with something for everyone, including seven kids’ matinees, screenings of “Back to the Future” with orchestral accompaniment, and more.\nThe winner of the Ode to Tom Brady Limerick Contest is Natalie Brennan, whose simple poem succinctly told the story of the QB’s career:\nThere once was a QB named Brady\nWho led the Patriots to their heyday\nBut opponents got mad\nWhen their results were bad\nSo now they just claim that he’s shady\nNatalie, sorry I still haven’t found out how much of a gift card I can give you, but please email me again at teresa.hanafin@globe.com with your home address. As for the rest of you, the choice wasn’t easy! Some other excellent entries:\nBurlington Mall Frank:\nWe have a fine Quarterback in Tom Brady,\nWhose skills and awards are quite weighty,\nBut recent injuries are mean,\nThat keep his team lean,\nAnd vexes each local man and lady.\nSid McDonough:\nThere once was a fellow named Tom,\nWho sometimes threw a long bomb,\nThey were seldom deflected,\nHe often connected,\nAnd greeted success with aplomb.\nDemetri Rizos of Danvers:\nBrady gives pause for elation\nWe even had 4 celebrations!\nWith Gisele by his side,\nWhat a beautiful bride,\nBut please, let’s halt the deflation!\nMore tomorrow and Friday.\nFinally, it’s National Mousse Day. I was going to give myself a new ‘do until I realized it’s the creamy, foamy dessert that’s being celebrated. Grab a cup at lunch if you can.\niStock\nIt’s National Mousse Day. Don’t rub it in your hair.\nThanks for reading. If you’re so inclined, please follow me on Twitter: I’m @BostonTeresa .

      "title": "Harvard study: Odds of Boston cyclists being injured in accidents have decreased",
      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe staff\nA bicyclist was silhouetted as he passed by a display of artwork in Boston last year.\nBy Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nThe odds of cyclists being injured in an accident in Boston have decreased significantly in recent years as the city has made a slew of changes to promote bike riding and improve safety, a new study from Harvard University researchers has found.\nThe study , published in the December issue of the American Journal of Public Health, found that there was a 14 percent reduction in the odds of being injured in a cycling accident for each year from 2009 through 2012.\nAdvertisement\nThe study’s lead author, Felipe Pedroso, said the reduced injury risk came as Boston made a host of changes, including dramatically expanding bike lane mileage citywide, installing more signage, improving crosswalks, and rolling out the Hubway bike share program in 2011.\nThe study shows that “improvements in infrastructure result in increases in safety,” Pedroso said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Pedroso said the increased ridership that has come with the safety improvements has made biking even safer.\nView Story In a region that can be perilous for cyclists, fellow riders share tips for beginners For many, Amanda Phillips’ death served as another reminder of the dangers of biking in Boston.\nBoston accidents have claimed 14 cyclists in 5 years Biking to work increasingly popular in Boston, census shows With crash data, Boston tries to make bicycling safer\n“There is a concept of safety in numbers that several studies have evaluated and we touched upon briefly,” said Pedroso. “The concept is based on the fact that with increased number of bicycle riders there is increased cyclist awareness by vehicles. This improved awareness results in reductions in vehicle-cyclist accidents.”\nThe study Pedroso and his team conducted relied on a database of about 1,800 cycling accidents that were reported to city police between 2009 and 2012.\nAdvertisement\nThe overall number of cycling accidents in Boston increased during the years the study focused on. There were 358 accidents in 2009, compared with 488 in 2012.\nBut at the same time, bike use became much more popular in Boston.\nWhen compared with the increased number of commuters biking to work, there was no statistically significant change in the accident rate, and there was actually a decrease in the rate of accidents where cyclists were injured.\nIn an editorial in the same issue of the journal advocating for infrastructure improvements to improve cycling safety, the journal provided statistics showing how growth in bike lane networks in a number of other cities has led to reduced crash, injury, and fatality rates. The editorial pointed to places including Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco, Portland, and Washington, D.C.\nIt has been suggested before that the growth in popularity of cycling has significantly outpaced increases in accident numbers. But Pedroso said he believes the analysis by him and his team is the first attempt to quantify the reduced injury risk in Boston.\nBoston Transportation Department Commissioner Gina Fiandaca said the study’s results were a testament to the many efforts the city has made to improve cycling safety.\n“Over the last several years, we’ve really taken some concrete measures to improve cycling safety,” she said.\nShe cited infrastructure improvements, including painting bike lanes on roadways, building physically separated tracks for cyclists, and requiring the installation of protective side guards on large city-contracted vehicles to prevent bikers from being caught underneath.\nFiandaca also said the city has offered safety-focused training programs in recent years and expects to soon secure final approval to lower the new default speed limit for Boston from 30 miles per hour to 25.\nStefanie Seskin, Boston’s active transportation director, said the city also has redesigned some streets to encourage motorists to drive more slowly. And, she said the city regularly monitors accident data to identify and address spots in the city with above-average crash rates.\n“Any small change we can make to make our streets safer for everyone — we try to take those steps whenever possible,” Seskin said.\nTo be sure, while injury risks may have decreased, cyclists have suffered serious, deadly injuries in recent years. In fact, as the Globe has reported , a 2014 study found Boston had more cycling fatalities per 10,000 bike commuters than Denver, Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.\nPedroso’s study produced other interesting findings about cycling safety in Boston, including:\n■ The odds of being injured while riding a bike on a main road — which are more likely to have bike lanes — are about 37 percent lower than riding on other roads.\n■ ■ The odds of cyclists being injured in auto-related accidents are 76 percent higher than in other types of accidents.\n■ The odds of injury in accidents involving car doors are 225 percent higher than other types of accidents. “This is an interesting finding because it shows that if we expanded on strategies that separated bicycles from cars that we may have a significant impact on overall injuries,” Pedroso said.\n■ For every one degree Celsius increase in temperature, the odds of being injured in an accident increase by about 2 percent. “This makes sense given that there are more cyclists out during warmer temperatures,” Pedroso said.\n■ The odds of injury were about 15 percent lower at intersections. Pedroso said that may be because intersections, by nature, force drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians to be particularly alert. And there have been safety-related infrastructure improvements at intersections in recent years.\n■ A cyclist’s age, gender, race, and ethnicity had no statistically significant impact on the odds of injury.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Laura Crimaldi Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nThe Massachusetts chapter of a Muslim civil rights organization asked Wednesday for more police protection at area mosques after an Islamic center in Rhode Island received a letter calling Muslims “vile and filthy people” and declaring that President-elect Donald J. Trump will target them.\nThe request from the local branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the letter mailed to Masjid Al-Kareem in Providence, R.I. should be investigated.\nAdvertisement\n“This act of hate campaign targeting a New England house of worship must be investigated by state and federal law enforcement authorities, and our state’s leaders should speak out against the growing anti-Muslim bigotry that inevitably leads to such incidents,” John Robbins, executive director of the group, said in a statement.\nThe organization said the letter was addressed to “Children of Satan” and urged them to “pack your bags and get out of dodge.” The writer also cited Trump, saying he will “cleanse America and make it shine again” in moves that will start with Muslims, the group said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here “This is a great time for patriotic Americans,” the letter read. “Long live President Trump and God bless the U.S.A.”\nMosques in other states have received the same letter, according to the group.\nThe council’s national office said more than 100 anti-Muslim incidents have occurred since the Nov. 8 election. During the same time period, there have been more than 700 incidents targeting other minority groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nLaura Crimaldi can be reached at laura.crimaldi@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nDavid Goldman/AP/file 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Julie Pace and Laurie Kellman Associated Press November 30, 2016\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he’s leaving his business empire to focus on being the nation’s 45th president, declaring he can successfully avoid conflicts of interest between governing and profiting in the private sector.\n‘‘I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make America great again,’’ he tweeted in a series of missives sent before dawn. ‘‘While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.’’\nI will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ...\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to ....\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses..\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016 Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016\nAdvertisement\nTrump did not provide any details about how he planned to separate from his businesses, though he said legal documents were being prepared. He has previously said that he'd leave his business operations to his three eldest children — Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka.\nEthics experts have pushed for Trump to fully exit the ownership of his businesses using a blind trust or equivalent arrangement.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

Bush, said in a joint statement Wednesday.\nView Story Horowitz: President or businessman One big reason Americans generally insist on seeing candidates’ taxes is so they can rule out even the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nTrump was also moving forward with his Cabinet selections, choosing former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary.\nMnuchin, 53, led Trump’s finance operations during the presidential campaign. But he has no government experience, which could prove a political hurdle. If confirmed by the Senate, Mnuchin would play a central role in shaping Trump’s tax policies and infrastructure plans. He would also lead an agency tasked with implementing international economic sanctions.\nAdvertisement\nArriving at Trump Tower Wednesday morning for meetings, Mnuchin said the administration planned ‘‘the most significant middle income tax cut since Reagan.’’ He also called for lowering corporate taxes to encourage companies to stay in the United States.\nTrump was accompanying his decision to line his Cabinet with financial industry insiders with an announcement that the air conditioning giant Carrier Corp. planned to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the outgoing Indiana governor, planned an event with Carrier officials Thursday to announce the plan.\nDetails of the agreement were unclear. Trump spent much of his campaign pledging to keep companies like Carrier from moving jobs overseas, relying on the skills he used in business.\nTrump’s sprawling business empire is unprecedented for a sitting president, as is the complexity and opaqueness of his financial holdings. He refused to release his taxes during the campaign, citing an ongoing audit, and will be under no legal obligation to do so in the White House.\nTrump owns golf clubs, office towers and other properties in several countries. He holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies. He has struck licensing deals for use of his name on hotels and other buildings around the world and has been landing new business in the Middle East, India and South America.\nReince Priebus, Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, was vague Wednesday in describing how the president-elect planned to separate himself from his businesses, saying ‘‘that'll all be worked out.’’\nPriebus told MSNBC’s ‘‘Morning Joe,’’ that Trump has ‘‘got the best people in America working on it.’’ Priebus demurred when asked if Trump planned to put his businesses in a blind trust — as presidents have traditionally done — or leave them in his children’s hands.\n‘‘I'm not ready to reveal that really,’’ Priebus said.\nPriebus added that Trump’s business acumen and the many interests he has as a result of it are ‘‘nothing to be ashamed about.’’ He said the country hasn’t seen a president with such business holdings before and the rules and regulations ‘‘don’t contemplate this scenario.’’\nRelated Elizabeth Warren asks federal agency to review Donald Trump’s ‘chaotic’ transition Horowitz: President or businessman\nAP writers Julie Bykowicz and Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Interactive map let’s cyclists report drivers parked in bike lanes",
      "text": " Google+\nscreen capture\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nIt’s a problem that many Boston-area cyclists face almost every day: As commuters are pedaling along, a vehicle illegally parked in a designated bike lane suddenly confronts them.\nAlexander Frieden, who commutes from Somerville to the Longwood Medical Center area each morning, said these obstacles pose a potentially deadly hazard. When a car obstructs a cyclist’s path, he said, the person is forced to merge into the busy roadway, where motorists are traveling at much higher speeds.\nAdvertisement\n“When you have to pull out into 40 mile-per-hour traffic from traveling at 15 miles per hour, you can get hit,” he said. “You risk your life.”\nTo draw attention to the issue, Frieden rolled out a collaborative online tool this week where cyclists can submit photographs of cars and trucks parked in bikes lanes, and pinpoint the locations of the vehicles on an interactive map. The purpose of the project is to both draw attention to problem areas for bike commuters, and inform city planners in Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, and Brookline about spots where bicycle infrastructure could be greatly improved.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here “Very quickly, you can see where there are issues,” said Frieden, a bioinformatics group leader at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “I wanted, personally, something that people could see, and say, ‘Here are the dangerous parts where we need protected infrastructure.’”\nThe website, carsinbikelanesboston.com , is an offshoot of a project first launched by a Nathan Rosenquist, a cyclist from New York City . Frieden said Rosenquist left the source code for his project open, on Github , making it easy to adapt and get a version for the Greater Boston area up-and-running smoothly.\n“I went through a month-long process … trying to debug what wasn’t working and what was working,” he said, adding that he worked with Rosenquist remotely. “We got it working and launched it and have had a number of submissions.”\nAdvertisement\nSince Monday, at least six people have added input to the project, he said. Users can go on the website, hit “submit,” and then add an image, the vehicle’s plate number, its precise location, and the date and time the driver was parked in the bike lane.\nSo far, three of the photographs featured on the website show large delivery trucks pulled to the side of the road, blocking a lane. Frieden said this is common — especially in the morning — as truck drivers struggle to find a place to pull over when unloading deliveries.\nIn Boston, drivers are not allowed to stop or park in a bike lane, and can get a parking ticket for doing so, according to the city’s website. Cambridge also doles out violations for obstructing the lanes.\nThe project comes as cities in the region add bike infrastructure to roadways. In Boston, city officials recently touted improvements such as painting new bike lanes, and building physically separated tracks for cyclists. Somerville has been adding “sharrows” — a shared-lane marking — and repainting bike lanes along busy thoroughfares. And in Cambridge, officials have taken steps to protect those most vulnerable on the streets.\nWhile some have said the project is a way to “shame” drivers , Frieden sees it as a method of working more collaboratively with city planners and drivers.\n“It’s not to shame drivers, it’s meant to get accurate information,” he said. “Although some people might use it for shaming drivers, my intent is to make sure this is an opportunity to learn what we could do better.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nRyan Anson/AFP/Getty Images\nUsers can now download Netflix programming and watch it later, while offline.\nBy Lucas Shaw Bloomberg November 30, 2016\nNetflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world’s largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as “The Crown” and “Orange is the New Black” at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com Inc. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, in a web post.",

      "text": "  \nGoogle today announced the launch of App Maker , the newest entry in the low-code, drag-and-drop app building market. Like its competitors from Microsoft and numerous startups, App Maker promises to make it easy for anybody to quickly develop basic apps that serve a very specific purpose inside an organization. \nThe new service features a cloud-based drag-and-drop development environment that lets you build the user interface and populate it with data from your G Suite applications, Google Maps, Contacts and Groups and virtually any service that offers an API. These applications then run on the same infrastructure on which Google’s own G Suite apps run, and IT admins can also manage them in exactly the same way as Gmail, Drive and other G Suite applications. \nThe typical use case for these kind of apps are time-tracking solutions, or tracking orders and inventory — essentially any problem inside a company that can be easily digitized and solved by a very basic custom app. \nThe advantage here, Google argues, is that users won’t have to worry about any of the underlying infrastructure (the buzzword here is “serverless”) and that it allows them to develop apps that solve their very specific needs without the need to bring on a developer. Users who want to delve deeper, though, can also do so thanks to the built-in scripting editor, which — from the looks of it — feels like a pretty fully featured IDE. \nApp Maker is now available through Google’s Early Adopter Program for G Suite Business . \nIn addition to the App Maker announcement, Google also today announced that it is adding a few new enterprise applications to its “Recommended for G Suite” program. This program certifies that an application is well-integrated into G Suite and that it has been tested for security vulnerabilities. The new partners the company announced today are Virtru, LumApps, DocuSign, Freshdesk, Zoho Invoice, Xero and Asana. 0",

      "text": "Hackers have in a matter of months compromised more than 1 million Google accounts as part of a lucrative fraudulent advertising scheme involving malicious app downloads, according to a new report by Check Point Software Technologies chkp , an Israeli cybersecurity firm.\nPeople’s devices became infected after they installed innocent-looking, albeit booby-trapped software from app stores outside Google’s goog authorized Play store. The malware took complete control of their devices at the root, or deepest level, stealing tokens that Google cloud services--such as Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Docs--use to authenticate users.\nSince August, the fraudsters made off with 1.3 million tokens with an average of 13,000 new phone infections per day, Check Point researchers found. The attackers reportedly used their foothold in the devices to install additional apps and ad software as well as to post fake reviews and ratings--all to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in bogus ad revenue per month.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \n“They were able to get to the lowest level of the Android operating system where there are no limitations on what the malware can do, and then they went after these account files,” said Michael Shaulov, head of mobile products at Check Point, referencing the million-plus stolen Google account credentials. “It’s probably the biggest ever security breach of Google accounts.”\nShaulov’s team discovered the extent of the security breach after a strange piece of malware tripped an alert in Check Point’s mobile security product a month ago, he said. The team then began working working with Google to investigate the incident.\nDespite having pilfered a vast cache of Google account credentials, the hackers did not appear to access data on Google services other than the Play store, Google said.\nRead more: “Millions of Android Devices Were Infected by a Chinese Advertising Firm” \n“We used automated tools to look for signs of other fraudulent activity within the affected Google accounts,” wrote Adrian Ludwig, director of Android security at Google, in a Google Plus blog post addressing the compromise. “None were found.”\nThe attackers, in other words, could have used the credentials to pore over people’s email messages, or to hold people’s photo libraries for ransom. Instead, they appear to have stuck to ad fraud.\nFor more on advertising, watch: \nThe malicious software, dubbed “Gooligan,” belongs to a family of malware called “Ghost Push,” which Google has been tracking for two years, Ludwig said. Google discovered more than 40,000 apps related to the scam last year, the company noted in a recent security report .\nCheck Point researchers have found 86 apps infected with the malware bearing innocuous names like “Wifi Master,” “Light Browser,” and “Flashlight Free.” About three-quarters of all Android devices on the market today are vulnerable, specifically those running operating system versions 4 through 5, dubbed Jelly Bean (4.1 to 4.3.1), KitKat (4.4 to 4.4.4), Lollipop (5.0 to 5.1.1), Check Point said.\nCheck Point recommended in a blog post that people who suspect their devices may have been compromised (seen unusual pop-up ads on your phone lately?) should check to see whether their account has been breached by entering their email addresses at the following website: https://gooligan.checkpoint.com/ .\nCheck Point further recommended that victims reinstall the operating system on their phones, hiring a technician to “flash” the device’s memory, since a standard factory reboot is not enough to remediate the issue. Immediately following that, customers should change their Google passwords, the company said.\nGoogle, for its part, recommended that customers download the latest Android software updates and stay away from unauthorized app stores to prevent future compromises. The company said it is working to take down the attackers’ infrastructure, to eliminate malicious apps from its stores, and to resecure customers’ compromised accounts.\nAsked who was behind the campaign, Check Point’s Shaulov said he hoped to be able to share an attribution in a week’s time. “Right now we understand who we believe is involved, but we want to nail down who exactly is behind this,” he said.",

Credit: Michael Kan IT security: 3 things you need to know now \nA new Android malware has managed to steal access to more than 1 million Google accounts, and it continues to infect new devices, according to security firm Checkpoint. \n“We believe that it is the largest Google account breach to date,” the security firm said in Wednesday blog post . \nThe malware, called Gooligan, has been preying on devices running older versions of Android, from 4.1 to 5.1, which are still used widely, especially in Asia. \nGooligan masquerades as legitimate-looking Android apps. Checkpoint has found 86 titles, many of which are offered on third-party app stores, that contain the malicious coding. \nOnce Gooligan is installed, it attempts to root the device, as a way to gain full control. The malware does this by exploiting well-known vulnerabilities in older versions of Android. \n“These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user,” Checkpoint said. Checkpoint \nGooligan will then go on to steal the user's Google authorization tokens, giving the malware access to Gmail, Google Play, and other related services. \nOf the 1 million Google accounts breached, 19 percent were based in the Americas, 9 percent in Europe, while 57 percent were in Asia, according to Checkpoint. \nBy gaining access to users' Google accounts, the malware is likely attempting to generate revenue for its creators. It does this by installing apps promoted by legitimate advertising networks, and then writing positive reviews for them on Google Play. \n“An attacker is paid by the network when one of these apps is installed successfully,” Checkpoint said. \nSecurity researchers first noticed an earlier version of Gooligan last year, when it appeared in the malicious SnapPea app . It wasn’t until this past summer that the malware reappeared with upgraded processes. \nCheckpoint has published a website that lets users check if their Google account was breached by Gooligan. \nSecurity experts also caution users should avoid downloading apps from third-party app stores. This is because these stores often do little to verify that the apps offered are safe for use. \nThe creators of Gooligan are also spreading the malware by sending SMS text messages to unsuspecting victims containing links to download apps carrying the harmful coding. \nGoogle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But Checkpoint said that Google is investigating the matter and revoking authentication tokens that were stolen by the malware.  ",

      "text": "Google is working hard to convince big companies to adopt G Suite, the collection of web-based productivity software formerly known as Google Apps . And big companies typically need at least a few tools that are very specific to their business—the sort of stuff that Google is never going to create.\nWhich brings us to App Maker , the new offering that Google is rolling out as part of G Suite for Business, at first for customers who are part of its early-adopter program. It&apos;s a browser-based platform for building browser-based corporate apps for internal use. And though it has an emphasis on approachable features such as drag-and-drop widgets you can use to rapidly assemble features without writing code, Google has also aimed to give it enough power to tackle fairly meaty development challenges as well as basic ones. \nApp Maker is based on functionality that Google has used to efficiently build more than 300 apps for its own use. \"For the last year or so, we&apos;ve been polishing it and making it customer-hardened and enterprise-ready,\" says G Suite VP of engineering Elissa Murphy.\nIf all you want to do is slap together something simple such as an app to collect information from employees, you can create a spreadsheet-like database that gets stored in Google Drive, then pull together an interface with canned elements such as text fields, pop-up calendars, star ratings, and Google Maps views. For more advanced projects, serious coders can take advantage of SQL databases, scripting, and standards such as JQuery, and can hook App Maker creations into Google Analytics.\nThere are already plenty of services out there with a similar emphasis on speeding up software development and minimizing the need for code—notably Microsoft&apos;s PowerApps, which was announced in 2015 and recently reached general availability . App Maker tries to distinguish itself by supporting existing technologies and extensibility rather than being purely self-contained. \"This takes a bit more of an open approach to allowing developers to use the skills they know,\" says Murphy.\nOne of the attractions of App Maker is that the apps you whip up run on the same infrastructure as the rest of G Suite, which means that a company doesn&apos;t have to worry about them choking: \"As your application scales to hundreds or thousands of users, that&apos;s taken care for you,\" says App Maker product manager Ajay Surie. For now, the tool is designed to build apps for use within a company, but Surie says that Google might evolve it into something that can host services on the open web if there&apos;s a demand for that capability.\nA guest check-in app created using App Maker by PwC , which has been testing the service Beyond G Suite Another thing about big companies: They like to feel confident that the services they use will work well together. With that in mind, Google is also announcing some new \"recommended\" third-party apps , a stamp of approval that means they integrate smoothly with the G Suite apps. The newcomers include Asana, Docusign, Freshdesk, LumApps, Virtru, Xero, and Zoho Invoice, which join existing recommended apps such as RingCentral and Smartsheet.\nIn picking these products, Murphy says, \"We asked ourselves, what are the categories of products we&apos;re not likely to fill, but we know customers are using?\" For a company that&apos;s already using Asana for project management or Xero for accounting, the fact that these services have partnered up with Google might be one more reason to give G Suite a try.",

      "text": "share Android malware skews Google Play ratings by installing apps You're probably safe if you have a recent phone, but there have been over 1 million infections so far. Save Reuters/Dado Ruvic \nMalware writers haven't stopped trying to game app rankings through bogus app installs . Researchers at Check Point have identified a new strain of the longstanding Ghost Push malware, Googlian, that has infected over 1 million Android devices to date and continues to grow (about 13,000 new infections per day). As with earlier code, attackers trick you into installing a Googlian-based app through either a third-party app store or a phishing scam. Once it's on your phone, the software takes advantage of Linux kernel exploits to access your Google authorization token and install fraudulent apps, whether to boost their Google Play rankings or to generate money through ads. \nYou're probably safe. Google fixed the vulnerability in Android 6.0 Marshmallow and beyond, and you're unlikely to run into one of the malicious apps if you stick to downloading from Google Play. Also, Google observes that the apps aren't harvesting data or committing fraud beyond the Google Play ratings. If you're concerned, you can use a web tool from Check Point to verify whether or not Googlian has abused your account. \nThe concern, as is frequently the case with Android malware, is that many people will remain at risk . As of this story, Google reports that only 24.3 percent of users it tracks are running sufficiently up to date versions of Android. Also, Google Play isn't always an option -- the Chinese can't use Google Play, for instance, while others may have devices where the store app isn't installed. It may take a long while before enough people are up to date (most likely through new hardware) that malware like Googlian is no longer effective.",

      "text": "\nA new malware strand called Gooligan may have breached over 1 million Google accounts over the past several months. That’s the claim from the Check Point security firm, which released its findings today.\nSee also: 15 best antivirus Android apps and anti-malware Android apps 4 weeks ago \nAs with many other malware attacks on an Android-based device, Gooligan starts when the end user either downloads an infected app from a third party store (not Google Play) or if a person clicks on a link in an SMS or email message that sends them to the malware source.\nOnce Gooligan is installed, Check Point claims it sends out data on the infected device to a command and control server. Then it downloads rootkit software that can steal information such as email accounts and authorization tokens that can be used to breach Google accounts. The blog states that the majority of infected Android devices are in Asia, but about 19 percent of those devices are in the Americas.\nCheck Point has a list of the known apps that have been infected by the Gooligan malware. It also says it has already sent the information it collected on this breach to Google. Adrian Ludwig, Google’s director of Android security, is quoted in the blog post as saying that the company has “taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall.”\nIn the meantime, most people can likely avoid having their Android smartphone or tablet get infected by staying away from unsecured third-party app stores and not clicking on any random links from emails and messages from unknown sources.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Android Fraudsters Breach More Than 1 Million Accounts \nHackers have in a matter of months compromised more than 1 million Google accounts as part of a lucrative fraudulent advertising scheme involving malicious app downloads, according to a new report by Check Point Software Technologies chkp , an Israeli cybersecurity firm. \nPeople’s devices became infected after they installed innocent-looking, albeit booby-trapped software from app stores outside Google’s goog authorized Play store. The malware took complete control of their devices at the root, or deepest level, stealing tokens that Google cloud services—such as Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Docs—use to authenticate users. \nSince August, the fraudsters made off with 1.3 million tokens with an average of 13,000 new phone infections per day, Check Point researchers found. The attackers reportedly used their foothold in the devices to install additional apps and ad software as well as to post fake reviews and ratings—all to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in bogus ad revenue per month. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \n“They were able to get to the lowest level of the Android operating system where there are no limitations on what the malware can do, and then they went after these account files,” said Michael Shaulov, head of mobile products at Check Point, referencing the million-plus stolen Google account credentials. “It’s probably the biggest ever security breach of Google accounts.” \nShaulov’s team discovered the extent of the security breach after a strange piece of malware tripped an alert in Check Point’s mobile security product a month ago, he said. The team then began working working with Google to investigate the incident. \nDespite having pilfered a vast cache of Google account credentials, the hackers did not appear to access data on Google services other than the Play store, Google said. Read more: “Millions of Android Devices Were Infected by a Chinese Advertising Firm” \n“We used automated tools to look for signs of other fraudulent activity within the affected Google accounts,” wrote Adrian Ludwig, director of Android security at Google, in a Google Plus blog post addressing the compromise. “None were found.” \nThe attackers, in other words, could have used the credentials to pore over people’s email messages, or to hold people’s photo libraries for ransom. Instead, they appear to have stuck to ad fraud. For more on advertising, watch: \nThe malicious software, dubbed “Gooligan,” belongs to a family of malware called “Ghost Push,” which Google has been tracking for two years, Ludwig said. Google discovered more than 40,000 apps related to the scam last year, the company noted in a recent security report . \nCheck Point researchers have found 86 apps infected with the malware bearing innocuous names like “Wifi Master,”“Light Browser,” and “Flashlight Free.” About three-quarters of all Android devices on the market today are vulnerable, specifically those running operating system versions 4 through 5, dubbed Jelly Bean (4.1 to 4.3.1), KitKat (4.4 to 4.4.4), Lollipop (5.0 to 5.1.1), Check Point said. \nCheck Point recommended in a blog post that people who suspect their devices may have been compromised (seen unusual pop-up ads on your phone lately?) should check to see whether their account has been breached by entering their email addresses at the following website: https://gooligan.checkpoint.com/ . \nCheck Point further recommended that victims reinstall the operating system on their phones, hiring a technician to “flash” the device’s memory, since a standard factory reboot is not enough to remediate the issue. Immediately following that, customers should change their Google passwords, the company said. \nGoogle, for its part, recommended that customers download the latest Android software updates and stay away from unauthorized app stores to prevent future compromises. The company said it is working to take down the attackers’ infrastructure, to eliminate malicious apps from its stores, and to resecure customers’ compromised accounts. \nAsked who was behind the campaign, Check Point’s Shaulov said he hoped to be able to share an attribution in a week’s time. “Right now we understand who we believe is involved, but we want to nail down who exactly is behind this,” he said.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Pixel Trounced Apple’s iPhone Over the Holiday Weekend \nGoogle’s new Pixel smartphones proved popular during the busy holiday shopping season between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nGoogle Pixel device activations were up 112% compared to the smartphone’s average number of activations in four preceding weekends, according to new data from mobile app analytics company Localytics. In comparison, iPhone 7 activations were only up 13%. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 saw activations grow by 36%, according to the research firm. The data comes from Localytics analyzing customer activations from Black Friday, Nov. 24 through Cyber Monday, Nov. 28. Localytics draws its data from more than 2.7 billion devices worldwide. \nIt’s hard to say exactly what caused the massive discrepancy in activations during the holiday weekend. Localytics said in a statement that its data will “confirm what many have believed since the device was released in October : the Pixel is a very impressive device.” The company also acknowledged that the iPhone 7 experienced strong demand when it was released in September, and there might be fewer people looking to buy the new handset. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nHowever, Localytics added that iPhone models released in years past have actually done better than the iPhone 7. Apple’s AAPL iPhone 6s, which was released in 2015, for instance, saw its holiday weekend activations soar last year. \n“During last year’s Black Friday weekend, the newest Apple models fared much better,” Localytics said, referring to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. “The iPhone 6s And 6s Plus saw lifts of 36% and 29%, respectively.” \nRegardless, it’s clear that Google GOOGL is on to something with Pixel, the first handset the company has designed and engineered on its own. The Pixel, which was unveiled last month, is the 5-inch version. A larger Pixel XL comes with a 5.5-inch screen. Both models come with what Google calls the “highest-rated smartphone camera,” long-lasting battery life, and a high-end processor for performance. \nAlthough analysts don’t expect the Pixel line to match Apple’s iPhone in overall sales, they have said there’s strong demand for the device. Earlier this week, in fact, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted Google would sell about 3 million Pixel devices in the fourth quarter, and another 5 million to 6 million next year. If Google can extend its partnerships with other companies, the analysts say, it could boost those estimates. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nGoogle surprised some industry watchers at its device unveiling last month when it said it was partnering with Verizon as its carrier partner. Now a month later, Verizon VZ is the only carrier selling Google’s smartphone. Expanding those relationships to other carriers could help Pixel’s sales, analysts say. \nStill, the Pixel is available unlocked at Google’s online marketplace, allowing customers to pay full price—the handset’s pricing starts at $649—and run it on the carrier of their choosing. \nAccording to Localytics data, 46% of the Pixel handsets activated over the holiday weekend were done so through Verizon. The remaining 54% of Pixel handsets were unlocked and brought to other carrier networks. \nOne other tidbit from the Localytics data: consumers activated more smartphones on Thanksgiving Day than any other day during the holiday weekend.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. This Is How Google Wants Businesses to Make Apps \nGoogle is trying to make it easier for people to create apps powered by its suite of business tools and services. \nThe search giant said Wednesday that it made a tool called App Maker that customers of its recently rebranded G Suite lineup of workplace software can use to build their own custom business apps on top of. \nAlthough Google goog already has a tool for coders to build apps on top of its cloud computing service, the new App Maker tool is geared toward low-level developers and not the types of advanced coders making powerful software like Uber’s ride-hailing app or Netflix’s video service. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nApp Maker is essentially a tool that simplifies the process of making a business app, in which a developer with limited experience doesn’t have to futz with the underlying code but instead pieces together the various components based on pre-made Google templates. The look of the tool is similar to the types of consumer-oriented website-building software like Adobe adbe Dreamweaver, except tailored to work with Google-sanctioned apps and services. \nThe app is geared towards more developers like those in charge of corporate offices that need to quickly build an internal app for their co-workers, explained Google Cloud vice president of engineering Elissa Murphy . \nGoogle had its own internal tool for building in-house corporate apps for a “number of years” but decided last year to make one for its customers, said Ajay Surie, product manager of App Maker. “Almost every process has an app,” Surie said of the various apps Google built over the years like one that lets employees book time off from work. How Google’s Pixel Compares to the iPhone 7 \nWith App Maker, Google joins the likes of companies like Microsoft msft and Salesforce crm that have built similar simplified internal app-making tools designed specifically for their own business software services. \nThis effort is part of Google’s steady rollout of enterprise features designed to lure more corporate customers and grow its overarching cloud business unit, which includes its cloud computing service, database technologies, and Chromebook laptops. \nThe new tool is only available in a so-called beta period, in which companies can sign up to use it. After Google receives enough input from trial customers, it will debut it to the public, but no time has been set, said Surie. \n",

      "text": "Top Story: 1 million Google accounts hit by malware that can access 74 percent of all Android phones By Mark Jones, Komando.com photo courtesy of shutterstock \nCybercriminals are always coming up with new ways to rip us off. We're constantly warning you of the latest scams making the rounds. And as time goes on, hackers and scammers are getting trickier and more sinister. \nWe recently told you about fake apps designed to trick you into giving the scammer personal information or credit card numbers . Now you need to be worried about a fast spreading version of malware. It's so rampant that 1 million Google accounts have already been compromised. What happened? \nMalicious software that is masked as a genuine app for Android gadgets has been discovered by researchers at Check Point. Malware known as Gooligan has been infecting nearly 13,000 Android gadgets every single day since August. It has gained control of over a million Google accounts since that time. \nSo far there have been 86 of the malicious apps found in third-party marketplaces. A few of those apps are named Perfect Cleaner, StopWatch, and Wi-Fi Enhancer. \nIf one of these malicious apps is installed on your gadget, it begins the rooting process. Having root access of your gadget means the scammers can do whatever they want on it. Hackers can use the access to spy on you using the camera and microphone, read texts and emails, install other viruses or anything else they want. \nStay with us on this... \nOnce Gooligan has root access to the infected gadget, it downloads a malicious module from the Command and Control (C&C) server and installs it. Code is then injected into running Google Play or Google Mobile Services to copy user behavior to avoid being detected. \nThe module lets Gooligan steal a user's Gmail account and authenticate token information. It can also install apps from Google Play and give them positive ratings to boost their reputation. It also installs adware to bring in revenue. Who is affected? \nAnyone who has an Android gadget that is running an older version of its operating system is at risk. These include Android 4 and 5, which are known as Android Jelly Bean, KitKat, and Lollipop. Nearly 75 percent of all Android users are running these operating systems. \nThe reason these older operating systems are at risk is because security patches designed to fix certain flaws are not available to them or the user never installed them. \nYou're also at risk if you download apps from third-party market places. It's a good idea to stay away from these and only get apps from trusted sources like the Google Play store. Even then, use caution! \nThe Gooligan malware can also infect your gadget if you click on malicious links sent through a phishing attack. Be especially careful! What you need to know \nWith Gooligan, infected gadgets download and install software that heists tokens used to authenticate the owner's phone. These tokens give them access to Google related accounts without needing to enter a password. These accounts include Gmail, Google Play, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos and G Suite. \nYou can find out if your gadget has been infected. \nAn online tool has been created by Check Point that will let you know if your gadget has been infected. Click here to access the Gooligan Checker tool. Once there, just type your Google address into the Gooligan Checker and it will tell you if you've been hacked. \nOne of the best ways to avoid Gooligan is to stay away from third-party app markets. However, since it is also being spread through phishing attacks you need to know how to avoid falling victim to them. Here are some things you can do: Be cautious with links - If you get an email or notification from a site that you find suspicious, don't click on its links. It's better to type the website's address directly into a browser than clicking on a link. Before you ever click on a link, hover over it with your mouse to see where it is going to take you. If the destination isn't what the link claims, do not click on it. Do an online search - If you get a notification about something that seems fishy, you should do an online search on the topic. If it's a scam, there are probably people online complaining about it and you can find more information. Watch for typos - Phishing scams are infamous for having typos. If you receive an email or notification from a reputable company, it should not contain typos. Use multi-level authentication - When available, you should be using multi-level authentication. This is when you have at least two forms of verification, such as a password and a security question before you log into any sensitive accounts. Have strong security software - Having strong protection on your family's gadgets is very important. The best defense against digital threats is strong security software. \nFor security that protects your whole family, we recommend Kaspersky Total Security. \nKaspersky Total Security will protect up to five of your gadgets including PCs, Macs, Android, and even iOS devices. It safeguards your money, privacy, identity, and data from all the current and emerging computer threats including ransomware.",

      "text": "'Over 1 million Google accounts breached by Android malware Gooligan' Last Updated: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 22:04 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: A new variant of an Android malware called \"Gooligan\" is believed to have breached the security of over one million Google accounts. \nAccording to security firm Check Point Software Technologies, the malware roots Android devices and steals email addresses and authentication tokens stored on them. \nThis can give attackers access to users' sensitive data from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Play, Google Drive, and G Suite, it said. \n\"This theft of over a million Google account details is very alarming and represents the next stage of cyber- attacks. We are seeing a shift in the strategy of hackers, who are now targeting mobile devices in order to obtain the sensitive information that is stored on them,\" Check Point's head of mobile products Michael Shaulov said. \nNo immediate comment could be received from Google on the matter. \nCheck Point's report said the malware campaign infects 13,000 devices each day and that Gooligan targets devices on Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop), which represent nearly 74 per cent of Android devices in use today. \nAbout 40 per cent of these devices are located in Asia and about 12 per cent are in Europe. \nAfter attackers gain control over the device, they generate revenue by fraudulently installing apps from Google Play and rating them on behalf of the victim, the report said. \n\"Every day Gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps on breached devices, or over 2 million apps since the campaign began,\" it added. \nThe infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device, or by clicking on malicious links in phishing attack text messages. \nCheck Point said it has reached out to the Google security team immediately with information on this campaign. \n\"We appreciate Check Point's partnership as we've worked together to understand and take action on these issues. As part of our ongoing efforts to protect users from the Ghost Push family of malware, we've taken numerous steps to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall,\" Google's director of Android security Adrian Ludwig was quoted as saying. \nAmong other actions, Google has contacted affected users and revoked their tokens, removed apps associated with the Ghost Push family from Google Play, and added new protections to its Verify Apps technology. \nCheck Point?s Mobile Research Team first encountered Gooligan's code last year and in August this year, the malware reappeared with a new variant and has since infected at least 13,000 devices per day. \nCheck Point is offering a free online tool that allows users to check if their account has been breached. \n\"If your account has been breached, a clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required. For further assistance, you should contact your phone manufacturer or mobile service provider,\" Shaulov said. PTI First Published: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 22:04 More from zeenews ",

      "text": "Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: The popular search engine giant Google on Wednesday paid tribute to one of India's greatest scientists Jagdish Chandra Bose on his 158th birthday with a creative doodle. \nThe scientist is best known for his work in biophysics and science of plants and made various contributions in the field of physics, biology and archaeology. \nThe doodle on the homepage features the scientist sitting in his laboratory with a plant and crescograph, an instrument he invented to analyse plant responses to different stimuli and measure growth. The invention of crescograph has helped scientists to better understand the cultivation of crops. \nBorn on November 30, 1858, at Mymensingh, now in Bangladesh. Jagdish Chandra Bose was raised in a home committed to pure Indian traditions and culture. He studied physics at Calcutta university, went to Cambridge for his Bachelor’s degree, and returned to India in 1884 where he continued his research. \nPrior to his death in 1937, he set up the Bose Institute in then Calcutta (now Kolkata), which is one of the oldest and premier research institutes. \nTo recognise his achievements in the field of wireless telecommunications, a small impact crater on the far side of the Moon has been named after the scientists. It is located close to Crater Bhabha and Crater Adler and has a reported diameter of 91 kilometres. First Published: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 13:45 More from zeenews ",

      "title": "Gooligan malware root 1M Android phones in \"largest Google account breach to date\"",
      "text": "– A + Gooligan malware root 1M Android phones in \"largest Google account breach to date\" By Daniel Eran Dilger \nWednesday, November 30, 2016, 04:20 pm PT (07:20 pm ET) \nA new strain of Android malware dubbed \"Gooligan,\" thought to be \"the largest Google account breach to date,\" is already in active circulation and three-fourths of the Android installed base is vulnerable. Once infected, devices give hackers access to the users' Gmail, Google Photos, Docs, Drive and other Google services accounts.\n\n\nSource: Check Point Software Technologies \n\nDiscovered by Check Point Software Technologies, the \"new and alarming malware campaign\" was found to have already compromised one million Google accounts, and is currently spreading to 13,000 new users each day.\n\nThe Gooligan malware is spread through phishing campaigns or malware installed via third party app stores. Once on the device, it sucks up local data, gains root access and downloads a module that enables it to steal the users's email account and Google's authentication tokens that provide it password-free access to the user's Google Photos, Google Play account, files in Google Docs and Google Drive and G Suite. \n\nStolen authentication tokens bypass various Google security mechanisms, including two-factor-authentication, by allowing the malware that gains control of them to appear to be the already-logged in, legitimate user. Stolen authentication tokens bypass various Google security mechanisms, including two-factor-authentication, by allowing the malware that gains control of them to appear to be the already-logged in, legitimate user \n\nCheck Point reported that 57 percent of those hacked are in Asia, but 19 percent are in America and 9 percent are located in Europe. Devices running Android 4 Jelly Bean or KitKat and Android 5 Lollipop are vulnerable. According to Google's latest data from earlier this month, that amounts to 74 percent of all Android users. \n\nThe security firm recommends that users who have been compromised do a clean install of the OS via \"flashing,\" which it says \"is a complex process.\" \n\nCheck Point added, \"we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician, or your mobile service provider, to request that your device be 're-flashed.'\"\n\nThe group also noted that it \"found traces of the Gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps.\"\n\nBeyond third party stores, the Gooligan malware \"could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages,\" the security firm noted. \n\nThe malware exploits two vulnerabilities that Google has patched, but Check Point noted that \"these exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user.\"\n\nThe malware is monetized both when it logs into Google Play and posts fake app reviews that raise the reputation of apps, and also when it installs further adware to generate direct revenue. The malware also spoofs device IMEI serial numbers to appear to download apps more than once, inflating the app install count of apps that pay for installs. \n\nApple has benefitted tremendously from Google's inability to secure Android. Apple's iOS holds a commanding share of premium phone sales worldwide and maintains a strong lead in security sensitive market segments including government and corporate enterprise users. Virtually all of Apple's users are on the latest iOS update and most are frequently patched, making it far harder and less lucrative for malware vendors to exploit old iOS security flaws.",

      "text": "News \nAndroid Auto has existed for almost two years now, but it's improved only slightly in that time. One of the more vexing inadequacies in Android Auto thus far has been the lack of OK Google support. With the latest version, the hotword trigger is finally a thing. \nJust like with your phone, Android Auto now supports saying OK Google to wake up the voice control interface. There's a toggle in the Google voice settings where you set how you want the hotword to work. Prior to this update, the \"While driving\" toggle only lists Google Maps. After the update, most people see both Google Maps and Android Auto listed. It's probably a combination of the new APK and an account-level switch. \nYou can grab the latest build of Android Auto from APK Mirror and give it a shot yourself. There are plenty of successes and a few failures in this Reddit thread (above image via /u/neo5468). Let us know how it goes.",

      "title": "Gooligan malware infects 1m Google accounts: here’s what to do",
      "text": "Reddit \nThe year is about to end but one of the most potentially harmful Android malware has just started to take flight. If 2015 had its Stagefright exploit, 2016 might be remembered for the Gooligan malware, a portmanteau of “Google” and “hooligan”. The malware attacks may have already been in operation since summer and has already installed 30,000 infected apps per day, compromising 13,000 devices daily, and putting more than 1 million Google accounts in danger of being hijacked and their data stolen. \nThe story of a Gooligan infection starts almost like any other successful malware infection. An unsuspecting user, who should probably know better by now, installs or gets duped into installing a Gooligan-laced app from a third party app store or website. Said app installs a rootkit in an attempt to gain complete access to a device. If successful, the malware proceeds to install more apps from Google Play Store in order to fund its campaign. But more worrying is that Gooligan gives the attacker virtually full access to the user’s Google account and all Google services connected to that. \nGooligan is somewhat unique in the way it finances its operations as well as its frightening reach. It isn’t just users that the Gooligan malware deceives. Even legit ad servers and systems are similarly conned. Gooligan tries to mimics normal user operations to tap on ads or install sponsored apps in order to receive some cash. It even leaves reviews to make it look more legit (and earn extra too). \nThat, however, is really only the tip of the iceberg. Once a device has been rooted, Gooligan can gain access to the Google account authentication token associated with the device. That token can then be used to access other Google services, like Docs, Drive, and Gmail, to get to the user’s data. This is one case where even two-step authentication can’t protect you, as the token system bypasses all that since it makes the user, really the hacker, look like they’re already logged in. \nThe malware campaign has been discovered and reported by Check Point and has already reached Google’s ears. Google director for Android security Adrian Ludwig promised to work with Check Point to plug up this massive hole. So far, however, no formal statement or action has been made. Gooligan can infect any device running Android version 4 to 5, that is, from Jelly Bean to Lollipop, and utilizes rootkits like VROOT and TowelRoot. While these have been mostly addressed in previous security patches, not all of the 74% of devices running these Android versions have received them. \nIn the meantime, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that your device and Google account remains safe. \n• DO NOT install apps from third-party stores (unless you are 200% sure they have their own screening procedure). More importantly, DO NOT just tap on links that claim to download free APKs for apps. And if you notice a suspicious download of an APK, do not install it and delete it immediately. \n• Now might be a good time to install some anti-malware app (from Google Play Store, of course). \n• Check if you Google account has been compromised. Check Point has provided a handy web page that only asks for your e-mail address to check. \nIf you are sadly one of the 1 million and still growing compromised users, you have very little recourse: \n• “Reformat” (technically, “re-flash”) your Android device to its pristine state, either by yourself or through your OEM’s certified technicians. • Change your account password immediately. And while it might not help in this particular case, now might be a good time to enable two-factor authentication as well. \nCheck Point has provided a rather long list of fake apps infected by Gooligan. These are mostly apps that have been downloaded from other sources, but do check if you have them installed as well. \n• Perfect Cleaner",

Sign up here .\nGreen Party presidential nominee Jill Stein of Lexington has agreed to pay millions for Wisconsin officials to begin recounting ballots, filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania, and indicated she will file for a recount in Michigan (the deadline is Wednesday).\nBut why? There’s understandably a lot of confusion over Stein’s intentions for these costly legal proceedings, and both Democrats and Republicans are rolling their eyes at her efforts, which they view as a waste of time.\nAdvertisement\nDespite these doubts, Stein has raised the funds to make it happen: She has brought in $6.6 million so far — almost double what she raised for her presidential campaign — and recently upped her request for funds to $9.5 million, citing additional costs in Wisconsin. It’s notable that Hillary Clinton is not pushing for these recounts, although her campaign aides have said they will send lawyers to these states if they occur.\nSo what is going on here?

In recent interviews, Stein has said she is concerned about the sanctity of the election process. She said she believes that some voting machines are faulty and, in the case of Pennsylvania, she is worried that a majority of counties don’t have a paper trail from which votes can be audited.\nTo her credit, this is not a new concern for Stein. She has advocated for improving voting systems and making them more transparent for years — especially in Massachusetts, where she once was a candidate for secretary of state.\nGuilt. It is possible — but unlikely — that Stein might feel guilty that she could have played a part in making the GOP nominee, Donald Trump, the next president (although Stein has also made clear her dislike for Clinton).\nAdvertisement\nJust look at the states that Stein has chosen to pursue: In Michigan and Wisconsin, Stein’s vote share was larger than the difference between the two major party nominees (not the case in Pennsylvania). While Stein has argued many of her supporters wouldn’t have voted for Clinton anyway, there could be some powerful people in Clinton’s camp who do not agree.\nIt’s good for the Green Party. Any way you slice it, these recounts are a strategically strong move for Stein’s Green Party. At a time when Democrats are fretting over their future, she is positioning the Green Party as the lefty aggressor — enough so that Trump is responding to her efforts on Twitter. For those wavering Democrats who are wondering about the future of the party in 2020 and beyond, Stein is showing them that maybe the Green Party is an option after all.\nIt’s good for the green. Some political professionals (and skeptics) believe Stein is just using the recount case as a way to raise money so she can run for president again.\nTo be clear, Stein has said that money raised for these recounts will go into a separate fund from her campaign, and any unused money will “ go toward election integrity efforts to promote voting system reform .” But Stein could do a lot under that umbrella of a cause, including promoting herself and the Green Party’s efforts. What’s more, thanks to this recount, Stein now has the contact information of many donors on the left from all over the country.\nAnd it’s likely there will be surplus funds. In Michigan, officials are preparing to use $1 million in taxpayer money to conduct a recount should Stein officially request one. In the case of Pennsylvania, if her lawsuit for a recount is denied in court, all she needs to pay are legal fees.\nAnd dollars aside, Stein is suddenly relevant (a priceless feat for a third-party candidate).

      "text": " Google+\nAP PHOTO\nNancy Villa was brought to the United States illegally from Mexico as a child. She has a work permit through a 2012 federal program started under President Obama&apos;s administration and works at a Chicago child care center and attends college.\n November 30, 2016\nB runo Villegas was 6 years old when he arrived in Southern California with his parents and older sister from their native Peru. He thought the trip was just a vacation, but his parents had a different plan, which was to overstay their tourist visas to build a better life in the United States. Thirteen years later Villegas is still undocumented, but also a college sophomore who managed to get into Harvard with a generous scholarship.\n“I grew up in a household where our status was a secret, you didn’t want anyone to know because it was dangerous,” says Villegas. “But staying silent is not an option anymore.”\nAdvertisement\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s reprehensible vow during the campaign to deport millions of undocumented immigrants may not be as feasible and practical to carry out as it was to promise. But fears that he can begin with targeting the so-called Dreamers — children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents, through no fault of their own — are not unsubstantiated. Four years ago, President Obama signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order, after the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) failed to pass Congress in late 2010. DACA grants certain undocumented youths and young adults a social security number, a work permit, eligibility for a driver’s license, and temporary deportation relief. There are about 800,000 DACA-permit holders, and Villegas is one of them. At least 40 of them are enrolled at Harvard, out of 7,000 or so who live in Massachusetts.\nWhile campaigning, Trump said he’d end the DACA policy. It is unclear, however, what he will actually do now. In a short video detailing his policy plan for the first 100 days of his administration, Trump didn’t address a DACA rollback. But because these young immigrants officially declared their illegal status to the government when applying for DACA, a Trump administration may very well go after them for deportation.\nLegal experts have explained that the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause protects Dreamers from any removal procedures the government may launch against them based on the information they previously provided. And yet, thus far the one defining feature of the Trump era is that nothing is off the table. “We don’t know what the guy actually wants to do,” says Villegas. Ending DACA would make Villegas instantly deportable. Trump’s nomination of Jeff Sessions for attorney general has only compounded fear among illegal immigrants. The nominee for the nation’s top lawyer and chief enforcement officer job has been the leading opponent in Congress of both legal and illegal immigration in recent years.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Many polls have shown wide public support for DACA and allowing Dreamers to stay. A new survey shows 58 percent of voters nationwide are against Trump repealing DACA. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is reportedly preparing legislation to protect the legal status of those in the program, although it wouldn’t be filed until next year. Major universities and colleges like MIT, Harvard, Brown, and Boston University have urged the incoming administration to protect undocumented students. Harvard has announced steps to offer them expanded resources and assistance on campus. Beyond the moral case, there is an economic imperative in allowing DACA to continue. The Center for American Progress recently issued a report estimating the cost of ending it: Over a decade, it would mean a GDP loss of at least $434 billion.\nIf Villegas, whose current DACA permit expires in 2018, gets deported, he has no “home country” to go to. Unlike more recent immigrants, the Dreamers have no previous life elsewhere, as they were typically brought to the United States by their parents as infants. America is the only home they know. “This is my country and no one can tell me otherwise,” says Villegas.\nThe impending Trump presidency is exposing the true costs of failing to arrive at an immigration compromise, leaving Obama with no other tools except executive orders, which now can simply be reversed. The problem isn’t going to go away with a new era of intolerance. But the case for allowing youth like Villegas to stay is as unequivocal and powerful as ever.",

      "text": " Google+\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney dined at Jean-Georges restaurant in New York City on Tuesday.\nBy Jerry Markon The Washington Post November 30, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s drama-ridden selection process for secretary of state has narrowed to four finalists, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump aides said Wednesday.\nIt was the first time that Trump’s transition team has publicly confirmed that Romney and Giuliani are competing for the highest ranking Cabinet position. Opponents of Romney have waged a remarkably public fight against him, saying the former Massachusetts governor should not get the nod because he attacked Trump in harsh personal terms during the presidential campaign and that Giuliani should be rewarded for his loyalty during the campaign.\nAdvertisement\nTransition team officials would not name the other two finalists, but other leading candidates include retired Army Gen. David Petraeus - a former commanding general of the U.S. Central Command and CIA director - and Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nA fifth possible candidate is retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly, former chief of U.S. Southern Command. Kelly, who clashed with the Obama administration over women serving in combat and plans to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, is also a candidate for homeland security secretary and possibly other positions, people familiar with the selection process have said. Kelly is scheduled to meet with the president-elect today at Trump Tower.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

Trump met with Romney Tuesday night for a two-hour dinner at which the two men were seen laughing and munching on frog legs and other delicacies.\nView Story Romney says Trump gives him ‘increasing hope’ After a two-hour meeting with Donald Trump, Mitt Romney said he was “impressed” with how the president-elect has handled his transition.\nGraham: Trump’s revenge on Romney\nAfterward, Romney emerged and told reporters: ‘‘I had a wonderful evening with President-elect Trump,’’ That stood in stark contrast to the campaign, during which Romney had been one of Trump’s leading detractors, labeling him a ‘‘con man,’’ a ‘‘fake’’ and a ‘‘phony’’ who was unprepared for the presidency.\nJason Miller, a senior Trump communications adviser, said Wednesday that Trump also ‘‘thought the dinner went very well’’ and that the two men had ‘‘good chemistry.’’ He added that Trump and Romney ‘‘have not spent a significant amount of time together, so this is still the process of getting to know each other.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe naming of finalists for the State Department post came as Trump appeared to be focusing on core economic issues in his emerging Cabinet, while he prepared to put aside his sprawling businesses.\nTrump officially announced key members of his economic team, choosing former banker and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary and billionaire industrialist Wilbur Ross to run the Commerce Department. As Ross’s deputy, Trump turned to Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Rickets, whose family are powerful conservative donors.\n‘‘This team will be instrumental in implementing the President-elect’s America First economic plan that will create more than 25 million jobs over the next decade,’’ Trump’s transition team said in statement.\nHouse speaker Paul D. Ryan, who often clashed with Trump during the campaign but has been strongly supportive of the president-elect since his victory, praised his choices. ‘‘I am excited to get to work with this strong team to fix our broken tax code, ease the regulatory burden on American businesses, and grow our economy,’’ Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement.\nAmid the economic focus, Trump’s advisers continued promoting his role in a deal with air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier, which has announced it would reverse plans to move one of its factories from Indiana to Mexico. The company, owned by United Technologies, said about 1,000 U.S. jobs would be preserved. Trump’s promise to keep jobs in the United States and rebuild American manufacturing was a core part of his insurgent campaign.\n“The Carrier deal, I think it’s terrific,’’ Mnuchin told reporters as he walked into Manhattan’s Trump Tower Wednesday morning to meet with his future boss. He said Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence had ‘‘picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here. Can’t remember the last time a president did that.’’\nTrump and Pence will travel to Indianapolis on Thursday afternoon for the Carrier announcement, transition aides said Wednesday during a telephone briefing with reporters.\nDetails of the deal remained unclear, including the extent of Trump’s personal involvement versus Pence or other officials, and whether any incentives were offered to keep the jobs in the state, where Pence is the governor.\nAlso uncertain were the specifics of how Trump, a longtime real estate developer with interests around the globe, planned to step away from overseeing his business. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he would soon leave the conglomerate.\n‘‘I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!’’ Trump wrote on Twitter, which has remained his favorite communication medium during the transition.\nThe announcement, seen as a response to increasingly voiced concerns about the potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s public and private roles, marks a turn from his months-long refusal to distance himself from his private affairs while holding the nation’s highest public office.\nTrump’s comments did little to convince critics such as Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., who along with 23 colleagues introduced a resolution Tuesday calling on Trump to follow the precedents set by past presidents and hold his assets in a form guaranteeing no conflicts, such as a ‘‘blind trust.’’\n“I was encouraged to see the President-elect’s initial response but the devil is in the details, which Mr. Trump was short on in his tweets,’’ Cardin said. ‘‘The fact that his announcement will be done with his children at his side leaves many questions as to whether he and his lawyers understand the meaning of a blind trust.’’\nTrump did not say if the new arrangement would include a full sale of his stake or, as he has offered before, a ceding of company management to his children, which ethics advisers have said would not resolve worries that the business could still influence his decisions in the Oval Office.\nPresidents are not bound by the strict conflict-of-interest laws governing most U.S. elected officials. But most modern presidents have agreed to sell or sequester their assets in a ‘‘blind trust,’’ led by an independent manager with supreme control, in order to keep past business deals, investments and relationships from influencing their White House term.\nGiving company management to his three eldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka - would still leave open the potential for Trump to make presidential decisions for their benefit. The children have already played a key part in Trump’s governing preparations, serving on the transition team now selecting key appointees and sitting in on meetings with foreign heads of state.\nTransition aides declined to provide details of Trump’s plans for his business during Wednesday’s briefing, saying the president-elect will provide them at his Dec. 15 news conference.\nWith Mnuchin, Ross and Ricketts, Trump’s Cabinet nominations reward their loyalty and roles in his campaign. Both Mnuchin and Ross were financial contributors and advisers, while Ricketts’s father financed a pro-Trump super PAC.\nMnuchin, an investor and former Goldman Sachs executive who joined Trump’s campaign in May as finance chairman, has no government experience. But in his statement announcing Mnuchin’s nomination, which is subject to Senate confirmation, Trump hailed the former private equity fund head as ‘‘a world-class financier, banker and businessman,’’ who has ‘‘played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs.’’\nRoss is an investor known as the ‘‘king of bankruptcy’’ for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits. He helped shape the Trump campaign’s economic agenda, particularly its hard-line stance on the need to renegotiate or withdraw from free trade agreements. That position resonated with the working class voters who were instrumental in delivering Trump’s upset victory.\nTrump said that Ross, whose nomination is also subject to Senate confirmation, ‘‘is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met.’’\nThe two expressed confidence in the incoming administration’s ability to boost economic growth as high as 4 percent a year.\nCrucial to that projection would be passage of Trump’s proposed overhaul of the tax code, including streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets and reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Independent research groups have estimated the plan could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade. However, that analysis does not include the potential economic benefits the tax cuts could generate.\nTrump’s new team spread out to give a sales pitch on Wednesday for his economic vision. In a joint interview with Ross on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mnuchin said reforming the nation’s tax code would be Trump’s top priority and promised significant tax breaks for the middle class but no absolute cut for high-income households.\nAnd at Trump Tower, Mnuchin told reporters that the new administration’s ‘‘number one priority is going to be the economy, get back to three to four percent growth. We believe that’s very sustainable.’’\nAsked how they would achieve Trump’s promise to convince U.S. companies to bring back massive amounts of cash they have stockpiled overseas because of what they see as high corporate taxes, Mnuchin said:’’ Well our first priority is going to be the tax plan and the tax plan has both the corporate aspects to it, lowering corporate taxes so we make U.S. companies the most competitive in the world.’’\nHe added, without elaboration, that Trump will ensure that ‘‘we repatriate trillions of dollars back to the United States.’’\nRelated After dinner, Romney says Trump gives him ‘increasing hope’ Renée Graham: Trump’s revenge on Romney",

      "text": " Google+\nBILL BRETT FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE/File\nBy Andy Rosen Globe Staff November 30, 2016\nThe City Council on Wednesday finalized a measure to reduce Boston’s default speed limit from 30 to 25 miles per hour on Jan. 9.\nMayor Martin J. Walsh, who had pushed for the change, called the measure an important step toward reducing the risk of injuries and fatalities on the city’s roads. Boston has set a goal of eliminating traffic-related deaths by the year 2030.\nAdvertisement\n“I am pleased that our hard work and commitment to creating safer roadways for all users by reducing the default speed limit to 25 miles per hour will become a reality in January,” the mayor said in a statement.\n“This is an important milestone in our Vision Zero efforts of bringing the number of traffic-related deaths to zero, and with approval of this petition we are one step closer to achieving that goal,” Walsh added.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Once the change goes into effect, drivers will not be allowed to exceed 25 miles per hour on any road unless a different limit is otherwise posted.\nBoston was allowed to make the change under a statewide measure that authorizes municipalities to lower their default speed limits.\nSomerville made a similar change recently. On Nov. 7, the city dropped speed limits across the city to 25 miles per hour, unless otherwise posted.\nAdvertisement\nAt least 17 people have died in car accidents this year on Boston’s streets — 12 of whom were pedestrians. In a statement, Walsh’s office expressed hope that the stricter rules would lead to fewer deaths , because crashes become more deadly at higher speeds .\nState Representative Dan Hunt of Dorchester, who pushed in the Legislature for the statewide change, said he hopes the change will improve the quality of life in city neighborhoods.\n“Traffic congestion and speeding cars are among the most common issues I hear about from constituents,” he said in a statement. “Taking this one action has the potential to greatly improve pedestrian safety in our neighborhoods.”\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com .

The mall will be renamed Arsenal Yards.\nAdvertisement\n“The place is just going to be very different,” said Boylston principal Bill McQuillan.\nThe redesign will also make it easier to access the 12-acre Arsenal Park on the Charles River along Greenough Boulevard. Tenant turnover will likely be big, too. While the Arsenal Mall’s massive Home Depot will stay, the new project would include boutique stores and national retailers, “chef-driven restaurants,” and more, McQuillan said.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

We’re working on a deal with a six- to eight-screen cinema,” he said. “The reaction from tenants has been great.”\nBoylston has been working on the project since 2013, when it bought the mall with Athena chief executive Jonathan Bush. It’s now nearly through permitting in Watertown, McQuillan said, and the aim is to start construction next year, with a first phase opening in fall 2018. A second phase, including about 500 apartments, would open in 2020.\nTim Logan can be reached at tim.logan@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter at @bytimlogan .",

      "title": "Pilot told Colombia controllers he had ‘no fuel’ before crashing",
      "text": " Google+\nFernando Vergara/AP\nRescue workers at the site of an airplane crash in Colombia on Tuesday.\nBy Fernando Vergara and Joshua Goodman Associated Press November 30, 2016\nMEDELLIN, Colombia — The pilot of the chartered plane carrying a Brazilian soccer team told air traffic controllers he had run out of fuel and desperately pleaded for permission to land before crashing into the Andes, according to a leaked recording of the final minutes of the doomed flight.\nIn the sometimes chaotic exchange with the air traffic tower, the pilot of the British-built jet could be heard repeatedly requesting authorization to land. ‘‘Complete electrical failure, without fuel,’’ he said in the tense final seconds before the plane set off on a four-minute death spiral that ended with it slamming into a mountainside Monday night.\nAdvertisement\nA female controller could be heard giving instructions as the aircraft lost speed and altitude about eight miles from Medellin’s international airport. Just before going silent the pilot said he was flying at an altitude of 9,000 feet and made a final plea for a landing code: ‘‘Vectors, senorita. Landing vectors.’’\nThe recording, obtained Wednesday by Colombian media, appeared to confirm the accounts of a surviving flight attendant and a pilot flying nearby who overheard the frantic exchange. These, along with the lack of an explosion upon impact, point to a rare case of fuel running out as a cause of the crash of the jetliner, which was flying at its maximum range.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here For now, authorities are avoiding singling out any one cause of the crash, which killed all but six of the 77 people on board, including members of Brazil’s Chapecoense soccer team traveling to Medellin for the Copa Sudamericana finals — the culmination a fairy tale season that had electrified soccer-crazed Brazil.\nView Story Colombia plane crash wipes out almost entire soccer team The aircraft was carrying the Brazilian side Chapecoense. Twenty-one journalists also were on board.\nPhotos: 71 dead after plane crashes in Colombia Framingham mourns Brazilian soccer players\nA full investigation is expected to take months and will review everything from the 17-year-old aircraft’s flight and maintenance history to the voice and instruments data in the black boxes recovered Tuesday at the crash site on a muddy hillside. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was taking part in the investigation because the plane’s engines were made by an American manufacturer.\nAs the probe continued, mourning soccer fans in Medellin and the southern Brazilian town of Chapeco, where the team is from, were converging on the two cities’ soccer stadiums for simultaneous candlelight vigils. The six survivors were recovering in hospitals, with three in critical but stable condition, while forensic specialists worked to identify the victims so they could be transferred to a waiting cargo plane sent by the Brazilian air force to repatriate the bodies.\nAdvertisement\nAlfredo Bocanegra, head of Colombia’s aviation agency, said that while evidence initially pointed to an electrical problem, the possibility the crash was caused by lack of fuel has not been ruled out. Planes need to have enough extra fuel on board to fly at least 30 to 45 minutes to another airport in the case of an emergency, and rarely fly in a straight line because of turbulence or other reasons.\nBefore being taken offline, the website of LaMia, the Bolivian-based charter company, said the BAE 146 Avro RJ85 jetliner’s maximum range was 1,600 nautical miles — just under the distance between Medellin and Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where the flight originated carrying close to its full passenger capacity.\n‘‘If this is confirmed by the investigators it would be a very painful because it stems from negligence,’’ Bocanegra told Caracol Radio on Wednesday when asked whether the plane should not have attempted such a long haul.\nOne key piece to unlocking the mystery could come from Ximena Sanchez, a Bolivian flight attendant who survived the crash and told rescuers the plane had run out of fuel moments before the crash. Investigators were expected to interview her Wednesday at the clinic near Medellin where she is recovering.\n‘‘’We ran out of fuel. The airplane turned off,’’’ rescuer Arquimedes Mejia Quote: d Sanchez as saying as he pulled her from the wreckage. ‘‘That was the only thing she told me,’’ he told The Associated Press.\nInvestigators also want to speak to Juan Sebastian Upegui, the co-pilot of an Avianca commercial flight who was in contact with air traffic controllers near Medellin’s Jose Maria Cordova airport at the time the chartered plane went down.\nIn a four-minute recording circulated on social media, Upegui described how he heard the flight’s pilot request priority to land because he was out of fuel. Growing ever more desperate, the pilot eventually declared a ‘‘total electrical failure,’’ Upegui said, before the plane quickly began to lose speed and altitude.\n‘‘I remember I was pulling really hard for them, saying ‘Make it, make it, make it, make it,’’’ Upeqgui says in the recording. ‘‘Then it stopped. ... The controller’s voice starts to break up and she sounds really sad. We’re in the plane and start to cry.’’\nNo traces of fuel have been found at the crash site and the plane did not explode on impact, one of the reasons there were six survivors.\nJohn Cox, a retired airline pilot and CEO of Florida-based Safety Operating Systems, said the aircraft’s amount of fuel deserves a careful look.\n‘‘The airplane was being flight-planned right to its maximum. Right there it says that even if everything goes well they are not going to have a large amount of fuel when they arrive,’’ said Cox. ‘‘I don’t understand how they could do the flight nonstop with the fuel requirements that the regulations stipulate.’’\nRelated Colombia plane crash wipes out almost entire soccer team",

      "text": " Google+\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\nA hunter loaded one of two female deer he killed into his pickup truck during last year’s Blue Hills deer hunt.\nBy Philip W. Johnston and Laura Hagen November 30, 2016\nThe peaceful sanctuary that is the Blue Hills Reservation has served as a refuge for urban and suburban dwellers alike for generations. But last year, area residents were shocked to learn that the state’s Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW) were instituting a deer hunt there.\nDespite strong opposition from hikers, abutters, animal-protection and public-safety advocates, and even some hunters, DCR, after a process that scrimped on transparency and public input, pushed stubbornly ahead with its plan.\nAdvertisement\nThe hunt was based on an outdated population survey from 2013, disregarding the state’s own guidelines, which recommend that surveys be performed at least biennially to show population trends. Thus, DCR began the hunt with no current deer count. Nor will it conduct another until 2017.\nDCR claimed deer were so abundant that up to 600 could be killed during the four-day hunt. What a surprise, then, when only 64 deer were felled . DCR still proclaimed the hunt a great success, but the huge disparity between projected and actual kills left many wondering if the deer-overpopulation claim was — and is — completely false.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here And the cost to taxpayers? At approximately $2,500 per deer, call it exorbitant. DCR and other state agencies reported spending approximately $153,000 on the four-day hunt, with records showing abutting municipalities spent at least $11,000 more. That means the per-deer cost of the hunt was more than double that of non-lethal alternatives, which DCR had deemed too expensive.\nView Story 24 deer killed as hunt begins at Blue Hills State Reservation The four-day hunt on the reservation began Tuesday and is expected to manage the deer population.\nStill, despite the failure of the 2015 hunt, DCR held another hunt this week and has a second planned for next week. Once again taxpayers will be left holding the bag for a small special-interest group.\nLast year’s hunt was predicated on the widespread but inaccurate notion that deer are responsible for Lyme disease. No major health organization, including the CDC, recommends culling deer to prevent Lyme. That’s because human risk of exposure to Lyme disease correlates with the abundance of immature (rodent) hosts and their food resources, not deer numbers. Tamara Awerbuch, Ph.D, one of the foremost Lyme disease researchers, found “no linear correlation between killing deer and the tick population.”\nAdvertisement\nApprised of Awerbuch’s and other researchers’ studies, DCR was forced to backtrack. This year deer are instead being branded the culprit for all vegetation and biodiversity concerns in the Blue Hills. Like other forested northeastern landscapes, the Blue Hills are subject to any number of influences that have created the conditions evident today. Harsh winters (like that of 2015), pollution, drought, climate change, insect damage, invasive plant species, parasitic organisms, landscape fragmentation and trail overuse by humans and dogs are just some of the many causes of deforestation. But instead of considering these factors, DCR based its ecological assessments on one sole vegetation-monitoring area: a mere 30 by 30 foot plot, which was used to render a judgment for more than 11 miles of forest. That was clearly insufficient for a true measure of impacts. Still, the easiest answer for DCR and DFW was obviously this: Let’s have a hunt and kill the deer.\nThis year’s hunt, Nov. 29 to 30 and Dec. 6 to 7, is worse than last year’s, employing cruel and ineffective methodologies like bow and arrow hunting, which has a crippling rate of almost 50 percent, meaning that about half the struck deer don’t die quickly, but rather flee in an injured state. Part of the bow and arrow hunting “sport” includes following a blood trail from those deer; at Blue Hills, that reality could leave hunters to choose between pursuing wounded deer onto private property or letting them endure a slow, agonizing death. The proximity of several major highways adds this frightening possibility: Wounded deer running onto heavily traveled roads.\nDCR and DFW’s lack of a current survey, dismissal of non-lethal alternatives, and disdain for real transparency are, sadly, not surprising. Avid hunters oversee both agencies developing and executing this hunt.\nBut this poorly premised hunt shouldn’t be tolerated. An independent, unbiased survey of the actual Blue Hills deer population should be initiated before the hunt resumes. And if there is indeed a problem, the state should explore humane efforts at population control. The current “policy” is merely a sportsmen-pleasing deer kill hunting for a scientific rationalization.\nPhilip W. Johnston is the former Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services and a member of Friends of the Blue Hills Deer. Laura Hagen is deputy director of Advocacy, Massachusetts Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA).",

      "text": " Google+\nJustin Kimball\n“Wyoming Avenue,” 2014\nBy Cate McQuaid Globe Correspondent December 01, 2016\nAn elderly man kneels on the sidewalk beside a parking curb. His hand rests on the curb, nails long and dirty, skin creased with age. Is he repainting the curb? Or has he fallen?\nJustin Kimball’s timely, sobering photographs at Carroll and Sons depict the fallen: houses caved in, shops demolished. But they also picture the scrappy: people and communities sticking out, hard times. The photo of the old man, “Wyoming Avenue,” shows either or both, depending on what you bring to it.\nAdvertisement\nKimball, who teaches at Amherst College, traveled to tumble-down neighborhoods in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, photographing buildings and people in towns apparently deserted by industry. Property values have sunk and abandoned houses pock the landscape, but residents stay, loyal to their communities or maybe too strapped to move.\nThere are lucid stories of struggle and the bonds of family and friends in Kimball’s compelling, necessary images of people. But his forceful photos of buildings and streets dominate. A shallow depth of field pushes imagery to the forefront, like sets looming at the rim of a stage; tight compositions could induce claustrophobia.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

Sign up for more newsletters here “Lincoln Avenue” jams many walls into the frame: the back of a worn shed; a wooden fence; clean green siding on the corner of a house; shingles shedding and broken windows on the side of another. The eye ricochets from one surface to the next, trapped, finding hope one moment and despair the next.\nKimball shot “Shenandoah” from inside a partially destroyed building. Perhaps there was a fire. A puddle on the floor reflects the sky. Windows in the sooty concrete wall open to another world: houses across the street under a blue sky. How can it be that life continues amid such decay?\nBut it has for decades. These communities are easy to ignore if all you’re doing is driving through. The people in Kimball’s photos are tired and disaffected. It’s time to pay heed.\nJUSTIN KIMBALL: ELEGY\nAdvertisement\nAt Carroll and Sons, 450 Harrison Ave., through Dec. 21. 617-482-2477, www.carrollandsons.net\nCate McQuaid can be reached at catemcquaid@gmail.com .

      "text": "1.3 million Google accounts hacked – report The hacks come as a result of users downloading illegitimate apps Published 2:53 PM, December 01, 2016 Updated 2:53 PM, December 01, 2016 GOOLIGAN. Around 13,000 new devices are still being compromised on a daily basis, says reports \nMANILA, Philippines – Google has confirmed that 1.3 million accounts have been compromised due to an ongoing hacking campaign that experts have labeled \"Gooligan.\" \nThe tech giant made the confirmation to CNNMoney on Wednesday, November 30, shortly after cybersecurity firm Check Point revealed the discovery. \nAccording to Check Point, which has been tracking the cyber-attack since last year, the hackers were able to gain access to the accounts by infecting Android phones through illegitimate apps. The hackers were able to harvest digital security \"tokens\" from the infected phones, which then allowed them access to photos, emails, documents and more. \nToday, 13,000 additional devices are getting infected and compromised daily by the attacks. Check Point specifies that \"Gooligan\" affects Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop) devices, which comprise 74% of in-market devices today. For Philippine users, what's more alarming is that 57% of the infected devices are located in Asia, with the number trickling down to 19% in the Americas, 15% in Africa, and 9% in Europe. \nThese illegitimate apps are apps that are downloaded from unnofficial app stores, which routinely offer free, counterfeit alternatives to paid apps found on the official Google Play Store. The huge downside: as the \"Gooligan\" hacks have shown, the unofficial, unapproved apps could lead to security compromises, costing users more in the long run. \nWhat were the goals of the hackers? The hackers have not yet tapped nor stolen the information, says CNN. Instead, the hackers are doing what the media outfit calls a \"criminal enrichment scheme.\" The infected phones download other legitimate apps, then automatically rate them highly, thus increasing the apps' reputation. The higher the app's reputation is, the more likely it is that people will download it. \nThe legitimate apps that have benefited from the fraudulent ratings have since been removed from the official app store, says Adrian Ludwig, the director of Android security at Google, in a blog post . \nThe \"Gooligan\" malware has also been reported to install malicious advertising software that harvests user data that may be of value to marketers. \nCheck Point has published a list of these illegitimate apps and their complete security report on their website. If you're on Android, check your phone right away for the presence of the said apps on your phone. \nYou can also check if your device has been compromised by using Check Point's security check service at Gooligan.CheckPoint.com . To lessen the risks of having your Android phone hacked, avoid downloading apps from places other than the Google Play Store. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL? Happy",

      "text": "  \nThe tech industry's diversity movement has been struggling to come to terms with the election of Donald Trump as president, but one tech giant is making an effort to let it be known its desire for a more inclusive workforce has not been diminished. Google, which has been in the vanguard of the movement since day one, is making a fresh effort to attract more individuals from underrepresented backgrounds into its ranks. \n\"We've always been about providing services for everyone, not for a select few,\" said Allan Thygesen, Google president of marketing solutions. Diversity \"is essential. You cannot service everyone if you don't have that perspective.\" \nNearly three years ago, Google released its first diversity report , setting off a domino effect that led dozens of other tech companies to follow suit. Since then, Google has continued to release a report on an annual basis, but thus far, the company has had little to show for it . Since 2014, the company's overall representation of women, blacks and Hispanics has remained unchanged with Google unable to move the needle. This has brought the sincerity of Google's diversity efforts into question and under criticism. \nBut Google hasn't let up on its efforts. Google's leaders know that diversity on their teams -- specifically the inclusion of individuals from underrepresented groups -- is key to its businesses and has a direct impact on its bottom line. The company wants individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to apply for its job openings and feel welcome at the company. \n\"We fully acknowledge we have work to do and are committed to this work for the long haul,\" said Thygesen, whose own division features a program designed to help women and minority-led businesses that are interested in working with Google grow. \"We hope that by highlighting these folks' accomplishments -- both tangibly as it relates to our bottom line and intangibly as it improves our collective ability understand, embrace and celebrate our differences -- others like them will see themselves in fulfilling careers at Google.\" \nThat is why, earlier this year the company reached out to Inc . in hopes of showing just how exactly diversity creates value for Google and, specifically, how it affects its bottom line. Google gave Inc . access to a handful of its employees. They hail from all portions of the world, ranging from around the U.S. to Nigeria, and they're spread across Google's most important teams. Alberto Villarreal, originally from Mexico City, and his team designed the exterior looks for the Pixel, Google’s new smartphone. Villarreal credits his Mexican background for his decision to design a bright and colorful blue version of the Pixel. CREDIT: Tory Putnam Thinking in a different spectrum \nBorn and raised in Mexico City, Alberto Villarreal, the creative lead and industrial design manager for Google's consumer hardware unit, was the lead designer behind the exterior of the Pixel, Google's latest smartphone. \nGoogle released the Pixel in three different colors, \"Quite Black, Very Silver, or Really Blue,\" as the phone is described online. Often, phone makers release their devices in black and white options, making the Pixel's Really Blue a distinctive offering among handsets. The blue is a bright, joyful and expressive tone that Villarreal said he believes he chose due to the influence of his background growing up in Mexico's culture of colorful and expressively loud art. \n\"There are people out there who actually want to have more expression. They want to have the phone say something about them,\" he said. \"It's something unique in the market.\" \nThe device was released in October and has been off to a fast start, with analysts predictin g that the Pixel could provide as much as an additional $4 billion in revenue on top of what Google already makes in revenue. \nVillarreal's design of the device -- he and his team crafted everything that you can physically feel on the Pixel -- were key to its success. \"Because our phones are used in all these different contexts, we have to really understand different cultures and make sure that our designs are universal enough,\" he said. Tapping into emerging markets \nThis idea of appealing to worldwide markets is one of the key contributions of a diverse workforce. Kechy Eke, a technical account manager on the Google technical services team, was born and raised in Nigeria. After arriving at Google, she created the group Africans@Google, which is now used by employees of the company to discuss how to best grow business in African markets.

Eke was born and raised in Nigeria, and soon after arriving at Google in 2015, she noticed there was a need for a Google employee focused on Africa. \nThe group, Africans@Google, has blossomed to nearly 200 members and become a gathering spot for Googlers of African descent, but more importantly to the bottom line, the group serves as a forum for exploring how best Google can grow its business on the continent where so many emerging markets and untapped consumers sit, Eke said. \n\"We have a lot of offices in Africa and a lot of projects going on because that's where we see a lot of growth,\" said Eke, who wrote papers about the business opportunities in Africa while in college. \"It's the next big emerging economy.\" Ensuring everyone's safety \nMeanwhile, Amber Yust, who was raised in Massachusetts, has used her experiences as a transgender woman to influence her work as an engineering manager on Google's privacy and security team. Yust's role is to ensure users' data, particularly their sensitive information, is kept secure on Google's service. Amber Yust, who was raised in Massachusetts, has used her experiences as a transgender woman to influence her work as an engineering manager on Google's privacy and security team. Yust was a part of the team that worked on introducing custom genders and pronouns to Google's services. CREDIT: Tory Putnam \n\"You really have to take into account the human element when you're dealing with security, and that is something that you do better when you aren't just thinking about one narrow definition of what the human element is,\" Yust said. \"As a trans individual, I'm very cognizant of how identity works and how people often go about portraying and communicating their identity.\" \nMost notably, Yust was a part of the team that worked on introducing custom genders and pronouns to Google's services in 2014. This was an effort championed by Yust and her peers as a way to ensure that all kinds of users felt welcomed on Google's services. \n\"Things like custom genders and pronouns are important in that they are one of those things that many users won't care about, but a small segment of our users base really does care about -- it's a make or break factor,\" she said. \"It may seem small, but when you add up these little things, they grow into a much more broader benefit that improves the platform as a whole.\" Positive legacy of an uncertain childhood Howard Sueing, a software engineer on Google’s privacy and security team, says his background molded him into a self starter with a strong work ethic, qualities he brings to his team at the tech company. CREDIT: Tory Putnam \n\"In order to maximize revenue from a product, you need diversity of people building it,\" said Howard Sueing, a Google software engineer. \"You're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't do that because regardless of how clever you think you are or what Ivy League school you went to, there's some perspective that you don't have or know about. \nAs a part of Google's privacy and security team, Sueing has contributed to the creation of Google's Transparency reports, which shows users the request Google gets from the likes of law enforcement and copyright owners. Sueing, who is the global co-chair for the Black Googler Network, has also worked on Google Takeout, the tool that makes it simple for users to download their data, such as their emails, photos and documents, off of Google's services. \nAs an African-American man from a low-income socioeconomic background who moved a lot during his childhood, Sueing said he acquired a self-starting, strong work ethic. Sueing worked throughout his high school, starting as a janitor his sophomore year, to put food on the table for him, his four siblings and his parents. That fueled him through his academic career, but it has also carried over to his work at Google where Sueing is often the one driving his teammates to meet deadlines. \n\"'Hey folks, this is where we are, this is where we need to be, this is how much work we need to do.' I find often that I'm the one guy on the team that has that culture and that perspective,\" Sueing said. \"I've been told by my managers, and praised for it, that this is a super valuable bit that I bring to the team that often results in us launching products on time.\"  ",

      "text": "\nGoogle recently updated their Earth Timelapse , which reveals the devastating impact human beings had on Earth between 1984 and 2016. From retreating glaciers to sprawling cities, Google Earth Timelapse allows a casual observer to see how much humanity has changed the planet over the last 32 years. While Google Timelapse has been around since 2013, the tech giant just updated the feature with new data from more years, as well as new images from NASA .\n\n\nOn Google Timelapse, anyone with an Internet connection can watch the diminishing Columbia Glacier in Alaska , and green plants springing up as snow and ice retreat. They can check out the Palm Islands in Dubai flourishing, or zoom in on Miami, Brisbane, Copenhagen, or any other location on Earth. Google says their updated Timelapse offers a sharper picture of cities and geological features all across the globe.\nRelated: Google and Landsat Create Time-Lapse Videos Showing 40 Years of Environmental Destruction in the Amazon \nThe new Timelapse includes petabytes of data; one petabyte comprises one million gigabytes. According to Google, the team had to sort through three quadrillion pixels from over five million satellite images . Five satellites across three decades collected the millions of images. Two new satellites, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, provided crisp imagery for 2015 and 2016. Google said most of the images in Timelapse come from a NASA and United States Geological Survey program, Landsat , that has been inspecting our planet since the 1970's. Google made the interactive Timelapse map utilizing Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab 's Time Machine Library technology.\nFor better or for worse, humans are transforming Earth, and Google Timelapse allows people to see the effects of our species on this planet. In a blog post on the updated Timelapse, Google Earth Engine Program Manager Chris Herwig said, \"There's much more to see, including glacial movement in Antarctica, urban growth, forest gain and loss, and infrastructure development.\"\n+ Google Timelapse \nVia Google \nImages via screenshot \n\n",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly planning to use drones to improve its Maps app and truly compete with Google Maps, following a problematic launch four years ago. Bloomberg News reports that Apple has been building a team of experts in robots and data capture to utilize drones to quickly update maps. Google and Apple both use fleets of cars and vans equipped with cameras, but drones will allow Apple to examine and monitor roads, street signs, construction areas, and more. Apple is said to have hired at least one employee from Amazon’s Air division to help run its own drone team based in Seattle.\nAlongside the drone efforts, Apple is also reportedly developing a new inside view for its Maps app and improvements for car navigation. Bloomberg New s claims that the indoor mapping view will let iPhone users navigate through museums and airports. Google Maps currently offers similar indoor features, and Apple has reportedly acquired Indoor.io to help build out the feature for Maps. Apple is also adding better assistance for changing lanes while driving, and both of the new Maps features are said to be planned for a 2017 release.",

      "text": "on Thursday December 01, 2016 @09:47AM from the fixing-things dept. Google says it has built support for the leap second into the time servers that regulate all Google services. An anonymous reader shares a blogpost by Google: No commonly used operating system is able to handle a minute with 61 seconds, and trying to special-case the leap second has caused many problems in the past. Instead of adding a single extra second to the end of the day, we'll run the clocks 0.0014% slower across the ten hours before and ten hours after the leap second, and \"smear\" the extra second across these twenty hours . For timekeeping purposes, December 31 will seem like any other day. All Google services, including all APIs, will be synchronized on smeared time, as described above. You'll also get smeared time for virtual machines on Compute Engine if you follow our recommended settings. You can use non-Google NTP servers if you don't want your instances to use the leap smear, but don't mix smearing and non-smearing time servers.",

      "text": "Some content gets hundreds of shares but never gets picked up by Google, while other content will rank well in searches but rarely appears on social. What’s the magic behind creating content that gets both shares and backlinks?\nI recently spoke with Steve Rayson , the Director of Buzzsumo , to find the secret sauce.\nHave a listen on iTunes , SoundCloud or scroll down to read a summary of our chat.\nWhat are the 5 types of content that get both links and shares? \"So number one, the obvious one is content that answers questions - in particular, authoritative content that answers questions. It might be as simple as, \"What is content marketing?\", \"What is shareable content?\", \"What is a bad link?\". Often those sorts of posts, those posts that answer questions, they get shared quite well, but they also gain a lot of backlinks, because people will refer to them I think almost as references.\nThe one that I think surprised me a bit more was strong opinion posts, or controversial posts. There seems to be no question that controversial content gets shares, but it also gets links.\nThe best example that I’ve seen of this in our own space is Mark Schaefer’s post on Content Shock . Mark wrote a post a while ago saying that content marketing is not a sustainable strategy, or words to that effect. So that’s slightly, well Mark would say that’s not controversial, but it was certainly a strong opinion piece. Just looking at that, it got over four and half thousand shares, which is quite good, but it also got 900 domain links.\nThe third type of content that always get links is research posts. We found this again in our research last year where we looked at a million posts . We were looking for correlation of shares and links. The one site where we found a really strong correlation of shares and links was Pew Research. They publish research content and it gets lots of shares, but it also gets lots of links, and there’s very little question for me, really, that if you publish good original research, people will not only share it, they'll link to it, and it’s much more likely to gain links.\nAnother post type that gets lots of links is authoritative posts about new developments - and that’s hard to produce. Unless you’re an authority, it’s hard for you to post something authoritative about a new development, but people who do this well - I think Search Engine Watch did one about confirming Google to no longer put ads on the right . It seems fairly small but that’s got masses of links.\nAnd the last big one is trending topics. If you just piggyback on a trending topic, those posts tend to get shares but not links. But if you can provide some real insight - and a good example of this was Inc.’s story on Pokemon Go, which was how small businesses are using Pokemon Go to drive sales - that got about 1000 links.\"\nFollow Steve on Twitter @SteveRayson and read the full article on the Link Humans blog .",

      "text": "Apple is hoping drones can help the company compete more effectively against Google Maps, according to a new report.\nThe tech giant is building a team that will use drones to fly overhead and capture critical street information, including signs and traffic changes, Bloomberg is reporting , citing sources who claim to have knowledge of its plans. Apple has secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use drones to capture photos, videos, and other traffic data, the report says.\nDrone capture could prove important to Apple AAPL as it works to improve its Maps application running on iOS and macOS devices. After capturing the data from streets both in the U.S. and abroad, it can then be transmitted back to Apple’s team and its information uploaded to the Apple Maps servers, according to Bloomberg . Users, then, would get far more useful and recent data. The drones would replace the minivans it currently uses to collect similar data.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple Maps was released in 2012 as a replacement to Google Maps on iOS. Soon after its release, however, the app, which comes bundled with Apple’s operating systems, was criticized for having inaccurate information and poor driving directions. Apple CEO Tim Cook ultimately apologized for Apple Maps and suggested users try out other options, like the Google Maps that had previously been bundled with Apple’s mobile operating system.\nSince then, Apple has made strides towards improving the app’s accuracy and data and has added more information, including traffic and transit data. Still, Apple Maps is generally believed to be inferior to Google Maps, which comes with accurate data and other key features, like a Street View option that lets users see images of addresses.\nIn addition to getting better data more quickly to Apple Maps with drones, the company is also trying to improve its mapping service’s navigation and is eyeing ways to take images of the inside of buildings, according to Bloomberg . That feature would let users explore airports, museums, and other public places without actually visiting them. Google GOOGL already offers a similar feature with Google Maps.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nLooking ahead, Apple could be hoping to get its indoor mapping service to Apple Maps sometime next year, along with a tool that would tell users when and where to change lanes during navigation. Apple is still assembling the team that will help it take advantage of drones, the report says.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment.",

Also topping lists of most popular stuff on Google's online entertainment marketplace: \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Deadpool.\" \nPokemon Go was the most popular game worldwide on Google Play. Photo by Chesnot, Getty Images \nThere was never any doubt here. The game that caused injuries , took over Comic Con , and made people stumble upon dead bodies was the most popular of 2016, according to Google. \nPokemon Go was the top trending game worldwide this year on the search giant's Play store, where people can download apps, games, music, movies and books. \nIt's that time of the year again -- to look back on the last 12 months and try to figure out what exactly happened, through the time-honored lens of year-end lists. Google on Thursday released its annual lists of top content on the its Play store. The lists give us a window into what the residents of planet Earth (well, at least the ones that use Google's Android mobile software) were thinking in 2016. Behold, psychology through pop culture. \nIt seems people were very anxious this year. Makes sense, after a l ng election in the US , deaths of legendary musicians , and, well, all that is Ryan Lochte . The top two songs were \"Stressed Out\" by Twenty One Pilots and \"Sorry\" by Justin Bieber. \nEverything else was probably as you'd expect: In TV, people liked gratuitous sex and violence (\"Game of Thrones\"). In apps, they liked photo filters and selfies (No. 1: Face Changer 2, No. 2: Lumyer photo and selfie editor). \nOne thing that might be surprising, though, was Deadpool coming in strong. The Marvel superhero topped two lists: Movies, beating out \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" and new books, with \"Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe,\" by Cullen Bunn. \nBelow are the complete lists: \nTop trending apps:",

      "text": "So much day-to-day communication at work happens via email on or apps like Google Hangouts or Slack.\n\nYet most employees never receive formal training in email writing, because it's just like communicating in person, right? \nNot really. \nA CEO of a $16 billion dollar business says that the way you write emails could help or hinder your career.\nCNBC asked several career experts to share their biggest do's and don'ts of email writing. Here are their top rules:\n1. Don't hit 'send' when you're emotional You may feel sorely tempted, at times of peak frustration, to fire off something quick and furious. But avoid that kind of email: It could come back to haunt you. \n\"Do not email when you're angry, hungry or tired,\" says Stefanie Ziev , executive and life coach. \"Check in with your mental state and mindset before you press 'send.'\" \nGet up from your desk, take a deep breath or even a walk to make sure you're in the right mental state, says Kathy Caprino , career coach and leadership expert at Brave Up. \n\"Never react harshly in the moment,\" Caprino says. \"Don't send an angry email as a knee-jerk reaction. You'll regret it.\"\n2. Don't ramble Time is money, so make life a little richer for your boss or coworker. \n\n\"Never 'bury the lead,'\" says Robert Hellmann , president of Hellmann Career Consulting. \"Get right to the point in business writing.\" \nIn other words, put the most important information at the top of the email. \nTo avoid rambling, write a draft of your email and then edit it, experts suggest. Emails that are more than one or two short paragraphs are generally too long.\n\n\"No one has time to read your long letter full of big dense paragraphs,\" Hellmann says. \n\"Get right to the point in business writing.\" -Robert Hellmann, president of Hellmann Career Consulting 3. Don't conduct personal business This one comes down to a simple rule that applies to nearly every single workplace: Company time and property should only be used for company work.\n\n\"Never conduct your own personal business using the company's email,\" says Juliet Murphy , CEO of Juliet Murphy Career Development. \n\"This is unethical and can also be grounds for termination,\" Murphy adds. \n4. Don't gossip Gossip at work, whether in person or via email, is not only unprofessional, it could get you fired, experts say.\n\n\"Negative remarks about the company, colleagues, bosses or the business in general have no place in work emails,\" says Joan Kuhl , founder and president of Why Millennials Matter. \nIt's an important rule to follow \"because you are not able to control how an email gets circulated after you have sent it,\" Murphy says.\nEx-Google career coach reveals the biggest mistake she sees people make 5. Don't joke We all appreciate a sense of humor at work, but remember that emails leave a lot of room for misinterpretation.\n\n\"There are certain types of messages that do not translate well in email,\" says Rachel Beohm coach and trainer at FORTE, a non-verbal communication coaching firm. \n\"Sarcasm can be misunderstood even in person, yet over email, without the use of eye contact and voice tone, it is even more likely to be lost,\" Beohm adds. \nMoreover, trying to be funny can get you into serious legal trouble. \n\"Don't write anything derogatory against a person's religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation,\" Murphy says. \"They are inappropriate and can expose the company to lawsuits or other EEOC issues, and could also put your job in jeopardy.\"\n\n6. Don't criticize \"Never criticize or call out another person in email, especially when it's a group email,\" career coach Maggie Mistal says. \n\nSensitive situations are most often better handled in person, unless you feel you need an electronic record of the communication. If that's the case, you can always send a follow up email reiterating what was discussed, experts say. \n\"Never try to solve a touchy interpersonal problem just by email,\" Hellmann says. \nAbove all, experts agree that using \"the headline rule\" is very helpful: If your email appeared as the headline of a major newspaper tomorrow, would you feel comfortable? If not, don't hit 'send.'\nshow chapters CEO of a $16 billion business says the way you write emails can break your career      19 Hours Ago | 00:55",

      "text": "By Laura Hurley \n2016 is coming to an end, and the time is now to look back at the best and worst that TV had to offer. It was a year filled with huge plot twists, heartbreaking deaths, and killer cliffhangers that drove viewers everywhere crazy...and to their Internet browsers. Google Play has released its ranking of the 5 most downloaded shows of this past year, and there are a couple that may come as surprises. Prepare yourself for some blasts from the super-recent past of 2016, and check out the list of Google's top 5 shows! 5. The Flash \nThe Flash is the biggest hit on The CW, but The CW is by far the smallest of the American broadcast networks. Still, something about the adventures of the Scarlet Speedster Barry Allen and his pals has struck a chord with viewers. I'm guessing that the big Flashpoint cliffhanger at the end of Season 2 probably had something to do with all the downloads. We had a long summer of waiting for news of what could possibly come next, and the plot hasn't gotten any less twisty in Season 3, so hopefully The CW considers its online popularity in considering the show's future.",

      "title": "At least 10 million Android users imperiled by popular AirDroid app",
      "text": "For at least the past six months, a popular remote management app available in the official Google Play Store has opened tens of millions of Android users to code-execution and data-theft attacks when they use unsecured networks, researchers said Thursday.\nAs recently as earlier this week—and possibly even at this moment—the most up-to-date versions of AirDroid have used a static and easily detectable encryption key when transmitting update files and sensitive user data, according to a blog post published by security firm Zimperium . Attackers who are on the same network can exploit the weakness to push fraudulent updates or view potentially sensitive user information, including the international mobile equipment identity and international mobile subscriber identity designations that are unique to each phone. The app has been downloaded 10 million to 50 million times from the official Google Play Store.\n\"A malicious party on the same network as the victim can leverage this vulnerability to remotely gain full control of their device,\" Simone Margaritelli, principal security researcher at Zimperium's zLabs, told Ars. \"Moreover, the attacker will be able to see the user's sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI, and so forth. As soon as the update, or fake update, is installed the software automatically launches the updated [Android app file] without ever verifying who built it.\"\nHere's a video showing a Zimperium-developed proof-of-concept attack exploiting the weakness:\nAirDroid Vulnerability The vulnerability, which Zimperium discovered privately reported to AirDroid developers in May, remained present in in AirDroid version 4.0, which was released in mid-November . On Wednesday, AirDroid developers released version 4.0.0.1 , which offered unspecified bug fixes. It wasn't immediately clear if the hole has been plugged in that update. Assuming it has, AirDroid users should install it as soon as possible, but only over secured networks. AirDroid representatives didn't respond to messages seeking comment for this post.\nKey under the doormat Margaritelli said that while AirDroid versions she tested used industry-standard HTTPS to encrypt most traffic, data for certain functions was sent over HTTP. In the cases where HTTP was used—including update notifications and the update files themselves—the HTTP-transmitted data was encrypted using DES, short for the data encryption standard . Remarkably, the key used for this symmetric encryption scheme—890jklms—was hardcoded into the AirDroid app, where it was easy for Zimperium researchers to find.\nA timeline included in the Zimperium blog post shows that company officials first notified AirDroid of the vulnerability in late May. In September, AirDroid informed Zimperium of an upcoming release, which finally went live two weeks ago. Zimperium's analysis of that release, AirDroid version 4.0, showed that the app remained vulnerable, a finding that resulted in Thursday's disclosure of the weakness.\nWhile application sandboxing built into the Android operating system can limit the access malicious apps have, there are a few reasons why the attack Zimperium has demonstrated remains a serious threat. First, AirDroid already has a significant number of usage rights, including the ability to make in-app purchases and to access contacts, device location, text messages, photos, camera, microphone, Wi-Fi connection data, and device ID and call information. What's more, an attacker pushing a malicious update could augment those rights as long as the end user clicked an OK button when receiving a fake notification that an update was available.\nAnd while use of a virtual private networking app while connected to an unsecured network may provide a layer of protection, there may still be ways for attackers to bypass it. One example: presenting the target with the type of captive portal page that hotels and conference organizers often display before end users can access a Wi-Fi network.\nUntil a fix is in place, AirDroid users should restrict their use of the app to networks they control and trust. And once a patch is made available, people should be sure to install it immediately, but again only over a secured network. This post will be updated as soon as possible to report the status of the newly released version 4.0.0.1.",

      "text": "LOOK: Google Earth Timelapse views Manila’s make-over since 1984 INQUIRER.net / 10:08 AM December 02, 2016 \nRanging from infrastructure to pollution and urban development, a lot has changed in Metro Manila since 1984, and Google Earth Timelapse proved these significant changes. \nThe newest feature from Google Earth gives internet users a quick glimpse of how Metro Manila grew up in a span of three decades. Using 5 million satellite images amounting to around three quadrillion pixels, Google Earth was able to sift and compile images from cities around the globe. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 also provided newer and sharper glimpses of the cities seen from outer space. ADVERTISEMENT \n“There’s much more to see, including glacial movement in Antarctica, urban growth, forest gain and loss, and infrastructure development,” Google Earth’s blog post said. While only minuscule transformations were recorded in Metro Manila, drastic transformations can be sighted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where the artificial Palm Islands could be seen. Majestic urban expansion can be attributed to the three-decade “make-over” of Las Vegas, Nevada; Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada; Oakland Bay Bridge in San Francisco, California; and Chongqing, China. The melting of several glaciers, including the Columbia Glacier in Alaska, exposed the negative effects of global warming. \nOther time-lapse clips featuring other global cities can be viewed in this YouTube playlist.

      "text": " Google+\nEvan Vucci/Associated Press\nThe event took Trump back to US Bank Arena in Cincinnati, where tens of thousands of people gathered in mid-October.\nBy Nick Corasaniti and Michael D. Shear New York Times December 02, 2016\nCINCINNATI — A triumphant Donald Trump soaked up the adulation of thousands of supporters here Thursday as he kicked off a two-week “thank you” tour featuring rallies meant to capture the campaign-style frenzy that sent him to the White House.\nFor Trump, who in the three weeks since the election has mostly stayed behind closed doors putting together his Cabinet, the Ohio rally provided a respite from those sometimes fraught deliberations.\nAdvertisement\nThe rally took Trump back to US Bank Arena, where tens of thousands of people gathered in mid-October for a raucous campaign event. The crowd was noticeably smaller this time; thousands of seats remained empty as Trump started his remarks.\nThe event carried the hallmarks of Trump’s whiplash style during the election: indicting and promising, nostalgic and forward-looking. He resurrected signature applause lines like the pledge to “make America great again” and, in a surprise, announced a Cabinet nomination, retired General James N. Mattis for secretary of defense.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Trump opened his rally with a familiar trope: gawking at the crowd and lamenting the difficulty that supporters were having traveling to the arena.\n“So I didn’t know what came with this position, and I didn’t know that they closed down the roads around the stadium for an hour and a half,” he said, thanking the crowd “for being so patient.”\n“I’m here today for one main reason: to say thank you to Ohio,” Trump told the crowd. “Thank you. We won the state by almost 10 points, which they say is totally unheard of.”\nAdvertisement\nTrump relished reminding the boisterous crowd of his election opponent Hillary Clinton, noting that “we had a lot of fun fighting Hillary Clinton.” He smiled broadly but did not react to the crowd’s chants of “Lock her up!” that followed.\nThose who attended expressed pride in his election and hope that the president-elect would be able to make good on his promise to make the country better.\n“He wasn’t originally my guy, but the more he spoke, the more he spoke to what rural America, what we want, it was just down to earth,” said Kim Pollack, 50, who took a break from her two jobs and drove two hours to attend her first Trump rally.\nIt was a familiar scene, with hundreds of Trump’s supporters lined up outside the arena. Volunteers clad in red shirts handed out “Trump/Pence” signs. The pre-rally soundtrack, heavy on Elton John and the Rolling Stones, rotated through the songs heard during the campaign. The crowd chanted “drain the swamp.”\nThe main difference: the lectern at center stage, which now had a big, bold “USA” where the name “TRUMP” used to be.\nAs president-elect, Trump has at times seemed frustrated by criticism of his business conflicts and his loss in the popular vote. But at the rally, Trump was once again in good spirits, feeding off the fervor in the crowd. He had just come from Indianapolis, where he celebrated his involvement in Carrier’s decision to keep about 1,000 jobs in Indiana.\nThe president-elect plans several more rallies in the next two weeks, most in swing states where his surprise victories helped power him to victory in the Electoral College. But aides to Trump have been quick to correct anyone who refers to the trips as a “victory tour,” calling them instead a “thank you” tour. They say it is an opportunity for Trump to get back out in the country and connect with those who helped elect him president.\nHis selection of Cincinnati was a nod to one of his most resounding victories. The president-elect won by about 8 percentage points in Ohio.\nTrump’s campaign often pointed to the size of his rallies as indications that the polls were wrong and that there was a “movement” afoot. Yet his tour is an unusual move for a president-elect. Most do not return so quickly to the campaign trail, especially while key Cabinet positions remain unfilled. While Trump has moved more quickly than his predecessor to announce nominations, he has yet to reveal his pick for secretary of state.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Jan Ransom Globe Staff December 02, 2016\nThe state’s highest court Thursday let stand a ruling that the Boston Police Department was wrong when it fired six officers after their hair tested positive for drugs — the only evidence the agency had showing drug use.\n“You can’t use hair testing as a stand-alone basis to terminate somebody,” said Alan H. Shapiro, who represents the officers in the state case. “I’m extremely heartened that the courts upheld that decision.”\nAdvertisement\nA lower court and the state’s Civil Service Commission had said the department’s hair tests are not reliable enough to support terminating an employee without additional evidence. That conclusion was supported by an appeals court in October.\nThe Supreme Judicial Court on Thursday declined the police department’s request to review the lower court rulings.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here The six officers had tested positive for cocaine, but they provided evidence to the Civil Service Commission showing the tests were wrong.\nThe lower courts, however, upheld the termination of four other officers who tested positive for drugs between 2001 and 2006.\nThere was a “a lack of general acceptance in the scientific and law enforcement communities, and a lack of universally recognized industry standards” when it comes to testing hair for drugs, the appeals court noted.\nAdvertisement\nThe mandatory hair test replaced a urine test and is given annually a month before officers’ birthdays. Officers who fail the test can agree to participate in a drug rehabilitation program and are then subject to random urine tests.\nThe test is also being challenged in federal court on the basis that it is discriminatory because black officers’ hair texture makes them more susceptible to tests that wrongly identify drug use. Five of the officers whose jobs are set to be restored under the appeals court ruling are black men.\nOfficers of color have been challenging the test for more than a decade.\nThe police department and the mayor’s office are “reviewing next steps and exploring options,” officials said in statements Thursday.\nAttorneys representing the officers in the federal case say the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision not to hear from the department bolsters their cause.\n“This is now a strong favorable finding,” said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. “This will support many of the arguments we have been making concerning the inherent unreliability of drug screening through the hair test.”\nShapiro said the goal is to come up with an alternative to the hair test, which he said has recently led to a black officer testing positive for cocaine. That officer has said he never used drugs, Shapiro said.\n‘You can’t use hair testing as a stand-alone basis to terminate somebody.’\n“We need to negotiate a substitute for the use of the hair test as a basis to fire somebody when it’s not a legitimate way to take away somebody’s job,” Shapiro said.\nJan Ransom can be reached at jan.ransom@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nJacquelyn Martin/AP Photo\nSecretary of State John Kerry.\nBy Indira A.R. Lakshmanan December 01, 2016\nW hen John Kerry steps down as secretary of state, it will be with the knowledge that President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to undo with the stroke of his pen nearly every accord Kerry labored over for four years and logged 1.3 million miles to achieve: climate change, trade, Iran’s nuclear deal, restored ties with Cuba, sanctions on Russia, and more.\nTheir fate depends on whom the president-elect chooses to replace Kerry and whether Trump makes good on his rhetoric. But Kerry, who has done time in the loyal opposition before, says he isn’t giving up. Having traveled a few hundred thousand miles with him during his time as secretary, I can attest that Kerry at 72 has more energy than most people decades younger. He’s not saying if he’ll work with a global organization, a university, or the private sector, but whatever he does, he’ll fight for what was — before Trump — seven decades of largely bipartisan support for US leadership in global security and economics.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re going to have one hell of a debate over the course of the next few years . . . and I can promise you this . . . I am not going to go quietly into the night,’’ Kerry declared to raucous applause from the Women’s Foreign Policy Group, which gathered in Washington Tuesday for what was billed as a valedictory address. What they got instead was a cri de coeur not to toss hard-fought deals in the dustbin.\nHoarse from a cold, Kerry went on for an hour, warning that if Americans cut off the world, we’ll pay the price. Without naming Trump, he bemoaned blaming others for problems we’re “unwilling to address.” We’re fighting “a dragon called trade,” when the issue is “inequity”: lack of education, retraining, good wages, adequate Social Security benefits, a workers safety net, he said. Kerry cited a Brookings Institution report that, like plenty of other research, concluded that automation and technology (like robotics and 3-D printing), not trade, are behind 85 percent of manufacturing job losses in the US.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But Trump has seized upon on trade as the scapegoat, pledging on day one to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord negotiated by Barack Obama (and George W. Bush before him) to boost access for US exports, raise global labor standards, and prevent China from imposing its own rules. Trump has also vowed to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA — without mentioning (or perhaps even realizing) that we sell more American-made goods to Mexico and Canada than anywhere else.\nOn Iran, Trump has said he’d dismantle the nuclear deal much maligned by Republicans. Before the accord, Obama said Iran had enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb in two months; the agreement forced Iran to radically reduce its uranium stockpile, restrict other activities, and submit to intrusive monitoring. Scrapping it “doesn’t compute under any reasonable standard of common sense,” Kerry argued — a notion echoed this week by CIA Director John Brennan.\nKerry also stressed the importance of the United States contributing to a better world, citing the long-term payoff our postwar rebuilding efforts in Europe and Japan had in fostering strong allies, and more recent efforts like funding education for girls in Afghanistan. The US isn’t a poor nation, Kerry said, and shouldn’t act like one by cutting the mere 1 percent of the budget that goes to foreign aid.\nAdvertisement\nBut he saved his most passionate defense for climate accords like the Paris deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That’s not surprising: My first interview with Kerry, 19 years ago, was at climate talks in Kyoto, Japan, when he was already deeply concerned about the threat to the planet.\nHis arguments are unlikely to get traction with Trump, who disdains nation-building and promotes a narrow, transactional view of US interests. But you can’t fault Kerry for taking Dylan Thomas’s advice to “not go gentle into that good night.”\nIndira A.R. Lakshmanan is a Washington columnist. Follow her on Twitter @Indira_L .",

      "title": "Android malware Gooligan affects over 1 million Google accounts : News, News - India Today",
      "text": "Last Updated: DEC 01, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nRemember Ghost Push? The malware that started threatening all Android devices about two years ago has come back to haunt the global Android community. Google has verified the existence of a new variant of the Ghost Push malware named Gooligan. The malware was first discovered by Check Point, a security research firm. The report says that over 1 million Google accounts could have been affected by the threat and the number is increasing with about 13,000 account breaches every day. \nAccording to Checkpoint, the malware infects devices and steals information that further helps it to access data from Gmail, Google Play, Google Photos, Google Docs, G Suit, Google Drive and more. \nAdrian Ludwig, director of Android security at Google, confirmed the Checkpoint report and said that his team is working closely with the security firm. How does Gooligan work? Gooligan is a variant of a family of malware called Ghost Push. In simpler words, Ghost Push is a collection of harmful apps, which usually find their way to Android devices through downloads from third-party app sites. Once installed, these apps secretly download other apps, which are not visible to the user. Also read: How to protect you data and avoid being hacked \nOnce these other apps, which are phishing campaigns, work with the original malware to collect user's data including account authentication tokens. All this while, the malware stays in contact with its maker. And you guessed it right, all your information is sent to this hacker sitting at a remote location. Who is affected? \nAccording to the findings, the affected devices run on Android 5 and lower. Unfortunately, 74 per cent of the Android devices in the market are running on these Android versions. Of these affected devices 57 per cent are in Asia, 19 per cent in the US, 15 per cent in Africa and 9 per cent are in Europe. \nLudwig has said that the company hasn't found any \"signs of other fraudulent activity within the affected Google accounts\". He says that the aim of Gooligan could possibly be app promotion and not steal information. Also read: Love your Android phone? Never click yes on this pop-up How to know if you are affected? \nCheckpoint has created a website, www.gooligan.checkpoint.com, to check if your Android devices is affected or not. Here is what to do if you device is one of the affected ones: \n-- The best course of action is to flash your device, which means a clean installation of the operating system. If you are sure you can do it, go ahead, else take the phone a technician. \n-- Once you have a clean Android, change your Google account password immediately. \nThese steps will ensure some level of safety for now, but for future we strongly suggest you to: \n-- NEVER install any app that is not coming from a verified developer. \n-- Not to click on pop-up ads. \n-- Not to open mails that are coming from unknown sources or are coming from a suspicious ID. \n-- To keep changing passwords on all accounts, which means Facebook, Google, Twitter and the likes.

      "title": "Getting lost near the Kremlin? Russia could be 'GPS spoofing' 2,",
      "text": "Getting lost around the Kremlin? Russia could be 'GPS spoofing' Google maps Earlier this year, reports started to surface on Russian media of a strange phenomenon. In certain areas of central Moscow, mostly within sight of the Kremlin walls, satellite signals were scrambled. Instead of showing true locations, people's phones were showing them almost 20 miles away at Vnukovo airport. On a recent assignment to Moscow, I stood on a bridge less than a mile from the Kremlin and watched Google Maps on my iPhone focus on that same airport -- about a 45-minute drive away from me. Nothing I did would reset it. \nRussian internet users have been reporting similar occurrences since the summer. Recently, CNN's Moscow bureau photojournalist Jeff Kehl incurred an extra 700 rouble charge (about $10.50) on a ride close to the Kremlin because the Uber driver's GPS device thought they had travelled from Vnukovo airport, and charged him the airport's flat fee. In fact, Kehl's Uber was never near the airport, and had only travelled within central Moscow, near the Kremlin. (Uber refunded him the next day.) \nThe Kremlin vs. drones. \nThere has been no official confirmation from the Russian authorities that they are behind this. Speaking to Russian news agency TASS in October, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had also experienced the signal jump while driving, but referred all queries to the Russian Federal Protection Service, which is charged with protecting the Kremlin. That agency would not comment. \nTodd Humphreys, a professor at the Radionavigation Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin and a leading authority on GPS security, says this is a clear example of GPS \"spoofing.\" Unlike jamming, which denies access to a signal, spoofing is when a louder signal is created to fool devices into thinking they are somewhere else. \nRelated: Russia has banned LinkedIn \nCommercial drones -- which have recording and surveillance capabilities -- have become increasingly popular. Humphreys is one of several experts we spoke to who are convinced this is an effort by the Kremlin to deter drones from flying overhead. Many commercial drones have no-fly-zones -- like airports -- pre-programmed in, so using the airport as a decoy would force the drone to reroute or land. \nHowever, Humphreys says this is a risky tactic. Last year, after a drone landed on the White House lawn, Humphreys testified before Congress and advised them against doing something similar. With Reagan National Airport just five miles from the White House, he felt the risk that aircraft could also be \"spoofed\" as they take off or come in to land was too great. They could land in the wrong place, or be redirected into the path of other aircraft. Moscow's airports are further away, but Humphreys believes there's still a risk. \nHow far does the \"spoofing\" go? \nWhile no one has produced a comprehensive map of how far and wide this strange GPS activity extends, Grigory Bakunov, an employee at Russian internet giant Yandex, conducted his own experiment earlier this year. He took his Segway out around central Moscow with a collection of devices that detect GPS signals. He found that maps were intermittently affected -- the location shifted sporadically to Vnukovo airport. He found the incorrect signal was strongest the closer he came to the Kremlin walls, and weakened further away. \nHow easy is it to pull off? \nFirst of all, it's illegal in the U.S. to spoof or jam GPS signals. And globally, UN members (including Russia) have agreed to the regulations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) -- one of which is the protection of GPS signals. (Although Humphreys notes that \"the ITU norms don't have much teeth by themselves.\") \nHowever, experts say that the technology needed to spoof a signal is actually becoming more readily available. \nRelated: Dubai deploys a 'drone hunter' to keep its airport open \nLogan Scott, a consultant specializing in systems signals, says this can be achieved with a GPS signal generator -- these are manufactured as testing equipment and can be bought online. To create the effect observed around the Kremlin, says Scott, all someone would need to do would be to take one of these generators, attach an amplifier and antenna and start broadcasting. \nIf this was the Kremlin's doing though, experts say they may not have needed to go shopping for generators. Over the past few years, Russia has invested heavily in electronic warfare, says Sim Tack, a senior analyst at Stratfor and expert in the Russian military. There were widespread reports of signal jamming in eastern Ukraine, and just this summer, Russia unveiled a new device it had developed called the Pole-21, which can be attached to cell towers and used to jam GPS signals. \nCNNMoney (New York)   2, 2016: 4:34 AM ET",

Image: Landsat/Copernicus/Google Earth \nIf you’ve ever been captivated by ants hard at work maintaining their colonies, you may want to check out Google Earth Engine’s Timelapse , an interactive tool that generates views of Earth over long periods. Originally launched in 2013, Timelapse rolled out its largest update ever this week; the application now includes imagery captured from the past four years, and sharper resolution for existing data acquired from 1984 to 2016. \nThis means that users can select any region of the planet, and watch it change over 32 years from the perspective of our Earth-observation satellites. Centers of urban development show a particularly obvious and dramatic shift, sprouting out new communities and industrial centers that take root in surrounding spaces. \nTake this timelapse of the San Francisco Bay Area from 1984 to 2016, which covers the eastern span replacement of the Oakland Bay Bridge from 2002 to 2013.",

It's an Apple drone! \nExpect to be saying that more in the future, as Apple launches drones to improve its Maps app, which has long been thought of as playing second fiddle to Google's more robust map app. Well, now Apple is aiming to finally close that gap, and they will be using drones to do it. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we get a little lost. \nWhat exactly is happening? Shrey Pacheco has the background : Apple may be planning on take on Google’s extensive mapping services by using drones. According to a report...the company is putting together a team of robotics and data collection experts...this team will use drones to capture and update its map information faster than its existing fleet of minivans. \nAnd how will the drones create a better Maps? Mark Gurman and Alan Levin have the details : Apple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction...The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users. ... Since Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by...updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber...and OpenTable...The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort. \nAny details on how exactly Apple is going to use these drones? Not a whole lot, but Mike Murphy tells us what he knows : Apple was granted permission to fly drones by the...FAA in March...The company’s original application to the FAA does not go into much detail...saying just that they would do “aerial data collection, photography, and videography.” ... Apple’s...application says it intends to use 11 different models of drones—some quadcopters, some fixed-wing drones—to capture information...There is no indication that Apple intends to build its own drones. \nAren't there a bunch of restictions on drone flying, though? Lee Mathews knows what's up : There are several caveats: drones must be flown by professionals who remain within the line of sight, flying is mostly limited to daylight hours, and...drones aren’t supposed to...fly over people or buildings. \nSo how is Apple supposed to update Maps with those limitations? April Glaser might know : Right now...it's illegal to fly drones over populated areas and near airports, although the rules are still being written...This month the FAA is expected to release a proposal for new rules that would dictate how drones will be allowed to fly over people. If Apple truly does hope to use drones to improve Maps, the company will...have to get involved in the FAA rulemaking process. \nIs Apple improving Maps in any other ways? Tonya Riley fills us in : More than...enhancing its outdoor maps, Apple is...advancing an indoor mapping system for public places like museums and airports, though that probably won’t involve drones whizzing by your face. \nSo when will these changes start to roll out to users? Jake Smith has that info : If all goes to plan, Apple is expected to launch the new...features in 2017. Apple is...focused on improving in-car navigation, as well. One feature will offer better guidance for changing lanes while driving. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "Why didn't Google make Chromebooks a priority this holiday season? Google remains committed to the platform, but things have been awfully quiet lately. Share Save \nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, and the holiday shopping season is in full swing. As such, Google, Microsoft and Apple have all revealed their latest and greatest to get shoppers opening their wallets. Microsoft has the Surface Studio and refreshed Surface Book , not to mention the Xbox holiday lineup, while Apple goes into holiday battle with the new MacBook Pro and the iPhone 7 . \nGoogle is trying something different this year. The company has a full ecosystem of products made in-house for the first time: the Pixel smartphone , Google Home assistant and Daydream VR headset . All three products are important to Google's strategy, but it feels to me like something's missing: the humble Chromebook. Google's more traditional computing platform has gone neglected this fall, and it's especially surprising in light of a few big developments this year. \nThe first was a report from IDC claiming that Chromebooks outsold Macs in the first quarter of the year. Yes, that's just one isolated data point, but it shows that there's a market for Chromebooks, and that market is growing. The second development was Google's announcement that Android apps would come to Chromebooks this year . That would solve two of the platform's big weaknesses : the lack of traditional applications and the Chromebook's limited offline capabilities. \nBut the rollout of Google Play on Chromebooks has been stilted at best. Only three models have full support as of today, more than six months after Google first announced the feature. There are a few more that can run Android apps if you use the developer version of Chrome OS , but ultimately this isn't a selling point Google can use to drive interest in the platform. Indeed, the company doesn't mention the feature at all on its Chromebook website or in its online store. Based on my experiences using Android on Chromebooks, that's because the experience isn't quite yet ready for prime time. There's no sense in launching a half-baked feature, but I had assumed it would be ready to go by the end of this year. \nIt's hard to see this as anything but a missed opportunity. Android is the most popular mobile OS by a wide margin , and being able to use the same apps on both your mobile phone and Chromebook would bring a nice layer of integration to the two platforms. But this non-launch means that consumers aren't aware of this potentially important feature and developers have zero incentive to consider Chromebooks when building apps. \nGoogle is dropping the ball from a hardware perspective as well. The Chromebook Pixel 2 was discontinued at the end of August with no replacement in site. Sure, that computer was never a practical buy , but similar to what the Nexus program did for phones, it provided manufacturers and developers inspiration when building their own Chromebooks. Other manufacturers have picked up the slack to some extent, but I'm surprised Google appears to have given up making its own Chrome OS hardware. \nThe hardware gulf shows up in Google's online store too. Right now, you can only buy three different Chromebooks -- all from Acer, two with 11-inch screens and large boat anchor with a 14-inch screen. It seems extremely strange that you cannot visit Google's store and buy a Chromebook with the ever-popular 13-inch screen size. \nOne possible explanation for the apparent de-prioritization of Chromebooks at Google could be that the company is fully merging Chrome OS with Android, as various rumors have suggested over the years. The most recent rumor claims a merged Android / Chrome OS will power the next Pixel laptop planned to arrive sometime next year. That would certainly explain the silence, and an announcement of that magnitude would likely wait for the next I/O event in late spring. But that's still another six months from now, not that the timeframe really matters if Google is moving on from Chrome OS. \nIt's too soon to know what Google's plan is, but a Google spokesperson confirmed that the company \"remains committed to Chrome OS and Chromebooks.\" The spokesperson also said that Google is seeing great momentum for the platform, particularly in the education market. And given that nearly all Chromebooks are made by OEM partners, there's logic to keeping this fall's big launch event focused on the \"Made by Google\" products. But the company it isn't giving up on Chromebooks, that makes the lack of new hardware this fall all the more strange. \nThat's particularly true given that Google has been closing the gap with Apple, a company whose laptop situation is clearly a bit out of whack right now. A Chromebook is clearly a different class of device than a MacBook Pro, but that's beside the point. If Google isn't giving customers good devices to buy and making big advances like Android apps a priority, Chromebooks will continue to have a hard time shaking the old \"it's only a browser\" stigma.",

While learning how to write content to best support your marketing goals, the golden ticket is what to write, week-after-week, that will drive people organically, over time, more and more, to your website.\nWhat to Write? It’s diabolically simple. I have at least a dozen topics that you can write immediately. And, even better, all of these posts will most certainly be as germane and bespoke to you and your business. What’s more, they will be just about as evergreen as you’re likely to ever get. And it’s so simple you’re going to kick yourself.\nWrite At Least One Blog Post for Every Page of Your Website You heard me. Very few websites allow for long-form journalism, the kind of in-depth expository that allows your visitors and your readers to really grok and unlock everything you do, including all the remedials, backstories, answers to frequently asked questions, individual insights, and even your personal interpretation, spin, e nglish . Expounding upon your products, services, and talent can both seriously woo Google (because Noogle AKA New Google loves long-form content these days) and also seduce your prospects into understanding that you’re not a bottom-feeder, that you’re not a commodity and that you and your products and services are worth way more than fairish market rate. The long and short of it is, start with writing a blog post based on every single page of your current website. Go do it!\nExamples can include absolutely anything.\nExpertise: a deeper dive into your expertise as a person or as a company is always the first thing anyone goes to when it comes to content marketing. Showing off one’s analysis of the current state of the art is the favorite go-to — but it’s really hard to keep up that sort of insightful brilliance day-after-day, week-after-week. That’s why people get some serious writer’s block when they’re tasked with populating an entire content-marketing blog that, like a bakery, starts going stale the moment you post your last article. Staff/Team/Partners: one of the best sources of a rich biosphere of content and diverse keywords comes from your staff. Two of the easiest: employee interviews and guest posts by employees. Start there and other variations of including your team in your content strategy will open like a flower. Just be sure to not edit out who they are. If you are too harsh with your red pen, you’ll both dispirit your employee to ever blog again and you’ll also ruin the natural language of their particular writing site. Biodiversity is seriously essential. Monocultures are vulnerable and true polycultural environments are much more resistant to pathogens, where pathogens are represented by the fickle and volatile shifting sands of Google’s algorithm. Allow as many diverse voices and writing styles and names and authors to exist on your blog as possible, just be sure not to edit all the diversity out of them before you click publish. Products & Services: I guarantee you that all the copy on your website is completely devoid of color, diversity, humor, and subjective tone. It sort of has to be because there’s a formula, an expected uniformity and professionalism that results in copy-by-committee, bureaucratic drivel that checks all the boxes but compels neither human nor machine (as in Google , Bing , and even Yahoo! ). What you can do, via a blog, is do what I do every week: noodle around, let the keyboard take me where it might. I yell out to my Amazon Echo, “Alexa, remind me to write about what to blog about.” And then on Tuesday morning I try not to think too much about it. The words just tumble out and the lovely Eileen and Madeline do just a little bit of reigning in. In my agency, products and services are pretty much the same thing. History: every single person in the world loves to hear origin stories. Become a superhero to your prospective clients! Backstage: people really love process. When I was a professional stock photographer, people seemed to me to care more about my process, my origin story, my ASAs, film speed (yes, film, and Fuji 100 slide film was my go-to), camera body, lenses, and even the bag I used (Domke F-2) before they spent too much time looking at my images. Artists who have an interesting, tragic, spiritual, impoverished, or human-journey-inspired process almost always sell more art and for more money than often better artists who just sit in their studios, sober and sane, doing their taxes and books, raising a loving family. Who wants to spend $1.2M on something their kindergartner could probably do if it’s not the direct result of Angel-inspired, drug-addled, genius. People don’t only want to know how the sausage is made, they demand it! Clients: with the approval of your current and past clients, and with a sweet text link and a hearty thank you, you can probably write so much good stuff about work with your client that are a lot more free-verse than the almost unreadable clap-trap that ends up when you stuff all the months and years of collaboration and partnership into the terribly formulaic Case Study or Testimonial format. Get personal. Your clients really do want to become your work BFFs . The more work BFFs they have, the more they can play and recreate on the clock and the expense account. You dig? I Am Assuming You Like Writing So many people make excuses as to why they can’t, won’t, or don’t blog. First they start out with “why should I blog,” to “how do I blog?” Then they move on to “what do I blog about.” When you scratch past this, you’ll discover that, for whatever reason, they really don’t want to blog. It could be that blogging is below their pay grade (only trolls, who live in their mother’s basement, blog), it could be that they really don’t know how or don’t like writing. Or, the longer-form stuff really makes them too self-conscious or open to ridicule, to judgement (“Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue” — Proverbs 17:28). Or, no matter how true this is, or how beneficial the time spent will reward them, there’s the “I’m too busy to blog” ploy. It’s all bullshit and always leads to something else. It means you need to find someone else who is passionate, excited, and enthusiastic about it. Either in your own organization or from somewhere else. A ghostwriter, if you will.\n",

      "text": "Comments Share \nResearchers from Google’s DeepMind and the University of Oxford developed a deep learning system that outperformed a professional lip reader. \nUsing a TITAN X GPU , CUDA and the TensorFlow deep learning framework, the team trained their models on over 100,000 sentences from nearly 5,000 hours of BBC programs. By looking at each speaker’s lips, the system accurately deciphered entire phrases, with examples including “We know there will be hundreds of journalists here as well” and “According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics”. \nThe AI system annotated about 50% of the words without any errors, compared to the professional who annotated just 12.4%. \nx \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aogzAUPilE \n“We believe that machine lip readers have enormous practical potential, with applications in improved hearing aids, silent dictation in public spaces (Siri will never have to hear your voice again) and speech recognition in noisy environments,” says Yannis Assael, who is working on a similar deep learning system called LipNet which is being trained on an NVIDIA DGX-1 .

      "text": "SHARES \nBig companies take care of their interns. \nAccording to a recent poll , Facebook can pay interns up to $8,000 a month, while Snapchat has offered interns as much as $9,000 a month. Plus, many major companies also offer interns a housing stipend. \nThe poll was conducted by Jesse Collins, who is finishing up his final semester at Purdue University and will be working for Seattle-based start-up Curalate post graduation. He asked nearly 600 new graduates and interns about offers received for start dates in 2017. He got 290 responses from new grads and 298 from interns. \nThe findings were making the rounds on Friday after Collins, who conducted similar research last year, posted the data on Twitter and various tech community sites, including a Reddit subgroup and the Facebook page Hackathon Hackers. \nCollins provided CNBC with the full data set, which we've used below to highlight the salary and housing stipend per month that interns can earn at 15 major companies.
