      "title": "How Amazon made its jewellery stock rock",
      "text": "Add to myFT How Amazon made its jewellery stock rock The retailer’s head of jewellery, Julian Exposito-Bader, has had a tough task enchanting the trade Read next: by: Rachael Taylor \nWhen Julian Exposito-Bader joined Amazon as head of buying for watches and jewellery in the UK, he was baffled: “Like everybody, I used Amazon for lots of things, but I was like — who is buying all these diamonds?” \nAmazon UK had been selling jewellery, mostly diamond engagement rings and wedding bands, for five years when Mr Exposito-Bader joined in 2012. The Ecuadorean had had a long and varied buying career that included sourcing children’s books for the now-defunct Borders, stationery for WH Smith and food for Marks and Spencer. \nBut Amazon lacked credibility within the industry. Through a charm offensive over the past four years he has convinced the sector that the site is not just a go-to for budget books and discount electronics, but can also sell jewels worth thousands of pounds. \nHe soon came to understand his core customer. “Men tend to be quite lazy,” he laughs. “When you buy an engagement ring, it’s a technical purchase. If you know the carat and the size, you type it in and, voila, a diamond comes up that is exactly what you want. And the beauty of buying from Amazon is that if she says no, you can send it back — it takes the risk away.” \nWhile the bridal offer was strong for these unromantic reasons, Mr Exposito-Bader felt the site was lacking a more fashionable jewellery offering and wanted to bring stylish brands onboard. The trouble was convincing designers with delicate egos and pricey products that it would not be the brand-killing, bargain-basement scenario they envisioned. “It was tough,” says Mr Exposito-Bader. “People are afraid of what they don’t know and back then people didn’t know we did jewellery, but once you get one brand in, the dam breaks.” \nThat important first brand was cult costume jeweller Mawi. The fashionable crowd are willing to spend £500 on an oversized necklace made from base metal and Swarovski crystals. Mawi was reluctant, but Mr Exposito-Bader was gently persistent — and victorious. \nYou can see why this calibre of brand would be willing to spend time listening to his pleas. He is fun to be around, pleasantly conspiratorial, with a great sense of humour, but most importantly he is one of them: stylish, living in Dalston , creative London’s hub, with his fashion designer partner, he is the antithesis of the corporate behemoth the jewellers feared. He does not entirely bat this idea off. “They are not just going to do it because I’m a nice guy and they can go for a drink with me, there is also a commercial element.” \nThe beauty of buying from Amazon is that if your girlfriend says no, you can send the ring back Julian Exposito-Bader \nPlus, he had cash. Unlike many online-only retailers which will act as a shop window, requiring brands they promote to dispatch directly when sales are made, Amazon UK bought all the jewellery and watches it sells through the site. (This excludes jewellery from seller-operated accounts; Mr Exposito-Bader has no responsibility for this.) “We buy everything,” he says. “It is a risk, but it’s one worth taking. Every brand I buy, I believe in, and it’s our duty to make those brands work. It’s the right thing to do. I see retailers that work with a brand for one or two seasons and then drop them — it’s appalling.” \nWhile Amazon keeps its cards close to its chest regarding specific figures, it will confirm that Amazon Fashion, under which jewellery and watches fall, is one of its fastest growing categories. One jewellery manufacturer that works with Amazon describes Mr Exposito-Bader’s visits as rare times when “the red carpet is rolled out”. A watch distribution group described selling to Amazon as a “brilliant experience”. \nThere have been high-profile successes too. Last year, Amazon offered an exclusive line of Hotlips rings by London jeweller Solange Azagury-Partridge, ex-creative director of Boucheron. These colourful lacquer pouts are a signature design of Ms Azagury-Partridge’s and sell for thousands of pounds when made of gold, yet Amazon shoppers suddenly had access to them for just £69 in silver. \nMore interesting is that these rings were sold alongside her top-end jewels, which Amazon also bought in. The most expensive is a Vices and Virtues gold and diamond ring that you can add to your basket with a click for £18,500. \nThe jewellery industry seems to be coming around to the idea of Amazon as a luxury retailer. But the barriers of the luxury watch industry have been more resolute. While you can buy timepieces by the likes of Rolex, Cartier and IWC (the priciest is a yellow gold Rolex Sky-Dweller at £40,000), these are sold through third-party suppliers. The offer curated by Amazon Fashion is centred on more accessible brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Gucci. \n“I went to my first Baselworld [watch fair] four years ago and I saw brands like Rolex and Patek Philippe, and you speak to them and they say they don’t need any more sales,” he says. \nAmazon’s offer has since broadened to mainstream Swiss-made brands like Citizen and Bulova, and also has a strong focus on fashionable minimalist brands such as Uniform Wares and Daniel Wellington. \nWhile Mr Exposito-Bader’s recent promotion to head buyer for jewellery across the whole of Europe has taken him away from watches day-to-day, he still fosters a hope that the watch industry may become more “democratic”, a word he uses to define the varied offer under his curation, as well as the next generation’s shopping habits. “Eventually, if we do Rolex, then happy days,” he says. “I’ll buy them.”  ",

      "text": "Amazon Has to Pay You Back for Purchases Your Kids Made Without Permission Kate Storey From Redbook Good news for any parents who've gotten a credit card bill chock-full of purchases from games their kids were playing on the iPad or smart phone. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled Amazon has to reimburse parents for purchases kids made in-app without permission, according to NBC News . The case was brought by the Federal Trade Commission, which accused Amazon of making it too easy for kids to rack up charges while playing games like \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices. The FTC estimated a whopping $86 million of unauthorized charges. Amazon will start the year-long reimbursement process early next year by alerting parents of their eligibility for refunds and then reimbursing them. According to the report, Amazon has already improved password protocols and other controls to stop unauthorized purchases. Hooray!",

      "text": "wtvd  13PM Friday's highly anticipated release of the NES Classic left many shoppers disappointed due to a lack of stock of the retro console.The NES Classic is a miniature version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) from 1985. The miniature console has 30 pre-installed games and comes with one controller.Demand for the console was so high that it crashed Amazon's website. The online retailer was set to sell the NES Classic at 2 p.m. PST.

Tried buying NES Classic, add to cart, cart empty. Now page is unreachable — Matt Rowe (@TVsMattRowe) November 11, 2016 Earlier in the day, Nintendo fans lined up at stores across the U.S. to purchase the console.

      "text": "Nintendowned: Amazon sells out of the NES Classic Edition in (null) seconds \nTake a Chapman Stick , add a lot of tech in its belly and jam a USB cable up its jacksie and you get something that looks vaguely like an INSTRUMENT 1. It’s a completely new type of musical instrument developed by Artiphon . Funded through a seven-figure Kickstarter campaign , the instrument is shipping now, and we can’t wait to see what people will be creating with it. \nThe campaign has seen a number of setbacks and delays, mostly around a familiar theme: Going from prototype to mass manufacturing is really hard. Trying to figure out how to work with manufacturing partners, especially, can be tremendously difficult, as the company’s letter to its Kickstarter backers a few days ago explains. It looks like the problems are now a thing of the past, however, and the company’s INSTRUMENT 1 is now available to order for a surprisingly modest $400. \nTrying to explain what the instrument actually is is easier said than done. It can be played as a guitar or as a keyboard, but it also has pressure sensitivity and an accelerometer built in, which can add a layer of creativity on top. In fact, just watch the video to get a feeling for why musicians are both scratching their heads and wetting themselves with excitement over this new cornucopia of creativity. \nTo play the instrument, you can use the companion app that helps you pick sounds, tunings and so on. It’s also MIDI-compatible, which makes it compatible with a big fat pile of mobile and desktop apps for creative music creation, including GarageBand, Animoog, SampleTank, Ableton Live, ProTools, Logic, Mainstage and many others. \nIt is actually quite hard to know what to make of the product. In fact, even watching professional musicians trying it out for the first time is pretty funny. They recognize there is a new wave of creative potential hidden somewhere in there, but they also know that there’s a very definite learning curve to get to grasps with a brand new instrument. INSTRUMENT 1 delivers a steep learning curve, but also potentially boundless creativity. \nThe only song you aren’t allowed to play on it is Stairway to Heaven. Stairway, Denied! OK, just kidding, you can , and it shows off the versatility of the INSTRUMENT 1 beautifully, to boot. \nEarly reports suggest that INSTRUMENT 1 is a jack of all trades. We can’t wait to see whether it becomes the master of a new generation of musicians, too. Timed perfectly for Christmas, we wouldn’t be surprised if this little beauty makes it to the wish lists of many a geeky musician around the world this year. 0",

      "text": "\n* Managing board member dismisses Amazon threat \n* Optimistic for Black Friday, Christmas sales \n* Sales growth slows in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (Adds comments from board member, analyst, shares) \nBy Emma Thomasson \nBERLIN, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Zalando, Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, reported higher profit in the third quarter despite a slowdown in sales growth as unusually warm weather put shoppers off buying winter gear. \nZalando confirmed it expects sales growth for 2016 to come in at the upper end of a 20-25 percent range and managing board member Rubin Ritter said he was optimistic for trading around the Black Friday sales event on Nov. 25 and the Christmas season. \n\"We are looking forward to a great fourth quarter,\" he told journalists on a conference call. \nGermany's HDE retail association this week gave a bullish forecast for the Christmas period, forecasting ecommerce sales would rise 12 percent to 12.3 billion euros. \nZalando reported third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) of 19.5 million euros ($21.3 million), beating average analyst forecasts for 15.7 million and giving an adjusted margin of 2.3 percent. \nZalando shares, which were hit on Monday by a downgrade to \"sell\" by UBS analysts, were up 2.5 percent by 0830 GMT. \n\"Margin was slightly better than we had expected at 2.3 percent versus our expectation of 2.0 percent and we expect investors will be reassured by the reiteration of full year sales guidance,\" said Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman, who has an \"Outperform\" rating on the stock. \nZalando confirmed a new forecast it gave last month for a 2016 adjusted EBIT margin of 5.0 to 6.0 percent, with profitability helped by more efficient logistics and marketing. \nUBS analysts warned this week that Zalando will need to increase marketing to maintain sales growth as Amazon steps up investment in fashion, especially given the U.S. ecommerce giant's strong brand, more categories, bigger scale and its Prime membership scheme. \nRitter dismissed those concerns on Thursday, saying that Amazon was more focused on older season and basic items, compared with Zalando's offering of the latest fashions. \n\"We are serving a much more fashionable customer looking for a curated assortment and recommendations... not an 'everything' store,\" Ritter said, \nZalando's quarterly sales rose 17.1 percent to 835 million euros, down from 25 percent the previous quarter, with the growth rate slowing sharply in its core Germany, Austria and Switzerland region to 9.7 percent from 34.4 percent a year ago.

These super-accurate open-back 'phones are also ultra-comfortable, so you can wear them over long listening sessions.

If you're hungry for premium sound, these 'phones are sure to satisfy! ",

      "title": "Black Friday 2016 Deals And Ads: Sam’s Club’s Pre-Black Friday Nov. 12 Sale Starts Tonight — Is It Worth Shopping Compared To Walmart and Amazon Sales?",
      "text": "\nWith Black Friday 2016 exactly two weeks away, numerous stores are holding pre-Black Friday sales. While some of these events offer comparable sales to what will be available on Thanksgiving and the day after, many of them provide no better prices than what you can find throughout the year.\nSam’s Club will hold their annual one-day sale on November 12, and there are a variety of intriguing items. The sale begins online at 12:01 a.m. tonight, and traditional brick-and-mortar locations will open at 7 a.m. While Black Friday is still going to be an important day for many shoppers, tonight’s sale at Sam’s Club should allow many to check a few very important items off of their holiday shopping lists.\nA full listing of the sale items can be found at BestBlackFriday.com , but here are the top deals from the ad.\nDisclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership.\n[Image via Sam’s Club] As the screenshot shows, Sam’s Club is stating that this sale will have the “lowest prices of the season.” They use this terminology a lot to describe sales, but it has historically been true on this particular one. Limited quantities are available on every item and there are no rain checks, so it is important to arrive at your local club at 7 a.m. If you are shopping online, you should be on the Sam’s Club website by midnight tonight.\nYou can view the entire 20-page Sam’s Club One-Day Event ad at Savings.com .\nItems for the Home \nAny King Serta Perfect Sleeper Mattress for $200 Off Any Queen Serta Perfect Sleeper Mattress for $100 Off Franklin Theater Chair for $299 (save $50) Member’s Mark by Tramontina 15-pc.

Unfortunately, there is not a general rule for their free shipping policy, so it is going to depend on the specific item. For example, a chair for $299 will not shop for free, but a pet bed for $15 will qualify for free shipping.\nThat is a pretty major drawback for some of the items in this sale, and you should steer clear of them if you are shopping online. Visiting your local Sam’s Club brick-and-mortar location and purchasing any items that do not qualify for free shipping can protect your discount.\nComparisons to Black Friday \nMany of the items in this sale are comparable to Black Friday prices, but some of them fall short. One example is the PlayStation 4 Call of Duty Black Ops III 500GB bundle. It is available for $249.99, which is a discount of $50 from the retail price of $299.99. While this is still a solid bargain, you may be better off waiting until Black Friday for a new PlayStation 4 Slim bundle.\nThe PlayStation 4 Slim is new for 2016, and many of the bundles are also available for $249.99. Some retailers, notably Kohl’s, are even including store cash with their PlayStation 4 bundles, so it makes even more sense to wait until Black Friday. Regardless, if this is the game that you want, you should buy it at Sam’s Club because this will not be a common bundle this year on Black Friday.\nAnother interesting deal is the Xbox One S bundle with Battlefield 1, Gears of War 4, and an extra controller for $299, which is a savings of $120.99. Dell is offering this same bundle on Black Friday for $249.99, but it is likely to sell out extremely quickly, so there are no guarantees that you will be able to get it. Even though it is $50 more, it may be in your best interest to purchase it today as opposed to hoping to get it at Dell’s busy online sale.\nComparisons to Walmart and Amazon Pre-Black Friday Sales \nAmazon has already opened their “Black Friday Deals Store,” and Walmart has started offering online early bird specials. Additionally, those who have Walmart’s app can shop some of their Black Friday items today. While these sales sound exciting, they are more hype than anything. Of course, you can find a good deal or two on both websites, but many of the prices are what you are going to see throughout the year.\nThe Sam’s Club Nov. 12 sale is probably the closest thing you will see to Black Friday prices for the next two weeks.\n[Featured Image by Scott Olson/Getty Images]\nBlack Friday 2016 Deals And Ads: Sam’s Club’s Pre-Black Friday Nov. 12 Sale Starts Tonight â€” Is It Worth Shopping Compared To Walmart and Amazon Sales? is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "title": "Google Home Makes Its Debut",
      "text": "  10, 2016 in Consumer Electronics , IoT \nGoogle is going head-to-head with Amazon. The new Google Home device is pretty much a copy of the Amazon Echo that we reviewed last year . This makes for an interesting battle as these two major companies duke it out in the artificial intelligence home platform. \nDesign \nWhile the Amazon Echo is a 9” tall, 3” round black cylinder, the Google Home device is a bit shapelier. It is 5 ½” tall, shaped like a room freshener about 4” round at the bottom and 3” around at the slanted top. It has a two-tone look. My review unit has a white top and gray fabric base. The bottom half screws on so you can remove it and replace it with alternative bottoms that have different colors and textures. \nCapabilities \nThe Google Home sells for $129 so it is cheaper than the $179 for the Amazon Echo. Both have similar features. To communicate with Google Home, you simply say “Hey Google” or “OK Google”. Four small circular colored lights on the slanted top show you that Google is listening. Like Alexa, the voice of the Echo, Google can give you news, check your daily schedule, play games, tell corny jokes, play music, answer questions, and control home devices. Both have female voices that are slightly different, but similar in diction and vocal quality. \nSet Up \nSet up is simple. Just plug it in, install the new Google Home app on your phone or tablet, and connect to your home Wi-Fi. Unfortunately this Google app was difficult to navigate on an iPhone. It was, however, well laid out and much easier to use on a Pixel or other Android phone. \nSmarts \nAfter doing side-by-side testing, I found that both Echo’s Alexa and Google Home are smart. Home was able to answer some questions that Alexa missed and Alexa was able to answer come that Home missed. In general, Alexa seemed better at sports questions, while Home was better at foreign languages. Since both of these devices are constantly learning, it will be awhile before we can actually determine which is “smarter”. \nControl Home Devices \nGoogle Home currently works with Nest, Smart Things, Philips Hue and IFTTT. I tested it with my extensive line-up of Hue lights. It found all easily and controlled them quite well. However, the Echo, which just celebrated its second birthday, controls many, many more devices. Google Home could not connect with some of my other brands of lights and switches that the Echo can control. \nMusic \nThe audio quality of both devices is very similar. My untrained ears thought the Home device sounded slightly crisper and had a little more depth, but there is not a huge difference. Google Home can play Pandora, YouTube, Google Play, Tunein, and Spotify. It comes with a free six-month subscription to YouTube Red, but after that you have to pay about $10 a month for it. As you know, Spotify is very good, but also charges a monthly subscription fee. \nThe free Google Play has a limited number of songs, but lets you upload 50,000 tracks of your own music for free. \nIn comparison, the Echo can play 2 million ad-free songs with your Prime membership which also offers free-two day shipping and several other perks for $99 a year. \nMusic throughout the home \nThis is the one big feature that Google Home has over the Amazon Echo. Two or more Google Homes can sync the music so the same music can play throughout the home. If you have more than one Echo or Echo Dot, each can play different music at the same time, but they cannot sync. \nIf you add a $35 Chromecast Audio device to any speaker with an auxiliary audio port you can use the Google Home device to create groups and can sync the music throughout your home or in any groups that you specify. I plugged the Chromecast Audio into a Bose radio and used the app to group it with the Google Home device. The results were spectacular. \nFuture Development \nIt is obvious that the Amazon Echo had a two year lead on Google. Shortly after its release, Amazon created the Alexa Fund to provide up to $100 million in venture capital funding for companies working with Alexa’s voice technology. The result of that was a tremendous serge of new products that work with Alexa. Alexa is now being built into everything from ceiling fans to cars. See our article about Alexa at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show to see what a big impact this had. Google Assistant’s Actions on Google program will open up to developers in December. It will be interesting to see how much of a push they put behind this program. What they do here will determine how quickly Google Home catches up to the Amazon Echo. \nConclusion \nAt $129, Google Home is significantly cheaper than the $180 Echo, yet Amazon also offers the smaller Echo Dot for $49.The Dot is just as capable as the large Echo except it’s speakers are not as good and if you use it for music you will want to purchase a Bluetooth speaker or use a standard speaker with an audio jack. \nI must say that constantly calling the Home device “OK Google” was very tiresome. I felt like I was constantly doing an advertisement for Google. In comparison, talking to the Echo by calling the name “Alexa” did not bother me a bit and it made her feel like part of the family. One comfortable thing about the Home is that when you say “OK Google, Good Morning”, she will respond with weather, news, traffic and other personalized daily facts that you have chosen in the app. \nRight now the Amazon Echo has a big edge on Google Home, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. I really can only recommend Home if you are a big Google fan, a constant user of Chromecast devices, or love the music sync idea. \nYet, the price of admission to this new world of digital assistants is relatively low. You can buy an Echo Dot for $49 or a Google Home for $129. Both are fun and extremely useful. As time goes on, I expect each of these devices to just keep getting better and better. It will be interesting to see them each develop and to see who gets the final edge. Related Articles",

      "title": "Amazon Must Issue Refunds, Not Gift Cards, To Parents Unfairly Billed For Kids’ In-App Purchases – Consumerist",
      "text": "Amazon Must Issue Refunds, Not Gift Cards, To Parents Unfairly Billed For Kids’ In-App Purchases \nNovember 11, 2016 10:46 am EST By Chris Morran @themorrancave \nBack in April, a federal court ruled that Amazon had not done enough to alert Kindle Fire owners — and users of Amazon’s Android appstore — that “Free” apps could still allow kids to make costly in-app transactions , but the ruling left unresolved exactly how much Amazon would need to pay to make customers whole again. Yesterday, the judge in the case determined that wronged Amazon customers must need to actively claim their refund, and that Amazon could not pay the refund in site credit or gift cards. The TL;DR Version \n• In 2014, the FTC sued Amazon, alleging the company failed to curb in-app purchases by minors or alert parents to this potential problem. • In April 2016, the court sided with the FTC but still had to determine how to refund customers. • Amazon wanted to issue the refunds in the form of Amazon gift cards that would applied to customers’ accounts. • The judge ruled this week that Amazon must instead refund the money to its source, or send paper checks. • Amazon now has 90 days to begin emailing customers who may be eligible for refunds. \nThe Federal Trade Commission, which brought the complaint against Amazon in July 2014 , had argued to the court that Amazon should pay a lump sum of nearly $27 million that would then be doled out to affected users. \nHowever, the judge ruled yesterday [ PDF ] that there were too many questions about the way in which the government had arrived at those figures, and instead opted to go with a “notice-and-claims” process, wherein Amazon alerts potentially eligible customers via email that they may be due a refund. It will then be each customer’s responsibility to go to a dedicated page on the Amazon site to determine what, if any, refund they can receive. \nAmazon wanted to provide refunds in the form of digital “gift cards” that would be applied to customers’ accounts. Under the company’s proposal, a customer could instead receive a refund check by mail, but only if they requested it. \nThe FTC had problems with Amazon’s proposal. First, the agency argued that the retailer was being too restrictive on which in-app purchases were eligible for refunds. Amazon wanted to exclude in-app purchases that were made after a customer had already received a refund for a previous in-app transaction made by a child. The company also sought to exclude in-app purchases made during certain times of day, or after a Kindle Fire user had been made aware of the Free Time feature on the device, which limits kids’ access. \nWith regard to the use of gift cards for refunds, the FTC argued that this could ultimately result in the return of revenue to Amazon. Additionally, the Amazon proposal includes no maximum or minimum amount the company would pay out in total to customers. The FTC suggested setting a floor of $12.2 million to hold the company accountable for its practices. If refund claims did not reach that amount, the difference would be paid to the government. \nIn the end, the judge sided with Amazon’s request for a notice-and-claim process, but without some of the exceptions the retailer was seeking. For instance, the court was not convinced by Amazon that it should not have to pay refunds to customers whose children continued to make unauthorized in-app purchases after the parent had received a refund for earlier unauthorized transactions. \n“Amazon has not provided sufficient evidence that all consumers who received refunds were instructed about parental controls,” writes the judge. “In fact the evidence indicates that Amazon customer service agents did not always instruct or effectively educate customers about parental controls.” \nThe judge was likewise unmoved by Amazon’s contention that parents who had been made aware of the Free Time functionality on Kindle Fire should not receive refunds. \nOne exception that the court did grant to Amazon was for in-app purchases made in the middle of the night (2 a.m. – 6:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time), as the judge concluded it was highly unlikely that such transactions were made by kids. \n“Common sense dictates that the majority of people are asleep during these hours, particularly if they are children,” explains the ruling, which also said that the FTC’s request for a $12.2 million minimum was too speculative. \nAmazon now has 90 days to send out the eligibility emails to the pool of affected users. Against Amazon’s wishes to limit most individual refund claims to $20, there will be no limit on this amount. \nRather than paying out the refunds in Amazon gift cards, the money is to be refunded to its source — usually a debit or credit card account. In cases where that’s not an option, paper checks can be sent. ",

      "title": "How Trump vs. Bezos Will Affect Amazon (AMZN) Stock - November 11, 2016 - Zacks.com",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump was elected to be the 45th President of The United Sates of America. While many citizens either celebrated or protested this historic victory, Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) CEO Jeff Bezos needed to back track on some of his previous comments about the President-Elect. \nBezos is the CEO of AMZN, which is currently trading at $738.39 per share. He also owns the Washington Post, a prestigious newspaper that he purchased in 2013 for $250 million. Both men have been exchanging words for over a year now over accusations made by Trump regarding Bezos' use of his newspaper company to get out of paying taxes. According to the President-Elect , \"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" \nTrump's biggest problem with AMZN is that he believes Bezos is outsourcing too many jobs to overseas nations and taking jobs from Americans. As quoted in the Seattle Times , \"Free trade fills the company's sails — as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon's physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also railed against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they're not advantageous enough to the U.S.\" \nThroughout his campaign, Trump's biggest message was to \"Make America Great Again,\" implying the attempt to make more jobs here domestically. Trump believes Bezos is getting away with paying little to no taxes and embarking on foreign trade agreements that aren’t benefiting anyone in the United States besides Amazon itself. \nEven though there is no proof that Bezos or Amazon is indeed using the political reach of the Washington Post to avoid paying taxes, the fact Donald Trump was elected president caused Bezos to concede to the future leader. Bezos tweeted from his verified Twitter ( TWTR - Free Report ) account: \"Congratulations to @RealDonaldTrump I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\" \nThis came after AMZN stock has seen an immense drop in price over the past few days. Prior to the election results on Tuesday, November 8th at 3:40pm, AMZN was trading at $789.72. In just three days, the stock has dropped over $51 to its current price of $738.39. Stockholders are showing fear that Trump being elected will cause some major negative changes to the company. This explains why Bezos tweeted that positive message for the President-Elect; he needs to help protect his company’s well being. \nCurrently, AMZN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of 'C.'

      "text": "The judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards. A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission.\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google.\nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password.\nSeattle US District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims.\nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.",

      "text": "Amazon Instructed To Begin In-App Purchase Refund Process November 11, 2016 - Written By John Anon \nBack in April of this year, Amazon was deemed accountable for a number of in-app purchases made by customers using Kindle and Android devices. The reason behind the accountability was that it was not the customer who actually made the purchases, but their children. As such, the purchases were deemed to have been made without permission from the account holders, the parents, and those who would otherwise be responsible for footing the bill. \nFollowing on from that judgement and the same judge who oversaw the original verdict, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, has today instructed Amazon to start to make good on issuing those refunds. According to the details coming through, Amazon has until January 2017 to begin the process of setting up a notice-and-claims procedure where affected parents can register their claims and receive their refunds. \nIt was the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who was largely behind bringing Amazon to account and had originally requested that a lump sum of $26.5 million be awarded. However, Coughenour is reported to have turned down the set among deeming the number to be “ too high ”. Although, Coughenour is also reported to have turned down Amazon’s request to issue refunds in the form of Amazon gift cards. The reason being that Coughenour feels that Amazon will inevitably be recouping some of the profits made by the unauthorized in-app purchases, if the value was issued and redeemed again via Amazon’s services. Therefore, Coughenour has opted for the notice-and-claims procedure which does not rely on set amounts being awarded or gift cards being issued, but simply the customer requesting the refund and having the monies returned \nThis most recent judgement will presumably bring to a close what has already been quite a lengthy process. While the judgement comes six months after the verdict, the verdict itself stems back to charged that were leveled at Amazon back in 2014, for actions that are said to have occurred from as far back as 2012. So while it has taken its time to come to today’s instruction, it would be expected that by the end of 2017, most, if not all, of the refund claims will have been satisfied, ended this particular issue.

      "text": "The stock of Costco Wholesale ( COST ) has lost 13% just since its August high of nearly $170 a share, and now trading at $147 is down 8% since the start of the year. There's one big bugaboo that's been stalking the stock: that business model disruptor known as Amazon ( AMZN ) .\nIn April 2014, Amazon introduced Amazon Prime Pantry. The service will deliver everyday essentials via a familiar e-commerce model. Amazon always made sure to point out that the contents of the grocery box you just received came in \"everyday sizes\" - a clear jab at the warehouse-sized packages that the Costcos of the world made you buy.\nIt threatened to be a problem and not just competitively. Amazon's entry into the grocery space also created significant reputational damage. Costco was supposed to be Amazon proof. It had long had one retail model that Amazon couldn't match, let alone blow up.\nNow they were going to go head to head.\nCostco is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells COST ? Learn more now .\nWalmart ( WMT ) -- the original grocery store disruptor -- got so scared about Amazon's straying into its lane that it went out and agreed to spend $3.3 billion on e-commerce grocery purveyor Jet.com , just to build a moat between its e-commerce opportunities and Amazon's scorched earth business model.\nBut the reality for Costco is that there's no monster that looks like Jeff Bezos hiding under the bed.",

      "text": "Drivers 'expected to deliver as many as 200 parcels a day' 11 hours a day is the legal limit for delivery drivers Amazon pay could plummet to £2.50/hour, taking into account long hours Firm's drives are self-employed so minimum wage does not apply \nBy Neil Sears for the Daily Mail \nPublished: 18:29 EST, 11 November 2016 | Updated: 19:01 EST, 11 November 2016 \nAmazon delivery drivers are having to speed in order to fit in all the firm's deliveries on time, an investigation has claimed. \nThose working for the internet shopping giant are regularly working for more than 11 hours a day – the legal limit for delivery drivers – according to the report. \nAnd one driver even admitted speeding at 120mph so they could keep to deadlines, the BBC investigation said. \nAmazon delivery drivers are having to speed in order to fit in all the firm's deliveries on time, an investigation has claimed \nIt also suggested pay could plummet to £2.50 an hour when taking into account the long hours worked, and taking off the cost of van hire and insurance. The minimum wage is £7.20 an hour. \nThe firm's drivers are officially self-employed so minimum wage legislation does not apply. Amazon has denied it drivers are underpaid or work excessive hours. \nBut there is growing concern that modern 'gig economy' jobs – typically those created by new internet firms – are exploiting workers who are told they are self-employed simply to keep costs down and profits for shareholders up. \nTwo 'self-employed' Uber taxi drivers last month won the right to be deemed employees after successfully arguing at a tribunal that in reality they were too busy working for Uber to work anywhere else. \nAnd takeaway food couriers delivering meals for Deliveroo are now mounting a similar fight with the aid of the IWGB trade union. \nThe new investigation into the Amazon delivery drivers by the BBC involved a reporter getting a job with a firm called AHC Services, one of a number of agencies which provides drivers for Amazon Logistics in southern England. \nIn a two-week stint based around the Amazon depot in Avonmouth, Bristol, the investigator said fellow drivers told him they were expected to deliver as many as 200 parcels per day, for which they were paid £110. \nTwo 'self-employed' Uber taxi drivers last month won the right to be deemed employees after successfully arguing at a tribunal that in reality they were too busy working for Uber to work anywhere else \nIn order to fit all the deliveries in, it was claimed, one driver admitted speeding at up to 120mph. \nIt was also claimed there was no time available for toilet breaks, so several drivers admitted using bottles or plastic bags in their vans as emergency lavatories. \nSelf-employed drivers are not entitled to the minimum wage or sick or holiday pay. \nAmazon denied any wrongdoing and said in a statement that its drivers typically received at least £12 an hour with possible bonuses on top, and that they were expected to comply with traffic laws. \nThe statement went on: 'As independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggested route or develop their own.'",

      "title": "How Trump vs. Bezos Will Affect Amazon (AMZN) Stock",
      "text": "On Tuesday, Donald Trump was elected to be the 45th President of The United Sates of America. While many citizens either celebrated or protested this historic victory, Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) CEO Jeff Bezos needed to back track on some of his previous comments about the President-Elect.\nBezos is the CEO of AMZN, which is currently trading at $738.39 per share. He also owns the Washington Post, a prestigious newspaper that he purchased in 2013 for $250 million. Both men have been exchanging words for over a year now over accusations made by Trump regarding Bezos' use of his newspaper company to get out of paying taxes. According to the President-Elect , \"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\"\nTrump's biggest problem with AMZN is that he believes Bezos is outsourcing too many jobs to overseas nations and taking jobs from Americans. As quoted in the Seattle Times , \"Free trade fills the company's sails — as it builds a planetary network of warehouses, transportation and profitable data centers that are turning it into a truly global store. At the end of 2015, more than a third of Amazon's physical footprint was in countries other than the U.S., and about 32 percent of its retail sales were made overseas. Trump has also railed against the trade deals that facilitate some of that commerce, saying they're not advantageous enough to the U.S.\"\nThroughout his campaign, Trump's biggest message was to \"Make America Great Again,\" implying the attempt to make more jobs here domestically. Trump believes Bezos is getting away with paying little to no taxes and embarking on foreign trade agreements that aren’t benefiting anyone in the United States besides Amazon itself.\nEven though there is no proof that Bezos or Amazon is indeed using the political reach of the Washington Post to avoid paying taxes, the fact Donald Trump was elected president caused Bezos to concede to the future leader. Bezos tweeted from his verified Twitter ( TWTR - Free Report ) account: \"Congratulations to @RealDonaldTrump I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\"\nThis came after AMZN stock has seen an immense drop in price over the past few days. Prior to the election results on Tuesday, November 8th at 3:40pm, AMZN was trading at $789.72. In just three days, the stock has dropped over $51 to its current price of $738.39. Stockholders are showing fear that Trump being elected will cause some major negative changes to the company. This explains why Bezos tweeted that positive message for the President-Elect; he needs to help protect his company’s well being.\nCurrently, AMZN is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of 'C.' Check back next week to see where the Zacks Rank grades AMZN.\nInterested in the other top stories of the week?

      "text": "Amazon owes parents cash refunds for their kids in-app purchases Gift card refunds won't cut it. Share Save \nBack in April, a judge found Amazon liable for in-app purchases made by children without their parent's permission, and now he's established a method for the retailer to pay them back. According to Reuters , Amazon will have to set up a notice-and-claims process next year to let parents know they're eligible for the reimbursements. \nWhile calling an FTC request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout \"too high,\" Judge John Coughenour also declined Amazon's offer of gift cards, since that would return some of the money to the company itself. The result of a case filed by the FTC in 2014 , the whole thing happened because Amazon didn't provide protections for apps labeled as \"free,\" and now it has to pay up. We assume this will be one of the platform talking points for Kanye 2020 .",

Its school guides enable top-tier candidates to become experts on their target schools overnight. Use Promocode CABTG20 for 20% off. Posted in Student Life \nA native of Israel who spent three years performing audits for PwC—mostly on pharmaceutical firms and hedge funds—Ran Rabinowitch was really looking for a change. “I knew I wanted to go work for one of the tech companies, and most are headquartered in the United States, so I began looking at U.S. MBA programs,” he says. Married, he wanted a school known for its community and smaller class size—where he thought his wife would fit in well. “I was also a little afraid that at schools in large cities, all the Americans would just maintain existing friendships, so it would be harder to find community,” he says. Cornell’s S.C. Johnson Graduate School of Management appealed on all those fronts, and its strong finance program and the new Cornell Tech campus in New York City sealed the deal. Not Laser-Focused on Amazon to Start \nIn terms of which technology firms to target, Rabinowitch came in with a pretty open mind. “Google, Autodesk, Amazon—I was generating a list of companies that I knew I would love to go to,” he says. Bottom line, he wanted a company where he would feel challenged, but also a company positioned to remain a leader in the future. The more he learned about Amazon, the more he liked. “Amazon is one of the ones I think will stay because of its customer obsession, which makes employees think long term,” he says. \nHe also really liked Amazon’s leadership principles. “I think it shows a lot about the company—and I notice that here in the United States, companies actually follow those values, whereas at a lot of companies in Israel they are just values printed on the wall.” This true adherence to stated principles, he says, made it a lot easier to understand the position of the different companies he was considering. \nHe went through internship recruiting, some on campus and some off. “Off-campus recruiting is tough—you never know if what you are doing actually works,” he says. “You network with a lot of people, but you’re never really sure if it actually helped you get your foot in the door.” On-campus recruiting—when the companies come to you, is a lot easier, he says. \nAmazon does on-campus recruiting at Johnson, and it consisted of two rounds of interviews. “They are very fast,” stresses Rabinowitch. His first interview was in January. “The first round was on a Thursday and consisted of two 30-minute interviews, mostly behavioral but with a few mini cases thrown in,” he recalls. “I did it in the morning, and the same night they invited me to the second round, which was the next day.” The second round consisted of two 45-minute interviews and an Excel assignment to complete in between them. \nRabinowitch thinks his background helped him get the first interview, but that once you get to the first round, everything is keyed to Amazon’s leadership principles. “They are trying to see if you meet them—and if they have concerns about one of them, they would ask more than once,” he says. As an example, he shares that he was asked to provide a pricing strategy for Prime, Amazon’s membership program that provides access to streaming video, free shipping and other benefits for an annual fee. “I think what they are looking for is someone to answer saying, ‘First of all, let’s look at the customer. Do they care about pricing or other features?’” In this way, the Amazon interviewer is looking for how well the interviewee grasps the firm’s customer obsession principle. What Helped Him Feel Most Prepared for the Amazon Interview \nRabinowitch took advantage of every available opportunity at Johnson to prepare for internship recruiting, including participating in a career work group, forming a second group made up of people interested in the specific companies he was, becoming a member of the Hi-Tech Club and taking part in its events, and making use of the various resources provided through the Career Management Center (CMC). \nThe career work groups were great because they provided a trusted forum in which classmates could focus on preparing for individual companies, practice answering questions they might face to get feedback from the group on what worked and what didn’t, and just grow more comfortable and confident in the process. The Hi-Tech Club arranged a speaker series, bringing in guests to talk about the industry and trends within it, which gave students more ground to cover in their actual interviews with companies. The Hi-Tech Club also helped members refine the PAR strategy—describe a P roblem you faced, the A ction you took and the R esult that action had—to effectively answer interview questions. The CMC, meanwhile, offered one-on-one meetings in which advisors helped students refine their recruiting goals, connect with alumni at target companies and strengthen their LinkedIn profiles. The CMC also encouraged students to network as much as possible with alumni and others working at different firms to help determine which might be the best for them, Rabinowitch says. Advice for Students Approaching the Interview \nIt is important to learn about the company and know the company principles, advises Rabinowitch when asked how he would advise current students preparing to interview with Amazon. “It’s important to talk to people to really get to understand the leadership principles—this will allow you to better understand how you would interact in the company,” he says. \nAlso, know your resume inside and out and be prepared to explain clearly how actions you took led to results. “They always choose something on the resume and dive deep—everything on your resume is fair game,” he says. \nExcel wizardry is not as critical, he adds, even though the interview process involves an Excel case. “People shouldn’t spend lots of time learning Excel—pivot tables and lookup functions, those are the only two things you really need. I wouldn’t spend time worrying about Excel.” And in terms of approaching the mini-cases, Rabinowitch’s advice is to keep it simple. “I would search for a very simple solution to the case,” he encourages. “I would care that everything is presented well, to present the assumption, to present the strategy behind the solution—but not to worry if the solution itself is simple.” So What’s It Like to Intern at Amazon? \nRabinowitch’s own extensive prep paid off, and he received an offer to participate in Amazon’s Finance Leadership Development Program internship as part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing infrastructure business unit. “What I basically did was forecasting. I would evaluate whether or not a project was needed, evaluate cost, revenue impact, cash flow impact,” he says. “I really had a great fit and a great time at Amazon.” \nAmazon’s is a very unique, very strong culture, he continues. “I don’t think it is going to be a fit for every student, and I really recommend that any student thinking about Amazon speak to as many people as they can to understand whether they will be a good fit.” \nTopping the list of things that made Amazon the right place for Rabinowitch was the ownership employees receive over projects, even as interns. “You get a project during the internship that is a real problem—nobody knows the solution,” he says. “Two weeks into the internship, you are probably the one who know the most about that problem in the entire company.” \nYou are asked to take the lead, determine next steps, figure out a solution, he continues. “No one is going to do that for you. It is not teamwork—it is individual work.” Employees can definitely bring concerns to weekly team meetings and get feedback and advice, but you won’t fine a team brainstorming the entire idea like you might at other companies, he says. \nAmazon’s is also very much a white paper culture, Rabinowitch shares. “People at Amazon present data to leadership through a narrative that they call white papers,” he says. Most meetings start with everyone in the room taking 20 minutes to read the white paper, and only then do they ask questions. “The process really helps everyone understand your idea before they interact, and it also leaves documentation,” he says. Given this focus on white papers, an ability to communicate effectively in writing is key. “I think it is crucial for success at Amazon,” Rabinowitch says, adding that he is taking a writing course now that he’s back at Johnson to strengthen his skills for exactly this reason. \nIn addition to having top-notch writing skills, Rabinowitch also encourages prospective applicants to Amazon to brush up on their SQL. “At Amazon today, it doesn’t matter if you go into finance or another function, you need to use SQL,” he says. The company will assign someone to help if you don’t have strong SQL skills, but having them going in is an asset. \nRabinowitch received an offer to return to Amazon full time after graduation on the final day of his internship—and he promptly accepted it. (The company does give interns until December 4th to make a decision on offers, in keeping with CMC requirements.) But Rabinowitch didn’t need to think twice. “I had a great time over the summer and know that it is a great fit for what I want to do.” If you liked this article, let Clear Admit know by clicking Like .

      "text": "Kourtney Kardashian is one stylish gal! \nRecently, the KUWTK star did an interview with Amazon 's Style Code Live where she reveals how she dresses her pint-sized frame! \nRelated: Kourtney Kardashian Reveals What Halloween Means To Her Family! \nThe 5'0\" diva said: \n\"I think knowing your body is the biggest thing because I feel like every trend isn't for everyone… I am really petite, so I feel like [I should be] cinching my waist, you know?\" \nThe mother-of-three avoids any pieces that are too long or drapey. \n\"I don't look good in anything long because I'm so small and so it's like I need to wear shorter things. And always a big heel\" \nEven though some of her sisters are much taller than her (ahem Khloé Kardashian ), the entire family isn't afraid to embrace the same style. \n\"We all will be into the same trends but will wear them differently… We're all into thigh-high boots.\" \nHowever, Scott Disick 's baby momma knows that beauty is truly skin deep. \n\"To me, beauty comes from within as well, so I have this avocado shake every morning… It has Manuka Honey in it. The honey and the avocado is so great for your hair. I do almond milk in mine or sometimes coconut milk. We just discovered that you could do the shake as a mask too and put it on your hair. Mix the avocado and honey. Or even coconut oil is a good one to put in your hair.\" \nThanks for the tips, Kourt! To see the entire interview, ch-ch-check it out (below)!",

Alberto Fujimori suspended the constitution and instituted martial law in order to fight them. He and the established government won the war, committing a lot of war crimes along the way. \nThe mountain people actually really like him because he won the war and freed then from the terror of Shining Path, which explains why his daughter has been the second place finisher in the last two presidential elections. He is currently in jail for corruption, but his daughter, Keiko, says that if she becomes president she plans to pardon him and make him a top advisor.",

      "text": "Where to Buy an NES Classic Edition--GameStop, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and More It's sold out for now, but here are all the places to keep checking for additional stock. Last updated by Chris Pereira on November 11, 2016 Want the latest gaming news as it breaks? All the highlights in the world of games, lovingly delivered 2-3 times/week. You're Good to Go! You are now subscribed Subscribe for the latest gaming news \nUpdate 2: Amazon's availability has come and gone in what was seemingly the blink of an eye. Numerous people are reporting the site crashed for them or otherwise prevented them from adding the system to their cart, though it was still possible to successfully place an order. There's no word yet on when more systems will be in-stock. We'll report back when that changes. \nUpdate: Amazon says it will have \"very limited quantities\" available for sale today, November 11, at 2 PM PST (5 PM EST). That may be your best chance to order one today, though the retailer notes, \"Demand is expected to be very high, and there's no guarantee that it will remain in stock for long. We will announce when additional inventory becomes available.\" It also says it \"will be receiving additional quantities over the coming weeks.\" \nOriginal Story: The NES Classic Edition launched today and perhaps unsurprisingly, it's already sold out and reselling online for more than triple the retail price . It was--however briefly--available through a number of retailers in the US. We've rounded up a number of these for you below to hopefully make it easier to secure one once more are made available. For its part, Nintendo tells GameSpot that it's \"working hard to keep up with consumer demand.\" It also states, \"There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year.\" We don't know just how soon those systems will come in or how many will be available. Certainly, Christmas being right around the corner won't make it any easier to buy one. There is the eBay route, but as of this writing, that will cost you far more than the $60 retail price of the Classic Edition . There aren't any special versions of the Classic Edition available--it's just the $60 system, which comes with one controller. (Extra controllers go for $10 and are also sold out, though Wii Classic Controlers are supported.) All of the major retailers are sold out currently. Even if you were able to place an order today through places that seemed to have them in stock, such as Toys R Us, it looks as if there might be a longer-than-expected wait. You can find listings for the Classic Edition through the retailer links below. Again, there's no telling exactly when more will be available or if advance notice will be given, as was sometimes the case with Amiibo figures that also faced supply shortages. If that does prove to be the case, we'll report back with all the details. NES Classic Edition:",

Note that these are sold out almost everywhere, so I am assuming Amazon will run out of stock pretty quickly. If you aren’t fast enough to snag one when it goes live, I will be sure to let you all know when they restock in the future. I would love to get one for myself… classic Nintendo games are the best! 😀",

Not needing to worry about running out of ammo or Co2 cartridges. does it pump up 10 times? I was looking at a Crossman pump style that was much cheaper. This one is made in Turkey and Germany and is a single cock spring type. Still very powerful. It's biggest complaint, and there aren't many, is that it's very hard to cock back the barrel. I'm not worried about that.

      "title": "Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" Wi-Fi Tablets",
      "text": "Top Comments Features We're listing these as \"Refurbished\", but the boxes will be marked \"Used - Good\". These units will have minor cosmetic blemishes and have been returned, inspected, and restored to fully working condition by an Amazon technician. The units have been repackaged in a brown box. \nMost advanced 7\" display When it comes to HD displays, great resolution is just the start. Unlike other 7\" tablets, Kindle Fire HD delivers rich color and deep contrast from every angle, with an advanced polarizing filter and custom anti-glare technology. \nHigh Definition Touchscreen Display Rich, HD video. Beautiful, vivid photos. Crisp, detailed text. Kindle Fire HD features a new 1280x800 high definition LCD display that brings your content to life. \nReduced Screen Glare Most tablet displays are made up of two pieces of glass - an LCD on the bottom and a touch sensor on the top, separated by an air gap. With an air gap, light reflects off of every surface as it passes through from the front, creating multiple distracting reflections that reduce display contrast. Kindle Fire HD solves this air gap problem by laminating the touch sensor and the LCD together into a single layer of glass, creating a display that's easy to view, even in overhead light. \nRicher Colors at Wider Angles Like many tablets, Kindle Fire HD uses In-Plane Switching (IPS) to improve color reproduction. But displays that only use IPS still appear washed out at various angles, such as laid sideways when reading in bed, laid flat on a table, or held between you and a friend when sharing a movie. Kindle Fire HD addresses this issue by applying an advanced polarizing filter directly to the LCD panel. This results in a display that shows the same deep contrast and rich, detailed color when viewed at any angle. \nBooming sound without distortion Low quality sound can ruin your HD entertainment experience. That's why Kindle Fire HD features exclusive, custom Dolby audio, dual-driver stereo speakers, and auto-optimization software for clear, crisp, balanced audio. \nExclusive Dolby Audio Kindle Fire HD uses the power of Dolby Digital Plus to create a world class audio experience, with or without headphones. Dolby Digital Plus includes technology used to adjust volume, create virtual surround sound, and deliver easier-to-understand dialogue in movies and TV shows. Kindle Fire HD is designed to automatically optimize the audio profile based on what you're doing, such as watching a movie, listening to music, or talking on Skype. It even optimizes the audio differently when you have headphones plugged in, so you can just sit back and enjoy. \nDual-Driver Stereo Speakers Big sound. Compact design. Kindle Fire HD features dual-driver stereo speakers on both sides of the display for a wide sound-field similar to that of a home stereo. And with this much power, we can push our speakers hard. The result - deeper bass in your music, loud, rumbling movie soundtracks, and room-filling stereo sound without distortion, even at higher volumes. \nUncompromised power under the hood HD content requires more storage, strong processing power and plenty of battery life. Kindle Fire HD was designed specifically for HD movies and games, giving you lightning fast performance without compromising battery life or storage. \nPowerful HD Processor A rich HD display requires a powerful processor and optimized software to drive it. Kindle Fire HD uses a fast dual-core processor with an Imagination PowerVR 3D graphics core, so even graphically-intensive games run smoothly and render stunning scenery. We also tuned the graphics pipeline and touch-handling software to eliminate delays between when you touch the screen and when the application responds. This means the home screen scrolls more smoothly, videos start playing faster, and games respond nearly instantaneously. \nOver 11 hours of Battery Life Kindle Fire HD is optimized to deliver high performance with low battery consumption, delivering over 11 hours of reading, surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching video, or listening to music. \nPlenty of Storage for HD Content For an HD device, 8GB of storage is not enough. High definition content is substantially larger - for example, on average, an SD movie is 500MB, and an HD movie is 2GB. Because of this, Kindle Fire HD offers more storage than most other 7\" HD tablets, as well as free, unlimited cloud storage for your Amazon content. \nGreat for the whole family With profiles for everyone in the family, shared content, and Amazon FreeTime, Fire HD makes life better for both parents and kids. \nUnique profiles for each family member With Profiles, create unique profiles for up to 2 adults and 4 children so family members can share a tablet and still keep personalized settings like email and social accounts, home screen carousel, and even their own level in games like Angry Birds. \nShare content with your family With Family Library, link your Amazon account to that of your spouse or partner so you can easily share apps, games, audiobooks, books, and Prime Video content without changing accounts. \nRevolutionary parental controls with Amazon FreeTime Amazon FreeTime allows parents to create a profile for each of their children and choose what books, apps, games, and videos they want to give their kids access to. Also, it's easy to set daily limits for tablet use, or restrict certain categories—like games and video—while leaving unlimited time for reading. \nAmazon FreeTime camera and photo Kids can take pictures of the world around them or with the family. Let kids explore their creative side with fun editing tools like adding stickers and drawings on their pictures. Parents can easily print them to hang, choose to share with friends and family, or auto-save to Cloud Drive with free, unlimited cloud storage for photos taken with Fire HD. As always in FreeTime, kids are blocked from sharing photos to social media. \nOver 10,000 kid-friendly titles with FreeTime Unlimited Amazon FreeTime Unlimited is the first-ever all-in-one subscription that brings together kid-friendly books, games, educational apps, movies, and TV shows—all the types of content that kids and parents love. From just $2.99 per month, enjoy unlimited access to hits kids love from Disney, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, PBS, and more.

Private Browsing allows you to browse the web without Silk saving a record of what you visit. \nEasy to Read There are multiple ways to enjoy your favorite web content.

Simply tap on any scene to instantly see which actors are currently on screen, jump to other movies in which they star, learn the names of songs as they play, see trivia questions and answers, and explore character backstories. \nImmediate video start with ASAP You shouldn't have to wait 10 seconds for a video to buffer after you press \"Play\"—it should start immediately. The new ASAP (Advanced Streaming and Prediction) feature predicts which movies and TV episodes you'll want to watch and prepares them for playback before you even tap play. ASAP's caching predictions get better over time, so video start times will continuously improve as you use your tablet. \nShipping Note: Shipping to Alaska and Hawaii is not available for this item. \nA physical address is required for delivery.

      "text": "Keeping your secrets safe on Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix By Kim Komando, Komando.com photo courtesy of SHUTTERSTOCK When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. But your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? Here are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) Amazon Amazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. The good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history so you never have this issue again. Let’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. You can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? With the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! By the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free eBooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. Google Google often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube. To delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually.",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 11, 2016, 1:07 P.M. ET Amazon, Google: Here Comes Application-Specific A.I., Says Evercore ISI By Tiernan Ray \nEvercore ISI ’s Ken Sena today offers up his findings from his firm’s “Machine Learning Symposium” in San Francisco, with implications for Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , among others, of the revolution in artificial intelligence that’s sweeping computing. \nOne takeaway is just how important it is that Amazon and Google have the hardware power to do artificial intelligence in the cloud: Hardware was brought up frequently not only in terms of the raw compute power required for AI and machine learning, but also in terms of the proliferation of devices. Gridspace’s Evan MacMillan spoke to the rise of quality microphones as a key enabler of his companies natural language processing tools and pointed out that one of the most expensive components in any phone is the microphone array. Similarly, Kevin O’Brien from Orbital Insights mentioned that the explosion in the number of satellites from private space companies like Planet Labs have created more imagery demand as the influx in satellites is leading to influx in data and hence performance. In addition, Jack Clark from OpenAI highlighted the hardware necessary for the raw compute power needed to power machine learning applications as creating just as much a moat as the data itself. This perspective on hardware makes us think that companies like Amazon and Google that provide cloud-based machine learning services are poised to benefit. \nAt the same time, there’s a rise of application-specific A.I. , writes Sena, where the big names like Amazon may not dominate: The conclusion among panelists and speakers seemed to be both, as there will be several AI service providers for application providers to leverage with these application providers holding certain domain expertise. For example, Gridspace is using similar voice recognition technology as Google and Amazon, but remains focused purely on enterprise applications rather than the consumer-facing application of voice recognition technology found in Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. \nAnd another topic was the limited engineering talent available relative to the high demand: There are an estimated 1,000 engineers with the needed skills in this field and concerns were expressed around the drain of the pipeline of data scientists within academia. Our VCs spoke to this bottle neck specifically, contrasting the notion of choosing to remain in school for five years (or more) with seven figure job offers coming in every six months. \nFor more thoughts on A.I., see my interview with Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang this morning .",

      "text": "'The Man In The High Castle' Season 2 Trailer News: Amazon Releases First Two Minutes of Season 2 Premiere Episode Vianne Burog Nov 12, 2016 07:39 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter AMAZON/ The Man in the High Castle \nAhead of the premiere of its sophomore season, Amazon has released the first two minutes of \"The Man in the High Castle's\" new episode. \nThe clip features student life in Nazi-ruled America and opens with Thomas, son of John Smith, arriving at school. Everything in the scene looks normal as he walks through the hallways of the building, enters his classroom, helps one of his friends with a detail in early American history, and gets chosen to lead the Pledge of Allegiance. \nThe students then recite, \"I swear I will observe the law, conscientiously fulfill my duties at home and school, be faithful and obedient, and pledge absolute allegiance until death to the leader of the Nazi Empire, Adolf Hitler.\" \n\"The Man in the High Castle\" is an Emmy Award-winning drama series that envisions a world where the United States lost in World War II and becomes under the rule of Japan and Germany. Based on the alternate history novel of Philip K. Dick, the second season of the series picks up with Alexa Davalos' Juliana Crain facing the consequences of her choice to betray the Resistance and let the suspected Nazi agent Joe Blake escape the Pacific States.   \nAccording to reports, season 2 will see political tensions rise between Germany and Japan as Trade Minister Tagomi regrets his success in sneaking in nuclear technology from the Reich. It will also follow Chief Inspector Kido as he begins to have greater interest in the Man in the High Castle. \n\"The Man in the High Castle\" season 2 premieres on December 16 on Amazon Prime.",

      "text": "SEATTLE (AP) - A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission.\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google.\nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password.\nSeattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims.\nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.\n ",
