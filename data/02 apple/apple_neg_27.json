      "text": "A couple of months ago, there were rumors that Apple could be interested in acquiring McLaren , presumably to aid in their electric/self-driving car efforts. The company later denied the rumors, claiming that McLaren and Apple were not in discussions over potential investment. However it seems that this might not have been the full story. According to an interview with McLaren’s CEO Mike Flewitt over at Reuters (via MacRumors ), it seems that both companies did meet up to talk, but nothing concrete came from it. Flewitt was Quote: d as saying, “ There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition.”\nBasically the original statement from McLaren was true to a certain extent as apart from this talk, it seemed that this was all there was to it. It also confirms that both companies did meet up as per the previous rumors. We’re not sure why neither company decided to go ahead with further discussions, but perhaps given that Apple has shelved their car plans for now, perhaps it makes sense that they did not want to invest any further.\nRight now the rumors are claiming that instead of making their own car, Apple could instead be focusing on creating software for vehicles. There are also rumors to suggest that Apple could be looking towards using augmented reality for their software as well.\nFiled in",

      "text": "If you’ve been using Apple’s laptops for a while now, you are probably familiar with the various gestures that you can do on the trackpad. Given that Apple’s trackpads are pretty big, these gestures are almost integral to using a MacBook laptop. Unfortunately it seems that with Apple’s new MacBook Pros , some gestures aren’t working as intended. According to various user reports , some are claiming that the three-finger drag gesture isn’t working on the new MacBook Pro laptops, or at least not working properly. Users are claiming that sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t, which can be really annoying especially if you are using the laptop without an external mouse.\nFor those unfamiliar, the three-finger drag gesture basically allows users to drag windows around, resize them, highlight text, and so on, which are pretty much basic features on any given operating system, for it to be working sporadically seems to be highly inconvenient. Some are suggesting that the palm rejection technology on the new bigger trackpads are to blame.\nThe good news is that apparently Apple has acknowledged this problem which means that we can expect a fix soon in the form of a software update (we’re assuming it’s a software problem), but unfortunately there is no date on its release just yet. In the meantime if you are experiencing this problem, not to worry because you’re not alone.\nFiled in",

      "text": "If you act quick you can snag a rare $100 discount on Apple's latest MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) at Amazon. This drops the price from $1,499 to $1,399, which makes it easier to swallow the need for the extra adapters and such with the laptop. You can saved the $100 on both the silver and space grey version of the computer, which comes with a 256GB SSD, 2.0GHz dual-core Core i5 processor and a 13.3-inch display.\n\nWhile $100 may not seem like a steep discount, it is actually a pretty good one on this machine. Keep in mind this is the one Apple just released. The deal likely won't last long, so if you are interested be sure to act quick to get one for yourself!\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": "Apple Launches iPhone 6s Repair Program For Unexpected Shutdowns By Tyler Lee on 11/20/2016 20:10 PST \nIf you own an iPhone 6s and you have experienced your phone suddenly shutting down for no reason, you’ll be realized to hear that Apple has since launched a repair program targeting iPhone 6s owners who are experiencing similar problems. This seems to affect units produced between September to October 2015, so if you got your phone around then, you’ll be covered. \nAccording to Apple, “Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.” Customers who are affected have been asked to go to a retail store to get it addressed. \n“If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.” However Apple also notes that should there be a problem with replacing the battery, such as a damaged display that could get in the way, users will have to get that repaired first (and for a fee) before proceeding. \nFor users who might have approached Apple before this program was launched and have since replaced their batteries, they can also get in touch with the Cupertino company to request for a refund. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones .

      "title": "Apple launches new repair program for iPhone 6s units affected by unexpected shutdowns",
      "text": "Reddit \nJust days after launching a repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus “ Touch Disease ” flaw, Apple today launched yet another repair program, this time for iPhone 6s users. The program is focused on users that are affected by a battery flaw that causes their iPhone 6s to unexpectedly shut down. \nApple claims that the issue plagues “a very small number of iPhone 6s devices” that were manufactured between September and October of 2015. To remedy the problem, Apple is offering to replace the battery on affected units, free of charge. \nApple is also sure to point out that this is not a safety issue in any way. \nApple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. \nIf you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge. \nIf you feel that your iPhone 6s is affected by this issue, Apple instructs you to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to confirm your eligibility. From there, your battery will be replaced free of charge. \nAs usual, Apple notes that devices with other damage, such as a cracked screen, will not be eligible for the repair program until the other damage is repaired. Notably, Apple explains that anyone who paid to have their battery replaced because of this issue can contact customer support about obtaining a refund. \nApple’s repair program for the Touch Disease issue was met with a wide array of criticism due to the fact that there’s a $149 charge associated with it. Apple justifies that charge by claiming Touch Disease is caused by dropping your iPhone on hard surfaces, rather than it being a hardware flaw like today’s battery repair program. \nNevertheless, if you’re an iPhone 6s user affected by unexpected shutdowns, you can head to Apple’s website now to get the process started on getting your battery replaced for free.

      "text": "McLaren CEO Confirms Company Was in Talks with Apple but Talks Never Matured   \nIn September this year, rumors sparked that Apple was in talks to acquire McLaren — the company known for its supercars. The company quickly issued a statement back then clarifying that it was not in acquisition talks with Apple. \nAlmost two months later, speaking to Reuters, McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt revealed that both companies did indeed talk but they never materialised into something. He also confirmed that there was never a bid from Apple to take over the company. \n“There wasn’t a bid from Apple,” said Flewitt. \nHe said that both companies talked about that they did, with Apple touring McLaren’s offices. Things stalled there and “never matured to a definitive proposition.” \nIt is likely that Apple did not further extend its talks with McLaren due to the unstable nature of its car project. While the company was initially working on building an autonomous vehicle, it has changed its focus in recent times to make an autonomous driving system for self-driving vehicles. The project has also been disrupted with many high executives leaving the project midway, which forced Apple to reboot the project and boot dozens of employees.",

      "text": "Apple has launched a repair programme for iPhone 6 Plus users whose devices exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface.\"\nAccording to Apple's official website , if your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will repair your device for a manufacturer's suggested service price of HKD$1,158. Pricing offered by Apple Authorized Service Providers may vary.\n\nHowever, going by Apple's description of its \"Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus\" the problem is really the owner's fault, caused by \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\"\nThe so-called \"touch disease\" causes the screens on some iPhone 6 Plus units to become unresponsive.\nIf you bought your iPhone 6 Plus from a wireless carrier, then do not take your smartphone to them for repair. Apple has explicitly mentioned on its website that wireless carrier partners are not participating in this programme.\nA lot of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users have complained of the problem over the last several months, criticising Apple for forcing them to buy a new iPhone to address the problem. Lawsuits were also launched, citing Apple's policy response to the problem.",

      "text": "shares \nApple acknowledged today that some iPhone 6s handsets have been shutting down unexpectedly. \nAs such, the company will replace the batteries for these devices at its branded retail stores and authorized service provider centers for free. \nIf you’re facing this problem with your iPhone 6s , Apple says there’s no cause for concern as it isn’t a safety issue. Plus, the company believes it only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. You can find more information on this page. \nThe issue is separate from the ‘ touch disease ‘ problem seen in some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices a few months ago, which causes symptoms such as a flickering gray bar across the top of the screen and reduced touchscreen responsiveness. Apple said last week that clumsy users who may have dropped their phones are likely to blame and that it’ll charge $149 for repairs . A class action lawsuit was filed against the company over this problem back in August. ",

      "text": "Apple has launched its second new repair program in one week, this time for “a very small number” of iPhone 6S models that have been unexpectedly shutting down . Phones that display the issue — reportedly only devices that were manufactured between September and October last year — will be eligible for a free battery replacement. \nIf you think your phone is affected by this problem, you’ll have to check for a corresponding serial number on your device at an Apple Store or with an Apple-authorized service provider — carriers that offer the iPhone 6S won’t be handing out battery replacements. \nOnly on devices manufactured in September and October last year Before heading into a store, Apple advises iPhone 6S owners to back up their data, erase settings, and turn off Find my iPhone. The company also says problems like cracked screens won’t be fixed as part of the new repair service, and unexpected shutdowns on devices manufactured before or after the specific window won’t score you a free battery replacement. If you’ve already paid for a new battery because you suffered from random reboots, however, and have a phone manufactured between September and October 2015, you’ll be able to get a refund on that.",

      "text": "Apple will fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with ‘Touch Disease’ (Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple is recognizing that “Touch Disease” is a thing. \nThe tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features. \nThe term “Touch Disease” refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months. \nIn August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue “Touch Disease”— and it was quickly adopted by the internet. \nNow, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 — as long as your screen isn’t cracked and the phone is in working order. \nApple said on its website it “determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” \nAlthough some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple’s fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus. \nThe company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149. \nFollowing widespread reports of the problem, “Touch Disease”— on both sizes of the iPhone 6 — has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider. \nApple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over “Touch Disease.” The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens and didn’t do anything about it. \nThese cases are not yet resolved.

      "text": "0 A woman touches an iPhone 6 Plus as it sits next to an iPhone 6 after they went on sale at the Apple store in Sydney September 19, 2014. Reuters/David Gray \nApple is finally responding to “touch disease” claims by providing an official avenue of repair. Users of the iPhone 6 Plus whose devices have been struck by this issue will be able to have their smartphones fixed for a particular price. \nREAD: Apple iPhone 8 specs & features: Digital camera with light splitter, Intel partnership & wireless-charging tech discussed \n“Touch disease” occurs when a flickering bar appears at the top of the phone’s display and the touchscreen feature stops responding completely. Apple has issued a statement saying this occurs with the iPhone 6 Plus whenever the unit hits a hard surface multiple times and correspondingly faces additional stress. Because of the widespread claims, the Cupertino-based company is now offering its repair services. \nThe repair is quite costly at US$149 (AU$204). In addition to the fee, Apple has required that all units up for repair must be in working condition, without a cracked or broken screen. The company also stated that previous customers who have already paid for the repair via Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will be contacted and reimbursed for the difference. \nAccording to repair tech site iFixit , however, the issue is not necessarily a problem with users dropping their devices and the stress that is made to the iPhone 6 Plus. Instead, the company alleged that the trouble is in the design itself. The touch disease is essentially inherent with the handheld. \nThe design placement of various touchscreen-related chips are supposedly the cause of touch disease. These chips become dislodged even with standard use, which is why the screen itself becomes unresponsive after some time. Some iPhone 6 devices have also claimed the same issue, but Apple is only willing to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices at this time. \nREAD: Apple iPhone upgrade: Camera may soon boast of new feature \nIn August, three California users launched a suit against Apple over the touch disease issue. The case outlined that the Cupertino-based company knew about the flaw, yet refused to take the necessary steps to correct this. Since its initial filing, the lawsuit has expanded to include a case from Utah.",

The company clarifies hat this is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. That said, the program offers to replace the affected unit’s battery for free. \nThe replacement process requires you to visit a participating Apple Authorized Service Provider so the unit can be examined and verify if it is eligible for the program. Do note that wireless carrier partners are not participating in this program. \nHit the source link below for more information about the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s.",

In the minute-long spot, audiences witness the superstar rapper pumping iron to one of his own tracks. \nAs soon as his PT leaves the room though, things change quickly with Drake shuffling through his personal playlist for something a little more jovial – enter Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood . \nThe first part of the ad appeared earlier this year when Swift was shown running on a treadmill to one of Drake’s tracks before falling on her face. \nThis ad ends in a similar fashion but we’ll let you see it for yourself. Could a Drake Feat. Tay Tay track be in the works? Don’t bet on it.",

      "text": "If you remember a couple of months back there were reports that said Apple is talking with British car maker McLaren for a substantial amount of investment. It was also rumoured that Apple was planning to takeover the car company, an over the top move by Apple. However it was later confirmed that no such deal was in place.\nA fresh report now confirms that those reports were true. According to a Reuters interview with McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt, there were indeed some discussions with Apple, but it didn’t progress into a definitive proposition and a takeover bid from Apple was ruled out.\n“There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,” said Flewitt.\nIt seems a bit unbelievable that Apple would go all the way and invest in a car brand, and even buy it. Of course rumours and speculations about the Apple Car have been around for a while now, but we haven’t seen anything concrete. What we heard last was that the iPhone maker has slowed down and is probably phasing out the idea of making a car altogether. Instead Apple is focusing on making the software for autonomous cars, which is probably the future of personal transport.\nThe post McLaren confirms talks with Apple; never matured to a definitive proposition appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "We have been hearing plenty of rumours about the iPhone 8 but this one could be a first even for smartphones. While we have been seeing dual camera smartphones running Android before the iPhone 7 Plus, what we have all been waiting for is dual optical image stabilisation (OIS) setup. Currently, all smartphones, including the Apple iPhone 7 Plus feature OIS on one lens only. But according to a famed analyst, Apple may pull off a dual camera with OIS with its upcoming iPhone 8 and there’s more.\nAccording to recent research note reported by MacRumours , KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, believes that the upcoming tenth anniversary iPhone 8 Plus may feature a dual OIS set up. While the current iPhone 7 Plus model packs in OIS for just the wide angles lens, Kuo believes that Apple will bring OIS to the telephoto lens in the future iPhone Plus model as well.\n“We believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year’s new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners.” said Kuo in the research note.\nA report from Forbes adds that Apple has an OLED crisis on its hands. While it had been conveniently neglecting OLED displays for long, Raymond Soneira of DisplayMate Technologies, said that they have taken it “as far as it can go”.\nOLED display feature better viewing angles and faster response time as well. Apple could even go with an always-on display mode if need be. Gone are the days when OLEDs colour reproduction was considered inaccurate\nThe last we heard about the upcoming iPhone, it was supposed to feature a bezel-less design with glass edges that even fold over till the back. The home button is expected to be placed below the display itself and the same may be the case of the fingerprint scanner.\nRumour has it that Apple is expected to release a 4.7-inch iPhone 8 along with the standard 5.5-inch model and a new 5-inch model as well. There are also reports of Apple working with Biel and Lens Technologies, a Chinese company that supplies glass panels to Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile, there have been reports on how Apple wants OLED in next iPhones, but suppliers are not ready yet .\nThe post Apple iPhone 8 Plus to feature dual camera with OIS; may switch to OLED displays appeared first on Tech2 .",

This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,\" Apple said in a statement.\nThe program is applicable globally. Users can visit authorized Apple service centres and get the serial number checked, to confirm if their iPhone 6S is affected or not.\nApple requests users to take a backup of their iPhone 6S, turn off the \"Find my iPhone\" service and erase the phone before handing it over.\nThere's one caveat though. If your iPhone 6S has a cracked display or any other damage, you will have to get that repaired before getting the battery replaced, which could incur some additional cost.\nUsers who have already got their iPhone 6s' battery replaced can reach out to Apple for a refund.",

      "text": "Apple limiting iPhone 7 LTE speeds on Verizon to match AT&T model Data shows iPhone 7 not taking advantage of Verizon capabilities Apple refutes the claims of different download speeds \nApple has been accused of limiting the LTE performance of iPhone 7 models powered by Qualcomm chipset to match speeds of the Intel-powered models. Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 models on Verizon network should have higher download speeds on paper than Intel-powered ones AT&T, however, in testing, Bloomberg reports it was found that iPhone 7 models from both Verizon and AT&T had similar speeds in real life. \nThe Bloomberg report cited researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights for testing. Recode in a separate report citing sources claims that Apple indeed limited some iPhone 7 models featuring Qualcomm chipset to match the speeds of Intel-powered chipsets. \"It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible,\" said Ina Fried in her report. Apple has however refuted the claims of different download speeds. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller commenting on the report said, \"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nFor those unaware, the iPhone 7 models sold through Verizon (and Sprint) feature Qualcomm's X12 modem which is claimed to offer maximum download speeds of up to 600Mbps while iPhone 7 models on AT&T (and T-Mobile) are powered by Intel chipset with a maximum download speed of up to 450Mbps. \nGabriel Tavridis, Head of Product at Twin Prime, on similar LTE speeds on the iPhone 7 models from Verizon and AT&T said, \"The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.\" Twin Prime from its internal testing claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S7 powered by the same Qualcomm X12 modem was way faster than the iPhone 7 on Verizon. \nThere's no question that two models powered by different modems will perform same, but if the test reports are correct, then it seems Apple thought it would be awkward if iPhone 7 models on Verizon were faster than the ones on AT&T (and T-Mobile).",

      "text": "Just as Apple and Samsung have bought out space at the many Best Buy stores across the continent, Google is doing the same. Funny how it does this after releasing a slate of products under its own brand ranging from smartphones to VR to Wi-Fi routers .\nThe effort is limited, at least for now, to some Best Buy stores in Canada and is being called the “Google Shop”. TechCrunch reports that these shops will hopefully build upon the current showcase of products — everything from Chromecasts to Chromebooks — with future releases and updates down the line.\n\nLocally programmed activities, multi-screen arrays and specialized stage design help frame the Google product experience that the company wants customers to have.\nThree Google Shops already exist in Dixon’s stores in the UK, but have revamped their forms to be more like the one you see above with the Pixel phone out . No plots for the US to see one of these soon, but with Google firmly holding its hardware reins and wrenching more grip into them, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see an expansion take shape.\nThe post Miniature Google Shops at Best Buy stores launch across Canada appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "title": "Imagining the iPhone 8 With No Home Button",
      "text": "There are steady rumours of Apple removing home button in iPhone 8 The button currently performs multiple actions Its removal may bring a major change to the way we use an iPhone \nYou may have heard this before, but 2017 will be the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. You’ve been hearing about it since even before the launch of this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and many have prophesied that for the tenth anniversary, Apple intends to do something truly groundbreaking. \nA new design is obvious, considering the present one has been in use for three generations now, with minor tweaks. Based on the rumours, iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge screen, and also ditch the home button - the most important way of interacting with an iPhone. The fact that this year’s iPhone models ditched the physical button with a haptic simulation of a button press, makes the rumour somewhat believable. But still, it will be a huge shift because the home button performs multiple functions today. Here’s a list of commonly-used tasks it does: 1) Touch to unlock2) Press once to exit from any app to the home screen3) Press twice to bring up multitasking4) Press-and-hold to bring up Siri5) Tap twice to enable Reachability (on select iPhone models)\nSince unlocking your phone is the first thing to do when you use an iPhone, let’s start with that. Many no-home-button rumours are often coupled with Apple integrating Touch ID directly into the screen . Signs towards making this happen are around; Qualcomm’s Sense ID is said to detect fingerprints through a variety of materials including glass, by using ultrasonic sounds. To be fair, we haven’t yet seen implementations of Sense ID literally working from beneath smartphone displays, and phones like the Xiaomi Mi5s or the LeEco Le Max 2 that employ the technology still have dedicated areas on the body to rest your finger. \nThe other way to unlock a phone without the need of a dedicated space would be using iris scanning - which the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Microsoft Lumia 950XL employed. Iris scanners are different from facial recognition using the front camera; they work faster and even in dark environments, but the inconvenience being having to point the phone to your face to unlock. \nWhichever route Apple takes, it is clear the home button won’t be missed to unlock an iPhone 8. I would put my money on the former than the latter; simply because iOS 10’s highly functional lock screen would become irrelevant if an iPhone just unlocked by looking at it. \nNow let's talk about the rest of the functions, and try to imagine how it might work on the iPhone 8. There are two approaches Apple can take - one is to put an on-screen button (like many Android phones have had for years), freeing the dedicated space under the screen. The other is to create a gesture-based interface that won’t require a virtual home button at all. \nIf you go with the first possibility, then there will be no change in multitasking, going to the home screen, or invoking Siri, as you’d end up doing the same with a software home button. Enabling ‘Reachability’ could seem tricky, but doable. To the uninitiated, this feature minimises the interface to the bottom-half of the screen for easy one-handed access. Currently it works thanks to the circular capacitive ring surrounding the home button, which reads the gentler double tap input (which is different from a double press). But knowing that your iPhone has been able to understand varying pressures applied on the screen (3D Touch), it isn’t hard to imagine that the on-screen home button will function only if you press hard on it, making it consistent with how it works on the iPhone 7 today; you have to press it like you’d press a mechanical button for it to work. Therefore, it is plausible that the Reachability feature will continue to work as it does today, by gently double-tapping the software home button. \nThere could be another tiny benefit in going with a software home button. Right now, on your iPhone, you can swipe right from the left edge to go back in an app. But say you've clicked a link on Twitter and it opens Safari, you can't swipe to go back to Twitter. You'll have to double press the home button and use the app switcher to go back, or use the tiny back button placed on the top-left corner of the screen. \nAn on-screen home button means a small portion at the bottom of the screen would be reserved. Maybe a dedicated back button could sit right next to the on-screen home button, making it easier to go back to the previous app. \nFinally, let’s address the possibility that Apple doesn’t go with an on-screen home button. Which means that the only way to perform all those actions would be via gestures. We already know there’s a gesture to bring up multitasking without pressing the home button, by hard-pressing the left corner on an iPhone with 3D Touch. But everything else will require re-imagination - to go to the home screen, to bring up Siri, or to enable ‘Reachability’. \nSure, the iPad for years has had the four-finger pinch gesture to go to home screen, but there may be a reason why Apple never enabled it for the iPhone (smaller area to perform the gesture, possibly). In all probability, Apple will need to create new, unique gestures to perform these actions, similar to BlackBerry’s PlayBook tablet or the Palm Pre series. Last but not the least; today you can triple-press the Home button to enable Accessibility options like VoiceOver, which again will require a considered implementation. It’s fair to say that this route would bring a major change in how the iPhone has been operated to date, thereby making it the lesser of the two probabilities. \nSo there you have it - a summary of the changes a (hypothetical) home-button-less iPhone 8 would bring. How do you imagine it’ll work?",

      "text": "Apple is replacing faulty batteries on ‘a very small number’ of iPhone 6s devices Posted \nTis the season for Apple replacement programs, it appears. Days after the U.S. tech giant addressed ‘touch disease’ on certain iPhone 6 Plus devices, so Apple has announced a battery replacement program for iPhone 6s owners affected by unexpected shutdowns. \nApple said the problem impacts “a very small number” of iPhone 6s devices that were made between September and October last year. In those cases, the phone may unexpectedly shut down due to issues with the battery. \nOwners of affected devices can go to their nearest Apple Store to check the serial number of their device — which should identify whether it is part of the malfunctioning batch — and then get a free battery replacement, if needed. \nApple said the battery problem doesn’t affect the safety of the devices like, say, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. In case you’ve been living under a stone over the past few months, Samsung was forced to recall the device and permanently cease sales due safety fears over defective batteries. 0",

      "text": "Apple limiting speeds on iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modems: Here’s why Apple limiting speeds on iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modems: Here’s why Apple iPhone 7 smartphones with the Qualcomm modem are capable of faster downloads, show reports. Published:November 21, 2016 1:08 pm Apple iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modem can outperform the ones with Intel. (Source: AP) \nApple iPhone 7 smartphones with the Qualcomm modem are capable of faster LTE downloads, but it seems Cupertino is intentionally reducing these speeds. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple iPhone 7 devices running on Verizon network in the US are capable of delivering faster speeds than those on AT&T. But research from Twin Prime Inc shows they are performing at the same speeds. \nBloomberg quotes Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime as saying, “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities.” He adds that it looks like Apple has not enabled certain features of the chip. \nHowever another report in Re/Code which quotes sources says Apple has a perfectly good reason for doing this: To ensure a similar and uniform experience for iPhone 7 users regardless of the network. The report points out that the Verizon version might be superior, but it is not working at its full “potential,” for uniformity of experience. \nAn Apple spokesperson had also issued a statement on the Bloomberg report saying all devices meet their quality and standard tests, and “there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.”",

      "text": "I'm leaving the cult of Apple and ready to buy a PC....Help!?! November 20, 2016 5:56 PM Subscribe I've had an Apple Mac Book Pro for the last 10 years. The computer is starting to breakdown / slow down, to the point where I'd rather bang my head against the wall then turn it on....Time for a new computer....I love Apple. I love my Macbook Pro...But Looking at the big picture, I use my computer for pretty much online stuff....I do virtually everything online. The only non computer stuff that takes up hard drive space is my itunes library. In orde to save a few bucks, I'm seriously considering in buying one of the PC's being advertised everywhere.... 8-12mb of Memory / 1 TB hard drive for $700 or less A much cheaper option than a new Macbook Pro... The only real thing that makes me 100% sure of my decision is , Apple Customer Service....It is un-paralleled Any problem I have ever had in any regard to any of my Apple Products (Computer/Ipad/Ipod.Phone) was solved with relative ease in the store or over the phone.... Back in the day, with my PC I was forced to deal with Best Buy's Geek Squads or Staple Computer Service Centers Nothing but issues.... I'd almost rather spend close to $1700-1800 just for the piece of mind of knowing if I have computer issues, they will be solved.... What is my best option for a PC (brand/model wise), where if I did have issues, I could have a similar protection plan as Apples with ease of contacting them and having these problems fixed.... Having at least 1TB hard drive is a must...And I'd prefer 8-12Mb of memory minimum as well....I do like Spotify, Apple Music, etc, but I prefer to have all of my music on my hard drive, so Itunes is important for me.... Help convince me that going back to a PC can ease my nerves and potential future issues....Who/Where do I go? Thanks! If you like near a Microsoft store, their customer support is quite good. Last year I bought a surface book at a Microsoft store that developed a problem with the screen six or seven weeks later. They exchanged it for a new one immediately, as soon as they double checked that I had backed up all of my data. posted by cpdavy at 6:20 PM on November 20 [ 1 favorite ] You don't actually say Windows, you say \"a PC\". If you really do virtually everything on-line, wouldn't Linux work for you? Firefox and Chrome run there too. Your music files can be played by software other than iTunes, right? I think a lot of the Staples/BestBuy stuff has to do with the complexity of Windows. Mind you, our family has all three types of machines, so I am not trying to steer you one way. But if you're thinking of going down a new path, at least think about Linux, which can run or more modest hardware, too. posted by forthright at 6:25 PM on November 20 [ 1 favorite ] I think you might be pretty happy with going straight to a Microsoft store. They're sort of set up to cater to exactly your type of customer - people who want the Apple Experience with a step down from the Apple Price - and have very solid customer support. (Full disclosure: I know someone whose job is exactly that and also teaching sweet old ladies how to sort through family photos; I was like \"set me up, yo\" and they proceeded to lay out my options in a very clear manner and it was overall an A+ experience.) For having your music on your local drive, you might want to invest in some external storage. It's getting simpler to set up local sharing for that kind of thing, and combined the price of a simple laptop for online stuff plus a nice large-capacity but portable sized solid state drive for your music is probably less than what you'd pay for a beefier laptop anyway, and allows more flexibility. posted by Mizu at 6:26 PM on November 20 [ 2 favorites ] What is my best option for a PC (brand/model wise), where if I did have issues, I could have a similar protection plan as Apples with ease of contacting them and having these problems fixed....

I full support your decision! I think it's a great one, and if you make the right choice you will be very happy. A couple things to keep in mind. One, you mention this, but you use the slightly wrong term - aim for 8 or 16 GB of memory. 8 GB is still entirely reasonable for a laptop. 1 TB drive is great and all, but you know what's really, really great, and going to sell you on this entire thing? A solid state disk drive (SSD). This is the key innovation in computer technology in the last 10 years. Not processors, not RAM - the disk drive. This is going to be the key thing with this whole deal. If you get a nice laptop with really nice specs and it has a 1TB 5400 RPM platter-based mechanical drive, you're going to be miserable. A computer with a SSD is worth every single penny you put in it. Now, SSDs are a little expensive. If you were just buying the hard drive, like, off the shelf, a decent 1TB SSD would cost you about $300. A crappy 1TB platter-based disk would cost you $75 or so. Is it worth it? Oh, you bet your ass. I beg you, take this advice to heart. Do not buy a cheap, slow big disk, just because you want a ton of storage. So, buy the best SSD-equipped machine you can, and if that 1TB SSD is too much, settle for 256GB or 512GB, and then expand with external USB storage or something. As for brands - Lenovo, if you're looking at their Thinkpad branded computers, are designed for professionals, and have really nice build quality and great warranty support, but there's not really like a physical place you can take them like an Apple store. Still, I really like them. As an alternative, as several people have said, take a look at Microsoft's offerings. They have a physical store and it's great. The Surface Book (first generation) was a great product but it was also a first generation product and was a little glitchy. The Surface Book (2016) just came out, and they are supposed to be fabulous. The Surface Pro 4 is also a neat device, if you can deal with the keyboard, which takes some getting used to for some folks. I'm happy to give you any advice you'd like or answer any questions, please send me a MeFi mail if you're so inclined! Good luck! posted by kbanas at 6:54 PM on November 20 [ 5 favorites ] FWIW, don't forget to take amortization into account as you price out your options. I went through multiple PC laptops, lasting almost exactly two years each before physically breaking enough not to be usable anymore. Then I switched to a Mac, and my 6+ year old Air is still happily running with no physical problems whatsoever. It wasn't 3x the price of my former laptops, so I came out well ahead. If you're on year ten of your current Mac laptop, you already know what I mean, here. I've never heard of anyone with a ten year old PC laptop in daily use. Ever. posted by instamatic at 7:10 PM on November 20 [ 2 favorites ] Then I switched to a Mac, and my 6+ year old Air is still happily running with no physical problems whatsoever. It wasn't 3x the price of my former laptops, so I came out well ahead. If you're on year ten of your current Mac laptop, you already know what I mean, here. I've never heard of anyone with a ten year old PC laptop in daily use. Ever. Not to comment a million times, but I will say there is some truth to this. Most major PC vendors like Dell and HP and Lenovo have a line of PCs made for \"consumers\" and a line of PCs made for professionals. For example, with Lenovo, you could compare their IdeaPad laptops to their ThinkPad laptops. The ThinkPad laptops are more expensive, yes, but they also have better build quality, are made with better materials, are frequently easier to service as well. They often will have a different warranty department as well (when you call, there's a different phone prompt, and a different level of service). Pay attention to this. If you buy a $700 Dell Inspiron 15, it will probably not hold up terribly well over the long term. I've seen people use the same ThinkPad for years and years and years and years. You really do pay for what you get. posted by kbanas at 7:16 PM on November 20 I'm so glad you asked this question, I'm also replacing a Mac :) So far the specifications of the Asus K501UX and this Dell look pretty great to me, for the price. The Dell Inspirons from 500 series and up look like good all-rounders in general. Also HP Pavilion (15). Black Friday deals are coming in Canada and the US, so there may be some deals to be had if you're in either place. Can't speak to service/seller. You can always upgrade ram if there are slots, the CPU is the thing you're stuck with for the most part (so I understand, and for that, there's not a significant difference between i5 and i7, for most people who aren't editing films, apparently). I haven't seen anything with the kinds of things you want that doesn't have at least 8GB. Keen to see other answers! Good luck posted by cotton dress sock at 7:19 PM on November 20 Nthing Microsoft Store - you're not going to get a comparable experience from Dell or Lenovo directly. 2nding SSD - they're so much faster, can survive being dropped, and use less power. Having all your music with you rather than streaming is nice, but is it really worth the risk of losing data and having a slower system? posted by Candleman at 7:32 PM on November 20 I would stick to the operating system I know and am comfortable with. If you want dirt cheap consider a Chromebook and keep all of your digital files in the cloud. posted by xammerboy at 8:28 PM on November 20 At that price point, you are going to get bad hardware and bad service. To save a few bucks: buy from the Apple refurb store. To get out of the Apple ecosystem, yet retain good hardware: buy a Thinkpad, then get some third-party tech support . Lenovo's hardware is good, but their phone support has been going downhill for a while. And by then, you're paying as much as you would for an Apple, I'd think. posted by BrunoLatourFanclub at 8:29 PM on November 20 For sad reasons I'm real happy with Lenovo's 3-year next-day on-site service option... my last two high-end laptops (W510 & W540) have required system board swaps within their 1st year. A trackpad issue on one took a couple tries to fix (turned out to be a conflict with other hardware). My old IBM branded ThinkPad seemed to be more robust than the Lenovos. I was not impressed with the pay-for software support thru IBM. They also made it difficult to cancel. posted by tinker at 8:53 PM on November 20 I've been pretty happy with Dell lately. I'm on my second Dell at work - a Lattitude. The build quality on the business Dell laptops is excellent. Also nice about the Dell Business machines is they are rather easy to upgrade. I do like Surfaces also, but they can get a bit pricey and also they are harder to upgrade. Many Windows based laptops come with SD or micro-SD slots, which can be helpful to add on an additional 128GB. Just be willing to buy a quality SD card - Samsung or Sandisk are my go-to brands. I don't recommend Lenovo, because of recent spyware issues - take a look at http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/12/lenovo_firmware_nasty/ posted by coberh at 9:55 PM on November 20 \"I've never heard of anyone with a ten year old PC laptop in daily use. Ever.\" I have a 13-year-old PC laptop in daily use FWIW Seconding the advice above to put high priority on getting a SSD posted by anonymisc at 10:31 PM on November 20 A word of warning, if you are used to a Mac laptop screen and it is important to you, you will probably find PC laptop screens disappointing. And SSD is the way to go. I bought an external 1 TB SSD for like $50, a \"Slim\", I forget the full name/maker. posted by TWinbrook8 at 11:06 PM on November 20 [ 1 favorite ] « Older Name upgrade for a cake swap | How can I avoid You-Know-Who?

      "text": "Apple unveils replacement program to fix iPhone 6s' random shut off By Liu Zheng | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2016-11-21 13:17 A Chinese customer tries out an iPhone 6s smartphone at an Apple Store in Shanghai, June 21, 2016. [Photo/IC] \nApple Inc introduced a free replacement program on Monday that aims to solve recent reports on the unexpected shut down of its iPhone 6s. \n\"This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,\" according to the company's official website. \nThe company asks users who have experienced unexpected shut down issues to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple authorized service provider and have their device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a free battery replacement. \n\"Your iPhone will be examined prior to any service to verify that it is eligible for this program and in working order,\" Apple said. \nRelated story: Consumer watchdog targets Apple over iPhone shutdown bug by Liu Jing from chinadaily.com.cn \nThe China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to address a sudden shutdown problem associated with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models in China. \nAccording to a statement issued by the consumer protection organization on Tuesday, it has received a considerable number of complaints from users of both devices reporting that the smart phones have been shutting off automatically with 50 to 60 percent battery left. The bug persists after a system upgrade. It is also reported to have occurred in both cold environments and at room temperature. Some users complained that their iPhones, after shutting down involuntarily, failed to turn back on without connecting to a power supply. \n\"Given that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s have considerable number of users and the problems have been reported by many, China Consumer Association has issued a query to Apple on the abnormal shutdown problem,\" the statement reads. \n\"CCA will follow the issue closely and protect the legal interests of consumers.\" \nAccording to the organization, the questions raised to Apple include what caused the automatic shutdown, whether there is problem with the batteries, how the company will deal with the complaints and what measures the company will take. \nSo far, Apple hasn't publicly commented on the matter. CCA says it expects Apple to respond within ten days. Related Stories ",

      "text": "In their rush to do away with problematic passwords, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies are nudging consumers to use their own fingerprints, faces and eyes as digital keys. Smartphones and other devices increasingly feature scanners that can verify your identity via these \"biometric\" signatures in order to unlock a gadget, sign into web accounts and authorize electronic payments. No security systems are perfect, said Anil Jain, a computer science professor at Michigan State University who helped police unlock a smartphone by using a digitally enhanced ink copy of the owner's fingerprints. Apple's iPhone 5S, launched in 2013, introduced fingerprint scanners to a mass audience, and rival phone makers quickly followed suit. Jain and two associates made a digital copy of the prints, enhanced them and then printed them out with special ink that mimics the conductive properties of human skin. Researchers at the University of North Carolina , meanwhile, fooled some commercial face-detection systems by using photos they found on the social media accounts of test subjects. To make such theft more difficult, biometric-equipped phones and computers typically encrypt fingerprints and similar data and store them locally, not in the \"cloud\" where hackers might lift them from company servers. Or it might be stored in a different database; Jain pointed to the 2015 computer breach at federal Office of Personnel Management, which compromised the files — including fingerprints — of millions of federal employees. There's a legal distinction between something you know, like a password, and something you possess, like a physical key or a fingerprint, said Marcia Hofmann, a San Francisco attorney who specializes in privacy and computer security.",

Specifically, Apple says that it discovered that “a very small number” of iPhone 6s devices are suffering from what the company calls an unexpected shut down happening at random times. Cupertino claims the bug only exists on devices manufactured between September and October 2015, and emphasizes that this should by no means be considered a safety issue because it’s not. The bug only causes phones to shut down even though the battery percentage is at 50 percent or so, the company explains, so it doesn’t explode or anything (as it happened in the case of the Note 7). “If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to ...",

If you have a compatible Android Wear watch (one with an NFC chip), it will let you touch your watch to an NFC-equipped retail terminal to pay for goods. \nAnother new feature that appears to be coming soon is Instant Apps , a way to get apps (for one-time use or other reasons) without actually installing them. Android Police notes that the Instant App services have been switched on and a flag set from false to true, meaning the feature is likely being tested in the wild. \nYou can actually tap to pay on Android right now if you really want to, but you have to use a Samsung Gear S3 watch and Samsung Pay, ironically. That feature works on any Android device with KitKat 4.4 or later, because Samsung just made its payment service available to other Android smartphone brands, provided you're using its Tizen OS-based watch. The Gear S3 is equipped with the same magnetic stripe payment tech as Samsung's phones, letting you pay with the watch just about anywhere in the US. (iPhone users have also been able to pay with the Apple Watch and Apple Pay for over a year, of course.) Samsung's Gear S3 smartwatch \nSmartwatches and wearables in general have disappointed of late sales-wise, and companies like Intel are reportedly scaling back development. It probably didn't help matters that Google delayed Android Wear 2.0, expected this fall, to 2017. Hopefully, Mountain View used the time wisely to improve the software and give folks more reasons to buy a smartwatch (and use Android Pay, which hasn't exactly set the world on fire either). \nDespite its appearance in Google Play Services, you likely won't see tap-to-pay now until Android Wear 2.0 arrives early next year. It could arrive at the same time as a pair of rumored Android Wear watches designed and built by Google to be the smartwatch equivalent of its Pixel phones.",

      "text": "Apple to replace iPhone 6s batteries after complaints in China   BEIJING : Apple today said it will offer free battery replacements for certain faulty iPhone 6s in China after consumers claimed that their phones unexpectedly switched off. China Consumer Association earlier last week sent a letter to Apple, requesting that it clarify the reason, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Consumers across China have filed complaints on the country’s microblog service Weibo, claiming their mobile phones unexpectedly switch off despite displaying battery levels over 50 per cent. Stressing the issue is not safety-related, Apple China said in a statement that the unexpected power-off only affects handsets with certain serial numbers. It agreed to replace the batteries of faulty iPhone 6s manufactured between September and October 2015 free of charge. Other models with the same problem are not included in the current replacement plan. Consumers can check whether they qualify for free battery replacement at any Apple store or authorised reseller, the company added.  ",

But a new survey conducted from Oct. 26 to Nov. 9 by Reuters/Ipsos revealed that Samsung customers are just as loyal as Apple's customers are.27% of those surveyed who were aware of the Galaxy Note 7 recalls, said that they would consider a Samsung phone first while shopping for a new handset. 25% of those who did not know about the recalls said that they would look at a Samsung phone first. 91% of current Samsung smartphone owners say that they would buy another Samsung phone. 92% of current Samsung phone owners said they they would buy any product made by the manufacturer. Meanwhile, 92% of Apple iPhone users said that they would probably buy another iPhone, while 89% said that they would buy another Apple device. Those numbers track closely with the numbers put up by the Samsung faithful.According to Samsung, 85% of Galaxy Note 7 models that were bought by the public have been exchanged as of November 4th. The majority have replaced their Galaxy Note 7 with another Samsung branded smartphone. Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 2,375 Samsung smartphone owners along with 3,158 Apple iPhone owners.Because the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosions started happening so quickly after the phablet was launched, Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research says that only early adopters were affected. Thus, the huge majority of Samsung's customer base was not involved limiting the damage to the brand. Still, recent data released by analytic firm Gartner revealed that during the third quarter Samsung shipped 12 million fewer phones year-over-year . Thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Sammy's market share declined 4.4 percentage points, or 14% from the 2015 third quarter to this year's period. The bottom line? Samsung remained the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world from July through September of this year. Its lead over second place Apple has dropped from 10.6 percentage points to 7.7 PP.

According to popular tech YouTuber iDeviceHelp, Apple devices may be vulnerable to attack even when locked and protected by passcode. The video blogger has uncovered a new exploit in the iPhones that could potentially give attackers an easy access to your iPhone, including contact information, message logs, and photo library. And the thing that is particularly troubling is that with the exploit hackers don’t even need to know your passcode to break into your device. The flaw basically gives access to contents in device even when it is locked. It is not a direct access, but it’s not a complicated",

      "text": "Apple Offering Free Repair to iPhone 6s Users Affected by Unexpected Shutdowns iPhone 6s users affected by the issue are eligible for free repair Apple stresses not all users affected by the issue It was first reported by several users in China \nSoon after announcing a repair program exclusively for the iPhone 6 Plus users, Apple recently launched another repair program where iPhone 6s users can opt for battery replacement. The Cupertino-based giant however claims that the issue only affects certain devices and not all iPhone 6s users. The company confirms that affected iPhone 6s users are eligible for \"free of charge\" replacement. \nApple on its dedicated repair program page titled, \"iPhone 6s program for unexpected shutdown issues\" writes, \"Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.\" The repair program seems to be Apple's acknowledgement to China's Consumers Association (CCA) which reportedly recently requested the company to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports where users claimed their iPhone 6s wasn't turning back on after abruptly shutting down - effectively bricking the devices.\nApple explains that if a user experiences unexpected shutdown, they can visit Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get the device checked. The company however will examine the iPhone 6s prior to any service to verify whether it is eligible for this program and in working order, stresses Apple. \n\"If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge,\" notes the company. \nFor some users who paid to get the issue fixed are also eligible for refund, confirmed Apple. \"This worldwide Apple program doesn't extend the standard warranty coverage of the iPhone 6s,\" the company added.",

      "text": "Apple offers free battery replacements for certain iPhone 6S handsets November 21, 2016 - 11:40   Apple has launched its second new repair program in one week, this time for “a very small number” of iPhone 6S models that have been unexpectedly shutting down. Phones that display the issue — reportedly only devices that were manufactured between September and October last year — will be eligible for a free battery replacement, The Verge reports. \nIf you think your phone is affected by this problem, you’ll have to check for a corresponding serial number on your device at an Apple Store or with an Apple-authorized service provider — carriers that offer the iPhone 6S won’t be handing out battery replacements. \nBefore heading into a store, Apple advises iPhone 6S owners to back up their data, erase settings, and turn off Find my iPhone. The company also says problems like cracked screens won’t be fixed as part of the new repair service, and unexpected shutdowns on devices manufactured before or after the specific window won’t score you a free battery replacement. If you’ve already paid for a new battery because you suffered from random reboots, however, and have a phone manufactured between September and October 2015, you’ll be able to get a refund on that.

      "text": "Apple Recalls \"Small Number\" of iPhone 6s Units Due to Defective Batteries GO iPhone users should thank China for the repair program Nov 21, 2016 08:06 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Apple has announced a new repair program for the iPhone 6s, calling owners whose devices show signs of a defective battery to bring them into stores and have them replaced. Specifically, Apple says that it discovered that “a very small number” of iPhone 6s devices are suffering from what the company calls an unexpected shut down happening at random times. Cupertino claims the bug only exists on devices manufactured between September and October 2015, and emphasizes that this should by no means be considered a safety issue because it’s not. The bug only causes phones to shut down even though the battery percentage is at 50 percent or so, the company explains, so it doesn’t explode or anything (as it happened in the case of the Note 7). “If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge,” Apple explains. Apple clearly states that every iPhone will be examined to determine if it’s eligible for the repair or not and devices with other damages, such as a cracked screen that impairs the replacement of the battery, do not qualify. China asked for an investigation In case you’re wondering how come that Apple discovered the battery flaw on the iPhone 6s, it’s all because of China, as the country recently contacted Cupertino and asked the firm to look into reports of phones shutting down at random times . China Consumer Association (CCA) recently revealed that it contacted Apple after receiving reports of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models suffering from a bug causing them to turn off even with battery level above 50 percent, as the organization believed this was a hardware problem. Apple didn’t previously issue a statement on the request or the faulty batteries, but given the fact that the company is now conducting a recall, it looks like the problem is real and it’s being addressed. There’s no information on how many devices need to be serviced.",

      "text": "Apple offers free battery replacement for iPhone 6S shutdown problem by Sherisse Pham @CNNTech November 21, 2016: 4:24 AM ET The iPhone reveal: a history Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n\"A very small number\" of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) said in a statement Monday. It didn't provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nRelated: Apple will fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with 'Touch Disease' \nApple's announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n\"A considerable number\" of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is \"not a safety issue.\" Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nRelated: More than 500 South Koreans sue Samsung over botched Note 7 recall \nApple's battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from \"Touch Disease\" -- when the phone's touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

Save Will Lipman / Engadget \nApple has let a cat out of its bag, the cat in this case being that there's a problem with some iPhone 6s models. According to the company, a fault with the battery is causing a \"very small number\" of handsets to randomly shut down. If you're rocking a device that was manufactured between September and October 2015, then you're eligible for a replacement. Simply head down to your local Apple Store or authorized service provider to have your serial number checked and, if you qualify, you'll get a replacement device. \nAlso, if you have already found this problem and paid for a battery replacement out of your own pocket, Apple will refund you. It's not the first issue the firm has had to address in recent weeks, which was the iPhone 6 Plus' \" Touch Disease .\" That's where a flickering gray bar appears across the top of the screen and multitouch issues render the device unusable until fully repaired. Although, in that case, the company still wants $149 for its trouble -- you don't manage to get $231.5 billion in your back pocket being generous. ",

      "text": "Apple Watch Has A Thanksgiving Activity Achievement  00 PST \nThanksgiving is around the corner which means that you can look forward to huge feasts with friends and family members. As much as you’d love to diet, chances are with all the food that is being passed around it would be pretty hard to resist. After all it is only once a year, right? However Apple has a plan to help you work it off. \nIt has been recently discovered that for the Apple Watch, there is a special Thanksgiving Activity Challenge achievement that users can earn. This contextual achievement is a brand feature to the Apple Watch that we did not know about, and it could be a sign of things to come. For this particular achievement, users will have to run or walk 5K (3.1 miles) on Thanksgiving itself. \nAccording to the message that Apple Watch wearers are receiving, “Earn this special achievement on Thanksgiving Day, November 24th when you complete a walk, run or wheelchair workout of at least 5K (3.1 mi) in the Apple Watch Workout app, or any app that records these workouts into the iPhone Health app. You’ll also earn a special Messages app sticker!” \nUsers can log it on the Workout app or other apps as long as it integrates with HealthKit. Once they have completed it, the achievement will be recorded. Note that this is only applicable on Thanksgiving, so if you miss out on it that’s too bad, although chances are there could be another one next year. It would also be a good excuse to walk off all the turkey and pies and other foods you would have eaten.",

      "text": "Tweet \nApple has launched its second repair program in quick succession, this time focusing on iPhone 6s handsets that suffer unexpected shutdowns. The program will see batteries replaced in a number of affected phones. \nThe battery replacement program comes hot on the heels of a repair program for iPhone 6Plus handsets afflicted with 'touch disease' . Apple stresses that the battery problems are not a safety issue such as seen with the Samsung Galaxy Note7 , and advises customers with problematic handsets how to get a repair. \nThe battery replacement program is in operation around the world, and Apple is offering refunds to anyone who has already paid to have their battery replaced. As with other such recalls or repair programs, iPhone owners are invited to take their handsets to an Apple store or authorized repair center. The company says : \nApple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. \nIf you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge. \nWhile the new batteries will be provided free of charge -- complete with a three year warranty -- Apple warns: \"If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair\".",

      "text": "Apple offers free battery replacements for some iPhone 6S handsets that keep shutting down The Verge 52 mins ago Rich McCormick © Provided by The Verge Apple has launched its second new repair program in one week, this time for “a very small number” of iPhone 6S models that have been unexpectedly shutting down . Phones that display the issue — reportedly only devices that were manufactured between September and October last year — will be eligible for a free battery replacement.\nIf you think your phone is affected by this problem, you’ll have to check for a corresponding serial number on your device at an Apple Store or with an Apple-authorized service provider — carriers that offer the iPhone 6S won’t be handing out battery replacements.\nBefore heading into a store, Apple advises iPhone 6S owners to back up their data, erase settings, and turn off Find my iPhone. The company also says problems like cracked screens won’t be fixed as part of the new repair service, and unexpected shutdowns on devices manufactured before or after the specific window won’t score you a free battery replacement. If you’ve already paid for a new battery because you suffered from random reboots, however, and have a phone manufactured between September and October 2015, you’ll be able to get a refund on that.\nGo to MSN Home",

Gadget repair firm iFixit took over the task of tearing down the Touch Bar variant of the MacBook Pro, and revealed that it is next to impossible to get it repaired!

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 15 minutes ago Image via iFixit \nApple has acknowledged problems affecting some of its iPhone 6s handsets, and this time, it's not blaming its customers for the issues. \nThe company has recently had to deal with complaints - and a class action lawsuit - from numerous owners of its iPhone 6 , after many of those handsets were afflicted by the so-called 'Touch Disease', with symptoms such as flickering displays and unresponsive touchscreens. Apple said that those issues were caused by mistreatment and owners repeatedly dropping their devices , only offering to repair them in exchange for $149. \nBut a separate problem has affected some of its newer iPhone 6s handsets too. Apple said it had \"determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down\". Perhaps wary of the fiery battery issues that affected Samsung's Galaxy Note7 flagship , Apple emphasized that \"this is not a safety issue\", but has promised to replace the batteries on affected devices free of charge. \nApple said that the problem affects iPhone 6s handsets \"within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015\". Those who have experienced the 'unexpected shutdown issue' can visit an Apple Store or authorized service center, or contact Apple Support, to arrange a battery replacement. It added that \"wireless carrier partners are not participating in this program\". \nWhile battery replacements are being offered at no cost, Apple did warn that: \nIf your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair. \nApple also said that it will honor refunds for customers who paid for battery repairs if their handset was affected by the shutdown issue.",

Available through the Activity app this morning, the Thanksgiving Day Challenge is the first activity challenge of its kind from Apple, and includes a share-able Messages app sticker as an enticement to get out and get moving. To earn the achievement, Apple Watch wearers must record an Apple Watch Workout distance of 5K (3.1 miles) on the day in question, using Apple's Workout app or any third-party app that syncs with HealthKit. An Apple Watch user's history of achievements can be viewed any time via the Achievements tab on the iOS Activity app. (Thanks, Dan!)",

AP \nApple visited British supercar engineer and Formula One team owner McLaren Technology Group (MTG), but never offered to buy it, Reuters has reported . \n\"They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,\" the CEO of McLaren Automotive, an MTG subsidiary, told Reuters. \nRumours that Apple was in talks to buy MTG were initially reported by the Financial Times and McLaren officially denied them at the time, but this is the first confirmation that the two companies spoke. \nMTG's shareholders have turned down a number of perspective buyers, Reuters reported, but Apple was not one of them. \nThe news that MTG has rejected takeover bids comes a week after the company announced its CEO and founder Ron Dennis will step down. His successor is yet to be named.",

      "title": "Apple offers free battery replacements for some iPhone 6S handsets that keep shutting down",
      "text": "Getty Images A customer checks an iPhone 6S at an Apple store. Apple has launched its second new repair program in one week, this time for \"a very small number\" of iPhone 6S models that have been unexpectedly shutting down . Phones that display the issue — reportedly only devices that were manufactured between September and October last year — will be eligible for a free battery replacement. \nIf you think your phone is affected by this problem, you'll have to check for a corresponding serial number on your device at an Apple Store or with an Apple-authorized service provider — carriers that offer the iPhone 6S won't be handing out battery replacements. \nMore from The Verge:\nFacebook won't call itself a media company. Here's how it can still support journalism \nConsider the PS4 Pro before you buy that expensive gaming PC \nSand's End \nOnly on devices manufactured in September and October last year Before heading into a store, Apple advises iPhone 6S owners to back up their data, erase settings, and turn off Find my iPhone. The company also says problems like cracked screens won't be fixed as part of the new repair service, and unexpected shutdowns on devices manufactured before or after the specific window won't score you a free battery replacement. If you've already paid for a new battery because you suffered from random reboots, however, and have a phone manufactured between September and October 2015, you'll be able to get a refund on that.",

      "text": "It seems that Apple is the next big company to face the recall bells as it recently announced a battery replacement program for iPhone 6s owners who were affected by unexpected shutdowns.\nThis comes right after the tech giant addressed the ‘touch disease’ issue on certain iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices where the touchscreen was unresponsive.\nAccording to Apple, the battery related issue affects iPhone 6s devices that were made between the period of September and October last year. The company also said that the issue impacts a very small number of units. The faulty battery is apparently making the handset shutdown on its own.\nUnder the replacement program, owners of affected devices can directly visit their nearest Apple Store and get the serial number of their devices checked. The serial number should identify if the unit is a part of the faulty malfunctioning batch for which the owners can get a free battery replacement. Apple has further confirmed that the battery problem does not affect the safety of the handset like in the case of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 . In short, if your phone is affected, it won’t blow up.\nWe haven’t heard of a recall information in India, but we will keep you updated if there is any. In the mean time if any of you are facing the issue, do let us know in the comments section.\nThe post Apple replacing batteries on certain iPhone 6s devices appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 \nThe Touch Bar could well prove to be a useful time-saver, but the best gift Apple can give its neglected professional user base is a more capable machine that will help them to meet their deadlines. The 15.4-inch Retina Display of the MacBook Pro retains the 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (220ppi) of its predecessors, although it now provides 500-nit brightness -- 67 percent brighter than the 2015 model, according to Apple -- as well as supporting the DCI-P3 colour space used for professional-level video-editing. So, if Apple is aiming at those sorts of high-end applications, then the new MacBook Pro really needs to step up with genuine professional performance. \nThe resolution of the 15.4-inch Retina Display is unchanged in the 2016 MacBook Pro, but it now delivers up to 500-nit brightness and supports the DCI-P3 colour space. Image: Apple \nHere in the UK, prices for the new 15-inch MacBook Pro now start at an eye-watering £2,349 inc. VAT (£1,957.50 ex. VAT, or $2,399 in the US) with a 2.6-3.5GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive and a discrete Radeon Pro 450 GPU. There's a second configuration with a 2.7-3.6GHz Core i7 and 512GB of SSD storage for £2,699 inc. VAT (£2,249 ex. VAT, or $2,799 in the US), but we took the plunge and opted for a few build-to-order upgrades, including a 2.9-3.8GHz Core i7-6920HQ processor, a 1TB of SSD, and a Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of VRAM. That brought the final price of the top-of-the-range 15-inch MacBook Pro to a mind-boggling £3,329 inc. VAT (£2,774.16 ex. VAT, or $3,499 in the US). \nTo be fair, the MacBook Pro does provide very impressive performance. Delivering single- and multi-processor scores of 4,550 and 14,050 in Geekbench 4 , the MacBook Pro outguns the raw processor performance of Apple's top-of-the-range 5K iMac, and sits only slightly behind HP's Xeon-based Z1 G3 desktop workstation. The solid-state drive flies too, with write and read speeds of 2,057MB/s and 2,505MB/s under Aja System Test Lite . The Radeon GPU is no slouch either, hitting 85.8fps when running the Cinebench R15 video tests. That's about 9fps behind the iMac, but still 2.5x faster than the 31fps achieved by the 2015 edition of the MacBook Pro -- which is still on sale as a token gesture towards people who can't afford £2,000-£3,000 for a laptop. \nSo, the 2016 version of the 15-inch MacBook Pro is certainly strong enough to handle 4K video-editing and other demanding graphics applications. However, it does have competition from rivals such as Dell's Precision 15 5000 mobile workstation, which offers similar levels of performance for a price that's closer to £2,300 inc. VAT (£1,922 ex. VAT, or $2,540 in the US) Portability versus performance \nIn addition to its performance, the 15-inch MacBook Pro does have one or two other tricks up its elegantly tailored sleeve. This new model has lost a fair bit of weight, dropping to 1.83kg (from 2.04kg) and measuring 349.3mm wide by 241mm deep by 15.5mm thick (compared to 359mm x 247.1mm x 18mm). That makes the 2016 MacBook Pro one of the thinnest and lightest 15-inch laptops currently available. \nThe 2016 MacBook Pro is 9.7mm narrower, 6.1mm shallower, 2.5mm thinner and 0.21kg lighter than its predecessor. Image: Apple \nBattery life is good too, aided by the ability to automatically switch between the discrete Radeon GPU and the Core i7's integrated Intel HD 530 Graphics (which can be turned off if you need to stick with the Radeon for specific apps). The Retina display's 500-nit maximum brightness allowed us to turn it down to 50 percent, under which setting the MacBook Pro delivered 7.5 hours (450 mins) of streaming video when using the BBC iPlayer. That's not going to win any awards, but it's still good going for a powerful Core i7 system -- it's also virtually identical to last year's MacBook Pro, and almost double the 230 minutes achieved by the Dell Precision 5000. \nThat's no mean feat, but this laptop's portability does come at a cost. The first thing I noticed is that the 2016 MacBook Pro now uses a slimline keyboard panel, similar to that on the ultraportable MacBook , which feels rather lifeless compared to the more responsive keyboard on my trusty MacBook Air. \nApart from a 3.5mm headphone jack, connections on the 2016 MacBook Pro are limited to four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports -- two on each side. Images: Apple \nApple has also jettisoned most of the MacBook Pro's traditional connectivity features, equipping the 2016 model with just four Thunderbolt 3.0 ports, all of which use a USB-C connector. The speed and versatility of Thunderbolt 3.0 is certainly impressive -- up to 40Gb/s on each port, while also allowing you to connect external storage, monitors and other devices. The downside, of course, is that you'll have to spend even more cash on an assortment of cables and adapters in order to connect existing HDMI, or USB 3.0 and other peripherals. \nMore importantly, the already limited upgrade options of previous models have now been eliminated altogether. The memory and solid-state drive are both soldered onto the motherboard, so user upgrades and repairs are simply out of the question. Apple's expensive build-to-order options do allow you to upgrade the solid-state drive and GPU at the time of purchase, but the memory is fixed at 16GB, which can cramp the style of professional applications such as Photoshop or 4K video-editing in Final Cut Pro. There's always a compromise between performance and portability in laptop computers, but a 'pro' laptop should surely prioritise the former over the latter. Conclusions \nThe new Touch Bar proves that Apple hasn't lost its innovative touch, and the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro is a superb piece of engineering. It provides the performance that professional users need, wrapped up in an attractive, lightweight design that also offers all-day battery life. However, it's extravagantly expensive, and the complete lack of upgradeability is a real weakness in a laptop aimed at professionals -- especially one that will need to justify its high price tag over a period of several years. \nRead more reviews ",

      "title": "Apple 15-inch MacBook Pro (2016) review: Fast, light, innovative, and expensive",
      "text": "Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 \nThe Touch Bar could well prove to be a useful time-saver, but the best gift Apple can give its neglected professional user base is a more capable machine that will help them to meet their deadlines. The 15.4-inch Retina Display of the MacBook Pro retains the 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (220ppi) of its predecessors, although it now provides 500-nit brightness -- 67 percent brighter than the 2015 model, according to Apple -- as well as supporting the DCI-P3 colour space used for professional-level video-editing. So, if Apple is aiming at those sorts of high-end applications, then the new MacBook Pro really needs to step up with genuine professional performance. \nThe resolution of the 15.4-inch Retina Display is unchanged in the 2016 MacBook Pro, but it now delivers up to 500-nit brightness and supports the DCI-P3 colour space. Image: Apple \nHere in the UK, prices for the new 15-inch MacBook Pro now start at an eye-watering £2,349 inc. VAT (£1,957.50 ex. VAT, or $2,399 in the US) with a 2.6-3.5GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive and a discrete Radeon Pro 450 GPU. There's a second configuration with a 2.7-3.6GHz Core i7 and 512GB of SSD storage for £2,699 inc. VAT (£2,249 ex. VAT, or $2,799 in the US), but we took the plunge and opted for a few build-to-order upgrades, including a 2.9-3.8GHz Core i7-6920HQ processor, a 1TB of SSD, and a Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of VRAM. That brought the final price of the top-of-the-range 15-inch MacBook Pro to a mind-boggling £3,329 inc. VAT (£2,774.16 ex. VAT, or $3,499 in the US). \nTo be fair, the MacBook Pro does provide very impressive performance. Delivering single- and multi-processor scores of 4,550 and 14,050 in Geekbench 4 , the MacBook Pro outguns the raw processor performance of Apple's top-of-the-range 5K iMac, and sits only slightly behind HP's Xeon-based Z1 G3 desktop workstation. The solid-state drive flies too, with write and read speeds of 2,057MB/s and 2,505MB/s under Aja System Test Lite . The Radeon GPU is no slouch either, hitting 85.8fps when running the Cinebench R15 video tests. That's about 9fps behind the iMac, but still 2.5x faster than the 31fps achieved by the 2015 edition of the MacBook Pro -- which is still on sale as a token gesture towards people who can't afford £2,000-£3,000 for a laptop. \nSo, the 2016 version of the 15-inch MacBook Pro is certainly strong enough to handle 4K video-editing and other demanding graphics applications. However, it does have competition from rivals such as Dell's Precision 15 5000 mobile workstation, which offers similar levels of performance for a price that's closer to £2,300 inc. VAT (£1,922 ex. VAT, or $2,540 in the US) Portability versus performance \nIn addition to its performance, the 15-inch MacBook Pro does have one or two other tricks up its elegantly tailored sleeve. This new model has lost a fair bit of weight, dropping to 1.83kg (from 2.04kg) and measuring 349.3mm wide by 241mm deep by 15.5mm thick (compared to 359mm x 247.1mm x 18mm). That makes the 2016 MacBook Pro one of the thinnest and lightest 15-inch laptops currently available. \nThe 2016 MacBook Pro is 9.7mm narrower, 6.1mm shallower, 2.5mm thinner and 0.21kg lighter than its predecessor. Image: Apple \nBattery life is good too, aided by the ability to automatically switch between the discrete Radeon GPU and the Core i7's integrated Intel HD 530 Graphics (which can be turned off if you need to stick with the Radeon for specific apps). The Retina display's 500-nit maximum brightness allowed us to turn it down to 50 percent, under which setting the MacBook Pro delivered 7.5 hours (450 mins) of streaming video when using the BBC iPlayer. That's not going to win any awards, but it's still good going for a powerful Core i7 system -- it's also virtually identical to last year's MacBook Pro, and almost double the 230 minutes achieved by the Dell Precision 5000. \nThat's no mean feat, but this laptop's portability does come at a cost. The first thing I noticed is that the 2016 MacBook Pro now uses a slimline keyboard panel, similar to that on the ultraportable MacBook , which feels rather lifeless compared to the more responsive keyboard on my trusty MacBook Air. \nApart from a 3.5mm headphone jack, connections on the 2016 MacBook Pro are limited to four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports -- two on each side. Images: Apple \nApple has also jettisoned most of the MacBook Pro's traditional connectivity features, equipping the 2016 model with just four Thunderbolt 3.0 ports, all of which use a USB-C connector. The speed and versatility of Thunderbolt 3.0 is certainly impressive -- up to 40Gb/s on each port, while also allowing you to connect external storage, monitors and other devices. The downside, of course, is that you'll have to spend even more cash on an assortment of cables and adapters in order to connect existing HDMI, or USB 3.0 and other peripherals. \nMore importantly, the already limited upgrade options of previous models have now been eliminated altogether. The memory and solid-state drive are both soldered onto the motherboard, so user upgrades and repairs are simply out of the question. Apple's expensive build-to-order options do allow you to upgrade the solid-state drive and GPU at the time of purchase, but the memory is fixed at 16GB, which can cramp the style of professional applications such as Photoshop or 4K video-editing in Final Cut Pro. There's always a compromise between performance and portability in laptop computers, but a 'pro' laptop should surely prioritise the former over the latter. Conclusions \nThe new Touch Bar proves that Apple hasn't lost its innovative touch, and the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro is a superb piece of engineering. It provides the performance that professional users need, wrapped up in an attractive, lightweight design that also offers all-day battery life. However, it's extravagantly expensive, and the complete lack of upgradeability is a real weakness in a laptop aimed at professionals -- especially one that will need to justify its high price tag over a period of several years. \nRead more reviews",

      "text": "No electronic device is altogether immune to manufacturing defects and hardware flaws of all sorts. Some phones will spontaneously combust , others may bend under minimal pressure , refuse to properly recognize touch actions or unexpectedly shut down .\nWhat’s vital for an OEM confronted with such issues is to identify the exact root cause of the “disease”, show transparency about measures taken to keep things in check, and most importantly, try its best not to alienate customers .\nOn that note, both Samsung and Apple have made mistakes of late handling bigger and smaller quality control scandals, with the former still unable (or unwilling) to share a determination of Note 7 investigations , and the latter turning a deaf ear to “Touch Disease” complaints for a long time, then finally acknowledging a problem, but forcing affected iPhone 6 Plus owners to pay up .\nThankfully, a new program aimed at fixing “unexpected shutdown issues” exhibited by the iPhone 6s will cover battery replacements free of charge around the world. While Apple doesn’t consider this a “safety issue”, claiming it affects “devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015”, the “very small number of iPhone 6s devices” randomly shutting down will be taken in and repaired.\nNot just in China, mind you, where the plague recently came to light, and if you happened to already replace your battery on your own for a similar problem, you may qualify for a refund. Now that’s more like it, Apple!\nThe post Apple promptly reacts to unexpected iPhone 6s shutdown issues with free battery replacement appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. \n\nâ€˜If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of chargeâ€™ \nMore At least 20 dead after someone let pet monkey loose on young girl \nPudsey Bear's penis made it into a family photo \nAliens â€˜use our planet like a supermarketâ€™, claims former CIA employee \n",

Her iPhone reportedly caught fire while charging and the explosion’s damages spread to other parts of the house as well.As reported by Daily Star, the phone exploded due to overheating, which caused a huge fire that totally destroyed the bedroom in which the iPhone was placed in. No details regarding the iPhone model that caused the fire has been revealed as of yet.‘Everything upstairs, my other daughter’s room and the office has also been destroyed due to heat, smoke and water damage. Nothing can be saved,’ said Gemma, the mother of the girl. ‘Downstairs has been flooded due to the volume of water that had to be pumped in to extinguish the fire, everything has suffered smoke damage. At the moment, we’re waiting to see if the experts think some items downstairs can be saved,’ she added.Apple hasn’t confirmed any reports of them reviewing this matter yet. ‘Although the fire was contained to one room, the after effects are enormous; we may well have lost almost all of our possessions. The house will have to be ripped apart from top to bottom, we will not be able to get back into our home for up to six months,’ the mother explained.",

The function will be available in 30 countries.",

      "text": "It seems that Apple is the next big company to face the recall bells as it recently announced a battery replacement program for iPhone 6s owners who were affected by unexpected shutdowns.\nThis comes right after the tech giant addressed the ‘touch disease’ issue on certain iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices where the touchscreen was unresponsive.\nAccording to Apple, the battery related issue affects iPhone 6s devices that were made between the period of September and October last year. The company also said that the issue impacts a very small number of units. The faulty battery is apparently making the handset shutdown on its own.\nUnder the replacement program, owners of affected devices can directly visit their nearest Apple Store and get the serial number of their devices checked. The serial number should identify if the unit is a part of the faulty malfunctioning batch for which the owners can get a free battery replacement. Apple has further confirmed that the battery problem does not affect the safety of the handset like in the case of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 . In short, if your phone is affected, it won’t blow up.\nWe haven’t heard of a recall information in India, but we will keep you updated if there is any. In the mean time if any of you are facing the issue, do let us know in the comments section.\nThe post Apple replacing batteries on certain iPhone 6s units appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple Launches iPhone 6s Repair Program for Faulty Batteries Updated 7 min ago \nLast week, Apple launched a repair program after acknowledging the iPhone 6 Plus had a touchscreen issue widely dubbed as \"Touch Disease.\" The program was not received well as Apple blames users for the problem rather than concluding there is a design fault on the phone. Because of that, the repair will cost iPhone 6 Plus owners $149. And now we have a second repair program underway, only this one is for the iPhone 6s . \nA small batch of iPhone 6s handsets manufactured between September and October 2015 have a battery issue. There's no threat of injury or phone damage, but your 6s may unexpectedly shut down. The battery is at fault and Apple will happily replace it for you for free. \nIf you have been experiencing the unexpected shut downs, take your iPhone 6s to an Apple retail store or an authorized Apple service provider. The serial number of your phone will be checked to verify it is carrying one of the faulty batteries. If it is, expect a replacement to be fitted to solve the issue. \nBefore taking your smartphone to be checked, Apple recommends backing up your data to iTunes or iCloud, turning off the \"Find my iPhone\" feature, and erasing data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox   Daily Headlines   \nThere are two ways this \"free repair\" could end up costing you money. If your iPhone 6s is experiencing the shut down problem and ends up not being eligible for the repair program, you can probably expect to pay for the fix. Also, if your phone has another issue that interferes with a battery replacement, for example, the screen is cracked, Apple won't replace the battery unless you agree to have that fault repaired as well, which won't be free. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com .

      "text": "Photo courtesy of UNICEF/UNI180469/Romenzi \nNovember 14, 2016; Mashable \nUsers of Apple’s iPhone and Mac platforms will soon be able to donate to nonprofit organizations with a touch. Apple has extended its Apple Pay online transaction system to include instant donations , which lets online donors give to select charities directly without needing to go to a separate web form in Safari or needing to reenter their billing or payment information. Apple had formerly prohibited iOS apps from collecting funds for charities and fundraisers via Apple Pay. \nStudies show that a seamless donation process increases the frequency of online users completing their gift. Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay, explains, “Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods. We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” \nAlong with the announcement this week, Apple Pay’s launch is tied to nineteen of the most prominent charities that users will be able to donate to through Apple Pay and Touch ID technology: American Red Cross ",
