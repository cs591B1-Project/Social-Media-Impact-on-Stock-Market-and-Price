TRD Pro is the fifth model in the 4Runner lineup and was revealed for the first time October 20 at Blue Mountain, ON.\nLike the TRD Pro Tacoma and Tundra pickups also shown at Blue Mountain, it comes with a very long list of features to give full off-road capability.\nThese include: TRD-tuned front springs, TRD Bilstein high-performance shocks with rear remote reservoirs, and 31.5-inch Nitto Terra Grappler all-terrain tires on 17-inch matte black aluminum wheels with TRD centre caps.\nAlso part of the TRD Pro appearance package are a heritage Toyota grille, TRD shift knob, TRO Pro-badged floor mats, black TRD Pro badging on the C-pillar and tailgate, TRD- stamped aluminum front skid plate and black accents on the front and rear bumpers.\nIt also boasts high-visibility Optitron instrumentation, black seats with red stitching, a hood scoop, TRD logo on the front headrests, and black end caps for the roof rails.\nPowered by a 4.0-litre V6 with 270 hp and 278 lb/ft of torque it is combined with a five-speed automatic super electronically controlled transmission with lock-up torque converter and transmission cooler.\nA lever style multi-terrain mode selector has four settings including four-wheel crawl.\nTowing is 2,268 kg (5,000 lb) with standard hitch with four-pin and seven-pin trailer wiring harnesses.\nBuilt on a stout frame, the TRD Pro 4Runner is considered an intermediate SUV.\nThe unit in Blue Mountain was a static display only but Toyota Canada is expecting press units soon and Metroland/Wheels.ca will do a road test at that time.\nJim Robinson is an automotive writer for Metroland Media",

      "title": "Toyota Pays Up over Rusty Trucks and Mercedes-Maybach Teases S650 Cabriolet: The Evening Rush",
      "text": "The Evening Rush is your daily roundup of auto, gear, and lifestyle news, all in one place. Less time searching, more time driving. Motor on. \nAutomotive \nToyota is gearing up to pay a whopping $3.4 billion in a class-action lawsuit for rusty truck frames. According to reports, Tacomas, Tundras and Sequoias are experiencing excessive rust, and Toyota will replace certain frames if they fall under the model years in question. \nThe Drive reported last week that Audi had transmissions that provided misleading CO2 readings due to a change in transmission configuration. VW has now confirmed that some models do, in fact, have such a transmission, but it is now unclear whether or not it classifies as a deceptive device or a tool to improve mileage. \nFor years Mercedes-Maybach has done a fantastic job of making massive four-door sedans. However, change is good and two-doors are sexy. With that bulletproof train of thought, Mercedes-Maybach will be debuting their S650 Cabriolet at the L.A. Auto Show. This will be the first time Mercedes-Maybach will produce a two-door model, and as you can see in their teaser video on Facebook, Mercedes-Maybach is very excited for the new car. Although we can’t confirm the power output, you can expect to see the 6.0-liter V-12 found in numerous AMG models under the hood. \nGear \nIf you could have a screwdriver the size of a key on you at all times, why wouldn’t you? That is a rhetorical question, as the answer is obviously, you would. Fortunately, a company called Key-Bit has invented just that. Utilizing stainless steel casing and an easy-grip design, users can quickly make adjustments to their bikes, ski boots and other gear without carrying around a toolbox all the time. Key-Bit \nWhat better way to show your patriotism than cutting a nice piece of steak with an American flag cutting board from Brooklyn Butcher Blocks . Made from a variety of different woods, this cutting board is the perfect gift for the holidays. \nLifestyle \nI am going to get to the point on this one. Costa is having a 60 percent off sale on Steep & Cheap and you need to take advantage of it. Perfect for fishing or skiing (think snow-blindness), Costa sunglasses will quickly become your best friend. \nIf you are anywhere on the West Coast this week, we highly recommend you stop by the L.A. Auto Show starting on the 18th. Jam-packed with debuts and new models, the Auto Show is always a great way to get caught up in the automotive world. As you might guess, there are plenty of high-profile debuts happening this year...the Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet being my favorite. L.A. Auto Show",

      "text": "Toyota Settles Truck Frame Rust Lawsuit for $3.4 Billion As Many as 1.5 Million Vehicles Potentially Affected View Photo Gallery | 4 Photos Toyota has agreed to settle with as many as 1.5 million truck and SUV owners that experienced issues with severe frame rust on Tacoma, Tundra, and Sequoia models that required serious repair or replacement. The total settlement cost of $3.375 billion is based on an estimated repair cost of $15,000 per vehicle for 1.5 million vehicles and inspection costs of $90 million at $60 per vehicle, Reuters reports. Toyota admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and agreed to inspect vehicles going back 12 years from the date first sold to determine eligibility for frame replacement. The suit alleged inadequate rust prevention measures on the original frames. The settlement covers 2005-2010 Tacoma models, 2005-2008 Sequoias, and 2007-2008 Tundra fullsize trucks. Owners who have previously paid out of pocket for frame replacement will also receive reimbursement as part of the settlement. Toyota will additionally pay $9.75 million in attorney’s fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the eight named class representatives. In a statement, Toyota said “We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to settle this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.”",

      "text": "0 \nThe U.S. auto show season kicks off with this week's Los Angeles International Auto Show. As usual, several automakers have plans to present important new products at the show. \nWhile we don't know everything about what's coming at the show, we do know this: Some important new crossover SUVs are coming from Ford (NYSE: F) , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ' (NYSE: FCAU) Jeep brand, Toyota (NYSE: TM) , and Subaru, among others. \nHere's what we know. Ford's EcoSport is finally coming to the U.S. \nThe Blue Oval's smallest crossover SUV has been a staple of its lineup in Europe, South America, and Asia for a few years now. Now the EcoSport, which shares some of its underpinnings with the subcompact Fiesta, will make its U.S. debut in L.A. The U.S. version of the EcoSport may get a new face, but it's otherwise expected to be similar to the European version, shown. Image source: Ford Motor Company. A new global Jeep to replace two current models \nFCA gave us a preview of the all-new 2017 Jeep Compass in September, including the photos you see below (and not much else). FCA hasn't shared a lot of details yet, but we know that the Compass will replace both the current Compass and its brawnier (but similarly sized) sibling, the Jeep Patriot, when it arrives in the U.S. early next year. It's expected that FCA will build the all-new Compass in Mexico . The all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will replace Jeep's current Compass and Patriot models. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will arrive at U.S. dealers in the first quarter of 2017. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Toyota gears up to take on Honda's HR-V \nToyota is jumping into the small-crossover fray with its all-new C-HR, a model that was originally planned for the discontinued Scion brand. The C-HR is built on the highly flexible Toyota New Global Architecture that also underpins the new-for-2016 Prius. \nIn U.S. trim, the C-HR is expected to come with Toyota's mainstay 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Toyota showed off the all-new C-HR crossover at the Paris Motor Show in October. The U.S. version is expected to be similar. Image source: Toyota. Something brand-new: A big Subaru \nFuji Heavy Industries ' (NASDAQOTH: FUJHY) quirky-but-beloved Subaru brand is expected to launch a \"three-row\" 7-passenger crossover SUV in L.A. This new Subaru will replace the Tribeca, a model that never quite caught on with brand loyalists. Being a Subaru, standard all-wheel drive is a safe bet, as is a choice between the brand's mainstay 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and its larger 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. Will Volkswagen bring a new electric car to Los Angeles? \nVolkswagen (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) took the wraps off its overhauled Golf lineup in Germany earlier this month. But it didn't show an expected battery-electric version of the compact hatchback, leading your humble Fool (among others) to speculate that VW was saving its electric Golf for the L.A. show.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Toyota Motor Corporation ( TM - Free Report ) has agreed to settle a U.S. truck lawsuit by paying roughly $3.4 billion. The lawsuit filed by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners claimed that the vehicles did not have enough rust protection. The plaintiffs’ lawyers have said that the frames could corrode, which per court papers, could lead to serious damage, thereby risking the structural integrity of the vehicles. Per court filings, the settlement covers about 1.5 million vehicles. The settlement has been valued at frame replacements of $15,000 per vehicle, or about $3.375 billion, and inspections at $60 per vehicle, or $90 million. This settlement is applicable to Tacoma trucks manufactured over the period 2005−2010, Sequoias between 2005 and 2008, and Tundras from 2007−2008. Toyota will be inspecting vehicles for 12 years from the day they were sold or leased to decide whether frames need to be replaced at the company’s expense, and owners who have previously replaced frames need to be reimbursed. Toyota has denied any wrongdoing or liability in the case. The automaker stated that it would like to solve the litigation to ensure a better experience for customers and uphold the quality as well as reliability of its vehicles. The company has agreed to pay attorney’s fees of $9.75 million as well as $0.15 million in costs and expenses. Additionally, it will pay each of the named class eight representatives and the costs related to advertising for the settlement of the lawsuit. Recently, Toyota recalled about 340,000 Pirus cars globally which is also expected to increase expenses. Moreover, the company has been facing currency headwinds due to a strong yen against the U.S. dollar in the last few quarters. \nTOYOTA MOTOR CP Price",

The Carfax will show that I have kept up with all of the maintenance since I bought this car in 2013. I am not going to try to hide anything from a buyer, this car has been in two accidents (this is the part where the car does not love me comes in!) The first time someone pulled out in from of me, in an effort to miss him I swerved and hit a snow bank. There was minor damage done to the front end. Mainly just to the bumper. The most recent time was in September (two weeks before my wedding) a guy ran a red light and hit the driver rear quarter panel. The tire was slashed and the police officer would not let me drive it two blocks home which is why the Carfax report labels it as \"disabling\". For both accidents the repairs were professionally completed at Carls Body Shop, a top body shop in Dayton. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5876994681",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008.\nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.\nAssociated Press\n Toyota Motor Corp.",

      "text": "Monday, Nov 14th, 2016 @ 5:39 pm Toyota has reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit for trucks and SUVs with rusted frames.Plaintiffs argued that the 2005-2010 Tacoma and 2005-2008 Sequoia were manufactured with insufficient corrosion protection, leaving the frames prone to premature failure.The court battle is said to have involved 2.5 million internal documents and potentially affects up to 1.5 million vehicles. The automaker denies the allegations but has reportedly agreed to inspect the vehicles and replace the frames if necessary. Attorneys representing plaintiffs suggest the replacement costs could cost up to $15,000. The settlement is said to be potentially worth up to $3.4 billion, however the actual payout will likely drop significantly as Toyota determines how many frames pass or fail inspection.\"The ultimate size of the settlement depends on a number of factors, including the valuation of the benefits offered under the settlement,\" Toyota said in a statement cited by USA Today . \n ",

The company expects to build up to 200,000 units per year, potentially expanding to other vehicles based on the same Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform.The factory will begin producing vehicles in 2019, presumably starting with the 2020 Corolla. It will employ around 2,000 workers from the Bajio region.Mexico's booming automotive manufacturing industry has emerged as a talking point in US presidential politics. President-elect Donald Trump's NAFTA criticisms have mostly focused on US automakers, but the Kentucky-built Toyota Corolla is actually considered the most American-made vehicle according to Cars.com. \n ",

When completed, the plant will be the company’s 15th in North America and produce the Corolla from 2019 onwards. Toyota says the de Guanajuato factory, costing $1 billion to build and tool, will employ approximately 2,000 people and build 200,000 Corollas annually. According to Mike Bafan, TMMGT president, “TMMGT will afford us the opportunity to boost vehicle quality and appeal while achieving cost savings through production engineering innovations. This plant will also be simple, sustainable, mindful of its environment and highly competitive. “Ultimately, this means our customers will benefit from our cars being produced locally with the highest quality and environmental standards,” Bafan said. Once production at TMMGT reaches capacity, the Japanese brand will be producing approximately 2.2 million vehicles annually in North America. PHOTO GALLERY",

(AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye, File) \nBy JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.  ",

(AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye, File) \nBy JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.

      "text": "By : Anthony Karr , Editor Owners of affected vehicles will be offered to get their trucks' frames replaced. \nToyota has announced it will pay more than $3 billion of compensations to owners of certain Tacoma , Tundra , and Sequoia models. The reason – the Japanese manufacturer was accused of designing, manufacturing, selling, and advertising “vehicles that allegedly lacked adequate rust protection on the vehicles’ frames that would allegedly result in premature rust corrosion.” That’s what the lawsuit initially filed by a Tacoma owner from Arkansas says. \nThe list of affected vehicles includes Tacoma models produced between 2005 and 2010, Tundras from 2007 and 2008, and Sequoia vehicles from 2005 to 2008. Under the agreement between Toyota and U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin in a Los Angeles court, owners of affected machines will be able to have their cars inspected and, if needed, have the rusty frame replaced. \nThe manufacturer explained it wants its customers “to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles.” \nToyota will also pay between $1.75 million and $2.5 million to notify owners, and about $9.75 million for attorneys’ fees. In addition, up to $150,000 will be paid in costs and expenses related to the court cases. \n“The ultimate size of the settlement depends on a number of factors, including the valuation of the benefits offered under the settlement,” Toyota said in a statement. “Plaintiffs’ counsel will have to explain how they’re reaching their valuation numbers. More important to us is that the agreement will deliver that value to our customers.” \nThis new agreement won’t be the only major payment Toyota will have to do in the coming months, as in late October it was announced new 5.8 million vehicles from the brand will be recalled as a part of the Takata airbags campaign. These cars have been sold in Europe in China between May 2000 and November 2001.   All New Toyota Tundra CrewMax World Debut About this article",

      "text": "Toyota to settle U.S. truck rust lawsuit for up to $3.4 billion Sat Nov 12, 2016 6:16pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T: Quote ) has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement. \n(Reporting by David Bailey in Minneapolis; Editing by Bernard Orr) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Toyota's WRC Car Will Help Accelerate Autonomous Driving System's Development | By Share While it may be hard to believe at first, Toyota asserts that its 2017 Yaris WRC car will help advance the firm’s autonomous driving technologies . The World Rally Championship is one of the most driver-focused forms of motorsport with racers relying on few electronic nannies and only their expert skills to tackle narrow roads at exceptionally high speeds. But according to the firm’s motorsport boss Koei Saga, self-driving tech can indeed benefit from this. While speaking with Autocar , Saga said its 2017 WRC car will help Toyota develop better sensors for its autonomous systems.“Right now the biggest technical difficulty [for autonomous driving] is that on the road you cannot expect everything. So when somebody suddenly drives directly in front of you or if the road is quite crowded or if some people are crossing the road without checking whether a car is coming, most of the sensors that we have right now cannot react that fast. This is one major challenge we are dealing with.“We also put our sensors on to our rally cars and they can, for example, predict a rock that is in the road in front of the car. When the sensors become capable of dealing with those obstacles at the speed of a rally car, we can enhance the level of sensor technology as a whole,” Saga said. To help with its WRC programme, Toyota’s rally team has joined forces with Microsoft in a collaboration set to further cement the relationship between the two which already includes work on self-driving systems together.

      "title": "Toyota Opportunity Exchange: Matchmaking for Diverse Suppliers",
      "text": "Toyota Opportunity Exchange: Matchmaking for Diverse Suppliers Event Has Generated Hundreds of Millions in Contracts Since 1989 November 15, 2016 CINCINNATI (November 14, 2016) – Hundreds of Tier I suppliers occupy the trade show floor at Toyota’s Opportunity Exchange each year looking to make connections with women and minority-owned businesses. One of those is Multi-Training Systems of Southfield, Mich. “I’ve been attending Opportunity Exchange for more than 10 years,” said Donna Charles, Multi-Training Systems sales and marketing manager. “We’re doing working with 10 or 15 different suppliers as a result of this event.” Charles added that doing business with Toyota Tier I and other Tier II suppliers has led to innovation within her company. “Each year that I come here I get something different out of it. What has been very meaningful to me is working with the groups in terms of utilizing technology to promote my business. At last year’s event, the organizers released a great app that we could use on the trade show floor. So I started to think about how I could use apps in our training programs and to promote my business.” That innovation was on display Monday and Tuesday, November 14 - 15, at the 27 th Annual Toyota Opportunity Exchange in Covington, Ky. There, potential and existing Tier II suppliers learn that the best way to generate business with a Toyota Tier I is to provide a product of equal or greater quality at a reduced cost. “The goal of Opportunity Exchange is to connect diverse companies with Toyota’s Tier I suppliers. By strengthening critical skills, business insight, and networking, our goal is to turn today’s connections into tomorrow’s relationships,” said Robert Young, Toyota group vice president of purchasing, supplier engineering development and cost planning. Toyota has hosted Opportunity Exchange for 27 years inviting hundreds of diverse businesses to cultivate and strengthen relationships with Tier I suppliers at the free two-day event. The event began in 1989 with 300 attendees and has grown to nearly 2,000, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for diverse suppliers. The event includes the trade show, as well as workshops and panel discussions that focus on how diverse suppliers can turn relationships into opportunities.

      "text": "Continuing Its 30th Anniversary Celebration, Toyota Surprises Three Georgetown Non-Profits with $10,000 Grants November 14, 2016 GEORGETOWN, Ky. (November 10, 2016) – Three Georgetown non-profits thought they were meeting with Toyota team members today to tell them more about their programs and make their pitch for a grant request. What they didn’t know is a group from Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. (TMMK) had something different in mind, surprising each of the three non-profits with a $10,000 check. The following organizations received $10,000 grants from TMMK today: The Gathering Place Mission – Georgetown non-profit which serves the community by helping people get back on their feet, providing daily meals, emergency shelter, personal needs and a recovery program. Georgetown- Scott County Immigrant Initiative – The immigrant community is supported by this program through educational, health, economic and cultural initiatives. Scott County Habitat for Humanity – Local organization which strives to alleviate substandard housing in Scott County by building partnerships among volunteers, families, and the community. The main goal is to transform lives, revitalize neighborhoods, and enable families in need to earn and own adequate and affordable housing. “This year marks Toyota’s thirtieth anniversary in Georgetown and we wanted to say thank you to our community for being a great partner and a great neighbor,” said Dan Antis, TMMK vice president of manufacturing. “These three organizations are doing important work in the community and we want to support them.” During the past three decades, TMMK has donated more than $123 million to communities and organizations across the state of Kentucky. That includes $85,000 in grants announced in June at the plant’s 30 th anniversary celebration to benefit a local VEX robotics program, Quest Farm, Lex-Pro and Honor Flight Kentucky. Toyota broke ground in Georgetown in 1986 on what would be the largest Toyota plant in the world. What started with 300 employees is now 8,000 team members strong with buildings spanning 169 football fields and a $6 billion (and growing) investment represented. Annual production at TMMK can top 550,000 vehicles and 600,000 engines. In 2016, the Toyota Camry once again topped the Cars.com American Made Index with 75 percent of content sourced from U.S. suppliers. The plant also produces the prestigious Lexus ES 350 after opening an all-new line in 2015. About Toyota Toyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands.

      "text": "Toyota Breaks Ground in Guanajuato Celebrates the construction of its fifteenth plant in North America and its latest investment in Mexico November 14, 2016 Apaseo el Grande, Guanajuato (Nov. 14, 2016) -- During a ceremony in Apaseo el Grande Toyota celebrated the groundbreaking of Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Guanajuato (TMMGT), its fifteenth manufacturing plant in North America. TMMGT will produce Corolla, the top selling car in the world, beginning in 2019, and will employ approximately 2,000 team members from the Bajío region. With an annual vehicle capacity of 200,000 units per year and a one-billion-dollar investment, TMMGT will serve as the model of manufacturing for Toyota thanks in part to it design built on the anticipated Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA). TNGA will serve as a catalyst for building more models on common platforms, making intelligent use of common parts, and fully leveraging Toyota’s supply chain.“TMMGT will afford us the opportunity to boost vehicle quality and appeal while achieving cost savings through production engineering innovations,” said Mike Bafan, TMMGT president. “This plant will also be simple, sustainable, mindful of its environment and highly competitive. Ultimately, this means our customers will benefit from our cars being produced locally with the highest quality and environmental standards.\" “Toyota’s investment in Guanajuato represents a long-term sign of our commitment to Mexico, its people and the Bajío region,” said Takeshi Uchiyamada, TMC board chairman. “TMMGT will play a key role in how we make products in the future, while setting a standard for manufacturing excellence in the industry.” He also highlighted that under Toyota’s Environmental Challenge 2050, which seeks to reduce the company’s global carbon footprint, Toyota will lower CO2 emissions and water usage by fifty percent. In Guanajuato alone, the automaker will help clean up Río Querétaro and strengthen water conservation. Moreover, Toyota announced it will aid the needs of the local community through mobility thanks in part to a donation of five Hilux trucks and uniforms to the local police and fire departments. The governor of Guanajuato, Miguel Márquez Márquez, commented that the installation of TMMGT contributes to consolidate the most important automotive cluster in the state. \"The development Toyota will generate in the state will benefit the economy of the region since direct and indirect jobs will be created and the number of companies that will supply the plant with different inputs will increase. Guanajuato is the main automotive cluster in the country, contributing to achieve the record in economic growth registered today, which is above the national average.\" Ildefonso Guajardo, Secretary of Economy, said that Toyota's growth in the country, with the construction of this important plant with cutting-edge technology, is a reflection of the confidence Mexico projects abroad to attract investment. \"We have very attractive competitive advantages for large companies -like Toyota- that recognize the quality of our country’s workforce,” he said. Lastly, Gonzalo González Centeno, mayor of Apaseo el Grande, thanked Toyota for its support towards the community. \"Our young people require opportunities for their development and we are sure that this complex that Toyota will build in Apaseo el Grande will bring many benefits for everyone,” he said. Once production begins at TMMGT, Toyota will have the capacity to produce approximately 2.2 million vehicles annually in North America. Attending the ceremony were Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) Board Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, TMMGT President Mike Bafan, Toyota de México Group Vice President Jun Umemura, Toyota Motor Sales de México CEO Tom Sullivan and Toyota Motor México General Counsel and Government Affairs Director Luis Lozano; accompanied by Guanajuato Governor Miguel Márquez Márquez, Mexico’s Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo and Apaseo el Grande Mayor Gonzalo González Centeno.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Toyota Prius are lined up for sale at a Toyota dealership in Springfield, Ill., Thursday, Feb. 4, 2010. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — New hybrid and electric cars are required to make noise when traveling at low speeds so that pedestrians, especially those who are blind or have poor eyesight, will hear them coming, under a new rule released Monday by the Obama administration. \nThe new rule could help prevent about 2,400 pedestrian injuries a year once all hybrids on the road are equipped to make noise, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \nHybrid vehicles use both a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Electric motors, however, make very little noise compared to gasoline and diesel engines. \nThe rule requires hybrid and electric vehicles to make audible noise when traveling in reverse or forward at speeds up to about 19 mph. The sound alert isn’t required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, provide warning. \n“We all depend on our senses to alert us to possible danger,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “With more, quieter hybrid and electrical cars on the road, the ability for all pedestrians to hear as well as see the cars becomes an important factor of reducing the risk of possible crashes and improving safety.” \nManufacturers have until Sept. 1, 2019, to equip all new hybrid and electric vehicles with sounds that meet the new federal safety standard. Half of new hybrid and electric vehicles must be in compliance one year before the final deadline. Share this: ",

      "text": "First he broke his arm, and now it seems he's broken his Toyota Prius... we're starting to have serious concerns about James May's safety on The Grand Tour. The car enthusiast probably won't be so enthusiastic about the fact that his Prius ended up nose deep in a post box this morning (November 15) outside London's King's Cross station. And this one's got May's name written all over it. Literally. But no need to worry folks, because this was all just a stunt to prepare the nation for The Grand Tour when it bumps into the tail-end of our screens on Friday. And to celebrate, Amazon is offering a £20 discount on its Prime package up until then. The first episode of May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond's new car show will be available to watch via Amazon Prime, and producers are really going that extra mile to get the word out - since it wasn't only May's Prius that was found crashed this morning. Hammond's Prius was spotted dramatically protruding out of the ground at the Hackescher Markt in Berlin, and we're guessing Clarkson's badly damaged but reasonably affordable vehicle will appear wrecked at a Grand Tour location any moment now.

      "text": " Toyota\nEvent has generated hundreds of millions in contracts since 1989\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 15, Hundreds of Tier I suppliers occupy the trade show floor at Toyota's Opportunity Exchange each year looking to make connections with women and minority-owned businesses. One of those is Multi-Training Systems of Southfield, Mich.\n\"I've been attending Opportunity Exchange for more than 10 years,\" said Donna Charles , Multi-Training Systems sales and marketing manager. \"We're doing working with 10 or 15 different suppliers as a result of this event.\"\nCharles added that doing business with Toyota Tier I and other Tier II suppliers has led to innovation within her company. \"Each year that I come here I get something different out of it. What has been very meaningful to me is working with the groups in terms of utilizing technology to promote my business. At last year's event, the organizers released a great app that we could use on the trade show floor. So I started to think about how I could use apps in our training programs and to promote my business.\"\nThat innovation was on display Monday and Tuesday, November 14 - 15, at the 27 th Annual Toyota Opportunity Exchange in Covington, Ky. There, potential and existing Tier II suppliers learn that the best way to generate business with a Toyota Tier I is to provide a product of equal or greater quality at a reduced cost.\n\"The goal of Opportunity Exchange is to connect diverse companies with Toyota's Tier I suppliers. By strengthening critical skills, business insight, and networking, our goal is to turn today's connections into tomorrow's relationships,\" said Robert Young , Toyota group vice president of purchasing, supplier engineering development and cost planning.\nToyota has hosted Opportunity Exchange for 27 years inviting hundreds of diverse businesses to cultivate and strengthen relationships with Tier I suppliers at the free two-day event. The event began in 1989 with 300 attendees and has grown to nearly 2,000, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for diverse suppliers. The event includes the trade show, as well as workshops and panel discussions that focus on how diverse suppliers can turn relationships into opportunities.\nFor more information, visit ToyotaOpportunityExchange.com .\nAbout Toyota\nToyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands.

      "text": " Toyota\nEvent has generated hundreds of millions in contracts since 1989\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 15, Hundreds of Tier I suppliers occupy the trade show floor at Toyota's Opportunity Exchange each year looking to make connections with women and minority-owned businesses. One of those is Multi-Training Systems of Southfield, Mich.\n\"I've been attending Opportunity Exchange for more than 10 years,\" said Donna Charles , Multi-Training Systems sales and marketing manager. \"We're doing working with 10 or 15 different suppliers as a result of this event.\"\nCharles added that doing business with Toyota Tier I and other Tier II suppliers has led to innovation within her company. \"Each year that I come here I get something different out of it. What has been very meaningful to me is working with the groups in terms of utilizing technology to promote my business. At last year's event, the organizers released a great app that we could use on the trade show floor. So I started to think about how I could use apps in our training programs and to promote my business.\"\nThat innovation was on display Monday and Tuesday, November 14 - 15, at the 27 th Annual Toyota Opportunity Exchange in Covington, Ky. There, potential and existing Tier II suppliers learn that the best way to generate business with a Toyota Tier I is to provide a product of equal or greater quality at a reduced cost.\n\"The goal of Opportunity Exchange is to connect diverse companies with Toyota's Tier I suppliers. By strengthening critical skills, business insight, and networking, our goal is to turn today's connections into tomorrow's relationships,\" said Robert Young , Toyota group vice president of purchasing, supplier engineering development and cost planning.\nToyota has hosted Opportunity Exchange for 27 years inviting hundreds of diverse businesses to cultivate and strengthen relationships with Tier I suppliers at the free two-day event. The event began in 1989 with 300 attendees and has grown to nearly 2,000, generating hundreds of millions in contracts for diverse suppliers. The event includes the trade show, as well as workshops and panel discussions that focus on how diverse suppliers can turn relationships into opportunities.\nFor more information, visit ToyotaOpportunityExchange.com .\nAbout Toyota\nToyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands.

      "title": "Future diesel cars could cost more than hybrids - Toyota powertrain boss",
      "text": "Choosing the black pump might not make sense if diesel cars cost more\n\nKoei Saga, chief of Toyota’s powertrain division, has predicted that cost of necessary complex aftertreatments will drive up diesel engine prices\n\nDiesel-powered vehicles could end up costing double the price of those with hybrid powertrains in the future, the boss of Toyota’s powertrain division has predicted.\n\nAs increasingly stringent emissions regulations force car manufacturers to equip their diesel-powered cars with traps and aftertreatments to reduce the amount of particulates emitted from the exhaust, these costly systems will drive up the cost of cars. Traditionally diesel-powered cars have cost more than petrol variants, but less than hybrids.\n\nKoei Saga, Toyota’s powertrain boss, said: “I think the diesel has got a very big challenge, maybe also some petrol engines. For diesel, the emission treatment is very difficult. You need a lot of technology for that and the regulations are getting harder and harder. And I think in the future diesels could cost double what we pay for a hybrid, so the costs will go up. Therefore I think for the diesel engine it will become more and more difficult.\n\n“However there are buses, trucks and ships that rely on diesel so we are conducting our research and we will continue to look at how to minimise the costs, so even if they go up they can be capped somehow.”\n\nDespite the threat of cost rises, Saga was adamant there will still be a role for diesel engines in many car markets around the world. \n\n“Even if the regulations get more strict in the industrial countries such as the USA, Japan, Europe and maybe China, there will be a lot of regions and countries that will need diesel cars and vehicles.\n\n“Particularly in the emerging markets, I think there will be a demand for very efficient diesel cars with high torque and toughness. We are continuing developing to get more efficiency and more environmentally friendly diesel cars, so I do not think that diesel will die,” he said.\n\nDiesel's share of UK new car registrations in the year to October was 47.8%, compared with 48.2% in the same period of 2015. Petrol has also experienced a minor decrease in market share, from 49.1% of the total market to 49.0%, while registrations of new alternatively fuelled vehicles has increased from 2.7% of the market in 2015 to 3.3% this year.",

      "text": "  11:02 AM EST More 2017 Toyota models make their way to Edmonton, Alberta \nEDMONTON , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- The 2017 model year has arrived, so more and more new models are rolling out to dealerships each month. Whether undergoing a bunch of changes, or simply being rebadged as a 2017 model, these vehicles offer new options to car shoppers wherever they are available. Toyota has already announced several new and refreshed vehicles for the 2017 model year, and some have even already gone on sale. But there are still quite a few models that need to be rolled over to the new model year. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161115/439856 \nOne of those models is the 2017 Toyota Avalon , the brand's flagship sedan. After undergoing a refresh last year, the full-size Avalon is ready to hit the ground running once again. Offering the most power, space and premium content out of all the brand's sedans, the Avalon makes a great option for any driver – whether single or with a family. Wheaton Toyota on the Trail, an Edmonton, Alberta dealership, has already provided some research on its website to help potential buyers find the information they're looking for. One of these pages is a comparison that sees the new Avalon take on the 2017 Genesis G80 , a brand-new sedan from the makers of Hyundai. \nComparison pages like this one pit one of Wheaton Toyota on the Trail's vehicles against one of its competitors, and highlights different aspects like efficiency, power, space and more. Another new model that will be joining the lineup soon is the 2017 Toyota Sequoia , a full-size SUV. The dealership created a research page for this new vehicle as well, pitting it against the 2017 GMC Yukon . \nResidents of the Edmonton area that might be interested in either of these vehicles can find all of this information and more at www.toyotaonthetrail.ca . Additional questions can be directed to 780-702-2222. Wheaton Toyota on the Trail is located at 5210 Calgary Trail in Edmonton , AB. \nMedia Contact: Melina Kawecki , Wheaton Toyota on the Trail, 780-702-2222, \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com",

      "text": "  GM, Ford, Toyota Report October Sales Decline Slowing October sales reinforce analysts' fear that US auto sales may have plateaued   GM +0% F +0% TM +0% NSANY +0% VLKAY +0% \nU.S. auto sales declined for the month of October despite discounts provided by dealers. Truck sales continued to show strength, but it was not enough to surpass a year-ago record in October sales with a seasonally adjusted rate of 17.5 million units. \nOne of the key reasons for the drop in sales is that it had fewer selling days in comparison to last year. Industry analysts had expected volumes to drop in the range of 6% to 8% for the month. \nAmerican automakers reported plunging sales for the month. General Motors ( NYSE:GM ), Ford ( NYSE:F ) andChrysler each posted sales decline, down 1.7%, 11.7% and 10%. Here’s a detailed look at the performances of the U.S. and other automakers. \nThe Detroit Three \nGeneral Motors' U.S. sales plunged 1.7% for the month from last year comparable's period. Buick, Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet together sold 258,626 vehicles in October. Although Buick witnessed strong sales gain of 7.4%, it was not enough to offset declines seen at Cadillac and GMC. Chevrolet sales, on the other hand, remained flat. In fact, the company’s top seller, Chevrolet Silverado, plunged 4%. Sales to retail customers climbed 3%.   GM \nFord posted a severe decline of 11.7% to 188,813 units in the U.S. auto market for October mainly because of the plunge in sales of Ford Mustang and Ford Fusion sedan. However, October was a good month for Lincoln as it sold 9,069 vehicles, up 6.9% year over year. Lincoln, which saw massive sales gain for its cars of 40.6% to 4,028 units, was the key driving force behind the luxury brand’s strong performance. Lincoln SUVs, on the other hand, experienced a drop of 10.3% to 5,041 units. The Blue Oval’s retail sales were down 7%. \nFiat Chrysler’s sales were down 10%. While sales of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Alfa and Fiat were weak, Ram sales were up 12%. Again, Maserati, the Italian luxury brand, was another bright spot for the company with sales surging nearly 12% to 1,304 units sold as compared with last year when it sold 1,164 units. \nPerformance of the other automakers \nToyota ’s ( NYSE:TM ) sales were weak, down 8.7% for October due to low demand. Toyota division car sales dropped 17% to 74,299 units old. Lexus division car sales plunged 19.7% to 10,098 vehicles compared with last year. Moreover, Toyota division truck sales were down 1% to 87,193 units. \nNissan ’s ( NSANY ) sales plunged 2.2% to 113,520 units. While sales of Nissan Armada SUV climbed a mammoth 79%, Murano SUV sales doubled last year. The combined sales of trucks, SUVs and crossovers improved 12.7%. Infiniti sales were flat, whereas the combined sales of Nissan and Infiniti declined 13%. \nVolkswagen ( VLKAY ) also registered a sales decline due to the underperformance of most of its vehicles. Sales plunged 18.5% to 24,779 units year over year. However, Beetle sales spiked 29.5%. \nOverall, U.S. retails sales were a bright spot in October as they rose 0.8%. That compares with an expectation of 6%. The better-than-expected retail numbers signify the resurgence of retail customers and higher consumer spending participating in the economic growth. It may be noted, though, the overall slowness in October sales is reinforcing analysts’ expectations regarding the U.S. auto market having reached its peak. Only time will tell if sales volume will go higher than 2015 to report yet another record year. Let’s stay tuned for the closing months. \nDisclosure: I do not hold any position in the stock/s discussed in this article. \n  A seasoned writer with keen interest in the automotive, technology, telecommunication, retail and aerospace sectors.

      "text": "You Can Help Us End This Cruelty General Motors, Volkswagen, and Toyota are among dozens of major car companies connected to JBS, including the following:\n\n\nThe horrific treatment of cows on Brazilian cattle ranches is hardly an anomaly, as branding, ear-tagging, and electroshock are standard practices in the leather industry. Violent treatment of cows has been documented during transport in India , in slaughterhouses in Bangladesh , in factory farms in the U.S., and beyond. \n\nPlease, before purchasing a vehicle, remember the gentle calves, cows, and bulls who are suffering at the hands of the auto industry as well as for fashion items from retailers such asAdidas, Reebok, Fossil, Coach, Tommy Bahama, J Crew, Target, Kenneth Cole, Dansko, Nine West, Stride Rite, Clarks, Sperry, Payless, and Rockport and for furniture sold at stores like Costco and Macy’s—all companies that have been linked to JBS. \n\nChoosing vegan leather reduces the demand for skins from cows who are branded and shocked—just like those you’ve seen here—and who suffer every step of the way. \n\nDo more: Urge the world’s largest car companies—General Motors, Volkswagen, and Toyota—to replace their leather interiors with vegan leather in all their car models so that consumers like you can easily make the compassionate choice for animals. 1 of 1 What happens in the leather industry will make you reconsider buying a car with a leather interior ever again. Subject Message A PETA video exposé featuring investigative footage from the nongovernmental organization Repórter Brasil of several cattle ranches in Brazil that supply JBS S.A., the largest slaughter company and leather producer in the world, revealed that gentle calves are branded on the face and that their mothers and bulls are electroshocked and beaten--all to produce the leather interiors offered by major car brands such as yours. It's clear from this exposé that the life of a cow in Brazil is filled with pain and distress. The eyewitness found that calves were dragged away from their mothers, forced to the ground by twisting their necks, and yanked up by their ears and tails. The eyewitness also saw workers punch holes in calves' ears and use hot irons to brand them on the face without any pain relief, which is counter to the minimum animal-welfare recommendations by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. When cows are about 3 years old, workers jab them around the anus with metal-tipped sticks and electroshock prods in order to force them onto cramped trucks and then transport them to JBS S.A. slaughterhouses. But the cruelty documented on these Brazilian cattle farms is not unique, as branding, ear-tagging, and electroshock are standard practices in the cattle industry. Violent treatment of cows has also been documented during transport in India and during slaughter in Bangladesh. At a time when vegan leather interiors are now more sustainable, innovative, and durable than animal hides, I urge you to replace your leather interiors with synthetic leather, which is better for animals and the environment and will allow consumers to be proud of the positive impact that they are having with every purchase.

      "text": "Competes with: Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue \nLooks like: Mazda didn't want to mess with a good thing \nDrivetrain: 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission; front- or all-wheel drive \nHits dealerships: 2017 \nSince its launch in 2012, the Mazda CX-5 compact SUV has been a hit for the Japanese brand, accounting for a quarter of Mazda sales around the world. At an event on the eve of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show , Mazda revealed the second-generation CX-5, which goes on sale first in Japan in February 2017 before arriving in other markets. \nMore 2016 L.A. Auto Show Coverage Exterior \nThe 2017 CX-5's new styling blends design cues of the prior model with styling touches from newer Mazdas like the CX-9 three-row SUV. The new CX-5's grille is wider, which gives it a more prominent role in the front-end look, and it meets a bulging hood that looks like it could have been sourced from an American muscle car. The lower edge of the grille is bordered by a chrome bar that sweeps up and under thin headlights. \nThe taillights are similarly thin and flow into the liftgate, which features a small spoiler. Chrome exhaust tips are tucked under the rear bumper. Interior \nLike its predecessor, the new CX-5 seats up to five people in two rows of seats. The seats can be finished in white or black leather or black fabric, and seat heaters are available for both the front and rear seats. \nThe restyled interior features a tablet-style screen that looks like it's been propped atop the dashboard. As in other Mazdas, the screen is controlled by a knob on the center console. Available features include a head-up display that shows navigation information and a Bose premium stereo. Under the Hood \nMazda shared few details regarding the CX-5's available drivetrains, but it did say 2.0-liter and 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engines will be offered along with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The previous CX-5 offered gas engines of the same displacement. There's also a diesel version of the CX-5, though it's unclear if that engine will be sold in the U.S. \nSenior Editor Mike Hanley is a father of three boys; he reviews new cars, admires classic cars and has embraced the minivan lifestyle.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nA new streaming documentary project from Academy Award-winning director Barbara Kopple and the new national nonprofit campaign WorkingNation features the Georgetown Toyota plant. \nKopple directed a series of four documentary shorts investigating the changes impacting the U.S. work force and solutions currently underway to train workers for the new economy, according to a press release from WorkingNation. \nThe newest episode, available on Fortune.com and WorkingNation.com , focuses on a two-year technical program developed by Toyota in Georgetown, that combines real work experience for incoming employees with advanced training in the field of robotics and automation. The goal for Toyota is to create ideally trained employees for their specialized needs. \nTitled, “Model of the Future,” the episode shows how employers like Toyota are working to re-design education — in this case with students from Bluegrass Community & Technical College — to fill millions of highly technical jobs with people able to do them. \nThe streaming episode is accompanied by an op-ed from National Association of Manufacturers president and CEO Jay Timmons. In the piece, Timmons explains how a growing skills gap is preventing members of the U.S. work force from filling significant employment opportunities across U.S. manufacturing industries, the new release states. \n“Over the next decade, 2 million manufacturing jobs will go unfilled. Even as our nation strives to get people back to work, a lack of trained workers — often those with trade and technical skills — leaves most manufacturing companies scrambling for talent,” writes Timmons. “This skills gap is a drag on the economy. A shortage of trained employees can slow the growth of our businesses and therefore our economy.” Related content",

      "text": "A new mod in Grand Theft Auto V lets you drive a Tesla Model X in the game. While GTA V did include a parody of the Tesla Roadster called the Coil Voltic, modders have since made a passable version of the automaker's electric SUV in the PC version of the game, complete with Supercharger station. The biggest difference is that the game version of the Model X doesn't appear to have working falcon wing doors... yet. Check it out in the video above, and read more at Electrek .\n\nKelley Blue Book has named the Toyota Prius Prime its 2017 Best Buy in the Electric/Hybrid Car category. KBB calls it \"the first PHEV to entirely resolve both issues\" of cost and ease of use. The publication praises the car's straightforward charging, its ride, the information center, and its comfortable seating. Its $28,000 starting price, available incentives, and low cost of ownership make it easy on the wallet compared to the competition, including last year's winner, the Chevrolet Volt. Read more from KBB , or from Toyota .\n\nThe DriveTheARC fast-charging corridor has begun construction in Northern California. The corridor connects Monterey to Lake Tahoe via San Jose and Sacramento, making it quick and easy for EV drivers to travel from the coast and the Bay Area to the alpine lake at the Nevada border. 50 fast chargers are planned at more than 20 locations along the route by March of 2017. The project is a collaboration between the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization , the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development , Nissan, Kanematsu , and EVgo . The DriveTheARC smartphone app directs drivers to optimal charging stations based on driving range (through the NissanConnect Data Link Service) and station availability.

      "title": "The CEO of $2.8 billion Pivotal explains why you need to change your culture to survive as a digital industry",
      "text": "print \nOver the course of the 20th Century, Toyota refined its processes for minimizing wasted time and effort in its factories so it could deliver more cars, faster. \nThe famed Toyota Production System , or TPS, was hugely influential and much-imitated in all industries, giving way to a movement called \"lean manufacturing,\" as in manufacturing without waste. \nToyota Chairman Eiji Toyoda, along with an engineer named Taiichi Ohno, helped developed the core concepts of the famed Toyota Production System between 1948 and 1975. Toyoda is shown here with GM Chairman, Roger B. Smith, right, in 1985. (AP photo/Paul Sakuma) \nThe principles of the TPS and lean manufacturing ended up inspiring the world of programmers, with the rise of so-called \"agile\" and \"lean\" software development. The same way Toyota used the system to build more cars, programmers are adapting similar methodologies to deliver more software, faster, Facebook-style. \nNow, things are starting to come full circle, says Rob Mee, CEO of $2.8 billion startup Pivotal — a software company and consultancy that's helped customers like Ford and GE ( both of whom are also Pivotal investors ) learn how to deliver code the way that Silicon Valley does. \nAs the manufacturing industry, and every other industry besides, looks to the so-called \"Internet of Things\" to automate their businesses and explore new ways of doing things, they suddenly have a need for lots of software, delivered fast. And so these industries are turning to agile software development, inspired by the TPS. \n\"The ability to update more quickly is really an advantage,\" says Mee. When worlds collide \nGenerally speaking, Mee says, the barriers between the worlds of the physical and the digital are starting to come down, as the software industry starts to build physical goods, and physical manufacturers start to build software. \n\"You can see how the world of the physical is moving into the world of the digital,\" Mee says. \"Those worlds are moving closer.\" \nTesla Motors customers received enhanced radar and other features in an over-the-air software update in Sept., 2016. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) \nThat extends to consumer goods, like the Nest thermostat or the on-board software on every Tesla , both of which are getting new features and updates all the time, delivered via the Internet. \nBut it's also true for manufacturing, or shipping, or anything, really, amid the rise of the so-called \"Industrial Internet of Things,\" where even the hugest industrial machines are getting much smarter and more automated by way of software. \nThe principles of building software for consumer goods aren't exactly the same as those for powering industrial machines, Mee says. After all, if you're building massive jet turbines, and there's a bug in the code, \"the consequences aren't the same as they are at Facebook,\" he says. \nStill, the general philosophies behind agile have bearing no matter how you look at it. Agile \nThe general tenets of agile software development, as espoused by Pivotal, is around taking away all the barriers to letting developers, well, develop. \n\"You're putting power in the hands of the developer,\" Mee says. \nFor starters, that means arming them with the tools they need to do their work without having to go through the provisioning cycle with the IT department or otherwise jump through any hoops. In an industrial setting, those platforms often end up being GE's Predix cloud , Microsoft Azure, or IBM's and SAP's own cloud offerings. \nYou can't just buy those platforms and expect magic to happen, though, says Mee. It requires real organizational change, which is a core tenet of agile development. If you're not trimming away things like unused product features, paperwork, or even extraneous meetings, you'll never get good at building software fast. \n\"What's the point? Your needs don't move that quickly,\" Mee says. New culture \nNaturally, it's a lot easier to embrace this at a small startup than it is somewhere like Ford or GE, where there are literally centuries of tradition and process to overcome to make this change. \n\"It's certainly more challenging for really large enterprises to make that shift,\" Mee says. \"There's so many more things that have been built up for many years against it, sometimes for good reason.\" \nThe way to overcome that resistance, Mee says, isn't to hold a big meeting where you declare your new priorities, but rather to demonstrate the principles at work and lead by example...even if you only go one small team at a time. \n\"You can't just say from the top, 'we have a new culture, and this is what it is,'\" Mee says.",

Photo: Chevy 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 Photo: Chevy 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 – interior Photo: Chevy Share Tweet Text Email \nChevy debuted its new Colorado ZR2 on Tuesday night at the L.A. Auto Show. The truck, available April 2017, is clearly designed to dethrone the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro as America’s mid-size, off-road vehicle of choice. \nThe specs include: a track (the width from the left tire to the right tire) that’s a full inch bigger than the Tacoma's for better stability; an inch higher ground clearance than the Tacoma (10.4 inches compared to the TRD Pro’s 9.4 inches); and a 2.8-liter diesel with 369 pound-feet of torque that's perfect for slow crawls up difficult terrain. Chevy even redesigned the bumpers to improve the truck's approach and departure angles to make clearing off-road obstacles easier. The ZR2 will also be the only midsize truck you can buy new from the dealer with front and rear locking differentials, plus a locking transfer case, all of which are intended to make the four-wheel drive more robust.",

      "text": "  \nPicking up where the now discontinued Toyota RAV4 EV left off, Hyundai has confirmed that its upcoming battery electric vehicle with a 200-mile range will be an SUV. The automaker made the announcement today at a press conference at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. Although Hyundai’s trio of Ioniq models (hybrid, plug-in, and full EV) and the automaker’s intriguing subscription ownership service were the stars at the press conference, a well-executed EV in SUV form could really help boost buying consideration in the zero emissions (at the tailpipe) segment. \nAsked about the upcoming EV crossover after the press conference, vice president of corporate and product planning Mike O’Brien added that it won’t be a vehicle that’s available today. Although Hyundai has offered a fuel cell version of the compact Tucson, this suggests the model might be a new nameplate. A higher seating position than the Ioniq models and all existing EVs could give an SUV version with a 200-mile range an advantage in the very low-volume segment. If Hyundai’s product plans don’t change, we look forward to seeing whether the EV will be offered with available or standard all-wheel drive. \nEven if it’s just a front-drive EV with SUV-like styling, we’re curious to see if Hyundai will offer a version of the Ioniq Unlimited subscription service , which for a fixed monthly payment for 24 or 36 months and no down payment, will include the cost of the Ioniq EV, registration, scheduled maintenance, charging, and unlimited mileage. The program will begin in California early in 2017, and strikes me as an interesting way to get buyers interested in a super-efficient car in a time of low gas prices. \nUntil Hyundai is ready to provide more info about its electric crossover or crossover-like vehicle, tell us: Would an all-inclusive ownership experience like Ioniq Unlimited make you more likely to consider an electric car?

      "title": "The CEO of $2.8 billion Pivotal explains why you need to change your culture to survive as a digital industry",
      "text": "Business Insider \nOver the course of the 20th Century, Toyota refined its processes for minimizing wasted time and effort in its factories so it could deliver more cars, faster.\nThe famed  Toyota Production System , or TPS, was hugely influential and much-imitated in all industries, giving way to a movement called \"lean manufacturing,\" as in manufacturing without waste. \n(AP photo/Paul Sakuma) The principles of the TPS and lean manufacturing ended up inspiring the world of programmers, with the rise of so-called \"agile\" and \"lean\" software development. The same way Toyota used the system to build more cars, programmers are adapting similar methodologies to deliver more software, faster, Facebook-style.\nNow, things are starting to come full circle, says Rob Mee, CEO of $2.8 billion startup Pivotal — a software company and consultancy that's helped customers like Ford and GE ( both of whom are also Pivotal investors ) learn how to deliver code the way that Silicon Valley does.\nAs the manufacturing industry, and every other industry besides, looks to the so-called \"Internet of Things\" to automate their businesses and explore new ways of doing things, they suddenly have a need for lots of software, delivered fast. And so these industries are turning to agile software development, inspired by the TPS. \n\"The ability to update more quickly is really an advantage,\" says Mee.\nWhen worlds collide Generally speaking, Mee says, the barriers between the worlds of the physical and the digital are starting to come down, as the software industry starts to build physical goods, and physical manufacturers start to build software.\n\"You can see how the world of the physical is moving into the world of the digital,\" Mee says. \"Those worlds are moving closer.\" \n(AP photo/Paul Sakuma) That extends to consumer goods, like the Nest thermostat or the on-board software on every Tesla , both of which are getting new features and updates all the time, delivered via the Internet. \nBut it's also true for manufacturing, or shipping, or anything, really, amid the rise of the so-called \"Industrial Internet of Things,\" where even the hugest industrial machines are getting much smarter and more automated by way of software.\nThe principles of building software for consumer goods aren't  exactly  the same as those for powering industrial machines, Mee says. After all, if you're building massive jet turbines, and there's a bug in the code, \"the consequences aren't the same as they are at Facebook,\" he says.\nStill, the general philosophies behind agile have bearing no matter how you look at it.\nAgile The general tenets of agile software development, as espoused by Pivotal, is around taking away all the barriers to letting developers, well, develop.\n\"You're putting power in the hands of the developer,\" Mee says.\nFor starters, that means arming them with the tools they need to do their work without having to go through the provisioning cycle with the IT department or otherwise jump through any hoops. In an industrial setting, those platforms often end up being GE's Predix cloud , Microsoft Azure, or IBM's and SAP's own cloud offerings.\nYou can't just buy those platforms and expect magic to happen, though, says Mee. It requires real organizational change, which is a core tenet of agile development. If you're not trimming away things like unused product features, paperwork, or even extraneous meetings, you'll never get good at building software fast.\n\"What's the point? Your needs don't move that quickly,\" Mee says. \nNew culture Naturally, it's a lot easier to embrace this at a small startup than it is somewhere like Ford or GE, where there are literally centuries of tradition and process to overcome to make this change.\n\"It's certainly more challenging for really large enterprises to make that shift,\" Mee says. \"There's so many more things that have been built up for many years against it, sometimes for good reason.\"\nThe way to overcome that resistance, Mee says, isn't to hold a big meeting where you declare your new priorities, but rather to demonstrate the principles at work and lead by example...even if you only go one small team at a time. \n\"You can't just say from the top, 'we have a new culture, and this is what it is,'\" Mee says.\n",

      "text": "  17:09 PM EST Toyota to Establish In-house Venture Company for EV Development \nToyota City, Japan,   Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) has decided to establish an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles (EVs). The venture company, which will be a virtual organization consisting of four persons-one each from Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., Denso Corporation and TMC-and which will be independent of other internal structural organizations, is set to launch in December 2016. \nIn the development of EVs, the venture company will draw on the technological knowhow and resources of the Toyota Group. Its small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products. \nBased on its thinking to provide the right vehicle at the right place at the right time, TMC has long taken a multi-angled approach to introducing environment-friendly vehicles and has developed hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), EVs and others. It has put special focus on FCVs, which, in terms of cruising range, hydrogen fueling times and other aspects, offer convenience on par with that of current gasoline-powered vehicles, making them, in TMC's view, ideal as a form of \"ultimate eco-car\". \nHowever, differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations. As such, along with its promotion of FCVs, TMC has decided to create a structure that will allow it to commercialize EVs at an early stage, as an alternative means of achieving zero emissions. \nTMC President Akio Toyoda, commenting on the establishment of the virtual venture company, said: \"Over these past few years, which we have positioned as years for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future, we have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary and have begun work to established an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets. The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.\" \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions. Toyota's vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries and regions.   www.toyota-global.com. \nSource: Toyota Toyota Motor Corporation Public Affairs Division Global Communications Department Tel: +81-3-3817-9926 \nCopyright 2016 JCN Newswire .

      "text": "Toyota to sharpen focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Reuters Reuters Photo: \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric vehicles as the Japanese automaker speeds up efforts to produce more of the lower-emission cars. \nToyota said the unit would initially consist of four people - one each from the automaker, machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \nThe team will be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations, a Toyota spokesman said, and will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \n\"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said. \n\"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\" \nThe automaker, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as the most promising \"green\" alternative to conventional cars, this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \nIt has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years, but by adding longer-range models to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Muralikumar Anantharaman) Related Links",

      "text": "  (TMC) has decided to establish an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles (EVs). The venture company, which will be a virtual organization consisting of four persons-one each from Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., Denso Corporation and TMC-and which will be independent of other internal structural organizations, is set to launch in December 2016.In the development of EVs, the venture company will draw on the technological knowhow and resources of the Toyota Group. Its small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products.Based on its thinking to provide the right vehicle at the right place at the right time, TMC has long taken a multi-angled approach to introducing environment-friendly vehicles and has developed hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), EVs and others. It has put special focus on FCVs, which, in terms of cruising range, hydrogen fueling times and other aspects, offer convenience on par with that of current gasoline-powered vehicles, making them, in TMC's view, ideal as a form of \"ultimate eco-car\".However, differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations. As such, along with its promotion of FCVs, TMC has decided to create a structure that will allow it to commercialize EVs at an early stage, as an alternative means of achieving zero emissions.TMC President Akio Toyoda, commenting on the establishment of the virtual venture company, said: \"Over these past few years, which we have positioned as years for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future, we have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary and have begun work to established an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets. The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.\" About ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions. Toyota's vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries and regions.

      "text": "Competes with: Ford Escape, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue \nLooks like: A Jeep Grand Cherokee had a \"moment\" with a Cherokee \nDrivetrain: One engine (a 2.4-liter four-cylinder), two four-wheel drive systems, three transmissions (six-speed manual and six-and nine-speed automatics) \nHits dealerships: To be announced \nCARS.COM — Jeep is taking its Compass in a new direction as a modern global product to be built in Brazil, China, Mexico and India and sold in more than 100 countries. The new Compass replaces the decade-old \"Compatriot\" twins, the Jeep Compass and Patriot SUVs that rolled out in 2006 on a platform developed by DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi, and are having a short 2017 model year. \nMore 2016 LA Auto Show Coverage \nIn size, and likely in price, the new Compass slots in the Jeep SUV lineup between the almost mid-size Jeep Cherokee and new subcompact Jeep Renegade. It is a key product for the brand, fitting squarely in the hot compact SUV segment but with a distinct Jeep flavor: a more rugged look and at least some models with more off-road capability than the competition. \nIt will be offered in four familiar Jeep trims: Sport, Latitude and Limited, as well as an off-road-oriented Trailhawk. Exterior \nThe Compass is instantly recognizable as a Jeep. If you mated a Grand Cherokee and a Cherokee, you might get this youngster; it has styling cues from each model in its side character lines and squared wheel openings. It sits wide with muscular haunches and has a Cherokee-like kicked-up beltline, but it eschews that model's eccentric headlight design for a seven-slot Jeep grille and headlights more like the Grand Cherokee. Like both models, the new Compass' LED taillights wrap into the liftgate, which is available with power. Roof options include stylish, chrome-trimmed gloss black or an anti-glare decal on the Trailhawk. \nThe more aggressive Trailhawk version also gets skid plates and its own bumper designed to offer a 30-degree approach angle and 34-degree departure. It also sits almost an inch higher for a 24-degree breakover angle. And it wouldn't be a Trailhawk without Jeep's signature red tow hooks front and rear. Interior \nInside, the family resemblance continues with the six-sided pod in the center dash housing air vents and the 5-, 7- or 8-inch display; Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' latest generation of Uconnect multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is available. Also available is a configurable 7-inch driver information display that Jeep boasts is the segment's largest. \nCharging and connectivity ports sit ahead of the traditional lever shifter with an open cubby for smaller devices and a mesh pocket for larger ones on the side of the console. The dash has a logical layout and the interior has a good-looking, clean design with interesting shapes and textures and color accents on upscale models. Under the Hood \nAll models will be powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out 180 horsepower and 175 pounds-feet of torque, has a start-stop system and will be good for up to 30 mpg, says Jeep. It will be mated to three transmission offerings and three drive systems. A six-speed manual or six-speed automatic will be offered on front-wheel-drive models; all-wheel-drive models will have FCA's nine-speed automatic or a six-speed manual. \nThe two AWD systems offered are the Jeep Active Drive full-time 4x4 system and the Jeep Active Drive Low full-time 4x4 system (standard on the Trailhawk) that includes a 20:1 crawl ratio. Both systems can send 100 percent of power to a single wheel and feature a disconnecting rear axle and power take-off unit to improve fuel efficiency. \nBoth systems also include a selectable drive mode with Auto, Snow, Sand and Mud modes, plus a Rock mode on the Trailhawk, which also has selectable speed and hill descent controls. Safety \nAvailable safety features include a backup camera with dynamic lines, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, blind spot monitor and rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nD.C. Bureau Chief Fred Meier, who lives every day with Washington gridlock, has an un-American love of small wagons and hatchbacks. Start Shopping",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | November 17, 2016 : 4:30 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nTOKYO (Nov 17): Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric vehicles as the Japanese automaker speeds up efforts to produce more of the lower-emission cars. \nToyota said the unit would initially consist of four people — one each from the automaker, machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \nThe team will be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations, a Toyota spokesman said, and will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \n\"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said. \n\"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\" \nThe automaker, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as the most promising \"green\" alternative to conventional cars, this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \nIt has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years, but by adding longer-range models to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.",

      "text": "Toyota's Impact on the U.S. Economy Nov 15, 2016 • By Jose Mateo •• 0 Views Embed from Getty Images \nToyota is now the most popular car brand not only in the United States, but in the world. In 2015, they sold more than 10 million cars worldwide, surpassing their competitors. Toyota has been at the top of the list of most cars sold for seven out of the last eight years. This is why Toyota is widely known for their contributions to globalization. This company has ultimately affected 170 different countries around the world. More specifically, growing the Toyota brand to the United States, has been a great influence on the economy. \nToyota’s Entrance to the United States \nToyota came to the United States on October 31, 1957. Since then, it has grown remarkably to become one of the most popular car manufacturers in the United States today. However, it has not always been at the top. When the company was first established in the U.S., only 288 vehicles were available. Out of the 288 cars, only one was a Land Cruiser (this model is still around today). The rest were a model called Toyopet Crown. Those two cars did not sell as well as they wanted, so they created a new car in 1965 called the Corona. This car became very popular in the United States and Toyota was starting to build their reputation for having quality and reliable cars. Then in 1968, Toyota released the Corolla, which is the world’s most popular car with over 30 million cars sold in more than 140 countries. This is when the brand “Toyota” really started to have an effect on the United States. In less than ten years, Toyota became the leading car manufacturer that sold imported cars. Now, fast forward to today and Toyota has continued to grow and essentially dominate the U.S. market. Toyota has greatly affected the U.S. economy in many different ways since expanding their company overseas. \nToyota Gives Americans Jobs \nGlobalization can really benefit the country that the company is expanding to. Even though Toyota is a Japanese company, it still has a major contribution to the U.S. economy. The biggest way the United States benefited from Toyota coming into the country is that it created many jobs. Based on a study done in 2011, Toyota has created more than 365,000 jobs in the United States. Unemployment rates has always been a concern for the country, especially after the recession toward the end of the 2000’s. \nMany Americans expressed interest in working for Toyota. The process of obtaining a job at Toyota’s assembly line is difficult. The applicants have to complete multiple training sessions to be able to get the job. Its purpose is to separate the great workers from all the applicants. Once hired, Toyota trains their employees to learn all of the assembly jobs to be able to complete any necessary job. This benefits the employees because it makes them more skilled and therefore, more important to the company. Thus, leading to a more secure job and that is a priority for all employees. \nToyota Sales are off the Charts! \nAnother way that Toyota impacts the U.S. economy is from their sales. Toyota has built their brand to become one of the top car manufacturers in the world. In 2015, Toyota dominated the U.S. market by having two of their cars as #1 and #2 on the list of bestselling cars. The Camry had a total of 361,111 cars sold, while the Corolla model sold 306,693. This is significant because this shows that Americans are buying more foreign cars than American cars such as Ford and Chevrolet. This shows that globalization is becoming more prevalent in today’s world. It is amazing that Toyota can accomplish such a feat. Toyota is certainly not the oldest car manufacturer in the market, but they are competing and winning against the older companies such as Ford. To expand that further, Toyota are outcompeting these American companies in their own backyard! \nTo summarize, Toyota becoming a globalized company has definitely impacted the United States’ economy for the better. First of all, Toyota has created many jobs and involved so many different workers to run their company successfully. Second, Toyota is one of the leading seller in cars in the U.S. When Toyota first came to the United States back in 1957, their company was small, starting with less than 300 cars and eventually discontinuing one of their main cars. However, Toyota bounced back and created a series of different cars that started to make the name “Toyota” a household name. \nOverall, Toyota has had an enormous impact and will continue to have an enormous impact on the United States’ economy. \nWorks Cited \n\"10 Most Cars: Here Are the Bestselling Cars in America for 2015.\" Car and Driver .

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | November 17, 2016 : 4:30 PM MYT TOKYO (Nov 17): Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric vehicles as the Japanese automaker speeds up efforts to produce more of the lower-emission cars.\nToyota said the unit would initially consist of four people — one each from the automaker, machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp.\nThe team will be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations, a Toyota spokesman said, and will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed.\n\"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said.\n\"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\"\nThe automaker, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as the most promising \"green\" alternative to conventional cars, this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles.\nIt has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years, but by adding longer-range models to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.\nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times.\nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/toyota-sharpen-focus-electric-cars-through-new-house-unit\n Good Articles to Share >>\nStanChart expects Bank Negara to cut OPR in 1Q17, instead of next Wed - Nov 17, 2016 [转贴] 做這3件事，讓自己明年比現在還富有 - Nov 17, 2016 Good bye at last.

      "text": "Toyota is revving up its electric car credentials with the creation of an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nIt will be a virtual organisation, made up of four people: one from each of Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., Denso Corporation and TMC.\n\nThe body will be independent from other internal organisations and launched in December. The small make-up of the company is designed to help implement \"unconventional work processes\" to speed up progress on work and get products to market quicker.\n\n*Read more*: Here's everything you need to know about Jaguar's new electric car\n\nThe unit forms part of Toyota's efforts to accelerate efforts to produce more of the lower-emission cars.\n\nThe team will plot out a strategy for dealing with keeping electric cars in line with stricter global emissions regulations. The company has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions free by 2050.\n\nTMC President Akio Toyoda, said: \"Over these past few years, which we have positioned as years for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future, we have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, making Daihatsu a fully-owned subsidiary and beginning work to establish an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets.\"\n\nThe new structure for EVs marks part of this effort and Toyoda hopes it will serve as a driving force in innovation for the company.\n\nThe company has been developing ultra-compact EVs for years, but has said it would like to have the option of expanding into developing full-size EVs. \n\n*Read more*: Mitsubishi's gearing up for an electric car revolution\n\nPrior to this, the Japanese firm had been focused on pushing plug-in electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.\n\nIt's been a busy week for the electric car market. Jaguar unveiled its first electric car earlier this week: the I-PACE Concept. It accelerates to 60mph in four seconds with a range of more than 500km.\n\nAnd BMW plans to ramp up plans of electric cars to 100,000 next year, which would involve boosting sales by two-thirds.",

      "text": "Business News | Thu Nov 17, 2016 | 11:47am GMT Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit A logo of Toyota Motor Corp is seen at the company's showroom in Tokyo, Japan June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo By Naomi Tajitsu | TOKYO \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow. \nJapan's biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations. \nThe unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \nThe announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nToyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \n\"The company's position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,\" CASA analyst Chris Richter said. \n\"It's going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,\" Richter said. \nThe new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies. These are machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \n\"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said. \n\"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\" \nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Muralikumar Anantharaman) Next In Business News",

      "text": "| November 17, 2016 This is line with Toyota's pledge to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050. \nTOKYO: Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow. \nJapan’s biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations. \nThe unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. \nThe announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. \nToyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years.

They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,” CASA analyst Chris Richter said. \n“It’s going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,” Richter said. \nThe new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies.

      "text": "1,800 HP Toyota 86 Is Built Around a Land Cruiser Engine, Goes 1/4-Mile Skating 17 Nov 2016, 17:16   U-turn As a peek into the street car-based part of the drag racing universe, we're bringing you a Toyota 86 that packs no less than nine times its factory output. Much to the delight of horsepower freaks, the Toyobaru we have here comes with a monstrous output of 1,800 ponies. And, as if that wasn't enough, this Australian-built speed animal doesn't follow what many pros would call the beaten path, namely the one that involves a Toyota JZ engine. Instead, the engine compartment of this Toyota has been filled with a 1FZ, basically the straight-six heart of a Land Cruiser. However, the powerplant has come a long, long way from its factory form. Following usual motorsport practice, the inline-six was destroked - the engine being taken from 4.5 liters to 4.0 liters allows it to be more friendly to the kind of high rpms required by its newfound racing life purpose. The unit now features a Garrett GTX55 turbocharger, along with a hefty list of supporting mods, such as forged internals. Everything is kept in check with the help of a Link Thunder ECU , while the engine works with a Powerglide two-speed transmission. The mods go much deeper than the engine bay, though. For instance, if we go under the skin, we'll find tubular work, with the contraption tipping the scales at 2,900 lbs (1,312 kg). So far, the best quarter-mile result of this 86 saw the machine delivering a 7.29s run at 197 mph, with the crew that runs the Toyota aiming for a 6s long term goal. While we're not aware of the actual reason behind this monstrous project, it could have something to do with making up for all the times when people called the Toyobaru underpowered. P.S.: Could you call this Toyota 86 a drift car? At least when it comes to moments such as the one found at the 2:19 point of the clip below, the answer is a big, fat Yes .",

      "text": "’s just not doing it for Toyota. The automaker has let development of a fully-electric electric vehicle slide, and now it’s time to play catch-up. \n\n’s A-Team. (E-Team?) \n“virtual organization,” the automaker claims the four members will operate independently from those organizations. The group, company, organization — call it what you want — officially gets to work in December. \n, the venture company’s “small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products.” \n’t covered all of its bases. Sure, the Prius hasn’t been ignored (though buyers aren’t giving it the love they once did ), and there’s a plug-in Prime variant on the way, but the company’s strong focus on fuel-cell vehicles served to momentarily take its eye off the ball. For the record, the company stands by its pro-fuel cell stance, calling it the best all-around technology for the future. \nHowever, all those pesky other companies and their EVs (existing or pending) tipped Toyota’s hand. It’s the government’s fault, too. \nThe automaker claims that “differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations.” \nWhat products can the world’s supposedly EV-hungry buyers expect? Toyota hasn’t said, though Japan’s Nikkei newspaper claims the company wants a vehicle with at least 186 miles of range by 2020. Even if the goal come to pass, expect a pack of Toyota’s competitors to cross the finish line first.",

      "text": "Toyota Explores Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fuel Cell Application Furthers Commitment to Hydrogen Society November 17, 2016 Toyota has long maintained that hydrogen fuel cell technology could be a zero emission solution across a broad spectrum of vehicle types. The scalability of this technology is enabling the automaker to explore a semi-trailer truck application for a California-based feasibility study. The Toyota Mirai will continue to provide a zero emission driving solution for global customers; a heavy-duty truck sized fuel cell vehicle creates a potential zero-emission freight transportation solution for the future. Additional details on the study, and the continued evolution of a hydrogen society, will be announced in the coming months. About Toyota Toyota (NYSE:TM), the world's top automaker and creator of the Prius and the Mirai fuel cell vehicle, is committed to advancing mobility through our Toyota and Lexus brands. Over the past 50 years, we’ve produced more than 30 million cars and trucks in North America, where we operate 14 manufacturing plants (10 in the U.S.) and directly employ more than 44,000 people (more than 34,000 in the U.S.). Our 1,800 North American dealerships (1,500 in the U.S.) sold more than 2.8 million cars and trucks (nearly 2.5 million in the U.S.) in 2015 – and about 80 percent of all Toyota vehicles sold over the past 20 years are still on the road today. Toyota partners with community, civic, academic, and governmental organizations to address our society’s most pressing mobility challenges. We share company resources and extensive know-how to support non-profits to help expand their ability to assist more people move more places.

Of course, the C-HR was always planned to sell as a Toyota in other markets, such as Europe (where that market’s production version was shown in Geneva early this year). Look, just because the lifted-coupe thing hasn’t been cool to us since “Eagle” was an American Motors brand doesn’t mean that other folks don’t find it impossibly hip. Just ask the Germans.
