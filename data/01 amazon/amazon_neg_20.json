      "text": "Britain's Morrisons extends Amazon deal with same-day service Wed Nov 16, 2016 8:04am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy James Davey \nLONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has launched a new service offering Amazon customers same-day deliveries of goods from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two firms but hitting shares in online grocer Ocado. \nOcado has its own distribution agreement with Morrisons and its shares fell 5 percent on concerns the extension of the Amazon partnership will mean it faces more competition. \nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service, launched on Wednesday, will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via the Prime Now app. \nIt builds on a deal Morrisons struck with Amazon in February that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. Morrisons said that arrangement had started well and been extended to thousands of products. \nThe new service, which remains part of the wholesale agreement, will see orders from Amazon Prime subscribers picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds or within a two-hour slot for free. \nAs with the existing wholesale deal, Amazon is able to charge its own prices. The new service will launch in selected districts in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. \nIt will run alongside the supermarket chain's existing online retail operation. Products ordered on the Morrisons.com website have been distributed by Ocado from its fulfillment centers around the country since 2014. ",

      "text": "Megyn Kelly’s New Book Gets Trolled by Donald Trump Supporters on Amazon \n“I am into real journalism nowadays,” one detractor writes as reviewers slam Fox News host Scott Collins  40 PM Fox \nIt took barely a day for Megyn Kelly’s new book to attract a torrent of bad reviews on Amazon – many of them, it seems, from Donald Trump supporters determined to bash the Fox News host, who has had a tense relationship with the president-elect. \n“Received as a gift because I used to watch Fox News,” one reviewer wrote on Wednesday, referring to “Settle for More,” Kelly’s memoir published Tuesday. “I am into real journalism nowadays.” \n“She is an insult to women journalists,” another wrote. In fact, as of Wednesday night, 62% of the 158 reviews for Kelly’s book were one star, the lowest rating in Amazon’s five-star system. Also Read: Megyn Kelly Fires Back at Bill O'Reilly: 'Roger Ailes Made the Company Look Bad' (Video) \nAccording to a report in the Los Angeles Times, the wave of bad notices appeared after a Reddit forum espousing Trump and his views urged users to troll the Kelly book and provided a link to her Amazon page. “It would be a shame if her biased reporting was reflected in the customer reviews!,” the reddit post said. \nA spokesman for HarperCollins, Kelly’s publisher, told The Times: “It has the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly. We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.” \nAmazon often removes reviews that are found to violate the company’s “Community Guidelines,” which are posted on the site. Among other rules, those guidelines tell users: “ Don’t attempt to drown out other people’s opinions, including by posting from multiple accounts or coordinating with others.” Also Read: Megyn Kelly's Memoir: 7 Eye-Openers From 'Settle For More' \nSome of the negative reviews were evidently purged Wednesday, but many others remained. \nKelly clashed with Trump during a Republican primary debate last year, when she asked the candidate about comments comparing women to “fat pigs” and “dogs.” Trump later responded by saying that Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” during the debate – a comment that many took as a reference to menstruation. \nKelly has since revealed that after the fight intensified, she felt the need to travel with a security detail. She has also had a public spat recently with colleague Bill O’Reilly, who has accused her of making Fox News “look bad” with her allegations that former network boss Roger Ailes sexually harassed her.

Studies show prime members annual spending on Amazon more than doubles that of customers who don’t belong to the service. \nIt also found that 70 percent of American households earning more than $112,000 are Prime subscribers meaning that Amazon has carved out a sizable niche among customers with disposable income.

      "text": "Deal: Amazon’s Countdown To Black Friday – 11/16/16   Justin Diaz \nBlack Friday is coming up next week, and with it there will be tons of deals on all kinds of items. Amazon not being one to wait has already started posting their deals leading up to the day in what they’re calling their “countdown to Black Friday,” and there are already some great discounts on tons of tech like Amazon’s collection of Kindle e-readers, battery packs, and more. Right now, you can pick up a Polanfo 12,000mAh battery pack that carries a slim design, two USB ports for charging two devices at once, and a small LED display to show what the battery percentage is that’s left. Normally this pack costs $29.99, but Amazon has it available for just $15.99 as part of their early Black Friday deals. \nIf you’re more in the market for a new e-reader, Amazon is offering various Kindle and Kindle bundles at discount. Right now they’re offering the Kindle Essentials Bundle for just $114.97, which includes the Kindle 6, a cover for the Kindle, and a power adapter. You can also grab the Kindle Paperwhite at $79.99 right now, or the Kindle Voyage at $119.99. \nAmazon doesn’t just offer e-readers when it comes to hardware, they also have the line of Echo speakers, and their Amazon Fire TV, both of which are also on offer at a decent price leading up to Black Friday as Amazon has the Echo Dot at $119.99, and the Amazon Fire TV at $64.99 for the current model, or $49.99 for the previous generation model. It is worth noting that the Amazon devices mentioned here are certified refurbished models, but Amazon will also be offering discounts on new models as well, with the Echo coming down in price by $40, bringing the $179.99 price down to $139.99, or the Fire HD 8 for $59.99, and a new Kindle Paperwhite for $99.99. Some of Amazon’s deals aren’t immediately live, with new deals that will be popping up each day leading up to Black Friday, and some deals continuing on through Cyber Monday. Other tech deals to look out for will be things like the Denon Heos 1 wireless speaker for $99, and a 55-inch 4K LG smart TV for $398.",

      "text": "Amazon’s $14.99 Per Month Music Family Plan Is Now Available   Kishalaya Kundu \nTo go with its Amazon Video service that has been operational in one form or another over the past decade, the Seattle, Washington-based online retail giant recently launched its music streaming service, Amazon Music Unlimited . The company had earlier announced that Amazon Prime members are eligible to subscribe to the new platform with a neat little discount, but the tech giant has now launched an all-new ‘Family Plan’ that allows up to six people to share an account for just $14.99 per month. That is a significant discount to the Individual Plans, which stand at $9.99 per month for non-Prime members and $7.99 per month for those with Prime accounts. \nOne thing to note here though, is that the pricing for the Family Plan remains the same regardless of whether or not you have an Amazon Prime membership. However, Prime members will still be able to save a few bucks if they choose to pay upfront for the whole year rather than renewing their subscription on a monthly basis. That’s because Amazon is asking for $149 for its yearly subscription package, which works out to just about $12.42 per month. There’s also an inexpensive plan on offer for those who’ve already splurged on an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot or Amazon Tap. As part of ‘Echo Plan’, the online retail giant is asking for just $3.99 per month to stream Amazon Music Unlimited on either of the three devices that come with the company’s voice-based intelligent personal assistant, Alexa. \nTalking about Alexa, Amazon says that users will be able to ask the smart virtual assistant to play any music from the available catalog even if they cannot remember the name of the song, by just mentioning a line or two of the lyrics. Amazon also has something special in store for country music fans. A couple of smash hit albums from country music superstar, Garth Brooks, are exclusively available on Amazon Music Unlimited. However, in case country music isn’t your cup of tea, the service also offers a whole host of genres to choose from, including rock, country, pop and hip hop. Interested users can sign up for the free 30-day trial by clicking through the link below.",

      "text": "“OMG It’s True!” \nWhile many have questioned the purpose of life, most insiders agree that we are here on this earth for more than what appears. Author Amos Allinger understands this better than many. Recently, the author announced his new book “OMG It’s True! You’ve Always Thought There Must Be More To This Life…There Is!”, which reveals how ordinary individuals, regardless of how challenging their circumstances have been, can find purpose, meaning, and a relationship with God. The book has made it all the way to #1 Best Seller on Amazon.com. Readers couldn’t be more excited. \nAccording to Allinger, there are ways that an individual can experience God within at almost any time. They include a process called the Discipline of the Heart. Through a tumultuous upbringing, trying circumstances, and many mistakes made, the author shares a path to finding and knowing God, and how the reader can take these practical steps as well. \n“OMG It’s True!” is available on Amazon.com in both paperback, hardback and Kindle editions. \nEarly reviews of the book have been passionate across the board. \nAn early reviewer of the book said, “What an amazing book! The honesty of his story and the incredible experience you’ll encounter make this book second to none!”",

Author Amos Allinger understands this better than many. Recently, the author announced his new book “OMG It’s True! You’ve Always Thought There Must Be More To This Life…There Is!”, which reveals how ordinary individuals, regardless of how challenging their circumstances have been, can find purpose, meaning, and a relationship with God. The book has made it all the way to #1 Best Seller on Amazon.com. Readers couldn’t be more excited. \n“The challenges we take on as leaders are immense and consequential—they affect our lives and those of our employees and customers. I wrote this book to help you navigate those troublesome feelings; to learn processes and tips for creating more structure, vision, and contentment in your life; and, most important, to discover how to lead from a place of peace,” commented Amos about his new book. \nAccording to Allinger, there are ways that an individual can experience God within at almost any time. They include a process called the Discipline of the Heart. Through a tumultuous upbringing, trying circumstances, and many mistakes made, the author shares a path to finding and knowing God, and how the reader can take these practical steps as well. \n“OMG It’s True!” is available on Amazon.com in both paperback, hardback and Kindle editions. \nEarly reviews of the book have been passionate across the board. \nAn early reviewer of the book said, “What an amazing book! The honesty of his story and the incredible experience you’ll encounter make this book second to none!” \nFor more information be sure to visit http://omgitstrue.com \nMedia Contact Company Name: Focus Management Services, LLC Contact Person: Amos Allinger",

The limited-time promotion runs from Friday Nov. 18 at 12 a.m. ET through 11:59 p.m. \nThe first episode of The Grand Tour will premiere on Amazon Prime that day with new episodes released weekly after that for 12 weeks. Prime members can watch the show (and other Prime content) via the Amazon Video app for TVs, connected devices like Amazon Fire TV , mobile devices, and online. \nThe show stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May of Top Gear fame. Fans of that BBC show no doubt recall that the trio left Top Gear last year after Clarkson was suspended following a scuffle with a Top Gear producer. The BBC has since revived the show with new hosts, including Friends star Matt LeBlanc; a US version did not fare as well. \nClarkson, Hammond, and May have since made the leap to streaming TV; The Grand Tour will feature the trio as they g o on a road trip across four continents in \"very exotic cars.\" Check out the official trailer below. \nThose with an Alexa-enabled device like the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot can enable The Grand Tour skill, which will give you a new clue every Thursday about what to watch for in the upcoming episode, and new trivia every Saturday. Fans who can answer all three questions correctly will unlock exclusive video content, and a chance to win a $25 gift card from Amazon.com. // Related Articles 12 Things to Know About Amazon Prime \nFor the uninitiated, Amazon Prime offers more than just shows. A membership includes two-day shipping on Amazon.com orders plus a number of other perks like unlimited access to Prime Video, Prime Music , Prime Photos, and early access to Amazon's Lightning Deals. Prime members in the US can now enjoy unlimited reading from a \"rotating selection of books, magazines, comics, and more\" at no additional cost. \nMeanwhile, if you're looking for deals, Microsoft , GameStop , Best Buy , Target , Walmart , Amazon , and Staples have all announced details of their Black Friday 2016 sales. \nFor more deals, check out Offers.com and TechBargains.com .

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAmazon is stepping up efforts to purge its site of fake goods, an immense task considering the vast size of its sprawling site filled with products from an expanding global network of third-party sellers. \nThe ecommerce giant is so determined to clean up its online store that it’s hit the courts, this week filing lawsuits that for the first time go after sellers allegedly offering counterfeit products to customers, the Wall Street Journal reported . \nThe legal documents – filed in a Washington court on Monday – state than when customers buy fake products from the online retail site, “it undermines the trust that customers, sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon’s brand and causing irreparable reputational harm.” \nOne of the suits focuses on a number of outlets that have allegedly been selling fake Forearm Forklift straps for moving heavy loads. The California-based company recently appeared in a CNBC feature about how its business has been “ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon.” It was even claimed last month that an incredible 90 percent of items sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products are actually fake. \nRelated: Amazon’s trade-in program now pays out instantly for games, tech, and books \nIn other efforts to rid the site of counterfeiters and their phony goods, Amazon has recently begun demanding invoices from new sellers of particular brands to prove that the products are coming from legitimate sources. \nAmazon says it invests heavily in systems designed to weed out bogus items and bans the sellers from the site whenever it identifies them. \nThe legal action against sellers of counterfeit goods follows other recent lawsuits from Amazon that targeted companies creating fake online reviews for merchants. The Seattle-based behemoth has even sent its lawyers after some of the merchants who create or buy those fake reviews in the hope of deterring others from becoming involved in the underhand behavior.

I'm not so sure about that. Say what you want about Amazon, but they're quite impressive in terms of logistics. Of note is that you can go to the Fantasy Flight Games website and buy it directly from them. While I'm not an expert, this suggests to me that Asmodee shorted Amazon (and likely some FLGS based on other threads) because there's likely more profit in it for them to sell it directly. Quote: And to add: Amazon, with 24 hours to go, says delivery by 8pm PST. Also: Not yet shipped. My account reads exactly the same. I've preordered all kinds of things from Amazon - board and video games included. I've never seen anything like this before.",

      "text": "If you want to make sure that your Amazon order contains what it says it does without having to open the box, you’re in luck because Amazon has introduced a new feature to its iPhone app that basically lets you X-ray the box. This lets users see its contents without opening the box, so in the event that it is wrong, you can send it back without having to repackage it. So how does this work? First of this isn’t actual X-ray scanning, by the way. Instead what users do is they launch the camera app within the Amazon app and then point it at the barcode on the box. Once the code has been scanned, the app will be able to bring up images of the products inside the box. Not the actual product sitting within the box, but a photo of the product just for visual reference.\nIt works even if the box contains multiple items within it as it will be able to sort them out, as you can see in the video demonstration above. Now for those who are concerned about privacy and about random people stopping by your house to scan your items, not to worry as it will not work for them.\nFrom what we can tell, you will need to be signed into your Amazon account on the app, which means that the app can tell what you’ve ordered and check that against the barcode. If it’s not yours then it won’t display the items. Pretty cool, huh?\nFiled in",

But the collateral benefit to the new trend among the young is that older women are now freer to discover what might be a natural asset hiding under a veil of dye. Some women discover they look better with white hair — who would have thought?\" Michael K said... \nWhite/Gray hair is probably genetic in my family. Mine turned gray in my 20s and my older son's in his 30s. I had a cousin whose hair turned gray when she was 16. She was gorgeous and I used to have a photo of her in her high school yearbook with white hair.I once went to a Halloween costume party at my yacht club. My costume was theatrical hair dye that dyed my hair brown. Most others at the party did not recognize me. A few that did thought, \"Oh the poor guy; to think we would not notice him starting to dye his hair.\"They did not realize it was a costume. Eleanor said... \nI think those of us who gray early are rewarded with a pretty shade of silver or white hair. Like it's the color we're supposed to have. Freeman Hunt said... \nYes! I saw a woman once who stopped dying her hair and went silvery white. It was gorgeous! She looked stunning and refined. Then some young idiot told her to dye it, so she did, and the beautiful silvery white was gone.Some people looked better with their hair dyed, and some people don't. Bob Matthews said... \nThe only reason this is a trend is because the baby boomers, the most trend-obsessed generation of Americans ever, now have gray hair. Look for upcoming NYT articles on the hipness of coronary artery disease, the desirability of arthritis (\"It allows me to slow down and look at the world!\"), and the fashionability of dementia. traditionalguy said... \nOne of my best friends and true loves is now called The Silver Fox. She is a master politician and a brilliant person. We love the person inside. On the outside is the Leopard skin pillbox hat, turned silver.

The force that through the green fuse flows doesn't drive men to gray hair. FullMoon said... \nBob Matthews said...

Guess you forgot about the first time, eh? Alzheimer tests on the 'net, Bob. Christy said... \nEarly on I developed a silver streak that my hairdresser always designed my hair style around. I never began to color it, taking my inspiration from the grace of Barbara Bush. mccullough said... \nBack when HW was president, I thought Barbara Bush should have colored her hair a bit. She looked 20 years older than her husband.I remember SNL had a skit where someone said to Barbara Bush \"you must be so proud of your son\" referring to HW. That joke turned out to be much funnier in retrospect David said... \nMy wife keeps saying she is going to do this but it never gets past the roots stage.

The assumption they are making is that there were additional resources to be allocated. I suspect that is not correct.Does anyone think that they didn't spend everything they had? Jupiter said... \n\"As Democrats begin to repair their party and learn from the shortcomings of the Clinton campaign, one of the primary arguments being made is that candidates have to show up if they expect to win.\"It really doesn't seem to occur to them that maybe the reason so many people didn't vote for Hillary Clinton is that they hate her filthy stinking guts and everything she stands for. They seem quite certain that if she had just shouted a few more lies into a few more microphones, and maybe passed out some free BBQ chicken, she could have won. Who knows, maybe they're right. Jupiter said... \n“There are only so many times you can get folks excited about Chelsea Clinton,” explained one Wisconsin Democrat.I'd say even once is pretty good. \nIt is like being at the Olympics and somebody is on steroids and somebody is not, and then blaming the person not on steroids... Well, it's like that if steroids were not against the rules. wildswan said... \nIn this article it says that they did have lots of canvassers in Pennsylvania where they also lost as thet did in Wisconsin. The difficulty in Pennsylvania was that the Dems turned out the vote in Philadelphia but it wasn't enough because even more people turned out in exurbs and rural areas. Without canvassers and without buses, Trump turned out more people. So even if the Dems had sent people to Wisconsin it might not have saved them. But by all means, Democrats, tell yourselves that it was only a failure or organization, not a failure of message. I agree with you that Hillary was the right and perfect messenger for your 2016 message: \"This is the New Normal - Suck it up, flyover losers.\" Fabi said... \nHer campaign had sixty million remaining per the last filing. Her outside groups had another twenty million. Those aren't final reports -- but I doubt cash was an issue. khesanh0802 said... \nI will once again rely on one of my favorite descriptors for Hillary's actions: HUBRIS. Here's what wikipedia has to say: Hubris describes a personality quality of extreme or foolish pride or dangerous over-confidence.[1] In its ancient Greek context, it typically describes behavior that defies the norms of behavior or challenges the gods, and which in turn brings about the downfall, or nemesis , of the perpetrator of hubris. Hillary's entire history is one of Hubris and the Gods finally got sick of it!My first encounter with Hubris was in high school English class reading the Mayor of Casterbridge. It made a lasting impression. khesanh0802 said... \nLousy candidate, lousy campaign, poor leadership, lousy message, overconfident little jerk running the campaign, outworked, out hustled, overconfidence throughout the organization, playing by outdated rules, sexual predator for husband, no feel for real people, criminal behavior, congenital liar, the Curse of Obama. I know there have to be more. Help! wildswan said... \nAnd you notice the utterly demented reaction from the left to Trump's victory. It's just like Wisconsin after Act 10 - only other states have much nastier leftists. So Trump supporters are getting beaten up. But noise in the streets, as we found in Wisconsin, does not mean lack of success for our side in the legislative chambers or lack of support for our positions. It just means the left has no winning strategy. The left had no idea of how people felt about university-student snowflakes snivelling into play-do and it still features them in its efforts to win support from the nation's adults. And it is trying to win support by riots. The media will like the riots, thinking they indicate popular support and boost ratings. But anarchy will merely guarantee larger victories for Republicans in 2018 and 2020. The question is jobs, good schools, safe streets and a reasonable foreign policy - not who riots and who the NYT likes. Patrick said... \nClinton's problem was she didn't have Lena Dunham out to WI to shill for her. That would've helped, and we can ask hope that next time, we'll hear more from Dunham and her ilk. YoungHegelian said... \nToday I was down at the office of a client, a moderately conservative think tank. I hadn't spoken to the director in some time, & when he saw me, he asked me what I thought about the election. Among other things we discussed, I said that, while it took them long enough, Republicans are starting to get the measure of Trump, but that the Democrats still truly have not faced up to just how fundamentally flawed Hillary was.He said \"They want to blame it all on Comey.\"I said \"If you want to have the FBI stay out of your business, try not having your own email server in your basement\".\"Exactly!\"",

While Siri and Google Assistant have been proven to be rather witty, it seems like Amazon’s Alexa is a bit of a nerd, as you can see from her response to this question.",

Amazon offers Prime discount to honor 'Grand Tour' show launch 0 Share: \nA car \"crashed\" into the ground at a promotional event for the new show in Berlin. Photo by Getty Images \nThe old \"Top Gear\" team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May reunite this Friday to the delight of gearheads everywhere in a new auto-focused series from Amazon called \"The Grand Tour.\" To celebrate the occasion, Amazon's introducing a new skill for Alexa and offering its Prime service at a discount. \nAmazon Prime normally costs $100 a year. Starting at 12 a.m. ET Friday, you'll be able to sign up for a year of Prime for $80 if you're a first-time user. (In the UK that's a discount from £79 to £59.) The promotion lasts all day Friday until 11:59 p.m. PT. Prime gives you access to lots of streaming video content, as well as music and free shipping. \nAlexa, the automated assistant built into popular devices like the Amazon Echo , is excited about \"The Grand Tour\" too. When you enable the Alexa skill via the app, your Echo will provide teasers on Thursdays before the weekly \"Grand Tour\" episode and offer a chance to play trivia about the episode on Saturdays. You can win a gift card if you play, and unlock extra video content if you get the questions right. \nEven if you're not a car person, the $20 discount makes this as good of a time as any to jump into Prime if you haven't already -- though I'm bummed the discount doesn't apply to current customers.

      "text": "Wal-Mart Is First, Amazon Is Worst in New Ranking on Chemicals Lauren Coleman-Lochner November 15, 2016 — 12:00 PM EST November 15, 2016 — 4:22 PM EST Study looks at 11 retailers’ policies on harmful substances Amazon, Costco are lowest-ranked for ingredient transparency \nHere’s one area where Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is handily beating Amazon.com Inc.: telling shoppers what ingredients are in the products they’re buying. \nThat’s the conclusion of a scorecard that ranks major retailers’ policies on harmful chemicals. Wal-Mart holds the top spot, followed by Target Corp. Amazon occupies last place in the study, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday. \nThe report by Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a Washington-based coalition that advocates the use of more healthful products, ranked the 11 biggest merchants on a 130-point scale. The scores are based on 13 metrics, including ingredient disclosure, credible safety screening and efforts to find safer alternatives. \n“Our policy is really to encourage a race to the top among leading retailers,” said Mike Schade, who leads the group’s retail campaign and co-wrote the report. “It’s more critical now than ever for big retailers, companies like Amazon and Costco, to use their multibillion-dollar purchasing power to drive toxic chemicals out of consumer products.” \nConsumers, retailers and manufacturers are all taking a closer look at what goes into the products they buy, sell and make as evolving science points to harm even from small exposures of some chemicals and techniques. That’s prompted the two largest U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart and Target, to introduce programs in the past three years to minimize the use of toxic ingredients in the products they offer. \n“We are excited about the progress we’ve made in the chemicals space,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said. “To date, our suppliers have successfully removed 95 percent of high-priority chemicals by volume weight from products we sell in Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores that are in the scope of our policy.” \nThe retailer will continue to work with its suppliers and groups such as Safer Chemicals “to advance sustainable chemistry,” Gardner said. Read more: what Wal-Mart asked its suppliers to stop doing \nWal-Mart, Target and CVS Health Corp. were commended for “making meaningful progress toward adopting policies for safer chemicals and products.” Wal-Mart scored a B, with 78.5 points, closely followed by Target at 76.5. CVS was graded C, with a score of 53. \n“We continue to apply a rigorous process in identifying chemicals of concern,” said Eileen Howard Boone, a senior vice president at CVS Health. “Our goal is to ensure we meet consumer demand for safe, effective and environmentally preferred ingredients and provide sufficient information to educate our customers.” \nCostco holds the penultimate spot on the list, with an F grade and 9.5 points, while the Internet giant Amazon ranked last with 7.5. \nIn July, Wal-Mart released a list of eight high-priority chemical groups it’s asked suppliers to eliminate, elaborating on a policy announced in 2013 to offer cleaning and personal-care products with safer ingredients. ‘Greater Transparency’ \nTarget, meanwhile, has expanded its own three-year-old program that rewards suppliers that list ingredients and choose safer substances. It added the cosmetics category and increased the number of substances it wants vendors to avoid. \nConcern about harmful substances in the products they come into close contact with “is very much top-of-mind” for its customers, said Jennifer Silberman, Target’s vice president of wellness and sustainability. “We know that our guests are asking for greater transparency.” \nBest Buy Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance have both promised to develop written safer chemical policies, the report said. They ranked fourth and seventh, respectively. \nCostco and Walgreens didn’t respond to a request for comment on the report, while Amazon had no immediate comment. Best Buy confirmed that it is working on a written policy but declined to comment further. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Video Is Coming to 200 Countries in December Amazon Prime Video is going to launch in India in December It will be launching in over 200 countries You can subscribe to Prime now for Rs. 499 \nEver since the launch of Amazon Prime in India in July , a lot of us have been waiting eagerly for the launch of Amazon Prime Video . Unfortunately, Amazon has only said that Prime Video is \"coming soon\". Now, the company has finally given a timeframe for the launch of Prime Video in India, though it stopped short of giving an exact date. In a tweet by The Grand Tour team, which was shared by the verified Amazon Prime Video India account, the former Top Gear stars revealed that Amazon Prime Video isn't just rolling out in India, but will soon be available in over 200 countries. This is somewhat reminiscent of the launch of Netflix in January, when it announced its entry into India and 129 other countries. It would seem that Amazon also decided that rather than spreading its service piecemeal through the world, it makes more sense to launch everything at once. You can see the full announcement video here: A message from the guys. pic.twitter.com/p1IJNRjAnS — The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016 \nAmazon Prime subscriptions are still available for Rs. 499 per year, or under Rs. 50 per month. With this, you get free shipping and special deals and discounts, which is already a pretty good offer, but in the rest of the world, you also get bundled extras such as Prime Video, and Prime Reading , which gives unlimited reading from a rotating selection of e-books. Although Amazon has not officially confirmed that Prime Video will be included in this price in India, this is all but confirmed, so you're getting unlimited video viewing, with in-demand local content, and Amazon's award winning original shows, for less than a single cup of coffee.\nAmazon Prime Video has the potential to be a really big disruptor in the Indian market. The company has made a lot of deals with Indian movie studios , and it's in the race for the rights to air IPL matches . Unlike Netflix, which is targeting the most affluent users , Amazon's pricing and content strategy makes it a product that could actually build a mass audience. \nThe company has not confirmed when in December the service will launch, though we have written to Amazon for confirmation.",

      "text": "40 shares \nUntil now, Amazon’s streaming video service has mostly been a nice add-on to sweeten the deal on its Prime subscription plan, which grants customers quicker shipping and other benefits for a recurring fee. \nIt looks like it’s going to get a lot bigger next month. In a video shared on Twitter, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, the hosts of the upcoming motoring show The Grand Tour , announced that the series will be available in more than 200 countries in December. A message from the guys. pic.twitter.com/p1IJNRjAnS \n— The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016 \nTo clarify, The Grand Tour will be available exclusively through Amazon, which means that its Prime Video service will expand worldwide. That’ll give the company a chance to take on Netflix, which was already available in 60 countries and expanded to 130 more in January. \nLike its rival, Amazon invests in producing exclusive original content and also licenses shows and movies from global studios and distributors. \nIt’s hard to say who’ll come out on top in the next few years, as both companies are working hard to deliver extensive content catalogs, including regionally relevant franchises and original programming. \nIn India, Amazon has partnered with Bollywood studios and distributors like Dharma Productions and T-Series; it’s also set to popular regional franchises and is reportedly working to secure rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket. \nIt seems like Amazon might be able to leverage competitive pricing to its advantage in the battle against Netflix around the world. For example, while Netflix costs between Rs. 6,000 ($90) and Rs. 9,600 ($143) per year in India, Amazon Prime Video will be bundled with a Prime subscription , which comes in at just Rs. 999 ($15) annually and offers additional benefits. \nThe Grand Tour will kick off on Amazon Prime Video on November 18 in the UK, Germany and Japan at 12:01 AM GMT; that’s 7:01 PM EST / 4:01 PM November 17 in the US, where it will also be available.",

      "text": "Yesterday, 1:34 PM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper \nFollowing its promise to do so earlier this year, Amazon today launched a family plan option for its Amazon Music Unlimited service. The family plan costs $15 per month (or $150 per year) and gives up to six family members all the benefits of the streaming music service. The family plan costs the same whether or not the subscriber also belongs to Amazon Prime. All users will be able to manage their own music, library, and playlists, and will receive personalized recommendations. The service includes ad-free listening, and will permit local downloads for offline playback. It differs from the Amazon Prime Music service in that it includes more songs and doesn't match or sync with user-owned libraries. Amazon Unlimited Music competes with Apple Music, Google Play Music, and Spotify.",

      "text": "Select All Posts By This User I did already order from Amazon UK myself as well considering Amazon are listed retailers shown on the Sony website it seems fairly sure that it isn't a fake which is a laughable suggestion really... Also a cable is so much easier to copy than an entire headphone and it isn't like these are moulded plastic crap like Beats which are constantly copied so it is a rather inappropriate comparison. In addition, if you order from the UK, Amazon cover you just the same and will pay for your return shipping as experienced when ordering from Amazon US several times before myself. It might take longer but if it is a third of the price on such a costly item why the hell wouldn't you? In fact several people in this thread have already said they did, you know, money talks! I do find your attitude somewhat frustrating, it seems every time anyone says something that differs to your opinion you charge head first into discrediting everything they say even if it was the truth! I noticed the exact same thing in the Focal thread and it is aggravating to say the least... Even more so as my original comment was in fact a joke but you know I forgot that Americans don't understand sarcasm, my bad...",

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited $14.99 Family Plan 8:30 am By Conner Flynn \nAmazon recently launched a new standalone music streaming service called Amazon Music Unlimited. And now it’s offering a plan to subscribers that many of its rivals like Spotify and Apple Music already offer. The company has introduced a $14.99 Family Plan for users to enjoy. The plan allows members of a family to get full access to the streaming service for one subscription charge per month. It is very similar to the one that Apple Music and Spotify offer. For the cost of $14.99 per month, the Family Plan lets up to six people share a single account. So if you and your family want to get in on this, go for it. Users in the United States can sign up right now. \nAmazon Music Unlimited is priced at $9.99 per month. However, you can actually get it for cheaper if you are interested in the service. Amazon Prime members can subscribe to this service for just $7.99 per month. Pricing for the Family Plan is $14.99 for all users whether or not they subscribe to Amazon Prime. That seems weird, but if you split the cost between family members that is a pretty sweet deal. You really can’t complain about that price at all.",

      "text": "Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0 The new feature allows you to ask questions, search and more Nov 17, 2016 08:50 GMT · By Iulian Pascal · Share: Amazon has announced the availability of new firmware packages compatible with its some of its Fire tablets, namely version 5.6.0, which includes support for the Alexa feature that allows owners to ask questions, shop, search, play music, and more. To be more specific about this release, the producer has provided firmware 32.5.6.0 targeted at its 5th Generation Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 devices, version 37.5.6.0 for the Fire 5th-gen tablet, as well as a 49.5.6.0 update compatible with the 6th Generation Fire HD 8 unit. As for the new Alexa feature, to activate it you must hold the Home button until you see a blue line; once displayed, you can feel free to give commands, ask questions, and more. Moreover, the new firmware update also includes general improvements and performance enhancements. In addition to that, take into account that Alexa will be disabled if Parental Control is turned on, and there is no possibility to use Alexa and Parental Controls at the same time. Also, do not say “Alexa” because it won’t work that way. When it comes to installation, first save the downloadable package on your desktop, transfer the .bin file onto the root folder of your Kindle’s internal storage, go to Settings > Device Options > System Updates, and tap “Update” to start the upgrade process. That said, from the links below, download the appropriate file suitable for your device model, carefully apply the new firmware, and enjoy your improved Kindle tablet. Also, constantly check our website to stay “updated one minute ago.”",

      "text": "Amex offering a free Gold Card for life, along with an Amazon Voucher November 17, 2016 by Ajay Awtaney Leave A Comment \nAmerican Express has recently launched a new Gold Card, which is essentially a Credit Card variant of their Gold charge card. The Gold Charge Card/ and the Membership Rewards Credit Card, offers 1000 Membership Rewards points for using your card 4 times a month on transactions of over INR 1000. You also get the same earning ratio and the same bouquet of reward transfer partners in the Gold Karat membership collection.The card comes at the same fee as well, with INR 1000 for the first year and INR 4500 second year onwards. \nNow, American Express is offering a free for life card to new to bank customers, as long as you apply by November 30, 2016. \nHere are the requirements you need to fulfill: Income Criteria : INR 6 Lakhs onwards per annum. To get the card free for life, you need to be earning INR 12 Lakhs upwards per annum (ex any incentives/bonuses). You must hold a credit card of another bank issued in India. You should not have held any Personal cards with American Express India in the past (including charge cards as well as credit cards). You also renege your privilege to earn any welcome or renewal gifts for being a non-fee paying customer. You need to be a resident of residents of Delhi/NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Indore, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Surat & Vadodara \nFurther, this offer only takes applications online. You need to complete your application as well as upload your KYC documents online, and you would also be sent an INR 1000 voucher from Amazon.in for getting an online approval of the card. Here is the link to the online application . Bottomline \nI think this is a great promotion from American Express, and if you have been on the fence for joining the American Express member base, you should take this opportunity to get their card free because Amex does not do free for life cards much any more. \nWill you be applying for the free-for-life Amex Membership Rewards Card? \n(P.S.: No referral links here) \nJoin over 5000 people who check-in daily to find out about the best in travel.",

      "text": "Snapdeal had capped cash on delivery limit to Rs. 2,000 Flipkart had ramped up its card on delivery service Amazon had completely disabled cash on delivery for a short time \nSoon after the announcement of demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, e-commerce giants like Amazon , Snapdeal, and Flipkart disabled or limited cash on delivery on purchases due to severe cash deficit. A few days later, Amazon India reintroduced cash on delivery , and now even Flipkart and Snapdeal have resumed full support. \nBoth the Indian ec-ommerce giants have announced that cash on delivery is now fully operational for purchases site-wide. As a result of demonetisation, the e-commerce giants had introduced various alternate payment options like wallet on delivery, deferred payments to a later date, and even had card on delivery option enabled across the country. ( Also see: FreeCharge Launches Wallet on Delivery; Paytm, MobiKwik Will Follow Suit )\nSnapdeal had limited cash on delivery, and was offering for purchases beyond Rs. 2,000 only, below which digital payment was made mandatory. It also served a warning that no Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes will be accepted during delivery. Now, the above-mentioned cash limit has been removed, and a Snapdeal spokesperson in an emailed statement said, \"We support the demonetisation effort by the government, and are committed to making this transition as frictionless and convenient as possible for our consumers. We worked closely with our users throughout the last week to ensure there was no lapse in their experience, and they have responded by swiftly adopting alternative payment modes, especially the Wallet on Delivery option. We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and do as required to ensure it is business as usual on our platform.\" \n( Also see: Demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 Notes Is Digital India's Gain ) \nFlipkart had also limited its cash on delivery purchase, and had ramped up card on delivery even in remote areas, to ease cash crunch. The e-commerce giant is also now accepting cash on delivery up to any limit. In an emailed statement, the company's spokesperson said, \"Flipkart has resumed cash on delivery fully up to any amount. As the government announced demonetization, Flipkart proactively reached out to its customers whose orders were in flight to educate them and offer additional time to procure cash. Flipkart took the initiative to provide every possible facility for a smooth and seamless order processing. We significantly ramped up our card on delivery facility and covered majority of pin-codes, also reaching remote towns. The government's decision has given a big push to adoption of digital instruments like wallets and UPI. In the last few days, we witnessed a lot of movement towards electronic transactions and we expect the economy to further support this change. To encourage customers to adopt other payment modes, we also introduced wallet cashbacks, which are being actively used by multiple sellers and brands.\" \n( Also see: Demonetisation Intent Good, but Needed More Research: Sachin Bansal ) \nAs mentioned, Amazon India had completely disabled the cash on delivery option, citing reasons beneficial to the customer. \"We have disabled COD for you to save cash for essential payments,\" the ecommerce site claimed. However, it was the first to bring cash on delivery back on track.",

      "title": "Amazon No Longer Owns and Ships the Majority of Items It Sells",
      "text": "Until Thursday, the majority of items sold on e-commerce giant Amazon were sold directly from the Seattle company, meaning that the company owned and shipped the items directly themselves. But on Thursday, Amazon said that half of all items sold on Amazon are officially from third-party sellers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs.\nSellers can sell via Amazon by shipping items themselves directly to customers or by using Amazon’s own fulfillment services. They send inventory to Amazon’s warehouses and the company takes care of the rest, including packaging the items, processing customer payments, and shipping. Depending on size and weight, sellers pay Amazon anywhere from $1.50 to $100 per order for the service, plus a standard fee.\nThe allure for many outside merchants to use and pay for Amazon to handle its shipping is to sell to Amazon's estimated 50 million Prime members, who pay $99 per year to get anything from toilet paper to diapers to books delivered to them in two days or less. For a time, merchants were eligible to be part of Prime delivery only if they were enrolled in the fulfillment program, which in 2015, delivered more than 1 billion items to customers worldwide.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nBut last year, Amazon started testing a new Seller Fulfilled Prime program, working with a set of larger merchants that already have warehouses across the U.S. and are able to deliver within the Prime two-day window. Because these merchants have their own fulfillment services, they don't need to use Amazon’s fulfillment services.\nBut they do get access to Amazon's negotiated shipping prices with companies like UPS , which are much lower than standard rates. It also allows another way for Amazon to offer more items to Prime customers without adding more capacity at Amazon’s hundred-plus fulfillment centers around the world.\nOn Thursday, Amazon said that the Seller Fulfilled Prime program had added more than 6 million new items for Prime members with free two-day or next-day shipping in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan.\nAmazon is predicting record sales for third-party sellers this holiday season, but in typical company fashion, did not reveal what it forecasts those sales to be. Last year on Cyber Monday, the online shopping holiday that takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving, sellers on Amazon received orders for more than 23 million items, a more than 40% increase year-over-year.",

His mission is to recover it for the Pope's visit. \n\"We know where we have come from, and what it has taken us to get here, and right now the future looks like a marvelous place,\" said the authors Ana Ballabriga and David Zaplana . \n\"This competition is a wonderful initiative to shed light on great Spanish works. Year after year, author's and reader's high participation  show us that there are many more unknown books that millions of people are waiting to discover,\" said Charles Kronbach , Director General of Amazon's Independent Publications. \nIn the words of Ismael Cala , ambassador of the event and best-selling author: \"Winning a competition is not a matter of luck, but of talent and perseverance.

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited family plans cost the same as Apple Music's. Photo by Amazon \nSharing is caring, and Amazon hopes you care enough about its streaming-music service to share it with your family. \nAmazon Music Unlimited , Amazon's response to streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, is now available as a $14.99-a-month subscription for up to six people. \nThe service, which debuted in October with discounted pricing for Prime members and Echo -only plans, is available in the UK , Germany and Austria, but as of right now the family plan is US-only. Prime members also have the option to pay $149 for a one-year Family Plan. \nAmazon's streaming service doesn't have as many exclusives as Apple Music , or as big of a music library as Spotify, but if you're a Prime member, it's a cheaper deal. The addition of a family plan, which is priced the same as many others , competitively increases its appeal in the crowded streaming scene. \nEditors' note, November 16, 2016: Post was edited to add that Prime members can buy a one-year Amazon Music Unlimited membership and to clarify that the service is also available in Germany and Austria.",

      "text": "5332620 \nImage source: The Motley Fool. \nRenowned investor David Gardner (whose Stock Advisor newsletter was reported in The Wall Street Journal as one of the best performing in the world*) revealed his next great stock ideas. \nAnd something very particular about one of David’s picks has some investors buzzing with excitement. \nDavid issued a rare “buy” alert on a stock that, at the time, had just recently held its IPO and went public . \nHere’s why this is such an important (and rare) move: \nIn Stock Advisor ‘s 14 year history, there have been only 4 occasions David Gardner has recommended shares of company that held its IPO within 5 months of his “buy” alert. \nThat’s incredible! Only 4 times has David looked at a brand new stock and IMMEDIATELY believed he found a winner. \nUsually, David likes to wait and see a company prove itself in the public markets for a few years before recommending investors buy shares, but sometimes , on rare occasions, he believes in a company so much, he pounds the table for investors to act fast and grab shares. \nPerhaps no example better highlights this rare conviction like David’s September 1997 recommendation of Amazon.com. Amazon was a small-cap stock that had just gone public on May 15, 1997 when David Gardner first published his detailed, 4,250 word “buy” report on Amazon ‘s (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock AND added shares to his portfolio. \nDavid predicted Jeff Bezos’s vision for Amazon. David told investors “Amazon is about more than just books.” \nAmazon had been public for just 4 months when David issued this bold “buy” recommendation but boy, did it pay to listen . \nA mere two weeks after David recommended buying shares of Amazon, the stock had already surged more than 41%. \nMany investors would be elated with a 41% pop and sell out. Not David . \nDavid refused to sell — fast-forward to today, Amazon’s stock is up a mind-boggling 20,000% — turning every $5,000 invested in Amazon into nearly $1 million today. \nWhile you can’t go back in time and invest in Amazon alongside David Gardner, I believe I’m offering you the next best thing… \nWhich brings me back to the newly IPO’d company David recommended – a company with strikingly similar traits to what made David first issue his Amazon call. \nFirst, with a market cap of around $4 billion, this stock is essentially still a small-cap. \nAnd like Amazon, this company has been growing like gangbusters! \nThe company has grown the size of its user base by 63% annually for the past 4 years – giving it more than double the market share of its next closest competitor. \nEven more exciting, management still believes they’ve only captured 11% of the potential market for their product. \nThat’s the type of growth and market opportunity that gets David Gardner’s heart pumping. \nRemember the old saying, “the early bird gets the worm” – an ageless mantra reminding us early movers often have the best chance of success. \nThat’s exactly why David recommended investors buy shares. \nBut please note : as of right now, you could miss out because you may not be eligible to access David’s pick. \nYou see, David Gardner only releases these recommendations to members of his service, Motley Fool Stock Advisor . \nLucky for you, it’s not too late to join, so I’m going to show you the simple steps to secure access today. \nIt’s very telling that David couldn’t wait any longer to recommended a newly IPO’d stock with these unmistakable traits. \nAnd while I would never guarantee David’s newest recommendation will produce Amazon-like returns, this stock is already up over 55% since David first recommended it-and up more than 10% with his most recent rerecommendation. \nEven though timing isn’t everything, history shows that it can pay to move early on stocks like this one — especially when you consider David’s average pick in Stock Advisor is up 174%! (And yes, that includes all his winners and losers!) \nDon’t miss out. There’s still plenty of time to get the full story on this remarkable company. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here’s why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who’s in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Amazon.com wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 \nThe Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com.

      "text": "The November 11, 2016 Azon Blitz marketing campaign performed exactly according to plan, catapulting “Everyday Heroes: A Collection of Motivational & Inspirational Stories from around the World” to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list. But the impact of that concentrated effort is still rippling, with the book – penned by a collective of heroic co-authors – remaining sky-high in the rankings for 7 days so far. As a result, charitable dollars continue to rack up for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, which the blitz organizer chose as the recipient of all proceeds generated. As of press time, “Everyday Heroes” was still sitting strongly in the number one position for Philosophers Biography—7 days after it launched on Amazon. Conservatively estimating then, the book has no signs of slowing down yet. And all the proceeds from those sales are all going to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.\nWhy is this a conservative estimate? “Everyday Heroes\" hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours and it has been sitting pretty at #1 New Releases in Philosophers Biographies ever since. Above and beyond that, on blitz day it also reached #4 in Amazon’s Movers and Shakers category, #6 in New Release Motivation, #8 in New Release Self-Help and #23 in Overall Motivational.\nThis inspirational, motivational and instructional collection contains the brilliance of these Everyday Heroes: Matt Bacak, Brian Evans, Alex Arnold, Ani Catino, Anthony McCarthy, Ben Bressington, Chris Hickman, Daryl Hill, David Asarnow, David Perdew, David Wright, Deanna Grayly,Diane Conklin, Donna Kennedy, Dushka Zapata, Eileen Forrestal, Gary Kissel, Helga Zelinski, Henry Gold, Jill Nieman Picerno, Jocelyn Jones, Kathleen Gage, Lee Nazal, Lou Brown, Milton Brown, Nick James, Pat Slattery, Paul Kelly, Paul Wakefield, Philip Perrin, Rosanne D'ausilio, Ph.D., Sharvin Exubrio, Sherman Ragland, Suzanne Edwards and Tom Cone.\n“First off, none of this would have been possible without my fantastic team of co-authors,” explains the campaign’s organizer. “But all our blitz participants played a major role in making this happen as well. They came together, spreading the word among their friends, family, and new fans. They are my heroes on this campaign.”\nBrian T. Evans, one of the motivators behind the blitz’s success, points out, “It’s not too late if you still want to get your copy and spread the word. More book sales equal more money for our charity, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.” Another success driver, Henry Gold, emphasizes, “We know that the reason we reach the impossible is really because we stay strong together.” “Everyday Heroes” and the people behind it drive this point home.\nFor more information on the co-authors and promoters behind the chart-topping success of “Everyday Heroes, contact the organizer, Matt Bacak, at 404-537-1425.

      "text": "Amazon is cutting Prime memberships to $79 tomorrow for debut of The Grand Tour UK subscriptions are also discounted share Amazon Prime is getting a pretty enticing price cut tomorrow , with a year of the premium subscription service available for for $79, down from $99. The deal is available to first time subscribers only, and will be up for grabs just tomorrow, Friday November 18th, from 12am ET until 11:59pm PT. The UK has a similar price cut available right now , with a year's subscription going for £59 (down from £79). The promotion coincides with the launch of The Grand Tour — Amazon’s original motoring show starring Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. The Grand Tour is available to watch exclusively on the company’s video streaming service, Prime Video, which comes bundled into a Prime subscription along with other goodies such as free music streaming, unlimited photo storage, and free one-day delivery on certain items. That last selling point has always been the foundation of Prime’s attraction to consumers, and is a good reason to consider signing up for the service tomorrow if you haven’t already. After all, with Christmas just around the corner and Black Friday deals coming up, if you think you’re likely to spend more than $79 in shipping charges from Amazon in the next year, Prime will end up paying for itself pretty quickly.

      "text": "The coordinated marketing blitz dubbed Azon Blitz drew people from all over the world to Amazon to get “Everyday Heroes\" which caused it to hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours. Thanks to so many sales, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta will be receiving thousands of dollars in charitable donations.\n\nPeachtree City, GA (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\n\nThe November 11, 2016 Azon Blitz marketing campaign performed exactly according to plan, catapulting “Everyday Heroes: A Collection of Motivational & Inspirational Stories from around the World” to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list. But the impact of that concentrated effort is still rippling, with the book – penned by a collective of heroic co-authors – remaining sky-high in the rankings for 7 days so far. As a result, charitable dollars continue to rack up for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, which the blitz organizer chose as the recipient of all proceeds generated.\n\nAs of press time, “Everyday Heroes” was still sitting strongly in the number one position for Philosophers Biography—7 days after it launched on Amazon. Conservatively estimating then, the book has no signs of slowing down yet. And all the proceeds from those sales are all going to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.\n\nWhy is this a conservative estimate? “Everyday Heroes\" hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours and it has been sitting pretty at #1 New Releases in Philosophers Biographies ever since. Above and beyond that, on blitz day it also reached #4 in Amazon’s Movers and Shakers category, #6 in New Release Motivation, #8 in New Release Self-Help and #23 in Overall Motivational.\n\nThis inspirational, motivational and instructional collection contains the brilliance of these Everyday Heroes: Matt Bacak, Brian Evans, Alex Arnold, Ani Catino, Anthony McCarthy, Ben Bressington, Chris Hickman, Daryl Hill, David Asarnow, David Perdew, David Wright, Deanna Grayly,Diane Conklin, Donna Kennedy, Dushka Zapata, Eileen Forrestal, Gary Kissel, Helga Zelinski, Henry Gold, Jill Nieman Picerno, Jocelyn Jones, Kathleen Gage, Lee Nazal, Lou Brown, Milton Brown, Nick James, Pat Slattery, Paul Kelly, Paul Wakefield, Philip Perrin, Rosanne D'ausilio, Ph.D., Sharvin Exubrio, Sherman Ragland, Suzanne Edwards and Tom Cone.\n\n“First off, none of this would have been possible without my fantastic team of co-authors,” explains the campaign’s organizer. “But all our blitz participants played a major role in making this happen as well. They came together, spreading the word among their friends, family, and new fans. They are my heroes on this campaign.”\n\nBrian T. Evans, one of the motivators behind the blitz’s success, points out, “It’s not too late if you still want to get your copy and spread the word. More book sales equal more money for our charity, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.” Another success driver, Henry Gold, emphasizes, “We know that the reason we reach the impossible is really because we stay strong together.” “Everyday Heroes” and the people behind it drive this point home.\n\nFor more information on the co-authors and promoters behind the chart-topping success of “Everyday Heroes, contact the organizer, Matt Bacak, at 404-537-1425. To order a copy of the book, with all proceeds benefiting Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, visit\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Everyday-Heroes-Collection-Motivational-Inspirational/dp/0997224037/.",

      "text": "Everyday Heroes” to Top of Amazon Bestseller List \n& Inspirational Stories from around the World” to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list. But the impact of that concentrated effort is still rippling, with the book – penned by a collective of heroic co-authors – remaining sky-high in the rankings for 7 days so far. As a result, charitable dollars continue to rack up for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, which the blitz organizer chose as the recipient of all proceeds generated. \nAs of press time, “Everyday Heroes” was still sitting strongly in the number one position for Philosophers Biography—7 days after it launched on Amazon. Conservatively estimating then, the book has no signs of slowing down yet. And all the proceeds from those sales are all going to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. \nWhy is this a conservative estimate? “Everyday Heroes\" hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours and it has been sitting pretty at #1 New Releases in Philosophers Biographies ever since. Above and beyond that, on blitz day it also reached #4 in Amazon’s Movers and Shakers category, #6 in New Release Motivation, #8 in New Release Self-Help and #23 in Overall Motivational. \nThis inspirational, motivational and instructional collection contains the brilliance of these Everyday Heroes: Matt Bacak, Brian Evans, Alex Arnold, Ani Catino, Anthony McCarthy, Ben Bressington, Chris Hickman, Daryl Hill, David Asarnow, David Perdew, David Wright, Deanna Grayly,Diane Conklin, Donna Kennedy, Dushka Zapata, Eileen Forrestal, Gary Kissel, Helga Zelinski, Henry Gold, Jill Nieman Picerno, Jocelyn Jones, Kathleen Gage, Lee Nazal, Lou Brown, Milton Brown, Nick James, Pat Slattery, Paul Kelly, Paul Wakefield, Philip Perrin, Rosanne D'ausilio, Ph.D., Sharvin Exubrio, Sherman Ragland, Suzanne Edwards and Tom Cone. \n“First off, none of this would have been possible without my fantastic team of co-authors,” explains the campaign’s organizer. “But all our blitz participants played a major role in making this happen as well. They came together, spreading the word among their friends, family, and new fans. They are my heroes on this campaign.” \nBrian T. Evans, one of the motivators behind the blitz’s success, points out, “It’s not too late if you still want to get your copy and spread the word. More book sales equal more money for our charity, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.” Another success driver, Henry Gold, emphasizes, “We know that the reason we reach the impossible is really because we stay strong together.” “Everyday Heroes” and the people behind it drive this point home. \nFor more information on the co-authors and promoters behind the chart-topping success of “Everyday Heroes, contact the organizer, Matt Bacak, at 404-537-1425. To order a copy of the book, with all proceeds benefiting Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, visit https://www.amazon.com/Everyday-Heroes-Collection-Motivational-Inspirational/dp/0997224037/ .",

The one-day sale will run from 12am ET until 11:59pm PT and is only available for new members.\n\nAmazon customers in the U.K. can take advantage of a similar promotion beginning today: Anyone who signs up for Amazon Prime between now and the end of Friday will receive a year's subscription for £59 instead of the usual £79 asking price, essentially amounting to three free months of the service.\nThe promotion coincides with the release of Amazon's new motoring show \"The Grand Tour\", the first episode of which can be streamed or downloaded on Friday morning by Prime members in the U.K., U.S., Germany , Austria, and Japan. Amazon says the show will be available to watch in 200 countries from December.\n\nThe benefits of Prime membership include free one-day delivery on eligible items, access to Amazon Prime Video and Prime Music, unlimited cloud photo storage with Prime Photos, access to the Kindle Owner's Lending Library, and early access to Amazon's Black Friday \"lightning\" deals.\n\nMembers also get an exclusive discount on subscriptions for Amazon's new Music Unlimited streaming service, giving them access to 40 million songs, compared to the 2 million included in the standard Prime Music package.\nRelated Roundup: Black Friday\nTag: Amazon Prime\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon No Longer Owns and Ships the Majority of Items It Sells \nUntil Thursday, the majority of items sold on e-commerce giant Amazon were sold directly from the Seattle company, meaning that the company owned and shipped the items directly themselves. But on Thursday, Amazon said that half of all items sold on Amazon are officially from third-party sellers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs. \nSellers can sell via Amazon by shipping items themselves directly to customers or by using Amazon’s own fulfillment services. They send inventory to Amazon’s warehouses and the company takes care of the rest, including packaging the items, processing customer payments, and shipping. Depending on size and weight, sellers pay Amazon anywhere from $1.50 to $100 per order for the service, plus a standard fee. \nThe allure for many outside merchants to use and pay for Amazon to handle its shipping is to sell to Amazon’s estimated 50 million Prime members, who pay $99 per year to get anything from toilet paper to diapers to books delivered to them in two days or less. For a time, merchants were eligible to be part of Prime delivery only if they were enrolled in the fulfillment program, which in 2015, delivered more than 1 billion items to customers worldwide. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nBut last year, Amazon started testing a new Seller Fulfilled Prime program, working with a set of larger merchants that already have warehouses across the U.S. and are able to deliver within the Prime two-day window. Because these merchants have their own fulfillment services, they don’t need to use Amazon’s fulfillment services. \nBut they do get access to Amazon’s negotiated shipping prices with companies like UPS , which are much lower than standard rates. It also allows another way for Amazon to offer more items to Prime customers without adding more capacity at Amazon’s hundred-plus fulfillment centers around the world. \nOn Thursday, Amazon said that the Seller Fulfilled Prime program had added more than 6 million new items for Prime members with free two-day or next-day shipping in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan. \nAmazon is predicting record sales for third-party sellers this holiday season, but in typical company fashion, did not reveal what it forecasts those sales to be. Last year on Cyber Monday, the online shopping holiday that takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving, sellers on Amazon received orders for more than 23 million items, a more than 40% increase year-over-year.",

      "text": "Photo by Press Eye Ltd/REX/Shutterstock \nIt’s been suspected for months but now it’s official: Amazon Prime is going global. 'The Salesman' Trailer: Asghar Farhadi's Drama Explores Relationship Woes & The Psychology Of Vengeance \nThe service is beginning its international rollout officially in December, which means viewers in more than 200 countries will be able to access its download and streaming service. \nThe news comes on the eve of the launch of Amazon’s new motoring show The Grand Tour , and was announced by presenters Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond in a YouTube video on Wednesday, in which May said: “We have received a package from Amazon, which contains my glasses and a letter which says in December, we will be launching the show globally, which means you will be able to watch The Grand Tour in over 200 countries around the world.” \nThe Grand Tour ’s first episode, which can be downloaded or streamed on Friday, November 18, will be available to Amazon Prime subscribers in the UK, U.S., Germany, Austria and Japan in addition to five other territories before the service’s global expansion next month. It comes during a period of intense marketing for the new motoring series, which has included three synchronized car crashes in London, Berlin and Los Angeles, with badly damaged cars abandoned in the middle of the street labelled with the show’s branding. Clarkson has also been in the news again this week after a story in The Sun said Clarkson claimed he was barred from a UK-bound flight by an airport employee because of a 2014 Top Gear controversy, during which the show’s members had to flee Argentina because one of their vehicles had a numberplate that appeared to refer to the Falklands War. \nIn case of any doubt of Amazon’s rollout, Clarkson also tweeted the news: So. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global. \n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nThis is a huge step for Amazon, which has been quietly calculating its global outreach, and means the service will now be available in more countries than rival Netflix, which is currently available in 190 countries around the world. \nIt became more apparent that Amazon was ultimately setting itself up for expansion with the company reshuffle announced last month , which saw Amazon Studios promote Head of Drama Development Morgan Wandell to a new post of Head of International Productions while Brad Beale, VP TV Content Acquisition for Prime Video, saw his role expand to include overseeing global selection of series for individual countries and licensing television content on a local and worldwide basis. \nDuring that announcement, the company renamed its movie division to Prime Movies, which includes all aspects of the business including production, distribution and licensing of original films. Jason Ropell, Worldwide Head of Motion Pictures, is at the helm of overseeing worldwide movie content. Bob Berney and Ted Hope report to him and the division’s slate includes a raft of smart, filmmaker-led indies such as Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck , Doug Liman’s The Wall and Richard Linklater’s Last Flag Flying . This weekend sees the domestic release of its Oscar hopeful Manchester By The Sea , directed by Kenneth Lonergan and starring Casey Affleck. \nThe promotions were seen as a real validation from Amazon head Roy Price and a signal pointing to company’s growth and expansion so it’s no surprise that the company would rollout internationally on the eve of its biggest program to date. \nLast year, after Clarkson left the BBC after allegedly assaulting a member of the Top Gear production team, fellow presenters Hammond and May jumped ship shortly afterwards. Amazon moved in on the popular trio — a move engineered by UK Film & Strategy Director Chris Bird — to set up rival motoring show The Grand Tour with their long-time exec producer Andy Wilman. The team has committed to three series as part of a global TV deal and will feature short films shot in different locations around the globe. ",

      "text": "Mark Sullivan 11.16.16 8:00 PM \nAmazon did an amazing thing when it accidentally-on-purpose figured out that people wanted purpose-built personal assistant devices in their homes. Its $179 Echo device, complete with its Alexa brain, has sold millions of units, and people are definitely crazy about them. But I've just spent a week living with the $129 Google Home assistant, and I believe Google will use its platform power to eventually steal the Echo's glory. \nI've been using the Echo for eight months, and I'm a fan. As I settled in with it, I found that I mainly used it to read the news out loud, answer random questions like word definitions, wake me up in the morning, and to control a couple of lights. \nBut after using the Google Home and Echo side by side, I can see some basic differences in approach. Google Home's female voice has a number of human-sounding answers to the same question. When I ask it to set an alarm, it might say \"you got it\" one day and \"consider it done\" the next. Music sounds better on the Home—its speaker is louder and truer to the sound of the music than the one in the Echo. \nBoth devices seem to hear and understand my speech reasonably well. Echo contains a seven-microphone array around its top to hear voices clearly, while Home contains only two microphones. Google says it uses some fancy cloud-based algorithms to understand trigger words, and the directions from which they're coming in the room. \nGoogle Home brings Google’s search prowess to bear when I ask it questions that don't contain all the key facts. \nI used two Alexa devices in my home for a few months, and the Echo in the other room often answered when I was talking to the Alexa device right in front of me in the kitchen. Google has worked out that problem with software to make sure only the Home device closest to the source of the trigger words responds. \nGoogle Home has an advantage over Echo in that it can work with Chromecast to order up movies (or music) to be played on the TV set in the living room or bedroom. You can also play music simultaneously across several Home devices in different rooms; Echo can't do that yet. \nGoogle Home brings Google’s search prowess to bear when I ask it questions that don't contain all the key facts, like \"Play that one song from Titanic .\" (Spoiler alert: It plays the Celine Dion song \"My Heart Will Go On,\" which was featured in the movie.) \nStill, it's not perfect. When you ask it to \"play that Celine Dion song on the Titanic soundtrack,\" it's stumped. When you ask \"What's the name of the second song on Dark Side of The Moon , it's stumped. When you ask it to \"play that one song from Dark Side of the Moon \" it says \"here's 'Any Color You Like',\" and then plays \"Breathe.\" Amazon Echo can play songs (via Amazon Music) when you know the name and artist, but nothing fancier than that, and frankly it sometimes plays crappy-sounding live versions of songs, which is annoying. \nI've seen Echo choke on word definition requests, while I've yet to stump Google Home. Home uses search to find pretty much any word or concept uttered by human beings. It can also crawl to the ends of the web for things like recipes, how-to advice, geography questions, historical facts, etc. It's the perfect device for settling factual disputes over the dinner table. \nOne shortcoming of Home is its ability to connect with only one person's Google account at a time. Meanwhile the Echo can be connected with multiple accounts. The users switch between accounts using a trigger phrase. \nThe strongest feature in Google Home is something called \" My Day ,\" which amounts to a sort of showcase for all the Google services the device can call on. After Home hears the trigger words \"Hey Google, what's my day look like?\" it bids you good morning, gives you the weather outside, reviews your agenda for the day based on your calendar entries, reminds you of to-dos, gives you your commute time to work, and then gives you a selection of news that you pre-select. (For me that's the NPR hourly news summary, some tech news highlights, and that's it.) The whole thing lasts about five minutes. \nIn a platform war, the combatants try to leverage as many relevant parts of their ecosystem as possible at a particular end point. \nAnd that’s one of the key jobs of a personal assistant! To orient the user to what's going on right now, what the conditions are, and what needs to be done. This is Google putting information in my brain that wouldn't normally be there. I've been getting such a briefing from Google Home for about a week now, and I find it to be a wonderfully orienting experience (especially when paired with that first glorious cup of coffee). I tend to leave the house feeling a little more in balance and in control when I know exactly what's coming. \nEcho offers a feature called \"Flash News,\" which is nice, but it's a customizable collection of news and weather, not the well-rounded briefing My Day offers. \nFlash News and My Day provide a telling view into the larger platform wars being waged by big tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The companies making these home assistant devices are big platforms that truly want to provide the operating system for your everyday life. They're all trying to anticipate the times and places you need assistance during the day, to make sure they are present on the right screen offering the right kind of information. \nThe home personal assistant is just the latest and hottest front in this battle. In a platform war, the combatants try to leverage as many relevant parts of their ecosystem as possible at a particular end point. If Platform A can do something a user really needs in a given setting on a given device, and that service is integrated with the rest of the platforms services, the user might be tempted to standardize on that platform. \nI felt that pull a few nights ago when playing around with Google Home. Like many people, I use a careful mix of Apple and Google apps. I had been using Apple's Calendar (mainly to understand how the service integrates with Apple devices and other Apple apps), but decided to switch back to Google's calendar so that Google Assistant would have more data to work with for my My Day briefing. \nIn the end, the usefulness of these home assistant devices, and your likelihood of buying one, will depend on the platform powers they can draw upon. And that's why I still believe that for most people, Google Home will win. \nGoogle's unique platform powers include search, Gmail, the Google Docs suite, Maps, and lots of other smaller services. Those are all brought to bear in My Day. \nAmazon's unique platform power is a vast online marketplace with a ton of buyer purchasing, intent, and suggestion engine data behind it. And Amazon is wisely working hard with third parties to add more meaningful skills to Alexa (there are 4,000 of them now). \nBut many of those skills aren't likely to remain exclusive to one brand of home assistant. A year down the line, Google will have extended its own Home API to developers, and I predict that Google will soon close the third-party \"skills gap\" with Amazon. Further, I expect that Google will leverage its AI and natural language chops to let users call up those skills in a more natural way. Never miss a story.

November 17, 2016 15:51 IST 1 Shares The cast of The Grand Tour Amazon Prime \nJeremy Clarkson is back with a bang. Clarkson, along with Richard Hammond and James May, are returning with the new prime car show, The Grand Tour, on November 16. \nClarkson, Hammond and May are now filming the new motoring show for Amazon Prime. The first episode featured 150 cars, 2,000 acrobats and six jet planes, which is worth £2.5million. \nThe Grand Tour will include sections filmed in front of studio audience in a giant tent. The trio has been sighted during the shooting in exotic locations of Johannesburg, California and Whitby in July with a live audience. \nHere is a sneak peek into the sets of The Grand Tour.

      "text": "Tracking George Soros's Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) \nIn 2006, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) made its web-scale application infrastructure, which was until then being used for its own e-commerce platform, available to external users. With this move, the company marked the beginning of the public cloud movement. \n“This business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has maintained its first mover advantage over the last decade and continues to be the clear leader in the public cloud space by revenue,” Goldman Sachs’ Heath Terry said in a report. He maintains a Buy rating on Amazon, with a price target of $1,010. 10 Years To $10 Billion \nAWS has made significant progress over the past 10 years. The business generated $11.1 billion in LTM [Trailing Twelve Months] revenue, which is more than fourfold the revenue reported by its largest competitor   )' Azure, Terry noted. \nAWS has over 1 million active customers and is growing at 61 percent year-over-year LTM, with 29 percent operating margins. Current And Future Trends Public cloud adoption is still in early stages. Organizations are beginning to use multiple public clouds, which indicates that “basic compute and storage offerings can be substituted between vendors.” Most organizations would use at least one public cloud over the next few years. Price cuts by one vendor are decreasingly triggering a rate reduction by other vendors. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )'s GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is perceived as being cheaper than competing products. Expectations For Amazon \nThe analyst believes AWS will continue to be the leader and expects its market share to increase from 35 percent share of the public cloud market in 2015 to 40 percent in 2020. He estimated AWS revenue at $12.4 billion for 2016, representing 57 percent growth. \nTerry expects growth to gradually slow to 55 percent in 2017 and to 49 percent in 2018 to reach $28.5 billion in revenue. “Meanwhile, we expect AWS operating margins to stay roughly flat over the next two years.” Latest Ratings for AMZN",

      "text": "Melissa Aouate Amazon \nEXCLUSIVE : Fabrik Entertainment , the producer of Amazon’s hit crime drama Bosch , has upped Melissa Aouate to Head of Development. The exec succeeds Kristen Campo, who left the company in October. 'Bosch' Is Going Back On The Case For A Fourth Season With Amazon Renewal Fabrik Aouate is making the jump from her role as SVP of Development and Production. She will continue to be supported by Abbey Morris and Paul Hilborn, who have been promoted to VPs. Prior to joining Fabrik, Aouate was a literary agent at ICM Partners and a film and television executive for director/producer Robert Zemeckis. \nLA-based Fabrik, owned by the Red Arrow Entertainment Group , is currently producing Season 3 of Bosch for air in 2017. The adaptation of Michael Connelly’s best-selling books that stars Titus Welliver as the eponymous rule-breaking detective, was recently picked up for a 4th season. \nFabrik is also developing book series Ancillary Justice for FX, social media thriller kRawl for MTV, and Midnights for USA. Together with parent Red Arrow, the company is further working on new international co-productions. \nHenrik Bastin, CEO of Fabrik, says “Melissa has been instrumental in building Fabrik’s growing slate, and I’m thrilled that we will continue to benefit from her talent and insight both in development and on set. Along with Paul and Abbey, we have a great development team, as demonstrated by our strong current and forthcoming productions. I would also like to thank Kristen for all her commitment and support over the last few years, and wish her the best of luck in her new ventures.” ",

      "title": "Trump supporters leaving onslaught of negative Amazon reviews for Megyn Kelly&apos;s book",
      "text": "Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are using online retailer Amazon to attack Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly through harsh reviews of her new book.\nMore than 100 negative one-star reviews appeared on the Amazon page selling Kelly’s memoir “Settle for More” within hours of its Tuesday release.\nMany of the comments came through a link on a pro-Trump Reddit forum called “The_Donald.” While the forum uses a Trump-Pence logo from the election campaign, it has no official association with the president-elect.\nThe forum instructed users to trash “Settle for More.” One post said: “Megyn Kelly’s new book on Amazon (link included). It would be a shame if her biased reporting was reflected in the customer reviews!” The forum mounted a similar campaign against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s last book.\nThe rapid spread of rhetoric against Kelly's book shows that many Trump fans have not forgiven her for her tough treatment of him during the contentious campaign. It also underscores how no platform — even an online retailer — is off-limits for a mobilized political force that wants to target a perceived opponent.\n'Cuck,' 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right' Jessica Roy Stephen K. Bannon's fringe brand of conservatism is suddenly front and center, after he was named to be chief strategist in Donald Trump ’s White House.

Bannon's fringe brand of conservatism is suddenly front and center, after he was named to be chief strategist in Donald Trump ’s White House. As the chairman of Breitbart News, Bannon turned the website into, in his own words, the \"go-to platform of the alt-right” – a far-right ideology ...\n(Jessica Roy) Executives at Harper Collins noticed the unusually high number of negative reviews – with one star out of a possible five -- for “Settle for More” by midday Tuesday, just hours after the book became available. The publisher only made a few advance copies available.\n“It has the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly,” said Tina Andreadis, senior vice president and director of publicity for HarperCollins. “We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.”\nAmazon, which did not respond to a request for a comment, had removed many of the reviews by Wednesday. But the page still has a high number of harsh comments for a celebrity tome that has just recently gone on sale.\n'A great purge'? Twitter suspends prominent alt-right accounts Travis M.

Andrews) The negative reviews can be potentially damaging to the success of “Settle for More,” as more than 50% of a best-selling book’s sales come through Amazon. Kelly received a $6-million advance from HarperCollins to write the book.\nAmazon users do not need to buy a book in order to post a review. The reviews from actual customers are given a “verified purchaser” designation, and those appear to have been left on the page for Kelly’s book.\n“Confused as a feminist, lacking as a 'journalist.' Now she can add 'failed as an author,' ” said one reviewer identified as One Woman’s Opinion.\nKelly is no stranger to the online wrath of Trump’s most ardent supporters.\nA prime-time anchor on Fox News Channel since 2012, Kelly became a household name after putting tough Republican primary debate questions to Trump about his past behavior toward women. Trump responded with hostile remarks about Kelly, including one that suggested she was menstruating during the debate held in August 2015. He used Twitter to attack her in the months that followed, calling her a bimbo and questioning her credibility as a journalist.\nTrump’s supporters piled on, unleashing a torrent of vicious posts. The candidate retweeted many of those remarks to his millions of Twitter followers.\nIn her book, Kelly said Trump’s public behavior toward her in 2015 led to anonymous death threats in the months that followed. She needed to have security guards accompany her and her family on a Disney World vacation.\nKelly said she made peace with Trump in April, when she personally negotiated his appearance on her prime-time special on the Fox broadcast network.\nBut Kelly has remained a polarizing figure for the conservative segment of Fox News Channel’s audience, which responds negatively to any criticism of Trump on her program.\nDuring her publicity tour for “Settle for More,” Kelly has used her confrontation with Trump as a cautionary tale for journalists who cover him in the White House.\n“If a President Trump were to come after a journalist the way the candidate Trump came after me, I think it could be potentially dangerous,” Kelly said Wednesday during an interview on “CBS This Morning.” “And I think, hopefully, the book will provide somewhat of a road map for reporters on how, potentially, to handle him.”\nKelly’s book also has caused some tension among her colleagues at Fox News. Bill O’Reilly, host of the top-rated “The O’Reilly Factor,” suggested in a TV interview and on his program that Kelly is “making my network look bad” and that she has been disloyal by writing in detail about the sexual harassment allegations against Roger Ailes , who was ousted from his post as Fox News chairman in July.\nIn the book, Kelly revealed how Ailes made inappropriate remarks and tried to initiate a sexual relationship with her early in her 12-year tenure at Fox News. She shared her experiences with the attorneys who investigated the sexual harassment charges brought in a suit against Ailes by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, which led to Ailes’ downfall.\n“If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that company allegiance,” O’Reilly said Tuesday on his program without mentioning Kelly by name. “You don’t like what’s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave. I’ve done that…. Don’t run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it.”\nDuring a publicity stop on her book tour interviews on Wednesday, Kelly was asked about O’Reilly’s comment that her book reflected poorly on Fox News.\n“I believe that Roger Ailes made the company look bad,” Kelly told “CBS This Morning.”\nThe Fox News contracts with O’Reilly and Kelly are both up in 2017.\nstephen.battaglio@latimes.com\nTwitter: @SteveBattaglio\n Megyn Kelly Donald Trump Fox News Channel Sexual Misconduct Crime Roger Ailes Fox Broadcasting Company",

      "text": "  Amazon to Stream 'The Grand Tour' in More Than 200 Countries 4:00 PM PST 12/31/1969 by Georg Szalai COMMENTS The company's video service is currently only available in a few countries. \nAmazon will stream original series The Grand Tour , hosted by Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear on-air colleagues James May and Richard Hammond, in more than 20 countries, even though its video services are currently only available in a few markets. \nClarkson & Co. unveiled the news in a YouTube video on Wednesday, ahead of the show's Friday launch to Amazon Prime subscribers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan. \nThey said they received an Amazon package and letter saying the show will become available in more than 200 countries in the coming weeks. “When the GT launches worldwide, everyone will be able to catch up on the show … to-date and then get a brand new episode every Friday on Amazon,” the letter said.",
