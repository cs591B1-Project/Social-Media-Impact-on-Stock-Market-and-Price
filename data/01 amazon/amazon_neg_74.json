      "text": "AWS Snowmobile Is Amazon's Truck That'll Move Your Data To The Cloud - Yes, It's Literally An 18-Wheeler 1 December 2016, 7:12 pm EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Amazon has introduced a new data transfer method for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Named the Snowmobile, the 18-wheeler climate-controlled truck will take companies’ exabyte-scale data to the cloud. ( Amazon Web Services ) Advertisement Amazon has apparently taken a page off the the \"sneakernet\" playbook in order to get users' data uploaded to the cloud with its newly announced Amazon Web Services Snowmobile service. Amazon's Data Truck The AWS Snowmobile service involves towing a secure 45-foot-long 18-wheeler truck loaded with 100 petabytes worth of data, helping customers move about an exabyte, or 1 billion gigabytes in a matter of weeks. Amazon says that the service is geared for large-scale operations such as finance, media, entertainment, scientific industries or other fields with mountainous amounts of data to store in the cloud. The truck will offload the data onto Amazon's Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) or Amazon Glacier , the company's web storage service. The Snowmobile will attach to its customers' network and will appear as a local, NFS-mounted volume on its customers' servers. An Upgrade To AWS Snowball The new Snowmobile data transfer service is a significant upgrade from Snowball, where Amazon deploys a rugged briefcase-like Snowball appliance for users to store their data in. These appliances, however, were only limited to 80 TB of storage, and users, companies or organizations who needed to lodge exabyte-scale data in the cloud found Snowball a cumbersome task because of its storage limit. The Snowmobile In Action Jeff Barr, Amazon Web Services' chief evangelist, illustrated the data transfer process using Lego parts. Basically, Amazon will cooperate with companies whose data centers are encumbered with racks and racks of disk drives who need to get all of their crucial data into the cloud. Keep in mind that this is just one scenario out of many others and many situations will likely fit the bill. After an agreement between two parties, the Snowmobile truck will arrive at the company's data center to migrate all the data needed to be uploaded to the cloud. Availability And Pricing Snowmobile is available in all AWS regions , though Amazon notes that unlike the Snowball, the Snowmobile service isn't meant to be carried out by a single party. As previously mentioned, Amazon will ensure that AWS professionals will discuss every facet of the process with potential companies who will order the service. Pricing details aren't available as of this time, according to Barr, though they can assure that the Snowmobile service will cost less than a network-based transfer method and will be significantly faster, too. Just for comparison, transferring 1 EB of data will take about 26 years over a 10 Gbps connection, while the same task can be accomplished in just six months using the Snowmobile. The truck's network cable can even transfer data up to 1 Tbps over multiple 40 Gbps connections integrated into the truck. \nAmazon is progressively treading other waters beyond its e-commerce mainline, bleeding onto other interest such as creating its own content , its own line of tablets and e-readers and of course, its cloud services, which puts a considerable amount of revenue in its coffers.

      "text": "This article originally appeared on Real Money on Nov. 30, 2016.\nThe competition might be making some noise, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is still in a league of its own in terms of the features and services its public cloud infrastructure can provide to customers of all sizes and backgrounds. That was the message AWS chief Andy Jassy made sure to drive home early during the lengthy keynote address he gave on Wednesday at Amazon's ( AMZN ) annual AWS re:Invent conference.\nJassy then proceeded to back up his claims by announcing a plethora of new offerings that should collectively be well-received by AWS' many enterprise clients. He also got some help from from a few notable guest speakers, some of which had announcements of their own to make.\nThe full list of new services unveiled by Jassy appears to be longer than that for the many services he announced via last year's AWS re:Invent keynote. The highlights include:\nSeveral new high-performance cloud computing instances, including ones optimized for memory, I/O activity and CPU resources. Amazon also launched an instance supporting programmable chips (FPGAs) that can be optimized for tasks such as machine learning and video-processing, and made it possible to add GPUs to any computing instance. Lightsail, a cheap and easy-to-use service for running virtual private servers. Plans range from $5 to $80 per month, and take aim at web hosting services from GoDaddy ( GDDY ) , Rackspace and many others. Athena, a service for quickly running queries against large amounts of data stored via Amazon's S3 cloud storage service. It complements Amazon's data warehousing and big data project services. New AI-powered image-recognition and text-to-speech services for developers, along with one for enabling \"natural, conversational interactions in voice and text.\" These are areas where Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) have been seen as having a lead. A version of Amazon's Aurora managed database service that's based on the enterprise-friendly PostgreSQL database. It complements a version of Aurora based on the MySQL database, and is promised to cost a fraction as much as databases from the likes of Oracle ( ORCL ) and Microsoft. Greengrass, a solution that allows AWS services to be locally run on Internet of Things (IoT) devices in places with limited or expensive web connectivity. Intel and Qualcomm are among the chip makers supporting the technology; hardware makers on board include Philips and Technicolor. Snowball Edge, an updated version of Amazon's Snowball appliance for transferring large amounts of data to an AWS data center. Unlike its predecessor, Snowball Edge has built-in computing abilities (including Greengrass support) that allows for more immediate processing of data that's headed for AWS. Snowmobile . This one needs to be seen to be believed. For enterprises that need to ship a lot more data than can be moved by the Snowball appliances, Amazon is providing a 45-foot semi-trailer that can house 100 petabytes (that's 100,000 terabytes) of data. The company's logistics teams must be proud. is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells GOOGL ? Learn more now .",

      "text": "Moonlight \nAfter nearly 4 1/2 of voting where it looked like either Amazon’s Manchester by the Sea or A24’s Moonlight was going to take best picture based on their traction, t he New York Film Critics Circle gave best film to Damien Chazelle’s La La Land . The Lionsgate/Summit movie also received 12 Critics’ Choice nominations earlier today just as the Gotham group began their deliberations. 'La La Land' Grabs Massive 12 Nominations To Lead All Movies In Critics' Choice Awards \nThe NYFCC’s historical bellwether rate for determining Oscar’s best picture is over 40%. Even when they’re off, they’re often spot-on in other categories — read last year, when they were the first ones to call Mark Rylance as supporting actor for Bridge of Spies, months before he took home the Oscar . \nManchester by the Sea and Moonlight took three wins apiece today. \nFor the Kenneth Lonergan movie, Casey Affleck won best actor , Michelle Williams (she was also recognized for Certain Women ) was named best supporting actress, and the director’s screenplay took a trophy as well. Affleck won a Gotham Award earlier this week for his turn in Manchester, and he was also nominated for best actor by the Broadcast Critics today. Last week, the Independent Spirits also nominated him. Amazon acquired the pic out of Sundance for $10M. Roadside Attractions is releasing stateside, and it has grossed $1.6M through two weekends. \nMoonlight took best feature, screenplay and a special jury award at the Gothams, but here with the NYFCC it was Mahershala Ali, who like Affleck, also had a great morning nabbing a best supporting win from NYFCC for the A24 coming-of-age drama and a Critics’ Choice nom as well. Barry Jenkins took best director, while the pic’s DP James Laxton also won. \nThere was further spillover from the Gothams in the best actress category, where Isabelle Huppert landed an NYFCC win for her turn as a rape victim in Paul Verhoeven’s Elle and also for her role in Things to Come. \nEzra Edelman’s feature documentary O.J.: Made in America won four Critics’ Choice documentary awards for feature, limited doc series, director and sports doc, and now the film possesses a NYFCC kudo. The five-part series premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and aired on ESPN in mid-June. \nSony Classics’ German Oscar entry Toni Erdmann , which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and won the Fipresci Prize, was named best foreign-language film. Maren Ade’s movie follows an eccentric father who, in an effort to get back into his corporate daughter’s life, disguises himself as her CEO’s life coach. SPC will open the dramedy on Christmas. \nSpecial lauds were announced for Martin Scorsese’s editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who recently finished Paramount’s Silence, as well as the 25th anniversary restoration for Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust. \nThe First Film category posted a tie between Kelly Fremon Craig’s R-rated teen comedy The Edge of Seventeen and Trey Edward Shults’ Krisha . Related New York Film Critics Circle 2015 Winners: ‘Carol’ Takes Four Including Best Picture, Director \nLast year, aside from best supporting actor, NYFCC synced with Oscar’s final winner in the best animated film category ( Inside Out ), and while the org gave Son of Saul best first film, that movie continued on to win best foreign-language film. Other than that, NYFCC lauded Weinstein Co.’s Carol with best film, best director Todd Haynes, Phyllis Nagy’s screenplay and Edward Lachman’s DP work. Carol was overlooked by Oscars in the best picture and director categories but received nominations for screenplay, cinematography, costumes, original score, actress (Cate Blanchett) and supporting actress (Rooney Mara). \nHere is the complete list of winners for the 2016 New York Film Critics Circle Awards; they’ll be handed out on Jan. 3 at Tao Downtown in Manhattan: \nBest film: La La Land \nBest director: Berry Jenkins, Moonlight \nBest actor: Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea \nBest actress: Isabelle Huppert, Elle \nBest supporting actor: Mahershala Ali, Moonlight \nBest supporting actress: Michelle Williams, Manchester by the Sea and Certain Women \nBest screenplay: Manchester by the Sea, Kenneth Lonergan \nBest animated film: Zootopia \nBest cinematography: Moonlight, James Laxton \nBest first film: (tie) Kelly Fremon Craig’s The Edge of Seventeen and Trey Edwards Shults Krisha \nBest foreign film: Toni Erdmann (Germany) \nBest non-fiction film (documentary): O.J.: Made in America \nSpecial Awards: Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, the other for Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust 25th Anniversary Restoration ",

Photo courtesy of Netflix. By Michelle Mills , San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: # Comments “Medici: Masters of Florence” is coming to Netflix in December. Photo courtesy of Netflix. \nAs we hurtle towards the holidays, many of us can’t help but think about time. We plan for the future and grow nostalgic for the past while worrying about just getting through our to-do list today. The movies and television series set to begin streaming in December reflect this obsession, so take a break and let them take you to another time…if only for a short while. \nExplore the past with “Medici: Masters of Florence” on Netflix. This political family drama set in the early 15th century Florence was filmed on location and boasts lush scenery and stars like Richard Madden, Stuart Martin and Dustin Hoffman. Cosimo de’ Medici (Madden) has his hands full, dealing with his sudden wealth after his father’s death and trying not to let it slip out that dad was really murdered as his seeks the killer. \nIf that’s not complex or timely enough for you, Netflix will also be offering the Canadian series “Travelers.” In this science-fiction piece, a group of surviving humans from the future use their consciousness to inhabit everyday people in the 21st century in a bid to save the world from its disastrous fate. \nAmazon Video will launch the second season of its Emmy Award-winning original series, “The Man in the High Castle.” Based on Philip K. Dick’s 1961 alternate history novel, it presents a view of what could have happened if the Allied Powers had lost World War II. \nKids can get into the time slip with “Lost in Oz” on Amazon Prime. Dorothy Gale finds her mother’s journal and quickly discovered that she — and her dog Toto — aren’t in Kansas anymore. She joins with a young witch and a giant Munchkin on a journey to find her way out of Emerald City and back home. \nIf all this jumping around through time tires you out, settle down with Netflix’s “White Rabbit Project.” Former “Mythbusters” members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara continue seeking out the reality behind contraptions, weapons, stories and legends, taking on even bigger projects and raising the bar.

      "title": "Best Stocks 2017: 4 Tech Companies to Buy Over Facebook or Amazon",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. The 4 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of Facebook or Amazon for 2017 The weeks before Thanksgiving brought a cornucopia of good news to tech investor Paul Wick. Five compan ies he owned in the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund were acquired in rapid succession as an M&A wave swept the semiconductor industry—a slice of the technology sector to which Wick has dedicated nearly half of his $4.4 billion fund. Meanwhile, shares in the Silicon Valley–based portfolio manager’s biggest holding, LAM Research, hit an all-time high. “Yet there’s still considerable upside,” says Wick. “We’re more bullish about the semi­conductor industry than we are about software or the Internet sector. ” Technology, though one of the most profitable and fastest-growing S&P 500 sectors, also tends to be relatively expensive. And investors are jittery about how President Trump’s policies might ­affect some of the largest players: After Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , Netflix nflx , and Google googl sold off in the wake of the election, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach advised investors “to stay away from these things in a big way.” But investors like Wick are finding exceptions to that ­sentiment—particularly in less glamorous but no less important corners of the industry. Though it might seem imprudent to recommend a stock that’s already risen 35% this year, LAM Research lrcx still trades at 13 times its 2017 estimated earnings. That means the stock trades at a 21% discount to the S&P 500 and is 18% cheaper than the technology sector. (For what it’s worth, LAM’s run pales beside that of the S&P 500’s best-performing stock in the first 11 months of 2016, the chipmaker Nvidia nvda , whose stock has almost tripled.) LAM doesn’t make the chips themselves, but rather equipment that companies like Samsung (one of its largest customers) use to put “flash” memory into semiconductors that are used in everything from iPhones to fitness trackers to Tesla tsla cars. Flash memory—so called because it processes data faster and with less heat than traditional hard disk drives—has become essential in enabling companies like Apple aapl to make its MacBooks more powerful and smaller at the same time, while allowing companies like Amazon and Spotify to retrieve music from their massive cloud libraries instantaneously. Historically, LAM’s stock has traded at a discount because its earnings “tend to have a lot of wiggle,” fluctuating depending on electronics’ product cycles, says USAA’s head of equities John Toohey, who is also a fan of the stock. But for the past three years LAM has grown consistently, increasing sales at a rate of 18% annually and averaging earnings growth of 56%. Wick expects that robust growth to continue in 2017, as the accelerating pace of innovation keeps semiconductor foundries buzzing: “There is no such thing as a semiconductor cycle anymore,” he says. Plus, LAM pays a dividend yielding nearly 2%—and with almost two-thirds of its cash offshore, it could benefit from a potential tax-repatriation holiday in the U.S. As the number of devices connected to the Internet has expanded, so has concern over how to keep that data safe. Spending on cybersecurity equipment, including firewalls, was on pace to grow about 13% in 2016, to $10.6 billion, Gartner says, but that rate is expected to slow to 8% over the next few years. Still, Palo Alto Networks panw , which makes state-of-the-art security systems known as next-generation firewalls, is growing its sales about four times as fast. “They’re really on the cutting edge to help people protect their infrastructure,” says Margaret Vitrano, portfolio manager of the $4 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund. Although ups and downs in businesses’ cybersecurity spending can mean volatility for Palo Alto’s earnings and its stock, the company expects to grow revenue 31% next fiscal year, making its 2017 estimated P/E of 49 look fairly reasonable. Elsewhere in cybersecurity, Wick likes Check Point Software Technologies chkp , a cheaper option (a P/E of 17). Founded in Israel in the pre-dotcom-boom 1990s, Check Point has proved to be “much more shareholder-friendly” than some of its younger peers and social media companies, Wick says; the company has bought back stock from shareholders for 13 straight years through 2016. Other investors are rethinking what it means to be a tech stock—finding opportunities in other industries where companies are using technology to make over their business models. Henry Ellenbogen, who manages the $16.3 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, points to Vail Resorts mtn . Once just an elite place to ski in Colorado, Vail has adopted a subscription model for lift tickets the way Salesforce crm has done for software and startup ClassPass has done for yoga and spinning classes: Think of it as a season’s pass with unlimited access to 13 different mountains in six states, Canada, and Australia. The company offers an app and harnesses its data to make chairlift lines more efficient—one reliable way to keep customers coming back. And Vail has been regularly acquiring new property and tucking it into its network, giving the company a scale that has helped Vail generate returns on capital unprecedented for its industry. The stock trades at a 2017 P/E ratio of 31, but Ellenbogen expects Vail to grow earnings organically 10% to 13% next year. PICKS: ",

      "text": "Pin it Share In 2014, Amazon got into the holiday spirit by releasing a compilation of Christmas tunes by indie bands and making it available for free for users of Prime Music. The 2016 edition, Indie for the Holidays , includes Melvins ' gnashing, guitar-slathered version of \"Carol of the Bells.\" \"The song has scared us since we were children,\" King Buzzo told Stereogum . \"That's why we wanted to do it.\" The band may have conquered their fears, but their \"Carol of the Bells\" seems likely to terrify future generations of children. The track is full of relentless guitars, bashing drums and swirling vocals that sound like cultish incantations. In 2014, Beth Orton, Ladyhawke, and Ashley Monroe contributed to Amazon's holiday effort, while last year's collection featured originals by YACHT and Robert Pollard along with Langhorne Slim's cover of \"Deck the Halls\" and Wild Child's take on \"Silent Night.\" Indie for the Holidays is due out on Friday.",

Photo courtesy of Netflix. By Michelle Mills , San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: # Comments “Medici: Masters of Florence” is coming to Netflix in December. Photo courtesy of Netflix. \nAs we hurtle towards the holidays, many of us can’t help but think about time. We plan for the future and grow nostalgic for the past while worrying about just getting through our to-do list today. The movies and television series set to begin streaming in December reflect this obsession, so take a break and let them take you to another time…if only for a short while. \nExplore the past with “Medici: Masters of Florence” on Netflix. This political family drama set in the early 15th century Florence was filmed on location and boasts lush scenery and stars like Richard Madden, Stuart Martin and Dustin Hoffman. Cosimo de’ Medici (Madden) has his hands full, dealing with his sudden wealth after his father’s death and trying not to let it slip out that dad was really murdered as his seeks the killer. \nIf that’s not complex or timely enough for you, Netflix will also be offering the Canadian series “Travelers.” In this science-fiction piece, a group of surviving humans from the future use their consciousness to inhabit everyday people in the 21st century in a bid to save the world from its disastrous fate. \nAmazon Video will launch the second season of its Emmy Award-winning original series, “The Man in the High Castle.” Based on Philip K. Dick’s 1961 alternate history novel, it presents a view of what could have happened if the Allied Powers had lost World War II. \nKids can get into the time slip with “Lost in Oz” on Amazon Prime. Dorothy Gale finds her mother’s journal and quickly discovered that she — and her dog Toto — aren’t in Kansas anymore. She joins with a young witch and a giant Munchkin on a journey to find her way out of Emerald City and back home. \nIf all this jumping around through time tires you out, settle down with Netflix’s “White Rabbit Project.” Former “Mythbusters” members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara continue seeking out the reality behind contraptions, weapons, stories and legends, taking on even bigger projects and raising the bar.

      "text": "Home > Hardware > Seagate Duet Portable Hard Drive Automatically Syncs with Amazon Cloud Drive Seagate Duet Portable Hard Drive Automatically Syncs with Amazon Cloud Drive Tweet \nSeagate has announced the launch of Seagate Duet 1TB portable hard drive with auto-sync to Amazon Cloud Drive, so that your data is always backed in the cloud. If you use the drive to backup data, that means you’ll have a extra backup copy in the cloud, which could be useful if the drive fails just when you want to back it up (it happened to me), or somehow your house burns down… Another advantage is that if you forget to take your drive with you, the data will be accessible from anywhere with an Internet connection from Amazon Cloud service. It connects through your Mac or PC’s USB 3.0 port, and sync files to the cloud after an initial setup with your Amazon account. Once the setup is done, you can use the drive as you’d normally do, and files will automatically be backed up in the cloud. The Amazon Drive mobile app will allow people to access their files from phones or tablets running Android or iOS operating system. \nI guess   set this up yourself with a normal drive too, but this just makes it a little easier. It should be slightly cheaper if you intended to use Amazon Drive, as Seagate Duet is available for pre-order $99.99 on Amazon (US customers only), and comes with one year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage ($59.99 value) for new US Amazon Drive customers, as well as a two-year limited warranty from Seagate.",

      "text": "HBO and Cinemax Come to Amazon Prime – Cable Cutting War Continues HBO and Cinemax Come to Amazon Prime – Cable Cutting War Continues   3:16 PM \nMore great news this week for cord cutters as Amazon Prime subscribers will now be able to access programming from HBO and Cinemax. HBO will be available on Prime for $14.99 a month, while the Cinemax add-on will cost $9.99 a month, Amazon said in a press release that went out on the wire today. HBO Now is already available for the same price, but this can be seen as a way to consolidate bills and as an incentive to subscribe to Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime is also available on more devices than HBO Now, so this will be great news for people with older devices that weren’t compatible with HBO Now. Amazon Channels now offers over 70 additional add-on packs for Prime video subscribers, beyond what they can access for no additional charge as part of their existing Prime subscription. \n“HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history. Their selection of blockbuster movies is unsurpassed, including hits like Batman vs. Superman, The Revenant, and Deadpool. And, our customers have been asking when all that wonderful content will be available on Amazon Channels,” said Michael Paull, Vice President, Digital Video, Amazon. “Prime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed Westworld and Game of Thrones without the need for a cable subscription. We’re thrilled to work with HBO to bring their cutting-edge content to Amazon Prime members with Amazon Channels.” \nThis news comes just after AT&T’s new streaming service was announced , DirecTV Now, that will also bring HBO and Cinemax into more households. This addition will bolster Amazons channels it offers as it already includes popular channels like Showtime, Starz, and Comedy Central Stand-Up, among others. All of the services come with their own monthly pricing and users can choose to sign up for one, some, or all. The service works on more than 650 devices and free trials are available on all the networks. \nAmazon is offering a 30-day free trial on both HBO and Cinemax to Amazon Prime members. Once you are logged into your account you’ll need to go to Amazon Channels and choose the networks to which you’d like to subscribe. A free-trial period will immediately begin, and then all billing for access to the content will be handled by Amazon. You are then free to stream content from Amazon Video.",

      "text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could soon partner with Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) to add HBO Now to its Amazon Channels in a three-year deal, according to The Information . Could that give Amazon a strategic advantage against Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) in the streaming video market? Let's take a closer look at this deal to decide.\nHBO's Westworld . Image source: HBO.\nWhat are Amazon Channels? Amazon Channels are apps which let Prime members subscribe to individual channels for additional monthly fees. There are about 75 apps on the platform, which serves as a \"virtual cable service\" in which users can simply pay for the channels they want.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick On the surface, it's similar to the app-based channels on Apple TV, Roku, and Alphabet 's Android TV. However, Amazon Prime members pay less for those subscriptions compared to the stand-alone apps. For example, a stand-alone subscription to CBS 'Showtime usually costs $11 per month, but only costs $9 per month on Amazon Channels.\nTherefore, the more channels a Prime member signs up for, the more money they save. That's a fairly efficient way to tether more premium streaming channels to its Prime ecosystem, which already offers free streaming TV shows and movies via Amazon Video.\n ",

The 2016 edition, Indie for the Holidays , includes Melvins ' gnashing, guitar-slathered version of \"Carol of the Bells.\" \"The song has scared us since we were children,\" King Buzzo told Stereogum . \"That's why we wanted to do it.\"\nThe band may have conquered their fears, but their \"Carol of the Bells\" seems likely to terrify future generations of children. The track is full of relentless guitars, bashing drums and swirling vocals that sound like cultish incantations.\nIn 2014, Beth Orton, Ladyhawke, and Ashley Monroe contributed to Amazon's holiday effort, while last year's collection featured originals by YACHT and Robert Pollard along with Langhorne Slim's cover of \"Deck the Halls\" and Wild Child's take on \"Silent Night.\"\nIndie for the Holidays is due out on Friday.\nRelated Content: Mariah Carey, DNCE Tapped for Times Square NYE Performances Why New York Giants Should Be Considered Super Bowl Contenders Flashback: Howard Stern Cuts a Song With His 6th Grade Band",

      "text": "Sign up for our weekly news updates by entering your email: Advertisement Walmart And Amazon Still Competing In Sales And Stocks This Holiday Season [VIDEO] Wallmart and Amazon are two stores in the country that offered great deals on different items last Black Friday and Cyber Monday. By Mayleen Mil , EnStars on Dec 01, 2016 11:17 PM EST Walt Disney Co. Mickey Mouse children's clothes are displayed for sale at a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. location in Burbank, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. (Photo : Getty Images/Patrick T. Fallon) Advertisement \nTwo of the country's biggest stores Walmart and Amazon are continuously competing on their sales and inventory for this holiday season. Based on the report posted by Business Insider Walmart's expense in its holiday inventory might increase as the mass merchant is still competing with Amazon when it comes to in-demand items and pricing this is based on the data from \" Internet Retailer. \" \nWalmart had increased their online store sales even before Black Friday by more than 60 percent than its usual sales. That occurrence has made the online market more in-demand for global consumers. Nevertheless, the company may work into logistical obstacles over the busy holiday season. \nMeanwhile,on a different report posted by Fortune ,the percentage of shares of Amazon in the stock market have dropped down $12 or 1.5 percent despite that the store had bigger sales last Cyber Monday. As stated Amazon's shares moved to $768 on Monday.The stocks are lower compared from the stocks two months ago. \nThe stocks are expected to go up to 25% in the final quarter of this year.And stocks experts said that the shares of Amazon this holiday season 2016 are expected to be higher than last year. \nLast year, a lot of retailers like Walmart exerted all their efforts to make their online sales on the top of the stock market. On the recent Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping extravaganza different retailers offered the biggest deals this year compared to the past year. That is why Amazon needs to execute that kind of marketing technique. So, they can be competitive in reaching bigger sales and shares. \nAmazon is one of the most trusted retailers worldwide ever since the trend of online shopping became a worldwide phenomenon as the modern technology continuously evolves as years pass by.

      "text": "Amazon Goes Server-Side With Header Bidding; Never Rely On Platform Traffic by AdExchanger // \nHere's today's AdExchanger.com news round-up... Want it by email? Sign-up here . \nAmazon Jumps To Server-Side Header \nAmazon has quietly ironed another badge onto its ad tech sash. While Amazon has had a header bidding solution for a few years , Ad Age’s George Slefo reveals that the company is moving it server-side. “Ad requests will be handled on the server instead of in consumers' browsers,” he writes. More . Amazon has a fairly long history in the header, using pre-bid integration to get a “first look” at publisher inventory via its A9 division, in much the way Criteo has done for years. But it will be among the first to move its header server-side. \nNew And Shiny \nThe new “new media” mantra: Never rely on platform traffic. In early 2015, Elite Daily seemed a sensible $30 million buy for the Daily Mail. But what was a social publishing standout – “founded by a couple of twentysomethings in 2012, fueled by Facebook growth, then sold for many millions a few years later” – is now a cautionary tale. The Daily Mail acknowledged the failure, announcing it had written off $31 million in losses from the deal, reports Peter Kafka at Recode. Low-brow content or outright fake news tends to dominate Facebook engagement (not counting recipe videos – seriously) but it’s not sustainable business. And consumers are apparently tuning into that fact as well, as the US election and Facebook’s role in the media has prompted a huge surge of true readership value to quality news organizations. More . \nPrints Of Thieves \nFacebook drank $1 billion of the print advertising milkshake in 2016, according to Poynter’s Rick Edmonds and ad industry analyst Gordon Borrell. Print newspaper revenue used to be about $43 billion per year, but the industry brought in less than $15 billion this year. Big-brand advertisers have been spending on Facebook for years, but now small businesses are shifting spend away from local newspapers and onto the platform. More . \nHidden Influencers \nIf you’ve seen Instagram posts with hashtags like #complimentary, #gotitfree or #gotacoupon, you’re not alone. BuzzFeed reports on the regulatory headache posed by “the so-called microinfluencer, people with as little as ten followers who are being paid by brands.” It’s hardly unusual for brands to give away promotional merchandise (ever heard of T-shirt cannons?), but how do we treat similar behavior on Instagram, where there are well-defined rules around disclosure. “One of our biggest concerns is that this is becoming normalized and so seamlessly integrated into our everyday interactions with social media,” says Kristen Strader of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen. “Of course this is what advertisers want, but it is unfair to the consumer, especially young consumers who are growing up seeing paid endorsements on social media without understanding that those posts are actually advertisements.” More . \nVirtual Blood, Sweat And Tears \nThe e-sports industry is young and insignificant compared to traditional sports, but these video game whippersnappers don’t get the credit they’re due as pioneers. While sports leagues grew fat on broadcast rights deals, e-sports (and, uhhh, e-athletes) have forged a scrappy path to monetization. On Twitch, an Amazon-owned video game live-streaming platform, viewers personally support players through microtransactions and marketers often run campaigns with them as social influencers. The world championship for online game “Dota 2” had a prize of $20 million, more than half of which was contributed by fans. Leagues may also monetize players’ time during tournaments by, say, charging fans for exclusive live streaming or social media access during tournaments. More at Digiday . \nBut Wait, There’s More!",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Cloud Chief Keeps Pushing Single Cloud Vision \nAmazon Web Services budged a bit on the notion of hybrid cloud this week, announcing a few hardware devices that customers can use to run some software code on-premises. But both of those gadgets— Snowball Edge and Greengrass —are also tightly tied to AWS services. \nBut Amazon amzn continued to push the notion that AWS is the only cloud that most customers will need. Earlier this week at the company’s annual AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS chief executive Andy Jassy told the an audience of software partners that they should go all in on AWS—and not hedge their bets by working with competitive clouds as well, according to published reports. \nAccording to ZDNet , Jassy said: \nThe reality is, we are going to direct business to our partners who are committed and who really understand the platform because our customers want partners who understand the details of our platform. \nHe moderated that somewhat by noting that he was not suggesting that the attending partners should not work with other companies, but again added that not focusing on a single cloud provider is a mistake. \nIt’s not surprising that the executive in charge of Amazon’s cloud business—on track to hit $13 billion in yearly revenue —wants to stave off well-heeled rivals like Google goog Cloud Platform and Microsoft msft Azure. He’s spoken in the past about how a “single cloud” strategy is best for customers. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nBut many smaller companies that write software to run on AWS have long been wary of the cloud giant, which continually adds new services—some of which compete with their own work. In this way, AWS is working much the same way Microsoft and other software behemohts have in the past: Recruit third-party partners to fill gaps in its product portfolio, and then fill those gaps in-house. For more on AWS, watch: \nPeter Christy, research director at 451 Research, reaffirms the notion that AWS has ripped a page out of the Microsoft playbook, but added there is one significant change: the sheer speed at which Amazon releases new features and services. AWS announced more than 20 new features and functions this week alone. \n“What is clearly different with AWS is the rate of development,” Christy tells Fortune . “Microsoft did a good job of giving partners visibility as to what was changing and that was a fairly long process. The time scale is vasty more compressed on AWS.” \nUnfortunately for the AWS partners, he adds, customers usually gain real value when AWS offers a similar option because it’s typically better integrated with Amazon’s other services. \nSome Fortune 500 companies are also weighing the idea of throwing in with one cloud versus using different providers to gain negotiating power. Capital One , for example, is heavily invested in AWS, but even it has a relationship with Microsoft. Rob Alexander, the bank’s chief information officer, acknowledges that companies must think about lock-in, but not be paralyzed by the idea. \nCloud lock-in, he tells Fortune , is a consideration, but there’s not much risk of that in using basic computing and storage services. The decision to use higher-level, unique AWS products will make moving to another cloud harder down the road. Still, Capital One is forging ahead with some of them. \nThe trade-off in being able to work faster to create innovative services outweighs the risk, he said.",

The catalog includes \"the largest digital selection of best sellers,\" and several exclusive titles.\nSEE ALSO: A new app is trying to get India to read more by being the Netflix of books\nIn addition to Kindle tablets, Amazon says it has also updated Kindle apps on Android and iOS platforms to include support for Indian languages. Amazon's rival Google Play Books also supports Hindi and other Indian languages.\nSome of the titles include 'Ishq Mein Shahar Hona’ by Ravish Kumar (Hindi), 'Rajaraja Chozhan' by Sa. Na. Kannan (Tamil), 'Mrutyunjay' by Shivaji Sawant (Marathi), 'Ek Bija Ne Gamta Rahiye' by Kaajal Oza Vaidya (Gujarati) and 'Aarachar' by K R Meera (Malayalam).\n“We are excited to offer readers the largest digital selection of best sellers in five Indian languages. All you need is an Android or iOS device, or a Kindle eReader to get started. This is another step in our ongoing work to provide more choice and selection to Indian readers,” said Rajiv Mehta, Kindle India Country Manager.\nThe move further establishes Amazon’s position in the ebook marketplace in India. In late October, the company purchased Westland, a subsidiary of Tata Group firm Trent, to bolster each other's physical and digital book businesses in India.",

Also get £1 Amazon Video credit if this is your first kindle book purchase after the promotion started https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004APA51U/?tag=ho01f-21#promotion_details_1480633055373 In this electrifying autobiography, Rik stands naked in front of his vast legions of fans and disciples and invites them to take communion with the blood he has spilled for them during his thirty year war on show business. He invented alternative comedy with The Young Ones, he brought down the Thatcher administration with The New Statesman and he changed the face of global culture with his masterpiece Bottom. Not only was his number one single Living Doll the saviour of rock 'n' roll but he also rescued the British film industry with the vast revenues created by his legendary movie Drop Dead Fred. In 1998, he survived an assassination attempt and spent five days in a coma before he literally came back from the dead. Having completed countless phenomenal feature films, TV series, live extravaganzas and radio voice-overs since then, Rik Mayall is now poised on the brink of a whole new epoch-shattering revolution. For the first time ever, Rik reveals in print the deep inner truth behind his gargantuan ascent to the pinnacle of international light entertainment – the mental hospitals he has broken out of, the television executives he has assaulted, the drugs he has definitely not taken, the charities he has bankrupted, the countless pregnancies he has engendered, and so much more.

      "text": "Email This Story Printer Friendly PDF Version RSS Feed 'Noise-Blocking' Bluetooth Earphones from Orfeo Soundworks Soon Selling at Amazon Orfeo Soundworks Launched Its Bluetooth Mono Headset, Orfeo Voice at IFA 2016 and Looking to Sell at Amazon Orfeo Soundworks announced its newly developed mono headset, Orfeo Voice at IFA 2016 held in Berlin, Germany. ANYANG, KOREA, December 02, 2016 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Orfeo Soundworks (CEO Tommy Kim), the Innovation Award Honoree in the headphone part at CES 2016 for the world's first 'noise-blocking' Bluetooth earphones, announced its newly developed mono headset, Orfeo Voice at IFA 2016 held in Berlin, Germany. Orfeo successfully demonstrated its noise-blocking technology to IFA visitors and attracted buyers from leading automobile companies, aviation and aerospace companies, and distributors. Normal earphones and headsets, wired and wireless alike, are not the best device for phone calls because the microphone is located outside and far away from your mouth, allowing every noise to enter instead of your voice. However, Orfeo put the microphone inside the earpiece. Therefore, by putting in the earpiece inside your ear, all the ambient noise is physically 'blocked' from going into the mic, while the microphone transfers only the person's voice that travels internally through the Eustachian tube. When the microphone inside the earpiece picks up the internally travelling voice, the voice quality become distorted. Orfeo's patented core technology then automatically changes distorted voice to be person's natural and original voice. Orfeo has multiple internationally patented technology that puts together Another great use case for Orfeo's noise-blocking technology is voice recognition even in the loud environments. Orfeo boasts that with their headset, voice recognition becomes possible even at a place like a rock concert. Aside from phone calls, Orfeo provides Hi-Fi sound when listening to music. Additionally, users can turn on SoundThruTM to hear surrounding sound while listening to music. Unlike existing in-ear earphones, SoundThruTM lets people to be aware of their surroundings, enhancing their safety. \"Orfeo Voice and its noise-blocking technology can change the way people communicate in the field of military, aviation, construction, and heavy industries,\" said CEO Tommy Kim, \"Not only that, Orfeo Voice will be a game-changer for IoT and voice recognition industry.\" # # #",

      "text": "Home / News / DVRs and Media players News / Amazon quietly rolls out new Fire TV UI – here's a sneak peek at what's new Amazon quietly rolls out new Fire TV UI – here's a sneak peek at what's new \nby James Laird Read Comments \nAmazon is quietly rolling out its new Fire TV user interface. Here's a sneak peek at what's new in the radically redesigned UI. \nThe arrival of the software was first spotted by a Cord Cutters News reader, with the only official hints from Amazon buried in its Appstore Submission guidelines ( H/T AFTV News ). \nAmazon promised a new Fire TV UI earlier in the year, but rollout details were thin on the ground. Now things look like they're getting underway. \nAs expected, Amazon is reorganising content under categories at the top of the screen – and killing off a number of categories in the hope of simplifying the overall browsing experience. \nThere's also a new 'Your Videos' section, which will pull together content from all the services you subscribe to and filter out paid-for shows and films. \nThere's a completely new app discovery screen, too, which centres on three main sections: Editor's Picks, Best New Apps & Games, and Trending. \nApp overlay screens will now feature more information as well, including a download status bar and new icons that indicate if apps are new, UHD, or stored in the cloud. \nLastly, Alexa integration is likely to be a lot more useful and intuitive, but we'll have to wait until we get a chance to experience Amazon's new Fire TV UI for ourselves to really judge any improvements. \nAs you can probably tell from the screenshots, the update is rolling out the US first, but the UK shouldn't be far behind. \nThe update is officially known as Fire OS 5.2.4.0 and will come to second-gen Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks first, before (presumably) being made available for older hardware. \nLike the look of the new Amazon Fire TV user interface?

      "text": "December 02,   'Noise-Blocking' Bluetooth Earphones from Orfeo Soundworks Soon Selling at Amazon Orfeo Soundworks Launched Its Bluetooth Mono Headset, Orfeo Voice at IFA 2016 and Looking to Sell at Amazon ANYANG, KOREA, December 02,   Orfeo Soundworks (CEO Tommy Kim), the Innovation Award Honoree in the headphone part at CES 2016 for the world's first 'noise-blocking' Bluetooth earphones, announced its newly developed mono headset, Orfeo Voice at IFA 2016 held in Berlin, Germany. Orfeo successfully demonstrated its noise-blocking technology to IFA visitors and attracted buyers from leading automobile companies, aviation and aerospace companies, and distributors. Normal earphones and headsets, wired and wireless alike, are not the best device for phone calls because the microphone is located outside and far away from your mouth, allowing every noise to enter instead of your voice. However, Orfeo put the microphone inside the earpiece. Therefore, by putting in the earpiece inside your ear, all the ambient noise is physically 'blocked' from going into the mic, while the microphone transfers only the person's voice that travels internally through the Eustachian tube. When the microphone inside the earpiece picks up the internally travelling voice, the voice quality become distorted. Orfeo's patented core technology then automatically changes distorted voice to be person's natural and original voice. Orfeo has multiple internationally patented technology that puts together Another great use case for Orfeo's noise-blocking technology is voice recognition even in the loud environments. Orfeo boasts that with their headset, voice recognition becomes possible even at a place like a rock concert. Aside from phone calls, Orfeo provides Hi-Fi sound when listening to music. Additionally, users can turn on SoundThruTM to hear surrounding sound while listening to music. Unlike existing in-ear earphones, SoundThruTM lets people to be aware of their surroundings, enhancing their safety. \"Orfeo Voice and its noise-blocking technology can change the way people communicate in the field of military, aviation, construction, and heavy industries,\" said CEO Tommy Kim, \"Not only that, Orfeo Voice will be a game-changer for IoT and voice recognition industry.\"---",

      "text": "Unfazed by touch latency controversies that were probably blown out of proportion anyway , as well as long waiting times on both US shores and across the old continent, OnePlus today brings its latest “never-settling” venture to the all-important Indian market.\nWell, technically, the incrementally-updated OnePlus 3T is still a couple of weeks away from its local commercial launch. But Amazon registrations are now open, pricing is confirmed, and Prime members will get an hour of “early access” sales on December 12 ahead of the wide rollout two days later.\nLike everywhere else, the 3T is only slightly costlier than the original OP3 in India, starting at Rs. 29,999 (around $440), compared to 28,000 rupees ($410). That’s obviously for the “entry-level” 64GB configuration, with the 128 gig SKU commanding an Rs. 5,000 ($73) premium for a grand total of 35,000 rupees, or roughly $510.\nRemember, just the 64GB variant is inbound with both gunmetal and soft gold paint jobs… eventually, while the top-line OnePlus 3T model comes coated in gunmetal alone.\nVisually similar to its predecessor, the Android Marshmallow-based OP3T has Nougat goodies decidedly on the way , Snapdragon 821 processing power in tow, both 16MP rear and front cameras, as well as 3,400 mAh battery capacity. Overall, it’s just sufficiently better than the OP3 to warrant the small price hike.\nThe post OnePlus 3T formally launches in India at Rs. 30,000 and up exclusive to Amazon appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Buy on Amazon (via What’s Eric Playing?) Full disclosure: A review copy of this game was provided by Ninja Star Games. So remember how I’ve been talking about game theme for a while and how I’m a bit tired of doing the same themes over and over again? Well, prep yourselves for something totally different. We leave behind generic fantasy for a spot in the French Alps, where two pairs of shepherds are trying to keep track of their flock as they do whatever shepherds do. Unfortunately, they have a bit of a wolf problem, as wolves keep chasing their sheep into the nearby dark forest. You’ll have to use your trusty sheepdog to bring them back, provided you can get the hound to actually focus on you. Can you protect your pasture and keep your sheep locked down?",

With the move, the US-based Amazon’s Kindle will enter the growing digital regional content market in India, said the company in its official blog on Thursday. \n“We are adding thousands of digital books in Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and Malayalam, including the largest digital selection of bestsellers, hundreds of exclusive titles and free classics to the Kindle Book Store,” said Sanjeev Jha, director (content), Amazon Kindle to PTI. \nReaders can access these books on Kindle for both Android and iOS \nKindle already supports languages like Chinese, German, French and Japanese among others, apart from English. \nWhile Amazon does not share country specific growth numbers, Jha told PTI that India is among its fastest growing markets globally for Kindle. \nAmazon will make available bestseller titles like Ishq Mein Shahar Hona by Ravish Kumar (Hindi), Rajaraja Chozhan by Sa Na Kannan (Tamil), Mrutyunjay by Shivaji Sawant (Marathi), Ek Bija Ne Gamta Rahiye by Kaajal Oza Vaidya (Gujarati) and Aarachar by K R Meera (Malayalam). \nThe exclusive titles include Banaras Talkies by Satya Vyas, Ki.Mu.Ki.Pi by Madhanand, Draupadi by Kaajal Oza Vaidya and titles like Mayapuri by Shivani will now be available in digital format for the first time, said the post. \n“We are bringing features like font size adjustment, ability to add notes and highlights, and automatic save and sync of your furthest page read across all your devices,” Jha told PTI. Not just for Kindle, but India is also among one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets globally, and is the target market for most digital players. \nLast year, Amazon.com Inc introduced a new service in India that allowed unlimited ebook reading for Kindle users at an inaugural monthly price of Rs 99. \nChristened ‘Kindle Unlimited’, the subscription-based reading service lets users access e-books and audio books across genres on Kindle devices and Kindle reading apps. \nAmazon had then announced that users will be able to choose from ‘over one million titles.’ \nLike this report?

Prime members get 30mins early access to deals, and if stock goes before the deal is up... tough luck. Once you have the game in your basket you have 15mins to check out or your copy gets put back on sale.",

Today, the brand have received their first feedback from a customer.\nTheir debut product, salt and pepper grinders, was launched onto Amazon’s U.S marketplace on Black Friday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year both in the U.S and internationally.\nThe first customer to give the brand feedback about the product said, “Modern, well made…I had issues with another product that made the grinder stick because of moisture build up. There’s also no mess when refilling as you get a collapsible funnel and a cleaning brush which is convenient…”\nAkoni Homeware have been working on their Salt & Pepper Grinder Set for some months and this is the first time that the brand have received real feedback from paying customers.\n“We’ve done lots of testing of our product and we have spoken to a few industry-relevant focus groups but it’s always reassuring to hear real feedback from our customers.” said Lisa from Akoni Homeware, “We welcome positive and constructive feedback as it means that we can better improve our product.”\nAkoni Homeware’s salt and pepper grinder set contains 2 glass and stainless steel grinders, a collapsible funnel and a cleaning brush. The brand hope that their set will be both stylish and practical. They have aimed their product at working mothers.\n“Our first week selling on Amazon.com has been better than we hoped.” continued Lisa, “We’ve had sales and our product rank has increased very rapidly which is a really good sign at this stage. We hope that our product has staying power compared to our competitors’ products.”\nAkoni Homeware’s brand new Salt & Pepper Grinder Set is now available from Amazon.com. The tall grinders have a 180ml capacity and offer a fully adjustable grinding mechanism on the top of the product: https://www.amazon.com/Akoni-Homeware-Salt-Pepper-…\nContact Info:\nName: Lisa Miller\nOrganization: Akoni Homeware\nAddress: 9450 SW Gemini Dr #29796\nRelease ID: 150497\n ",

Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here External hard drives with a capacity of 1 TB are ubiquitous now, but the new Seagate Duet comes with a twist - in addition to the internal storage space offered, it also comes with one free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage and automatic cloud backup capabilities. Seagate Duet is a rather regular external drive, including a classic hard drive and no special connectivity options. It weighs 0.27 pounds, measures 0.4X3X4.5 inches, connects to PCs or Macs via USB 3.0, but can also backup files from smartphones and tablets thanks to the Amazon Drive mobile app. Unfortunately, the free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage offer only applies to customers in the US. Those interested can already pre-order the Seagate Duet got $99.99 USD via Amazon. Shipments are scheduled to begin at the end of next week. The cloud storage plan bundled is worth $59 USD and should be used within two months after the purchase date. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "Tweet \nDuring its re:Invent developer event in Las Vegas, Amazon announced its new Amazon AI platform which will make many the company's machine learning tools available to developers to use in their apps and websites. \nAndy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, explains that the company has a great deal of background in machine learning, saying: \"We do a lot of AI in our company. We have thousands of people dedicated to AI in our business\". Amazon has decided to release three tools that take advantage of its AI to developers with the launch of its new platform. \nThe first tool is an image recognition service called \"Rekognition\" which is able to identify objects and scenes in a similar fashion to Google and Microsoft's tools. Amazon did note that its service is able to identify dogs by their breeds, but other image recognition tools have done this in the past. \nThe next tool the company announced is a text to-speech service called Amazon Polly, which uses machine learning to sound more natural and differentiate between the pronunciations of words based on their context. Amazon's speech tool will also offer support for 24 languages and feature 47 male and female voices. \nJassy offers more details on the tool, saying: \"Polly was designed to address many of the more challenging aspects of speech generation. For example, consider the difference in pronunciation of the word 'live' in the phrases 'I live in Seattle' and 'Live from New York'. Polly knows that this pair of homographs are spelled the same but are pronounced quite differently\". \nThe third tool Amazon announced is a new service called \"Lex\" that takes advantage of the technology that powers the company's Alexa service. Developers will be able to use the tool to add multi-step conversations to their applications using the Lex Console where they can use simple phrases to train the bot. \nAmazon explained how developers can use Lex in its announcement, saying: \"You can use Amazon Lex to build chatbots and other types of web & mobile applications that support engaging, lifelike interactions. Your bots can provide information, power your applications, streamline work activities, or provide a control mechanism for robots, drones, and toys\". \nScott Horn, CMO of [24]7 commented on the announcements: \"Amazon’s announced advances in AI demonstrate yet another example of the value businesses are putting on the power of machine-learning. Abilities like natural language processing (NLP) which power chatbots like Alexa, are markers of an industry-wide race to better serve customers through AI. These advances are not only applauded by businesses, but also by customers. According to [24]7’s new customer experience study, which surveyed 1,000 US consumers, two in five consumers are open to interacting with a chatbot in a retail scenario, and nearly one-third of them (28.9 per cent) prefer it over the phone or email. This level of adoption points to a profitable opportunity for retailers as they consider future CX investments\". \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

Caption: Amazon \nSlide: 2 / of 2 . Caption: Amazon Author: Klint Finley. Klint Finley Business   7:00 am. 7:00 am Amazon’s Snowmobile Is Actually a Truck Hauling A Huge Hard Drive Amazon \nAmazon has a new service that makes Google Fiber seem slow. And it rides on 18 wheels. \nYes, today’s speediest internet connections make it faster to download movies than to go to the store and buy them. But downloading or uploading truly large amounts of data can still take days, months, or even years—think a film studio’s entire video archives or the satellite imagery collections of government agencies. That lag is a problem for Amazon, which wants companies to store their information in its lucrative cloud. But it’s also a natural one for Amazon—a logistics company at heart—to solve. So this week the company announced one of its strangest ideas yet: a tractor trailer that will transport your data to Amazon’s own data centers. (Insert information superhighway joke here.) Amazon \nAmazon announced the new service, confusingly named Snowmobile, at its Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas this week. It’s designed to shuttle as many as 100 petabytes–around 100,000 terabytes–per truck. That’s enough storage to hold five copies of the Internet Archive (a comprehensive backup of the web both present and past), which contains “only” about 18.5 petabytes of unique data. \nAmazon has long let businesses ship hard disks full of data to Amazon for uploading into the retail giant’s cloud. But copying 100 petabytes to individual hard drives isn’t practical. Snowmobile acts like a giant hard drive that comes to you. \nUsing multiple semis to shuttle data around might seem like overkill. But for such massive amounts of data, hitting the open road is still the most efficient way to go. Even with a one gigabit per-second connection such as Google Fiber, uploading 100 petabytes over the internet would take more than 28 years . At an average speed of 65 mph, on the other hand, you could drive a Snowmobile from San Francisco to New York City in about 45 hours—about 4,970 gigabits per second. That doesn’t count the time it takes to actually transfer the data onto Snowmobile–which Amazon estimates will take less than 10 days–or from the Snowmobile onto Amazon’s servers. But all told, that still makes the truck much, much faster. And because Amazon has data centers throughout the country, your data probably won’t need to travel cross-country anyway. Related Stories",

      "text": "Earlier this year we noted how Amazon had launched the Amazon Cable Store, which intially only sold Comcast cable broadband service. Now Amazon appears to have expanded the store to include service from Frontier Communications . A quick look at the store indicates that Frontier is selling speeds up to 1 Gbps via the store -- though given Frontier's allergy for broad network upgrades , most of the shoppers won't be able to actually get the lion's share of the speed options Amazon is advertising.\nIn fact, the majority of Frontier customers still can't even get the new FCC standard definition of \"broadband\": 25 Mbps.\nAs we saw with Comcast , the ability to leave public reviews isn't what you'd call a boon for an industry with some of the lowest customer satisfaction scores (thanks to limited competition) of any industry in America. Comcast was absolutely hammered by reviewers when its Amazon store went live. That trend continues with most of the company's speed options seeing a majority of one-star reviews.\nFrontier's early reviews are decidedly split , with a few users leaving one-star reviews due to either annoying fees or inconsistent performance. Poor reviews will likely spike once Amazon shoppers realize most of the listed speeds aren't actually available.\nIt's worth noting that with the addition of a phone company, Amazon appears to have ditched the \"cable store\" label and instead now simply calls its resell challe \"Amazon Internet | TV | Phone.\" There had been reports that Charter was also in talks to be listed on the site, but those claims have yet to materialize.",

      "text": "Salesforce’s bread-and-butter software products, used by salespeople at Fortune 500 companies around the world, will be available from Amazon’s public cloud for the first time in a few months..\nUntil now, this collection of software services has been available from Salesforce’s own data centers, but that will change starting in mid 2017 when Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Community Cloud, and Analytic Cloud will be available from Amazon amzn in Canada. Other countries will follow.\nThe news comes six months after Salesforce announced plans to build new products on AWS and to offer some of its older software on Amazon’s infrastructure as well. Less public was the fact that Salesforce crm committed to buying $400 million worth of AWS infrastructure over the next four years to make that happen. It was a big PR coup for AWS, which is fending off challenges from Microsoft msft and other rivals who are wooing big software companies to use their rival clouds.\nA public cloud is a massive set of shared servers, storage, and networking gear that is run by one company--Amazon, Microsoft , or Google googl , for example--and rented out to many customers.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nMoving onto Amazon’s cloud was no simple task, Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder, told Fortune .\nFor one thing Salesforce crm depends on Oracle orcl databases running on what techies call “bare metal” servers. To put those databases on Amazon’s virtualized servers required significant work. Virtualization is a software layer that runs on servers to enable more workloads to share the same hardware.\nBy doing that re-engineering, Harris said Salesforce’s core software is no longer married to the company’s traditional data center infrastructure so, in theory, Salesforce could move all of its software to the public cloud. He added that there are no plans to do so, however.\nFor more on Salesforce, watch: \nStarting next year, customers in Canada can opt to run their sales, or customer relationship management, software on either set of data centers. There will be no price difference, Harris said.\nIn making this move, Salesforce can take advantage of Amazon data centers around the world, and avoid building more of its own. Amazon has giant data center farms in 14 regions worldwide, with four more slated to come online soon, including one in Montreal.\nNewer Salesforce products, including its IoT or Internet of things cloud, were developed to run on AWS right out of the box. The fact that Salesforce opted to take what was its legacy code and repurpose it for a new infrastructure set is worth noting.\nOther areas of AWS-Salesforce collaboration include enabling Salesforce Heroku, a popular software development tool set to run on Amazon’s Virtual Private Cloud. VPC lets customers cordon off a section of Amazon’s computing power for their own use. The companies are also working to bridge Salesforce’s Internet of things product, (IoT Cloud) and Amazon’s Redshift data warehouse. And, a new set of tools will help developers incorporate the voice recognition of Amazon’s popular Alexa personal assistant into Salesforce software.\nThe news comes just as the annual AWS re:Invent tech conference in Las Vegas comes to a close.",

      "text": "Amazon logo (Photo: Getty Images)\nQ: It’s hard to have secrets. How do I stop Amazon from showing what I purchased? No Christmas surprises here!\nA: Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. But you need to do more to keep your gifts a surprise. Click here to learn how to make Google and Facebook keep quiet.\nKeep safe walking alone\nQ: My daughter has to walk to her college classes at night. What were the names of the safety apps you recommended to a caller on your national radio show?\nA: When walking alone, use the Companion app (Apple, Android; Free). You start by entering your destination. Next, add friends or family members as your companions. Companions receive a text with a link to an online map showing your destination. The map refreshes as you move. When you arrive safely, your companions receive a message. If you go off course, fall, start running or suddenly remove your headphones, the app asks if you're all right. If you don't push the “I’m Okay” button, the app sounds an alarm and gives you the option to contact the police. Click here for two additional ways your phone can help you get home safely.\nWhen walking alone, use the Companion app (Apple, Android; Free). (Photo: Stephanie Taylor for USA Today)\nFind out of your router has been hacked\nQ: You were talking about the importance of changing your router’s password during an interview on my local station. Is there a way to see if my router has been hacked?\nA: Absolutely. As you heard, routers are your Achilles’ heel. You can protect your laptop and individual accounts, but few people think to protect their routers. Most internet users have never heard of a “DNS hijack,” so they don’t know how to protect themselves from it. This is one method hackers use to steal your passwords, your identity, and even the money from your bank account. Click here to find out how to check whether your router’s been compromised .\n (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\nBest tablet apps for Mom\nQ: I purchased my mother a tablet for Christmas. Taking your advice, I would like to set it up for her before I give it to her. Are there any specific apps that I should load on the tablet?\nA: What a coincidence! I recently bought a tablet for my mother, too. Most tablets are simple and easy to use, which makes them appealing to people of all ages. But if your mother is new to tablets, the sheer number of apps can be daunting. Most of them are cheap or even free, and a rookie may struggle to wade through all the options. The right app will depend on your mother’s taste, but most people are drawn to organizational tools, simple games, and apps for your camera. Click here for five apps I put on my mother’s tablet.\nBroadcast using Facebook Live\nFacebook Live lets you stream videos to friends. (Photo: Facebook)\nQ: I am seeing Facebook Live posts all the time. I am a pastor at a small church. Can I do this too?\nA: I’ve worked in radio and television for a long time, and I’m accustomed to top-notch engineers and equipment. But I’m always impressed what kinds of video people can produce with a smartphone and a $10 lavaliere mic. I live-stream parts of my own radio show, and my audience loves it. If you’re a pastor, you probably already have the most important elements: an audience, a good message, and a Facebook account. Still, to make your live video feed as effective as possible, you should know some studio basics.

      "text": "January's semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour will be without some of the industry's biggest executives, as well as another streaming outlet.\nAmazon has opted to join Netflix as well as Starz and completely sit out the January TCA press tour. Additionally, NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS have all eliminated executive panels from their day-long sessions. Instead, insiders say, each of the Big Four networks want to focus on their midseason fare. Sources suggest that the networks will resume executive panels during the summer as they look to heavily promote their 2017-18 fall lineups.\nRead more: Netflix to Skip January TCA Press Tour\nThe news comes as a recent poll of the TCA membership found that more than 60 percent of members felt it was important to have an executive panel twice a year. The bulk of the news that comes out of TCA largely stems from executive panels in which Bob Greenblatt, Channing Dungey, Gary Newman and Dana Walden, as well as Glenn Geller, are quizzed about trends, returning and new shows as well as hot topics in the industry including Peak TV, dwindling viewership and the struggle to cut through the increasingly cluttered landscape. (The CW's Mark Pedowitz as well as all the cable toppers will participate in January.)\nRead more: THR TV Critics Debate: The Highs, Lows and Dumpster Fires of TCA Summer Press Tour 2016\nDuring the summer TCA, Geller was roasted about CBS' lack of diversity during a panel in which he confessed the network needed to \" do better \" as part of a grueling 10-minute-long diversity discussion. Fox brass Walden and Newman fielded questions about the future of The X-Files; ABC's Dungey - in her debut - opened up about axing Castle and plans for a Star Wars TV series; and NBC's Greenblatt and Jennifer Salke were quizzed on Trump. Given the near lack of a breakout broadcast hit and the absence of outright cancelations amid a lower ratings barometer, it's almost no surprise that execs from the Big Four networks would sit out the January tour in an effort to maintain a positive news cycle.\nMany networks have voiced concerns about the rising costs and questionable value of TCA - as well as the impact on shows that take the time away from production. What was initially conceived as a way for press to have access to executives, producers and talent for both new and returning shows has evolved, given the 24/7 news cycle and digital era. Gone are the days when talent was inaccessible and rarely did press. Instead, comments from the stage can often go viral before a panel ends, given the prolific use of social media during the tour. The latter can make or break shows (and executives ).\nRead more: 28 TV Network Chiefs on Dream Casting, the Reboot Craze and What Happens Under President Trump\nFor Amazon's part, the streamer and retail giant's summer TCA featured an executive session followed by panels for Fleabag, Goliath, Good Girls Revolt, Man in the High Castle, Mozart in the Jungle, One Mississippi, Red Oaks and Transparent.\nMidseason broadcast shows that are expected to panel at TCA include ABC's Still Star-Crossed, Downward Dog, Imaginary Mary and Time After Time; CBS has Training Day and Superior Donuts; Fox has Shots Fired, Star, 24: Legacy, APB, Making History and The Mick; and NBC has Taken; Powerless; Trial & Error; Midnight, Texas; Great News; Marlon and The Blacklist: Redemption.\nWinter TCA will be held Jan. 5-18 at the Langham in Pasadena.\nEditor's note: Lesley Goldberg is a TCA member.",

      "text": "Amazon Working On A New Echo Speaker With 7-inch Touchscreen By Aadil Raval | Dec 02, 2016 07:25   Bloomberg ) An 'Echo' device stands on display during the U.K. launch event for the Amazon.com Inc. Echo voice-controlled home assistant speaker in London, U.K., on Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016. The Seattle-based company today announced that its Echo product line will be available in the U.K. and Germany starting in the fall, the first time the gadget will be available outside the U.S. Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nAmazon's Lab126 is reportedly working on a voice-activated speaker with a 7-inch touch screen codenamed \"Knight.\" Amazon might unveil it as a top-notched version of Echo. \nBloomberg reported that Amazon R&D Lab126 is undergoing a process to create a premium Echo-like Speaker, which will house a jumbo 7-inch touchscreen for controls. If reports are to be believed, then the upcoming Echo speaker will be paired with Amazon's Alexa Digital Assistant that is similar to other Amazon product like Echo Dot, Echo, and Tap speakers; however, the cool thing to notice is that the upcoming Echo Speaker will have a 7-inch screen to control its many features. Advertisement \nThe same publication also reported that it wouldn't be a surprise if the Echo uses an optimized and enhance version Amazon's Fire OS, which is a popular operating system amongst Amazon's line of tablets named Fire. It is, however, not known if the new Alexa Digital Assistant fused with Echo Speaker will go in sync or not. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, according to Yahoo , Amazon Echo Speaker is anticipated to be launched in the first quarter of 2017, which will be fun to see if it surpasses the bar set by its predecessors. It was highlighted that the speculations arose soon after Google launched its Google Home, which is a Digital Assistant for Android devices. A similar product is expected to be unveiled by Apple, which is currently working for a smart home device as well. \nSince major competitors around the globe are practicing a fierce approach towards launching their own Digital Assistant for smartphones and other devices, it is remarkable that artificial intelligence has taken an agile pace which was just a thought a few years ago. \nNevertheless, Amazon opted to keep mum on the upcoming Echo Speaker. Amazon Fire Tablet and Echo Dot makes up a great combo to listen to your favorite songs or to watch a movie or try Amazon Echo with Alexa which was updated this October.

      "text": "Amazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives More Amazon will not present any panels at the Television Critics Association (TCA) winter press tour this year, joining executives from NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox in sitting out their executive sessions, TheWrap has learned.\nAmazon is the latest streaming service to announce that they would sit out the semi-annual event. Netflix announced earlier this year that it would not be attending the winter tour this time around.\nThe loss of the executive sessions is a serious blow to TCA, as plenty of news has been made during these sessions in previous years. For example, CBS Entertainment head Glen Geller got a lot of flack during the summer session for the lack of diverse lead characters on his network. However, the executives will return for the summer press tour in 2017.\nAlso Read: 11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV\nAn individual with knowledge of the networks’ collective decision not to include any executives this time around told TheWrap that they are choosing to focus on their midseason programming rather than the executive sessions.\nAt this year’s winter session, CBS is set to present “Training Day” and “Superior Donuts;” ABC will preview “Still Star-Crossed,” “Downward Dog,” “Imaginary Mary” and “Time After Time;” Fox will present “Shots Fired,” “Star,” “24: Legacy,” “APB,” “Making History” and “The Mick;” NBC will bring “Taken,” “Powerless,” “Trial & Error,” “Midnight, Texas,” “Great News,” “Marlon” and “Blacklist: Redemption.”\nThe TCA winter press tour will be held Jan. 5-Jan. 18 at the Langham in Pasadena.\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n'SNL' Outcasts Jay Pharoah, Taran Killam Get New Showtime Series\n'Star Trek: Discovery' – Everything We Learned From Bryan Fuller's TCA Panel\n10 Things Scene and Heard at 2016 TCA Awards",

      "title": "Amazon Video Launch in Canada Is Imminent, Top Broadcaster Says",
      "text": "On Tuesday, Canada's biggest media player told the country's TV regulator that Amazon Prime Video will launch north of the border on Dec. 1.\n\"Now, a new global OTT competitor - Amazon Prime - is entering the Canadian market in two days,\" Bell Media president Mary Ann Turcke told the CRTC during license renewal hearings in Ottawa to stress the level of competition that the broadcaster is experiencing from streaming players. \"So it's not just our fellow Canadian broadcasters who will try to outbid us for first run, original programming, but it's Netflix and now Amazon, two entities that are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as us and that have astronomically more buying power than we do.\"\nAmazon representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nBell Media runs the top-rated CTV network, a stable of cable channels and the CraveTV streamer already competing against Netflix Canada, which launched here in late 2010.\nOutside the hearing room, Turcke told reporters Amazon had notified its Prime members they will bring a streaming video service to Canada on Dec. 1. \"It feels a little bit like a soft launch, much the way we did iHeart [Radio], so we'll see what happens,\" she said.\nTurcke's heads-up comes as the industry widely anticipates Amazon to begin rolling out its streaming video service worldwide, challenging Netflix - which has already gone global with the exception of China, North Korea, Syria and the Crimea.\nAmazon already runs its massive e-commerce business in Canada. And Canadians can already go onto the U.S.-based Amazon site and sign up for Amazon Prime Video to view a host of movies and TV shows by acquiring a U.S. IP and a Canadian Amazon Prime subscription.\nAny expansion into Canada would be complicated by Amazon's licensing deals with local SVODs like CraveTV and Shomi to make originals like Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle available north of the border. Coincidentally, Shomi is set to shut down on Dec. 1 after failing to compete against Netflix Canada.\nAmazon, led by chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos, currently formally offers its Amazon Prime Video service in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany and Austria and previously said it was also planning a launch in India. It hasn't confirmed a global launch.\nHowever, talk of a possible global video service rollout started in mid-November when Jeremy Clarkson, co-host of Amazon's new series The Grand Tour, tweeted that Amazon is going global. In a video he and Grand Tour co-hosts and former Top Gear colleagues James May and Richard Hammond elaborated that their show would be available on Amazon in more than 200 countries.\nThe comments set Wall Street speculating about whether Amazon is prepping a global launch or planning to roll out video in select additional markets where it already has an e-commerce presence. \"Unless they change their strategy and start offering video as a stand-alone product, which I doubt, then I don't see how they can be in 200 countries,\" speculates Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali.\nJefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald has estimated that the launch of a global video streaming service would require an additional $1 billion-$2 billion video content spend from Amazon in 2017. In a recent report, he noted that the increase in spend \"would bring Amazon's annual content expenditure in line with Netflix, which disclosed an about $6 billion content budget.\"\nRead more: Amazon Aims at Netflix With Separate Prime, Video Subscriptions",

      "text": "Sid and Marty Krofft are coming to Amazon Prime. The legendary producing duo is reviving 1970s kid show cult classic “ Sigmund and the Sea Monsters ” for Amazon, with David Arquette starring as Captain Barnabas.\nFor those who may have missed it during its initial run in the ’70s, the original “Sigmund” centered on brothers Johnny and Scotty, who find and befriend a young sea monster named Sigmund and his own dysfunctional brothers Slurp and Burp. The Amazon revival will add in Johnny and Scotty’s cousin Robyn and Arquette’s Captain Barnabas, who’s on the hunt for the young sea monsters.\nThe Kroffts built a TV monster empire in the 1970s, with “Sigmund,” “H.R. Pufnstuf,” “Land of the Lost,” and various other series, though “Sigmund” was their only Saturday morning kids’ series that was produced for a second season.\n“Sigmund and the Sea Monsters” on Amazon is executive produced by the Kroffts, with the pilot directed by Jonathan Judge. Garrett Frawley and Brian Turner (“Santa Baby”) wrote the new teleplay based on the original series.\nLooking to further beef up its kids’ programming , Amazon has also ordered “The Bug Diaries,” aimed at the preschool set. Based on the children’s books written by Doreen Cronin and illustrated by Harry Bliss, “The Bug Diaries” follows a trio of bug buddies — Fly, Worm, and Spider — as they embark on various adventures.\nRelated stories\nJeremy Clarkson Denies Netflix's Claim That Amazon Spent $250 Million on 'The Grand Tour'\nAmazon Prime to Stream New Matsumoto Comedy Series\nAmazon Wants Live-Streaming Sports Rights for Prime Video, but What Will It Really Be Able to Secure?\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

The speaker will be based on what Intel calls Form Factor Reference Designs (FFRD). Essentially, FFRD is a ready-made modular board design of the board layout that can be placed into a design frame, thereby cutting down the time of development substantially. \nThe retail giant's collaboration with Intel will allow partners to build new devices with Alexa using Intel-based smart speaker FFRD due in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon wants to expand its voice-based digital assistant's reach, and this partnership will enable third-party developers to bring out a variety of smart home products with Alexa on board. Amazon AVS content marketing manager Ted Karczewski announced the collaboration in a blog post . \n\"Intel is working with Amazon to deliver smart speaker form factor reference designs (FFRD) with Alexa that make it easier for device manufacturers to build products with high-performance, far-field voice interaction.\" \nBoth Amazon and Intel are focusing on expanding their network to fully integrate into the home. For Amazon to do this, the company knows it cannot restrict Alexa to its own products like Echo - and Alexa Voice Service has been open to third-party integration since last year. Further to than end, Amazon on Thursday also announced a new product called JAM Voice . JAM Voice is a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled portable speaker that features touch-activated integration with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS). The AVS can essentially put Alexa inside a range of smart devices.\nThe first FFDR will offer accelerated development of Alexa voice-enables smart speakers on Intel's architecture. It will also support Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth to allow full connectivity in the home. \nAdditionally, Amazon will also release a Software Development Kit (SDK) for the reference design that will let manufactures incorporate voice and video capabilities into their products, Karczewski wrote.",

      "text": "3 Surprising Reasons Netflix, Amazon and Broadcast Execs Will Skip January TCA More TV executives have a message for the winter TCA: No thanks.\nTop programmers from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox won’t come to Pasadena, California, in January to answer reporters’ questions at the Television Critics Association Winter press tour, the association revealed Tuesday. That marks the first time in at least 20 years the brass will skip the event (except for 2008, when the entire January tour was sacked due to the writers’ strike).\nThe broadcasters will still offer panels to promote individual shows, but reporters will have to chase the executives through the swanky corridors of the Langham Huntington Hotel if they want an interview. That’s still more access than Amazon is providing, though — TCA also announced that the streaming provider, home to the acclaimed “Transparent” and other fare, is bailing on the event entirely. Netflix, home of “House of Cards” and other critical favorites, previously revealed it’s not planning to attend, either.\nAlso Read: Amazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives\nWhat gives? Why, during this supposed Golden Age of TV, are the biggest purveyors of original programming squelching an opportunity to get in front of the media?\nChalk it up to the immense changes seizing the worlds of entertainment and journalism, shifts that are making many industry veterans question the utility of the TCA events themselves.\nThe old media world is dying\nWhen newspapers were the main news providers, network executives saw the TCAs as the most cost-effective way of getting the word out about new shows. Critics from around the country would pile into ballrooms in Beverly Hills or Pasadena, pepper stars and execs with questions and then save up stories that they would publish back home as the new shows premiered.\nAlso Read: 11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV\nNow, newspapers have been decimated by online competitors and plummeting ad sales. The press tour is now filled with far fewer critics from hometown papers and many more bloggers and “genre press” from sites that only fanboys and fangirls have heard of. There are multiple representatives of Hollywood trades such as, yes, TheWrap. These outlets cover the networks and their shows like a blanket all year long. Why do the networks need to spend six-figure sums to reach them? What’s the point of putting executives in front of reporters?\nIt’s about the shows\nTCA is the source of a disconnect for journalists and TV executives. Reporters see it as opportunity to probe, ask questions, hold executives’ feet to the fire. But for networks, it’s a marketing and PR opportunity, pure and simple. From the executives’ perspective, it makes far more sense to spend their limited time at TCA promoting an actual show that may benefit from some media exposure, rather than taking a bunch of questions about the inside baseball of scheduling or ratings for on-demand viewing. The decision comes down to dollars and cents: One broadcast exec told TheWrap that each day of TCA can cost a network up to $1 million for hotel fees, flights for incoming cast members, food for critics and more.\n“We want TCA to be more about the shows,” one network exec told TheWrap (like everyone else interviewed for this story, the source spoke on condition of anonymity). “There’s more midseason shows now and not more time to present them.”\nTired of the grilling\nIt’s no secret that many executives hate TCA — or at least, hate their sessions in front of reporters. “How lovely to see you all again,” former UPN boss Dean Valentine (a former journalist himself) would purr sarcastically as his exec session began at every TCA back in the day.\nAlso Read: 13 New Fall TV Shows, Ranked From Best to Worst by Critics (Photos)\nRelations haven’t gotten any warmer lately. Glenn Geller of CBS last summer was raked by harsh questions about the diversity of programming on his network. HBO’s Casey Bloys caught flak over the sex and violence in the premium cable network’s shows. These types of exchanges may provide great copy for journalists.\n“But what,” one network executive asked, “am I getting out of it?”\nFor now, networks insist that they aren’t ready to bag their TCA involvement entirely. But the future is uncertain.\nRead More “In age when you can Facebook Live, and I can stream the talent to you, and you can sit in bed and watch … Is this the most logical way to do this?,” one executive said of the press tour.\nFor now, the networks are taking a wait-and-see attitude. But if the lack of executive sessions translates into empty ballrooms for the show panels come January, one executive has a stark warning:\n“We will just not do press tour anymore,” this person said.\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\nAmazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives\n11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV\n'Star Trek: Discovery' – Everything We Learned From Bryan Fuller's TCA Panel",
