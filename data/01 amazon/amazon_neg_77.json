      "text": "Amazon, Intel Partner to Advance Smart Home Tech Amazon, Intel Partner to Advance Smart Home Tech 10 Comments The tech giants are coming together to 'extend natural language capabilities to consumers everywhere.' \nFrom Amazon Echo and the Nest Learning Thermostat to Philips Hue light bulbs and the August Smart Lock , there are already loads of gadgets on the market that can make your home a little smarter. Now, two tech giants — Amazon and Intel — are coming together to \"advance the Smart Home ecosystem and extend natural language capabilities to consumers everywhere.\" \nThe companies on Thursday unveiled two new technology initiatives to further that mission. For starters, they're working together on Intel-based smart speaker reference designs that will feature Amazon Alexa. The new designs are meant to \"help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services ,\" Intel and Amazon said . Developers and manufacturers should be able to check out the designs at some point in the first quarter of 2017. \n\"Amazon and Intel see a tremendous opportunity to bring the benefits of a personal voice experience to millions of new consumers and are collaborating to encourage developers and device manufacturers to extend natural voice interaction to more products via Amazon Alexa,\" Amazon's Ted Karczewski wrote in a blog post . Related The Best Smart Home Devices of 2016 \nOn top of that, Intel is making it easier for its customers to bring voice control features to their connected products by adding Alexa to its Smart Home Hub. \n\"A truly smart home is one that provides users with experiences that ease the tasks of running a home and enrich daily life,\" Karczewski wrote. \"With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day.\"",

      "title": "Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson Is Back With the Supercharged 'Grand Tour'",
      "text": "By Caty Enders \nThe inordinately expensive five-minute intro to the new Amazon car show The Grand Tour is nothing if not gaudy: a sort of music video ode for classic car fanatics, set to a live performance in the California desert of \"I Can See Clearly Now\" by the Hothouse Flowers. For those familiar with The Grand Tour ’s progenitor, Top Gear — one of the most popular shows on the planet — it’s hard not to view the $2.5 million spectacle as a sod off to the BBC, which dropped the show’s three longtime hosts a year ago after an altercation between a senior producer and then-host Jeremy Clarkson. But what else would you expect from 56-year-old Clarkson, who’s delighted in provoking everyone from truck drivers in the north of England to, famously, the entire country of Argentina (as well as America’s Deep South). \nHis new project, which debuted in November, immediately became Amazon’s most-viewed premiere and prompted a single-day record for number of Amazon Prime sign-ups. Rumored to cost anywhere from $160 million to $250 million for three seasons , TGT is just two episodes into its 12-show run. Clarkson, along with co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, who bolted with him from the BBC, have not lost a beat in switching to the new format, which is essentially the same as Top Gear, with the exception of a mobile tent-cum-studio and a team of copyright lawyers. We caught up with Clarkson at New York’s Classic Car Club Manhattan to ask him about the new show. RELATED: The 32 Best Cars to Buy Now \nI read a couple years ago that you and James May were going to retire and open a pub, but it seems like that’s not coming to fruition. Well, no, because we worked out that we don’t really like anyone. We’d have a list of people who weren't allowed in so long that we realized we’d have no customers at all. So he’s going to do a shoe shop, and I’m going to be a farmer — that’s the latest thing. \nIt seems like you spent a fair bit of time in America for the new show. Do you like it here? Well, this isn't America. This is an island off the coast of America, same as Britain … I know America quite well, actually. I've been to all of the States. I know both the Dakotas; I can discuss streets in Austin, Texas, and Sacramento, California. There are weird little outlying bits of Birmingham, Alabama, that I know quite well. And there are really good hotels in Utah. But I haven't been to New York until really quite recently. So the part of America I know well is between California and New York. RELATED: Matt LeBlanc: A True Gearhead? \nSo if you haven't spent much time in New York, then you haven’t met Donald Trump, I assume. I have not met Donald Trump. Everyone was very surprised about Trump's victory except me, because I spent most of my time in America in between the blue bits. \nWhere “people have started to mate with vegetables,” as you once said when you were in Alabama for a Top Gear special. Well, that day was bad. It was scary. There were a lot of men in pickup trucks who came to do us harm. But that's the bit of America I knew — where I go most of all. When Trump won, it was much like Brexit. \nAnd you pushed your fans to vote \"Remain,\" which would have kept the UK in the European Union. Yeah, I pushed hard. Shows how much we know, doesn’t it? But we live in a democracy: You just have to roll up your sleeves and say, \"Well, there we are. We’re out of Europe; you got Trump. Carry on.\" \nFor someone who's sort of an equal-opportunity offender, you do come across as political. I would on British stuff, because I’m allowed. I think Piers Morgan’s biggest mistake when he came over here was getting involved in the gun debate. You’re British: Shut up. It’s up to Americans to decide what they want to do with guns. We can watch with amazement, but it’s not up to us to lecture. When Barack Obama came to Britain and started telling us we had to stay in Europe, he almost swung 10 percent of the population the other way. We don’t want to have Americans telling us what to do. It's the same thing. \nThe show is watched all around the world, so it’s understandable that people everywhere want to know what you think. As a newspaper columnist, I think the Trump win is hilarious. Had Clinton won, I would have had nothing to write about. With Trump now, he’s going to be vomiting column ideas for me every single week. And, let's be honest, I don’t live in the States, so it makes no difference — selfishly — to me. \nSo tell me about the new show. It’s three old men who fall over and drive cars: there you go. Three fat old men — well, two fat old men and a slightly thinner one. We fall over and laugh at each other. That’s the show. \nHas it been hard to adjust to the new format? I know you've taken most of your team with you. It's all the same camera team and production team — same hosts. Everyone thinks the BBC was a nightmare to work for. It wasn’t. There was one bad apple at the time, and he’s now gone. \nYou did say you liked the BBC. I loved the BBC. The BBC is a terrific organization, and it did allow us to say what we wanted to say, and so does Amazon — Amazon studiously so. They ring every week and make observations, and they’ve made a couple of helpful ones. If we’ve said something about America, they’ll tell us, \"Actually, you might want to be a bit careful saying that,\" which we don't know because we’re British. So they’re useful advisers, but they don’t ever say, \"You can’t say that, you must say that, and can you all wear Coca-Cola hats.\" Which is what we were worried about. And no commercial breaks. So it’s all the same, really. \nDid you have any demands that came with signing on to do another show? Yeah, we didn’t want any commercial interference. The BBC, as you know, is not commercially funded. And I’d been there 27 years, and the idea that somebody might say, \"Oh, could you mention Coca-Cola?\" That would have made my penis go inverted with horror. Yeah, I can’t do it. If someone said, \"Here's £20 to say, 'Aren't those tires lovely?'\" I would say the opposite, I’m such a contrarian. \nYes, you seem to criticize everyone. Exactly. Everybody’s terrible. Including me. \nWere you worried that essentially having to reinvent Top Gear would be too difficult? Honestly, if you like traveling as much as I do, how can you not be excited? We go to the Namib desert on The Grand Tour , and I got a purple metal-flake beach buggy to try to get across the Namib desert with an army of people to make sure I always have a glass of rosé wine or the cigarettes I like. Not the white-tipped Marlboro Lights, but the browned tipped. You know, with a camera team that’s sort of brilliant and willing, and a team of producers that is brilliant and capable, why would you not? \nThe first episode of the new show opens with a celebration of green technology and hybrid cars — albeit hybrid hypercars. Do you still think that regulation is going to kill the supercar? What Mclaren and Porsche and Ferrari have done is the equivalent of weaponizing a wind farm. They’ve taken green technology and turned it into speed and power and more excitement and noise. There’s nothing even remotely environmental about those cars, make no mistake, and I still maintain that there is only one solution for cars, and no government or carmaker is following it with any sort of real enthusiasm: We will have to use hydrogen. The more hybrids that come along, and electric cars, the more people think they're being environmental, which they’re not, because of course, they’re charging it up from a power station. \nBut the more they think they are, the less demand there is for actual environmental solutions. It’s one of the reasons I genuinely hate hybrids and electric cars, because what they’re doing is delaying the introduction of hydrogen cars. \nYou do have a Doctor of Engineering, even if it is honorary. Shouldn’t you build one? Unfortunately, I have no skills at all. Everything is always broken, as far as I'm concerned — usually is if I've touched it. \nWhat should we make sure not to miss in this new series? Honestly, my favorite episode is the one in Jordan. I think it’s very funny. Very few cars in it, but I did do a lot of laughing, and I think the audiences will laugh as well. I hope they will. Otherwise we’ve just wasted our time. \nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed. Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter!

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nThe battle to provide the best digital butler for homes is something Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) will be fighting over for years. \nThese in-home devices with artificial intelligence and language processing skills could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track. \nAmazon upped its game with announcement's at its re:Invent AWS user conference that ended Friday. \nAlready, Amazon grabbed an early lead with its digital butler called Echo — a 9-inch tall cylindrical device with speaker and wireless internet connection. It's infused with artificial intelligence and the ability to understand language, providing the brains that bring Alexa, the voice of Echo, to life. Simply ask, and Echo plays music from the cloud and delivers broadcast news, sports, weather and many other features via the voice of Alexa. It can also control lights in the home. The Echo sells for $179.99, with a low-end compact version, the Echo Dot, selling for $49.99. \nThe Google unit of Alphabet recently followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home , a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, which sells for $129. IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system . Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but New products or services often generate stellar profitability. \nMicrosoft has yet to introduce a similar device for the home but has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. This is also true of Apple with its Siri platform and Facebook ( FB ) with its Messenger platform. Facebook and Microsoft are tapping into software apps for smartphones called bots, software that performs automated tasks. \nThe devices have the potential of being the central hub of a smart-home ecosystem. Amazon is reportedly working on an Echo device that comes with a 7-inch touch screen , according to a Bloomberg report. It said the device could be introduced in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon's Re:Invent Announcements \nAmazon revealed several new services based on artificial intelligence at re:Invent conference, held in Las Vegas. \nOne is Rekognition, a platform that enables developers to build applications that analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. \nAmazon also introduced Polly, an artificially intelligent text-to-speech platform that could be used, for example, with software bots to provide a customer service feature. \nA third announcement was Lex, which can be used to build conversational applications. Lex helps power the Amazon Echo device, giving a personality to its voice by Alexa. \nAs to who will be the top dogs in this battle of brains is a wide open debate. Amazon is currently the market leader with Echo, reportedly with more than 4 million sold, but even it has work to do, according to commentary from Edison Investment Research via email. \n\"Still an awful lot of work to do for Amazon,\" Edison said about Echo. \nOn Wednesday, Amazon and Intel ( INTC ) announced a partnership, with two technology initiatives for the smart home ecosystem. \nOne initiative is designed to enable Alexa to remotely control and coordinate device actions with an Intel-based Smart Home Hub. The second is an Intel-based smart speaker reference design with Amazon Alexa included. It is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services . \n\"We would not be surprised to see Google follow suit in this strategy with Google Assistant where, once again, it will have the advantage because we have long believed that Google Assistant is vastly superior to anything else in terms if the user experience that it offers and the usefulness of its responses,\" the Edison commentary said. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note said Amazon has been investing in voice technology for more than five years and believes it could be the next major disruption in computing, serving as a primary user interface in the next computing generation. \n\"We've been hearing many of the 'smartest people' at Amazon want to work on Alexa because they sense it's a major growth area for the company and will be 'something big,' \" Mahaney wrote. \"We believe the Echo devices could be one of the (technology) gifts this holiday season.\" \nMahaney has an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 950. \nAmazon stock fell 0.45% to 740.34 in the stock market today . The stock has been sliding since hitting an all-time high of 847.21 on Oct. 6. \nPacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin in a research note said initial customer response to the AI applications announced by Amazon at re:Invent was strong and could further complement and differentiate Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. \nBracelin has an overweight rating and price target of 905 on Amazon stock. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "As Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) re:Invent conference draws to a close on Friday, the company's expanded partnerships and services could be a boon for some companies, but a thorn in the side of some other enterprise giants.\nAmazon announced an expanded partnership with Salesforce.com ( CRM ) comprising several areas. Users of Salesforce's AppExchange will be able to use Amazon's app streaming service, while Internet of Things customers can crunch data from networked device on Amazon's IoT platform and move it into their Salesforce databases. Salesforce will also draw on Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition tech, among other matters.\n\"That benefits Salesforce quite a bit,\" said Ryan MacDonald of Wunderlich Securities said of the pact.\nAmazon announced a range of cloud partnerships and services during the week-long Las Vegas conference for Amazon Web Services users and developers, from an agreement with Workday ( WDAY ) to new offerings in databases and voice-recognition technology. The moves will ripple through enterprise software, benefiting companies like Salesforce and Workday, but presenting new challenges for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Oracle ( ORCL ) and others.\nThe decade-old Amazon Web Services is \"one of the most formidable threats to other software vendors as it continues to release compelling competing services, and improve on existing offerings,\" Raimo Lenschow of Barclays wrote in a note about the conference.\nThe cloud unit is \"the fastest-growing, multi-billion dollar, enterprise IT [company] in the world,\" according to Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald. \"With new features and services in 2016 on track to hit 1,000 (vs. 722 introduced in 2015), the pace of AWS innovation is hard to match by any of its competitors,\" the analyst wrote in a report this week.\nBy itself, Amazon Web Services is worth $160 billion, or 44% of Amazon's enterprise value, according to Macquarie, which values the cloud unit at 9 times projected 2017 revenues. Microsoft's Azure and the cloud service Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google also have strong positions in the public cloud, but Amazon Web Services is the clear leader.\nAlphabet is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

Subscribe Oscar Buzz Builds For Rebecca Hall In ‘Christine’ (Photo by Brian Ach/Getty Images for Amazon) \nHow effectively will Amazon Prime Video be able to compete with Netflix outside of the US? originally appeared on Quora : the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights . \nAnswer by Jonathan Brodsky , SVP of Chicken Soup for the Soul, on Quora : To answer how well Amazon Video can compete with Netflix outside of the US, you really have to look at how well they’re doing in the US, first. The good: Amazon has a number of exclusive titles for Prime that are high-quality and win awards. Amazon has access to pretty much any movie you might want to buy. Amazon’s apps are reasonably good, and searching for programming is relatively simple. The bad: Amazon doesn’t work with Chromecast. This, all by itself, is a huge pain in the butt if you’re already used to streaming your other services (Netflix and Vudu in my house) via Chromecast, because it requires either a Fire Stick (yet another thing to buy) or a smart TV with an Amazon app. If you own a smart TV, then you’re already aware of how terrible those app environments tend to be. Amazon has a great video selection, but I don’t think that they do nearly as good a job on rental/purchase videos as Vudu does on a number of fronts (don’t get me wrong - Vudu has plenty of problems of its own, most notably that you need to be on the internet to watch movies that are downloaded to your device). And what they have available for Prime is just not worth it on its own — I maybe find one movie per month that I’m interested in on Amazon that’s not available for free elsewhere. Amazon’s content is good, but there’s not enough of it to compete with what I can find on Netflix (which does a much better job in two verticals I really care about, children’s shows and documentaries) or Hulu (which has all of the network TV out there). It’s unclear to me how Amazon is going to deal with the ‘bad’ issues: Smart TVs aren’t necessarily prevalent globally, and you can’t force people to keep buying peripherals. Plus, there’s a lot of the world that’s still on analog cable: For this reason alone, I’d expect slow growth in a wide number of countries overseas just because spending more on a TV or a Fire Stick (which may or may not work with your current TV, especially if you’re on an old analog or satellite TV) isn’t likely to be worth it. 2. I’ve already noted that I think Amazon’s US content isn’t worth the extra money in comparison to what’s available from other services; I would be unlikely to pay for Amazon Prime Video if I wasn’t already a Prime customer. Amazon is going to have to create content that is appropriate, region-by-region, to be the winner here, just like any other content network needs to have really good content. Replaying a bunch of second-run movies and a couple of decent, US-centric shows isn’t going to do much for anyone other than homesick ex-pats. Dubbing everything that is US-centric in another language is a short-term solution, but there’s enough content being produced everywhere at this point that you really need original content. 3. Amazon should make its Prime Video apps multi-lingual, just like it does with its overseas websites: This is the same thing that companies learn, over and over, when they port their brand from their home country — you need to localize. In the case of Prime Video, there’s two things that they need to localize — the language (relatively trivial work) and the content (not at all trivial, especially if they want to create content like they do in the US). This is a tall order … but I’m sure Amazon is up for it. \nThis question originally appeared on Quora. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge.

      "text": "0 \nAmazon’s Fire tablets have really caught on since its inception. Amid its cheap price, suitable performance, and deep integration with Amazon’s products and services, the Kindle Fire has become the unrivaled sweetheart of low-end affordable tablets. However, the \"unrivaled\" aspect of the brand may soon be omitted as an old rival has surprisingly resurfaced to challenge the popular budget-friendly tablet: the Barnes & Noble Nook . \nAmazon and Barnes & Noble were once stiff competitors. Around the same time that the Amazon Kindle eReader was gaining serious traction, Barnes & Noble was also getting in on eReaders with its own product, the Nook. The brand was a popular option for eReaders, but really took off when Barnes & Noble unveiled the Nook Color tablet at the tail end of 2010, the same year the Apple iPad was released. The Nook Color was one of the first “budget” tablets to arrive on the market and was wildly popular, selling millions of units. The Kindle Fire wouldn't appear on the market until a year later. \nUnfortunately, a string of questionable decisions led to the demise of the Nook, including the release of too many Nook variants in a short amount of time, disabling a popular ability to sideload Android apps, limiting memory partitions so that users only had access to a fraction of the advertised price to load e-books and losing the ability to download and backup e-book purchases. Amazon, on the other hand, continued to thrive after its release. \nDespite its shortcomings, the Nook line never did completely die out. Barnes & Noble teamed up with Samsung to create two Galaxy Tab 4 Nook models in 2014, and released one eReader in 2015. Barnes & Noble also released a Samsung Galaxy Tab A variant earlier this year. These releases came and went quietly without much coverage, but Barnes & Noble appear to be edging its way back in the budget tablet market with the introduction of the new competitively priced $49.99 Nook tablet . \nThe new Nook offers specs that relate closely to the $49.99 Amazon Fire 7 , such as a 7-inch 1024 x 600 resolution display, 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of storage (expandable by microSD up to 128GB; Amazon’s allows for up to 200GB), VGA front-facing camera and 2MP rear-facing, and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. \nDespite their similarities, the two devices also have their differences. The Fire 7 has a much wider array of accessory options when compared to the new Nook tablet. The Fire is also offered in more colors, whereas the Nook is only offered in black. The Fire 7 also offers double storage for $20 more; the Nook is stuck at 8GB of internal storage. However, both tablets support SD storage for apps. Kindle FreeTime, a relatively hassle-free option for kids for a monthly fee, is a nice plus for the Fire 7, but the Nook also has parental controls and profiles. \nOn the other hand, the Nook has advantages as well. For starters, the Nook is ad-free at $49.99 . It costs $14.99 extra to remove ads on the Kindle Fire. The Nook also appears to have unbridled access to the Google Play Store, whereas the Kindle Fire only has access to Amazon’s Appstore (which features many of the same apps in the Play Store, but not all). There are workarounds to get the Play Store on the Kindle Fire, but it does not come with it right out of the box. \nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. The Kindle Fire is better for more storage/wider variety of accessories and Amazon connectivity, while the Nook is better for ad-less hassle and a wider selection of apps from the Google Play store. Ultimately, they are both excellent deals for the price. \nReaders, what are your thoughts about the new Nook with competitive pricing? Would you rather have the Nook with the Google Play Store out of the box, or the Kindle Fire with more accessories and storage space? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!",

      "text": "The past week saw record-breaking online sales as the U.S. and much of the rest of the Western world gobbled up Thanksgiving weekend sales.\nBut though an incredible amount of money was spent from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, the results were a mixed bag for ecommerce superstar Amazon ( AMZN ) .\nMany observers say that though Amazon no longer depends on Thanksgiving, Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales as it once did , Chairman, Chief Executive and Founder Jeff Bezos must seriously consider a few challenges to the company's business.\nSales of devices at Amazon over the weekend rose more than 100% from a year earlier. But digging deeper paints a less-than-rosy picture .\nThis year, Amazon sold two times more Kindle tablets than last year, but on Cyber Monday 2015, the company sold three times more tablets than it had the year before.\nSimilarly, sales of the Amazon Fire TV streaming-media player also decelerated, up 2.5 times from a year earlier. But Cyber Monday Fire TV sales in 2015 grew more than six times year over year.\nAmazon has boasted that it sold millions of its all-new Echo Dot over the holiday weekend.\nThis lowest-cost version of its Alexa voice-activated personal assistant has made headlines, but the device was marked down to just $40 from nearly $50 in September . It is doubtful whether this momentum can continue at the regular price.\nBut while Amazon's sales growth is cooling, it is heating up for some of the company's competitors.\nFor instance, Walmart has redoubled its ecommerce efforts over the past year in an effort to catch up with Amazon, especially when it comes to mobile purchasing. And those initiatives are starting to pay off.\nThe retail giant reported that its holiday weekend application orders with in-store pickup jumped 150% .",

      "text": "Markets Today How Amazon's Rapidly Growing Cloud Business Threatens Microsoft and Oracle Amazon Web Services is building up a formidable range of features and partners, challenging the big enterprise software providers. Chris Nolter Dec2,20162:30PMEST \nAs Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) re:Invent conference draws to a close on Friday, the company's expanded partnerships and services could be a boon for some companies, but a thorn in the side of some other enterprise giants. \nAmazon announced an expanded partnership with Salesforce.com ( CRM ) comprising several areas. Users of Salesforce's AppExchange will be able to use Amazon's app streaming service, while Internet of Things customers can crunch data from networked device on Amazon's IoT platform and move it into their Salesforce databases. Salesforce will also draw on Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition tech, among other matters. \n\"That benefits Salesforce quite a bit,\" said Ryan MacDonald of Wunderlich Securities said of the pact. \nAmazon announced a range of cloud partnerships and services during the week-long Las Vegas conference for Amazon Web Services users and developers, from an agreement with Workday ( WDAY ) to new offerings in databases and voice-recognition technology. The moves will ripple through enterprise software, benefiting companies like Salesforce and Workday, but presenting new challenges for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Oracle ( ORCL ) and others. \nThe decade-old Amazon Web Services is \"one of the most formidable threats to other software vendors as it continues to release compelling competing services, and improve on existing offerings,\" Raimo Lenschow of Barclays wrote in a note about the conference. \nThe cloud unit is \"the fastest-growing, multi-billion dollar, enterprise IT [company] in the world,\" according to Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald. \"With new features and services in 2016 on track to hit 1,000 (vs. 722 introduced in 2015), the pace of AWS innovation is hard to match by any of its competitors,\" the analyst wrote in a report this week. \nBy itself, Amazon Web Services is worth $160 billion, or 44% of Amazon's enterprise value, according to Macquarie, which values the cloud unit at 9 times projected 2017 revenues. Microsoft's Azure and the cloud service Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google also have strong positions in the public cloud, but Amazon Web Services is the clear leader.

      "text": "How Capital One taught Amazon’s Alexa AI assistant to help you manage your money © Capital One The US bank Capital One is developing Alexa skills so that customers can ask the AI personal assistant for account details and even make transactions in a secure way \nScott graduated from Cardiff University with a degree in English Literature and a diploma in Magazine Journalism. He has a keen interest in disruptive tech, sport and the media. Follow: LinkedIn Google Plus \nA few years ago, asking an AI assistant to retrieve sensitive financial information on behalf of a bank customer would have seemed far-fetched. However, this is the vision of Scott Totman, head of mobile technology, payments and innovation at Capital One, had for the US bank. Earlier this year, Capital One created a virtual assistant application - or ‘skill’ - for Amazon’s Alexa platform. The voice-activated service allows customers to use voice commands to perform actions such as tracking recent transactions on credit and current accounts, balance checking and even bill payment. Speaking at AWS Re:Invent in Las Vegas this week Totman revealed how the company created the AI platform. \nThe project started by running face-to-face consumer research sessions with customers to work out if they would be willing to bank using voice with Alexa. \nTotman found customers had a common set of concerns they would need to overcome before launching the service. These included account security, a lack of physical privacy and sensitivity around data sharing with third parties. \nCapital One realised early on that security would be integral for customer confidence in the platform. The skill is one of the first to use the open standard OAuth so no information is passed between Capital One and Amazon. Furthermore, the initial linking of accounts isn’t a simple mobile integration but a two-step verification where a secret phrase is sent to a user’s mobile device to authenticate the integration. Related AI is the latest “fashion” in enterprise tech, with widespread usage a year away \nTotman identified two primary customer needs: the ability to perform a task without having to stop what they are doing, and performing basic financial health checks, what Totman calls “Am I OK?” questions. \nHe said that when the team developing the Alexa skill “had to balance security and convenience, so that people felt comfortable using it but not making it so inconvenient that you would just go on your mobile app and do it just as fast”. \nDavid Isbitski, chief evangelist for Alexa and Echo added: “Skills should provide an experience that is easier than using your phone,” otherwise people won’t use them. Semantic search \nNext, Totman and his small developer team had to work out how to communicate with customers using Alexa. \n“Take ‘what’s left in my checking account?’, so is the person asking this affluent? Probably not, so we have to bear in mind. While the Alexa platform, through the commercials, has been brought with humour and levity, finances aren’t necessarily humorous to a lot of people. It’s stressful and personal so we had to be sensitive to that,” Totman said. \nAt first Capital One wanted customers to state their account number or type to get a balance request, however “we found that people ask things in all sorts of ways,” Totman said. \nThrough its call centres, user lab and actual feedback from the skill, Totman saw that people asked for information in a number of ways, and the skill now allows for more than 150 query types. \n“Sometimes people don’t give us any information at all, they ask “what did I buy” and we have to figure out the time period, account and help the user get some useful information without making them work for it,” Totman added. \nFinally, voice brought a new set of challenges for user experience (UX) designers as people don’t speak in a linear way. Totman explained the challenge: “There is a strong breadcrumb trail in web and mobile apps, you know where they came from and are going. With conversations they can go from asking for an account balance to wanting to pay a bill,” so it is important to work out context and understand when customers switch intent. Avoiding the bad first date \nTotman had some advice for fellow Alexa skill developers which he described as similar to avoiding a bad first date, namely avoiding awkward silences, forced conversation, a lack of personality and talking too much. \nWhen it comes to silences: “Unlike a web page where you have process bars, when you have a silence from an Echo it is ten times more painful than a webpage, so you have to have extremely responsive APIs,” Totman said \nThen, in order to avoid forced conversation you have to continue iterating the skill and responding to feedback so that all questions can be answered because “if you put in a feature that no one uses it doesn’t clutter up anything, it is just a question that no one asks. Just put it in,” Totman advised \nHe added that looking for opportunities for humour and making sure responses aren’t too verbose are good guidelines when developing an Alexa skill. What next? \nCapital One is investigating how to offer customers more capabilities to perform core banking activities with Alexa, such as locking or activating credit cards without having to pick up the phone. \nTotman said the Capital One developers are working on a skill which allows you to ask Alexa what happened last night. Totman demoed it on stage and Alexa responded to the query with: “I don’t know what happened to you but I know what happened to your money”, and then “make better choices Scott.” \nExplaining how they achieved this Totman said: “It’s not that complicated behind the scenes. We grab transactions between 8pm to 3am and if it is over a threshold we shame you and if it is lower we congratulate you.” Recommended for you ",

Photo: Amazon \nAt Amazon’s Web Services conference re: Invent this week, the retail giant announced it is teaming up with Intel for a smart speaker reference design with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant to help with tasks. The device is meant to help other companies make their own gadgets using Amazon’s voice tech and Intel’s platform. Developers will be able to get their hands on the device during the first quarter of 2017. \nIntel’s Smart Home Hub uses Alexa voice controls, making it easy to ask questions and more. This means Intel is helping developers build connected products that can be controlled with voice commands. \n\"With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day,\" said Alexa content marketing manager Ted Karczewski in an Amazon developer blog post . Related Stories CBS All Access Will Stream NFL Games, Starting This Sunday \nBoth Amazon and Intel are looking to expand their network so it integrates into the home. Alexa already has some smart home skills through Echo , like being able to control Logitech’s Harmony Hub. \nEarlier this year, Intel formed a partnership with Microsoft, Samsung, Qualcomm, Cisco, GE Digital and others to help connected products in your house talk to each other. Intel also announced a chip for the IoT industry in October. \nThis smart speaker reference design \"is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services,” Intel said in a statement today. \nThe speaker will “support the standards needed for PAN connectivity in the home, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth, and is extensible enough to add video capabilities and environment sensors for an all-in-one customer experience,’ Karczewski wrote .

      "text": "Amazon Adds HBO And Cinemax To Amazon Channels; Consumers Slowly Moving Away From Cable TV? By Chris Benjamin   06:40 pm The new policy set by Amazon does not apply on books and can be found on the site's Customer Service Section(Photo : David McNew / Getty Images) \nMovie-lovers will now be able to stream movies available on cable and satellite TV even when on the go after Amazon recently announced the addition of HBO and Cinemax subscriptions on their TV offerings list , \"Amazon Channels.\" \nAccording to the Verge, members of Amazon's streaming service, Amazon Prime, can now buy monthly subscription to HBO and Cinemax through Amazon Channels. HBO's monthly subscription costs $14.99, while Cinemax's monthly subscription costs $9.99 with both subscriptions having a 30-day trial.HBO and Cinemax will be the new addition to Amazon Channels' over 70 add-on subscriptions for their Amazon Prime members . This on top of what Amazon Prime subscribers can access with no additional cost. All of @HBO , all on #AmazonChannels . Try a month of HBO, free! https://t.co/nL6nyxBj1I pic.twitter.com/7ysEqEsqpB \n— Amazon (@amazon) December 1, 2016 \nWith the HBO subscription, Amazon Prime Subscribers will have access to hit HBO-original shows and series, both current and past. HBO subscribers will also have access to HBO's currently licensed movies and news shows. \n\"Prime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed 'Westworld' and 'Game of Thrones' without the need for a cable subscription. We're thrilled to work with HBO to bring their cutting-edge content to Amazon Prime members with Amazon Channels.\" The Verge Cites Michael Paull, Amazon VP of digital video. \nAs for the Cinemax subscription, Amazon Prime subscribers will have access to Cinemax-originals and licensed movies. In December, Jurassic World will be available in Cinemax, reports Techcrunch . \nThere is, however, hardly any price difference between getting the add-on HBO subscription in Amazon Channels and subscribing to HBO Now, HBO's standalone streaming service. HBO Now's current subscription costs $15.Other than HBO and Cinemax, Amazon Prime members can also subscribe to other programs like Showtime, Starz, and Comedy Central for a monthly fee.

      "text": "The Internet is where we do most of our shopping, and a solid 90% of it is done at Amazon. Jeff Bezos has turned his humble bookstore into a sort of Automat of the digital age, selling everything from soup to nuts at low prices with speedy shipping. Nobody knows Amazon deals quite like we do. Except for you, that is. Welcome to Prime Directive, where we find the coolest things on Amazon.com and feed them to you, one at a time.\n12/2/2016 Five Nights At Freddy’s Backstage Construction Set\nThe Five Nights At Freddy’s phenomenon is one of the most unlikely success stories of the last decade. A hinky indie game made by a fundamentalist Christian about working nights at a pizza parlor somehow transformed itself into a huge cultural phenomenon with multiple sequels, a book, and even an upcoming movie. Oh, and of course there’s toys. From MacFarlane, the industry leader in disturbingly realistic plastic, you can now have your own miniature backstage area to look at in terror while you work.\nThis 153-piece construction set lets you build the workspace where the malfunctioning animatronics hang out, and comes with a Withered Chica figure as well as a spare endoskeleton and a bunch of character heads. It’s one of several construction sets for the game from MacFarlane, but this one is our favorite.\n$26.98 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n12/1/2016 Turbo Kid Soundtrack\nOne of the few good developments in this hell century has been a new appreciation for the balls-out low-budget sci-fi action flicks of the late 1980s and early 1990s. That was a glorious time for practical effects and buckets of blood. One of our absolute favorite throwback films of 2015 was Turbo Kid , which took equal parts Mad Max and Mega Man and threw them in a blender to create a gory, wild and emotionally affecting story of love and heroism in the wasteland.\nYou can stream that movie for free on Netflix so we’re not going to make you buy it here, but what you really should get is the absolutely luxurious collector’s edition soundtrack by Le Matos. Limited to just 1000 copies, this 2x 180 black vinyl record set contains the film’s complete music in a glorious package. Any fans of John Carpenter or 80s synthpop needs to have this in their library.\n$42.29 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/30/2016 Magnus Robot Fighter: Flesh And Steel\nIf you want to talk about one of the most serious paranoias of the modern age, being replaced by a robot is right up there. With Westworld dominating the geek conversation, it might be nice to look back at one of the more influential man vs. robot comics of the last century – Gold Key’s Magnus, Robot Fighter , created by Russ Manning and first hitting newsstands on November 30, 1963. The tunic-wearing martial artist practiced a discipline that let him smash steel with his bare hands, and the character has survived in various forms from various publishers.\nDynamite bought the rights to Magnus and a few other Gold Key characters in 2013 and rebooted the title, and it’s been a fun read so far. Magnus now lives in a world with deceptively humanlike robots integrated into regular society, and both sides are equally complicit in bad deeds. It’s a solid 12-issue run that you can get into at a good price.\n$12.85 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/29/2016 Xtronaut\nWinter is most definitely board game season, and all throughout the next month or so we’ll be highlighting some new favorites and old classics to play with family and friends. Let’s start off with a recently Kickstarted game that scratches just about every one of our geek itches. It’s a seriously techy take on space exploration called Xtronaut from the leader of the NASA OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission.\nHere’s how it works: each player is the director of a launch complex, struggling to complete their mission before other players do. You can take part in all the political and financial intrigue of the real-life space program, as well as collaborate and betray other players. The basic rules are simple to learn but the game has a ton of depth and replayability. Add it to your collection before the snow hits.\n$29.74 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/28/2016 Livid Minim Wireless Controller\nIt’s never been easier to make music for fun and profit. Gone are the days of painstakingly learning how to play an instrument, replaced by electronic gadgets and gew-gaws that let us conjure any sound in the world at the press of a button. If you want to get in on this racket – and really, why shouldn’t you – you’re going to need some hardware. Meet the Livid Minim Wireless Controller. This unique device links up wirelessly with an iOS app to let you craft all kinds of music with just your fingers.\nWe like the Livid Minim for a few reasons. First and foremost is the seriously 90s retro industrial design – it looks like something Alpha would use on Power Rangers , all pastel neons and beveled edges. Second is the user-friendly nature of the hardware. Eight big pads and fifteen buttons give you enough space to experiment without overloading you with options. It also has 3D motion control, so you can modify your sound simply by picking the thing up and changing its position. Audio pros are giving it unanimously good reviews, and at this price how can you go wrong?\n$129.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/24/2016 World’s Largest Gummi Worm\nIf you’re anything like most Americans, today is the day when you gorge yourself on turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and other traditional Thanksgiving dishes. And looming on the horizon is one of the most dreaded events on the calendar: the post-Thanksgiving potluck. Everybody brings their leftovers over and they’re glumly picked over by people who have been eating the same stuff for days.\nBe the hero of your next potluck by showing up with something completely unexpected: a three pound gummi worm. This massive hunk of slithering sweetness is deeply disturbing looking but apparently tastes great. The product description on Amazon reads as follows:\n– blue\n– gummy & Chewy candy\n– Great taste\n– fresh\nHow can you argue with that?\n$23.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/23/2016 Lot Of 100 Comic Books\nEven though in the modern era you can get just about any comic book ever published digitally streamed to your PC, tablet or phone, there’s nothing that will replace the feeling of sitting down with a stack of single issues. There’s no way to replace feeling the slick cover stock on your fingers, and breathing in the smell of ink. One of the most treasured geek traditions is the proverbial “dollar box” at comic conventions, a massive trove of back issues you can pick through for bargain-priced hidden treasures.\nIf there’s no con near you, replicate the experience on Amazon by buying a random box of miscellaneous comics for 60 cents apiece. Sure, some are likely to be junk, but odds are good you’ll discover a title you missed, a new favorite character, or something weird enough to scan and post to Twitter. This was the way our nerd ancestors consumed comics, and you owe it to yourself to do the same at least once.\n$60.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/22/2016 Jamie Lee Curtis Action Figure\nWhen we think about actresses who have earned and kept geek cred for their entire careers, Jamie Lee Curtis is near the top of the list. From making her debut in the first Halloween movie to her going undercover in Vega cosplay to Street Fighter tournaments, she’s been keeping it 100 for decades. And if you’re not enjoying Jamie gloriously chewing scenery on Scream Queens , you have no soul at all.\nOddly enough, for an actress who has been in so many sci-fi and horror movies, Curtis doesn’t have that many action figures of herself. We have to turn to 1999’s Virus , based on an indie comic, for the best one. Luckily for us, Amazon has literally everything, so you can still pick one up. It comes with a bunch of accessories, like any good action figure does.\n$11.05 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/21/2016 Nintendo New 3DS XL Special Edition: Lime Green\nIt’s a big month for video game anniversaries, and today is no exception. On November 21, 2004, Nintendo unleashed the original DS in America – before it hit Japan. The first entry in company president Satoru Iwata’s “Gaming Population Expansion” plan, it was a shot across the bow to the hardcore. A stylus-based touchscreen created a whole new input paradigm and made more casual games like Brain Age a possibility. The console was a massive hit, with over 3 million preorders, and went through a number of stylistic and hardware evolutions.\nThe latest iteration is the New Nintendo 3DS, and if you don’t have one, it’s a great time to snap one up. Amazon has a special edition lime green model of the portable console that comes with Super Mario World pre-installed. We dig the funky coloration, and the hardware has an insanely deep library of games, both first-party stuff like Mario Maker and third-party titles like Monster Hunter: Generations .\n$199.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/18/2016 Cryptex USB Flash Drive\nThere are lots of lessons to be learned from the just-completed 2016 elections, but one of the most important is already well-known by geeks: you’ve got to protect your data. Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the Wikileaks of John Podesta’s emails made the candidate look like she didn’t know swift about security, and with the Russians gleefully hacking everything they could get their digital fingers into that wasn’t a smart move. So how do you keep your bits and bytes on lockdown?\nOne old-fashioned but cool-looking way is with the Cryptex USB Flash Drive. This 16GB portable storage unit comes encased in a steampunk-style combination lock that keeps it protected from anyone that doesn’t know the five digit code. Created from designs by Leonardo da Vinci, this thing probably won’t solve all your data security needs, but it’s stylish as hell and an awesome conversation piece.\n$47.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/17/2016 LEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar\nGeorge Lucas had no idea that Star Wars would become the cultural juggernaut that it did. That’s the only explanation we can give for the Star Wars Holiday Special , a bizarre low-budget oddity that premiered on CBS on November 17, 1978. The hour-long show is notable for the first appearance of Boba Fett (in animated form), but what most people remember is the bizarre musical numbers, celebrity guests like Bea Arthur and Chewbacca’s weird family. It was only aired once and then buried in the Lucasfilm vaults.\nTo celebrate the season in a little bit cooler way, snag this sweet LEGO Star Wars advent calendar from Amazon. For each of the 24 days of December leading up to Christmas, open a door to reveal a different LEGO minifig or vehicle, including an exclusive holiday variant you can’t get anywhere else. While we wait for Rogue One , we’ll need to scratch our Star Wars itch somehow, and this is as good a way as any.\n$61.97 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/16/2016 Night Of The Comet\nEverybody has their personal cult classic movies that they force on friends and acquaintances. On November 16, 1984, one of our favorites hit theaters for the first time. Night Of The Comet is a unique and bizarre combination of two cultural touchstones of the era: zombie horror and Valley Girl comedies. And it works!\nWhen a comet that passes Earth every 65 million years catches our planet in its tail, the majority of the population is either reduced to dust or transformed into murderous zombies. Only a handful of people who were protected from its effects remain to figure out what the hell happened, including a pair of teenage sisters.\nIf you haven’t seen it, Night of the Comet will make you look at shows like The Walking Dead in a new way. Sure, it delivers on the horror and shock, but it never loses sight of its own humanity. It’s a great flick and one that you should add to your collection.\n$19.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/15/2016 Halo: The Master Chief Collection\nWhen the original Xbox hit store shelves in the United States on November 15th, 2001, most people thought Microsoft was crazy. Getting into the hardware business, and competing with market-crushing juggernauts Nintendo, Sony and Sega? Even with their deep pockets, there was no way they could make it work.\nAnd for the most part, they were right. The first Xbox was a disaster. Horrible form factor, nightmarish UI, and a third-rate software library consigned the console to the bottom of the heap. But even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while, and that nut was the original Halo: Combat Evolved . Bungie’s attempt to make first-person shooters work on a console was a tremendous success, selling over five million copies. The sequel, also on the original Xbox, moved over eight million. And a new franchise was born.\nCelebrate fifteen years of Xbox gaming with Halo: The Master Chief Collection , taking the first four games in the series and giving them a current-gen graphical and audio upgrade. The insane amount of content in this package will probably keep you busy for the next fifteen years.\n$26.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/14/2016 Red Sonja: Queen Of Plagues\nIf you think about underrated comics from the last fifty years or so, Marvel’s Conan the Barbarian book has to be up there. While Marvel’s superhero universe was growing, Roy Thomas and John Buscema kept sword-swinging fantasy action alive for decades. One of the most culture-defining moments that came out of the series happened on November 14 in the pages of Conan the Barbarian #23. That’s when we first glimpsed the She-Devil with a Sword, Red Sonja. The crimson-haired barbarian quickly grew in popularity and soon snagged her own book as well.\nWhile the character’s rights have bounced around publishers since then, we have to give props to Dynamite Entertainment for rebooting her with a female writer at the helm. Gail Simone’s take on Sonja doesn’t skimp on the chainmail bikini or the violence, but also portrays her as a strategic genius and a serious threat on the battlefield. Simone’s run was one of the best fantasy comics of the last few years, so get in on the ground floor with this TPB collecting the first six issues.\n$12.81 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/11/2016 Playing With Power: Nintendo NES Classics\nToday’s the date when the NES Classic Edition hits store shelves, but you’re a geek, you probably already pre-ordered it. If you’re a true retro gaming fan, though, you should carve out a space on your bookshelf for this handsome hardcover volume that pays tribute to some of the console’s greatest game,\nPlaying With Power: Nintendo NES Classics is crammed with artwork and information on 17 NES titles, as well as complete walkthroughs and strategy guides. If you pick up a Classic Edition, you’re probably going to get stuck because some of those 8-bit titles are obtuse and hard as hell. Sure, you can log on to GameFaqs or whatever, but if you really want the authentic experience, this book (which comes in a sweet-ass slipcase that looks like a NES Game Pak) is a must-buy.\n$26.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/10/2016 Boomer The Foot Mouse\nWe freaking love bizarre computer peripherals. A whole closet at Geek HQ is crammed to the gills with quirky keyboards, unusual USB devices and customized mice. But we’ve gotta say that Boomer the Foot Mouse has us feeling pretty envious. This hilarious-looking input device lets you use your tootsies to move a cursor around. We’re not 100% sure how much latency Boomer has, but the idea of using our feet to aim in Overwatch is so ridiculously funny that we’re going to order one just to try it out.\nThe manufacturer says that Boomer is great for “doctors, surgeons, dentists” or anyone who needs to do something with their hands white they compute. The discs on the top are made of elastomer rubber so you can take them off and clean them easily, and anti-skid pads prevent it from traveling across the floor. It’s even Bluetooth-compatible. This is easily the weirdest damn mouse we’ve ever seen in our lives. You should buy one.\n$895.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/9/2016 SAS Survival Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Surviving Anywhere\nIf you’re freaking out after last night’s… events, you might be considering packing a bug-out bag and making a new life off the grid, away from other human beings entirely. But one mark of a true geek is that we always do our homework, so before you doomsday prep, get some reading done. John “Lofty” Wiseman was the youngest person to ever pass the admissions test for Britain’s Special Air Services, and he served with them for 26 years through numerous operations.\nDuring his time there, Wiseman accumulated a library’s worth of information on surviving in the wild, and in this book he lays it all out for you. The SAS Survival Handbook has all the tips you need for making it work in a variety of hostile environments, including how to track and kill animals, make secure campsites, navigate by the sun and moon and recognize poisonous plants. It’s the essential manual for keeping your crap together when the world ends, and with Amazon Prime you can have it in your hands tomorrow.\n$12.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/8/2016 Chuck’s Living Object Tinglers: Volume 3\nNovember 8th is a day of true horror. No, not because the fate of the free world hangs in the balance of the most ridiculous American Presidential election ever. It’s actually the birthday of one of the most influential horror writers of all time. Abraham “Bram” Stoker came out of the womb on November 8, 1847. 50 years later he produced his most famous work, the gothic novel Dracula that kicked off a wave of imitators and basically defined everything we know about vampires.\nBut just as the 90s were the time for Klax, the 2010s are the time for a new breed of author. One with an equally vivid imagination. A humble man from Billings, Montana named Chuck Tingle. And wouldn’t you know it, Chuck has even penned one of his trademark “tinglers” about blood-sucking creatures of the night. Vampire Night Bus Pounds My Butt is one of three stories in this bargain-priced volume that will chill you to the bone and keep you warm on election night.\n$6.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/7/2016 Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series\nAll the normies are getting into Westworld , HBO’s new sci-fi prestige drama that examines what happens when human-looking artificial intelligence gets a little big for its britches. But true geeks walked down this road ten years ago when a couple of guys brought B-level sci-fi TV show Battlestar Galactica back as one of the most thought-provoking and influential shows of the 21st century.\nThere are a lot of parallels between the two properties – Westworld was also a significantly cornier movie in 1973, for example. And people had lots of wild theories and ideas about where things were going. But while you have to wait week after week for HBO to drip out new episodes, you can watch the whole damn thing of Galactica right now. This 20 disc box set is crammed to the gills with bonuses and special features. With a running time of 4179 minutes (or about three straight days), it’ll certainly do the job.\n$114.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/4/2016 Kotobukiya “Armored Core” Rayleonard 04 Alicia Unsung D-Style Model Kit\nMost days we try to tie in the Amazon Prime pick to something happening in the real world, just to give you a little context for your shopping. But sometimes you just want to buy a cool-ass robot without any hassle. We got you, buddy.\nAs the weather gets cooler and outdoor activities become significantly less fun, we must return to the geek hobbies of our ancestors. It is our true belief that if you’ve never assembled a Japanese mecha model, you’re missing an important punch on your geek card. Amazon has a bevy of sweet-ass Gundam and the like to choose from, but this is a site for the hardcore, and no game is more hardcore than Armored Core .\nCreated by From Software (the Dark Souls guys), Armored Core has been delivering intense mech combat action since 1997, and the robot designs have evolved to be some of the most badass in the business. This Rayleonard is a great pick for a newbie model builder, as it looks fricking sweet but doesn’t have an insane number of little fiddly bits to keep track of. A warning, though: once you get bit by the mecha model bug, it won’t stop until your desk is a battlefield of mechanical carnage.\n$28.04 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/3/2016 Death Wish Coffee\nNovember 3rd marks the birthday of one of the most stoic movie badasses of all time, Charles Bronson. Born Charles Dennis Buchinsky in Pennsylvania coal country, the craggy-faced Bronson was the first member of his family to graduate high school and moved to New York City after serving in WWII to pursue a career on the stage. Bronson’s breakthrough role was in 1960’s The Magnificent Seven , and after that he was regularly cast as badasses out for revenge, most notably in the 80s vigilante fantasy Death Wish movies.\nIt’s with those movies that we segue into today’s deal: sixteen ounces of Death Wish coffee, certified to be the strongest java you can brew. This organic, fair trade blend boasts a caffeine payload around 660 mg per 12 ounce cup, or twice the amount of normal drip coffee. That’ll give you the buzz you need to blow away punks on the subway, no problem.\n$18.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/2/2016 Dr. Strange Omnibus\nStan Lee gets most of the credit as the architect of the Marvel Universe, but without his artistic collaborators there would be no Marvel as we know it. November 2nd is the birthday of one of the Man’s most important and contentious partners – Stunning Steve Ditko, co-creator of both Spider-Man and Dr. Strange. The reclusive artist let his freak flag fly on the page with the latter, sending the mystical hero into psychedelic dimensions of flowing shapes and impossible perspectives.\nDitko left Marvel in 1966 (the rumor is over an argument with Stan Lee over the identity of the Green Goblin in Spider-Man , which is the most comics thing ever) but his work still stands as some of the most inventive the medium has ever seen. This handsome hardcover omnibus edition collects his complete run on Dr. Strange as well as the Roy Thomas / Bill Everett issues that followed. Read up before you see the movie so you can tell the Wand of Watoomb from the Rod of R’Thakk.\n$67.50 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n11/1/2016 Grim Fandango Remastered Soundtrack\nHopefully you’re sweating out your candy hangovers on this fine November morning, but if you’re close to the border you might be preparing for another holiday. November 1st is Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, when the living honor and remember the dead with sugar skulls, elaborate altars and satirical poems. It’s pretty damned cool.\nAnd when you talk Day of the Dead and geek culture, there’s only one game that comes to mind: Tim Schafer’s legendary Grim Fandango . The LucasArts adventure game was mindblowing when it dropped in 1998, with a unique art style that illustrated the tale of travel agent Manny Calavera in the Land of the Dead as he helps people on their journey to the Land of Eternal Rest. It’s one of the best games of its genre.\nUnfortunately, until Amazon tries to battle Steam and sell games digitally (don’t do that), you can’t buy the remastered version there. What you can get, though, is the game’s insanely good soundtrack by Peter McConnell, which blends Latin jazz up into an all-time great set of music performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\n$8.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/31/2016 Warlock by Jim Starlin: The Complete Collection\nIt’s Halloween, but we need to be practical here: if you order something spooky from Amazon, it’ll be November before it gets to you (even with Prime). So let’s take the day to commemorate the creation of one of the greatest villains in comic book history.\nJim Starlin was in the middle of a short run on Iron Man in 1972, taking the armored Avenger into space to contend with less mundane threats than he was used to. In issue #55, we met Thanos the mad Titan for the first time. The purple-skinned near-immortal would become one of Marvel’s most dependable villains, anchoring numerous crossovers like the original Infinity Gauntlet . His murder of James “War Machine” Rhodes in Civil War II shows he’s still a mover. Oh, and of course the Marvel Cinematic Universe is setting him up as the Big Bad (played by Josh Brolin).\nTo really get an idea of why Thanos is the pimp he is, you need to go back to the source. This hefty volume collects Starlin’s wild 70s work on Warlock , where he single-handedly explored the trippier sections of Marvel’s cosmology.\n$25.48 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/28/2016 Stargate SG-1 Complete Series Seasons 1-10 Collection\nIn terms of sheer amount of content produced, the Stargate franchise ranks up with the most successful science fiction of all time. Since the first movie hit theaters on October 28, 1994, it’s spawned two more movies, three TV shows, an animated series, a couple video games and even a pinball machine. Not too shabby, by our standards.\nThe franchise’s longevity can in many ways be chalked up to the popularity of Stargate SG-1 , the first spin-off series. Over the course of ten seasons, SG-1 built a huge mythology around the alien Go’auld, who have been trifling with human history since the dawn of time. The show was brisk, had a hefty effects budget for the time (a reported $400,000 per episode) and holds up well. Thanks to Amazon, you can take home all ten seasons in one weighty box and binge until next year.\n$117.44 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/27/2016 Petcube\nIf you’re anything like us, the hardest part of your day is leaving your pets at home to go to the office. Unless you work for a company that lets ferrets run free in the server room and dogs camp out by the water cooler, you spend eight hours a day away from your cat or your fish or your lizard, and it’s awful. Well guess what? Technology is saving the day yet again. Meet the Petcube.\nThis camera lets you interact with your pets through a special app from anywhere in the world. The self-contained unit contains a speaker and microphone so you can talk to your furry friend, observe their motions, and even boasts an aimable laser pointer that you can control with your finger through the app. The camera delivers crisp 720p video and you can take snapshots of your pet and share them.\n$143.20 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/26/2016 The ICO and Shadow of the Colossus Collection\nWhen you get gamers talking about the best console of all time, a few float to the top. The Super Nintendo is obviously up there, and some holdouts will claim the Dreamcast. But in the modern era, only one box had the range and quality, and that was the Sony PlayStation 2. Easily the dominant console of the early 21st century, the PS2 boasted a staggering software library and impressive (at the time) technical specs. On October 26, 2000, North America met the hardware for the first time, and we loved it.\nYou can (and maybe should) buy a used PS2 on Amazon for under fifty bucks, but if you want to play two of the hardware’s best games on a slightly more modern machine, pick up this collection of Fumito Ueda’s PS2 masterpieces Ico and Shadow of the Colossus , remastered for the PS3. Ueda’s third game, The Last Guardian , finally releases this December, so if you’re not familiar with his work you might want to get on that.\n$22.05 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/25/2016 Halloween Complete Collection\nIt’s that time of the year again, where ghouls and ghosts and killers and thrillers crawl from their crypts to scare us just like we want them to. But October 25th has special resonance for any true horror fan, as it’s the day that John Carpenter’s Halloween hit theaters in 1978. The film was shot on a $300,000 budget, but Carpenter wanted to make something with the same visceral impact as The Exorcist . He did it with amazing performances, razor-sharp cinematography and the creation of an iconic villain – the blank-masked Shape, Michael Myers.\nIt was a huge success and the rest is history, spawning six sequels and a reboot trilogy. And you can get them in one convenient box set for a pretty reasonable price right here. The package includes all ten movies with quality transfers, so you can sing the “Silver Shamrock” jingle in deliciously clear stereo all year.\n$49.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/24/2016 The Comic Book History Of Comics\nWe’re typically looking to the future here at Geek as much as we can, but every so often we need to turn an eye to the past. October 24th is one of the most important days in geek history, as it marks the birth of one of our most treasured art forms: the comic. On this day in 1896, the New York World printed what is considered the first ever comic strip, called “The Great Dog Show in M’Googan Avenue” by R.F. Outcault.\nThat strip introduced a bald ragamuffin in a yellow nightdress who came to be called the Yellow Kid, the first comics star. While those early Outcault strips are kind of hard to read a century later, you can learn about them and the rest of the history of comics in The Comic Book History Of Comics by long-time Marvel and Valiant writer Fred Van Lente and artist Ryan Dunlavey. This brisk collection of stories tackles the high points and low ones of the medium we love with humor and heart.\n$19.10 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/21/2016 AUT-350C Pro Gold 3G Connected Car Adapter\nAs we write this, huge chunks of the Internet are down due to a hacker attack against one of the Web’s biggest DNS servers. We can’t get to a bunch of our favorite sites, but luckily Geek is still up and running, and so is Amazon. The age of constant connectivity is both a blessing and a curse. Today’s product is a pretty interesting step into the world of the Internet of Things, where every object you own is in some way wired into the global information network.\nIt’s called the AUT-350C Pro Gold 3G Connected Car Adapter, and it’s designed to make the bond between you and your whip stronger than ever. Hook this puppy up to your car and it’ll give you real-time location tracking, diagnostics and more. If your Check Engine light is on, instead of shelling out big bucks for a mechanic the AUT-350C can tell you what it means. The device even links up with Amazon Echo and other smart devices.\n$129.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/20/2016 The Flash Season 2\nOne of the things that separates DC Comics from their marvelous competition is the idea of “legacy” heroes – new characters who take up the mantle of an older one when they retire from the superhero game. The best example of that concept is the Flash. In the Golden Age, they had silver-helmeted Jay Garrick. The Silver Age introduced Barry Allen to the role, and then shortly after he was joined by a third – Wally West.\nOn this date in 1959, Flash #110 was released, and we met young Wally, who fell victim to the same freak accident that gave Barry his powers. The character has seen numerous changes over the years, but last season of the CW’s Flash series gave us a Wally West for a new generation. He took up the mantle of Kid Flash in season 3 (currently airing), but if you missed it, pick up the last season on Blu-Ray and get up to speed. Sorry for the pun. Sorry. We’re trying to delete it.\n$34.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/19/2016 The Walking Dead Compendium 3\nWe’re just a few days out from the season 7 premiere of The Walking Dead , and the cliffhanger of exactly who met the business end of Lucille, the baseball bat wielded by new big bad Negan will presumably be resolved. One of the many cool things about the AMC show is seeing where it sticks to the comics and where it goes its own way – if you’ve been reading along, you already know who gets their head caved in, but the big question is whether it’ll be the same on-screen.\nFor our money, the absolute best way to read The Walking Dead is in the massive Compendium volumes, which collect over a thousand pages of comics in one back-breaking tome. The third collection covers the introduction of Negan and the threat that comes after. You can read ahead and spoil yourself, or dole issues out as the season goes along. It’s all the same to us.\n$34.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/18/2016 Nintendo Selects Remix Pack\nOn October 18th, 1985, possibly the greatest thing to ever happen to Generation X hit American stores: the Nintendo Entertainment System. Single-handedly revitalizing the world of console gaming, the NES introduced us to the genius of Shigeru Miyamoto, Gunpei Yokoi and the other masterminds of Japanese design. Although the first wave of NES games was… uneven (anybody remember Chubby Cherub ?), the console got better and better, eventually boasting some of the most important games of all time.\nAlthough Nintendo is releasing the NES Classic Edition pre-loaded with a bunch of games later this year, today’s a great time to re-visit one of the most interesting things they’ve done with their library. NES Remix took titles like Excitebike , Dr. Mario and Punch-Out and transformed them into bite-sized challenges, Wario Ware style. They’re addictive and fun. Dust off the Wii U and give this one a try while you’re waiting on NX news.\n$19.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/17/2016 Bullitt Do you like the Fast & Furious movies? Of course you do, because you are a true cinema fan. Those flicks represent the apotheosis of the car chase as action movie, but if you want to know how the genre got there, it’s time to look back to a movie that was released on this date in 1968: Steve McQueen’s baller San Francisco thriller Bullitt .\nMcQueen, one of the most iconic action stars of all time, stars as a police detective trying to get to the bottom of an assassination attempt on a Mafia witness. But what people really remember the flick for is the chase through the San Francisco hills, with McQueen behind the wheel of a forest green Mustang GT going after a pair of hitmen. This propulsive piece of cinematography did more than just about any other movie to make car chases popular.\nFrank P. Keller won the Oscar for best editing for that scene, and it’s definitely worth multiple viewings. If you haven’t seen it, check it out.\n$14.30 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/14/2016 Underworld: The Legacy Collection If you had told us back in 2003 that Underworld would spawn a five-film franchise – more than, say, Hellboy , we would have looked at you like you were crazy. But never underestimate the appeal of Kate Beckinsale in a skin-tight catsuit. The fifth movie in the series, Blood Wars , was scheduled to be released next week but Screen Gems just let us know they’re pushing it to early 2017.\nWhat to do until then? Why not re-acquaint yourself with the series courtesy of the very affordable “Legacy Collection” on Bu-Ray, which boasts all four films as well as five and a half hours of additional material. All four films have entertaining and enlightening commentary tracks.\n$30.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/13/2016 Jack Kirby’s Fourth World Omnibus “I am the Revelation! The Tiger-Force at the core of all things! When you cry out in your dreams — it is Darkseid that you see!” With those words – and many more like them – Jack “The King” Kirby created one of the greatest villains in comic book history. And in Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen #134, released on this date in 1970, we got our first tantalizing glimpse of the ruler of Apokolips.\nWhen Kirby came to DC Comics in 1970 after a long stint at Marvel, the company put him on one of their worst-selling, least consequential titles. Nobody really cared about the annoying redhead that Supes got out of scrapes. But Kirby, being Kirby, took the ball and ran with it like a maniac, laying the groundwork for what would become the Fourth World saga. This gorgeous omnibus edition collects the beginning of that run, along with lots of great meaty Darkseid dialogue.\n$55.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/12/2016 QWERKYWriter\nLet’s face it: touch screens are probably the future. But for old-school geeks like us, we’ll never get used to the feeling of tapping our fingers on our monitor to get things done. We need the tactile feedback of an old-school mechanical keyboard to make us really feel like we’re hacking away. There are a number of models on the market, but we have to give props to the QWERKYWriter, which goes really retro with a typewriter-styled chassis and keys.\nFunded on Kickstarter, the QWERKYWriter is a completely wireless mechanical keyboard, powered by a rechargeable battery. The body is cast from solid aluminum and keys are triggered with mechanical click switches. One of the coolest things is the return bar, which you can macro program to do just about any task you want. This thing is a solid piece of tech that will make writing on your iPad or other tablet significantly more pleasurable.\n$349.00 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/11/2016 Saturday Night Live, Season 1 41 years ago today, a little television show called Saturday Night Live made its debut. Developed by NBC to fill a hole left by the end of Johnny Carson repeats on weekends, the sketch comedy program would change the course of humor forever, launching the careers of dozens of stars from John Belushi to Kate McKinnon. The first season of SNL is a fascinating historical document, as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players find their unique voices in front of a live audience week by week.\nThis DVD collection of the whole first season is amazing to watch – George Carlin completely blows the first ever opening monologue. Richard Pryor kills it in his episode. Musical acts include Abba and Gil Scott-Heron. And the Muppets are on it making decidedly more adult jokes than they’ll ever make again.\n$14.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/10/2016 Arduino Uno Ultimate Starter Kit\nTinkering with electronics has been a hallmark of the geek experience for generations. While our ancestors would head to Radio Shack to stock up on resistors and diodes, modern geeks are engaged in some significantly cooler stuff. One of the neatest platforms that makers are using for projects is Arduino, an open-source system that links microcontrollers that can control physical objects. Those funky robots and bespoke gadgets you see on YouTube? It’s more than likely that Arduino makes them go.\nSo how do you get going with this stuff? One click, buddy. The Uno Ultimate Starter Kit has everything you need to set up an Arduino project, with a 72 page manual that contains a dozen starter ideas. Clear step-by-step diagrams make them all digestible. It comes with a breadboard, tons of wires and LEDs, a DC motor and lots of other stuff.\nThere you go. Build something cool and tell us all about it.\n$48.99 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/7/2016 Mafia III We’re not going to put release-day video games in this section all that often (and let’s get this out of the way right up front: ordering with Amazon Prime saves you eleven cents ), but we can’t think of a title we’re more eager to spend a weekend with than Mafia III . It’s been six years since the last game in the franchise, and developers Hangar 13 have taken it to some new and daring places.\nUnlike the last two titles, which put you in the shoes of a classic Italian mobster, the protagonist for Mafia III is Lincoln Clay, a young Black Vietnam vet in a fictionalized New Orleans-esque city. Games that tackle racial prejudice head-on are rare, and the devs have been working hard to ensure that the game pulls no punches.\nThe game also has a seriously groovy period-appropriate soundtrack with tons of great music. Although official reviews aren’t out yet, the early buzz on Twitter is very promising. We’ll be plugged into this one until Monday at least. Won’t you join us?\n$59.88 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/6/2016 Ajax Scientific 5 Piece Equal Mass Metal Density Cube\nThe best thing about Amazon – aside from the ability to get anything in the world delivered to your door like a pasha of old – is the site’s incredible array of objects with little to no practical use. Case in point: these five cubes of equal density but different size from Ajax Scientific. Unless you’re a high school science teacher (and if you are, that’s awesome), you probably don’t need cubes of aluminum, brass, copper, iron and zinc.\nBut what does “need” mean, really? All you actually need is food, water and a place to sleep. Everything else is transitory and meaningless. So why not embrace that meaninglessness with five beautiful, perfect cubes of various metals? You can make them the start of a cube collection of every substance known to man. When you get one of every element, urban legend has it you can combine them all to make a reality-warping Cosmic Cube.\n$13.65 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/5/2016 Pokemon Go Survival Knife If you’re anything like us, you’re still out on the streets for at least a little bit every day playing Pokemon Go . And your hunt for new creatures to catch and gyms to conquer might have taken you off the beaten path. It might be time to equip yourself with a little protection.\nThe Pokemon Go Survival Multi Tools Knife from Vivien Discount Store has everything you need to keep safe and secure on your travels. They offer it in three different colors – red, blue and yellow, of course – and each color is engraved with the corresponding team Valor, Instinct or Mystic logo.\nAt just four and a half inches closed, this low-profile knife fits comfortably in a pocket. The 1/3 serrated blade is durable enough to cut through rope and other obstructions, and a built-in LED light lets you illuminate your workspace.\nThe blade is notched to cut away seat belts in the event of a car crash, and it also has a glass breaker fob, bottle opener and firestarter (in case you run into any Grass-type Pokemon who take extra damage from fire). It’s quite the well-designed little multitool for the price.\nThe Valor and Mystic knives come in two different designs – the standard single-bladed model as well as a Batarang-esque “Zubat” style. The Instinct one only comes in Zubat for some reason, but nobody’s on Team Instinct anyways.\nNow we’re not saying that you should go out and have West Side Story -esque knife fights with other teams. Let’s keep our battling to the virtual plane. But a survival knife is good for lots of other things besides spilling blood. Oh, and they also throw in a free color-coded bracelet so your teammates can identify you from a distance.\n$19.95 with free shipping from Amazon Prime, Buy it here\n10/4/2016 Westworld One of the most unexpected surprises of the fall TV season has been HBO’s Westworld , the adaptation of a Michael Crichton book about a theme park full of realistic robots. When some of them begin malfunctioning and doing things they shouldn’t be able to (like murder, for instance), drama ensues. The show has a fine pedigree – created by J.J. Abrams and Christopher Nolan’s brother Jonathan, and with an awesome cast including Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood, it looks to be another hit.\nThe thing is, Westworld was already a movie back in 1973. A pretty damn good one, too. Crichton directed the tale, which featured Peter Martin and James Brolin as guests in the park when the robot attractions start to go ape. Yul Brynner is awesome as the Gunslinger, armed with weapons that theoretically don’t allow him to hurt humans. Of course, that theory fails and the end result is a fun, futuristic box office hit.\n$5.49 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here.\n10/3/2016 Cage Are you done binging on Luke Cage ‘s first season yet? If Netflix’s latest adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has whet your appetite for a little more action, why not delve into the back issues? You could certainly start from the beginning with the ’70s Power Man book, but for something a little closer to the modern take, Brian Azzarello, and Richard Corben’s five-issue Cage miniseries will hit the spot.\nAzzarello is famous for 100 Bullets and other titles, and Corben is a legendary underground artist who cut his teeth in the pages of Heavy Metal . His mainstream work is few and far between, so this is a rare treat. Published under Marvel’s Max imprint (sort of a “mature readers” line akin to Vertigo, but less fantasy-oriented and more gritty action), this book brings Luke Cage back to the streets, putting him in the middle of a gang war as he looks to solve the murder of a little girl.\nCorben’s art is gorgeous, the script hews close to the character’s Blaxploitation roots, and it’s an interesting midway point between the tiara-wearing Hero for Hire and the devoted family man and Avenger that he became. Very much worth reading, especially at this price.\n$9.95 from Amazon Prime, Buy it here.",

It's makers have indicated that they'll be taking it to other networks or streaming platforms in the hopes of getting the second season broadcast.",

      "title": "Amazon & Intel Work Together To Bring Alexa To More Devices",
      "text": "One of surprising successes in recent times is the Amazon Echo, a speaker with Amazon’s AI assistant Alexa built into it. The device has been received pretty well and so far it seems that many users are reacting positively to it, so much so that it has since spawned various devices like the Amazon Tap and the Amazon Echo Dot. However it seems that is not enough as Amazon and Intel have announced that they are working together to bring Alexa onto more connected devices. For starters Intel has actually recreated a reference design for a set of speakers with Alexa integrated into it. This means that companies who want to reduce their own R&D costs and use this reference design to make their own speakers.\nIntel is also bringing Alexa to its Smart Home Hub, which in turn is helping developers build more connected home products that can be controlled using Alexa. Given that Google is hoping to achieve the same thing with Google Home , it seems that Amazon might have the added advantage of Intel’s backing.\nAt the moment Alexa is open to third-developers to use and we have seen a few devices that have taken advantage of it , but we guess with Intel’s backing it should open it up to more companies.\nFiled in",

      "text": "In today’s TV news roundup, Stephen Root joins Amazon’s “ The Man in the High Castle ,” Bravo announces a premiere date for “Imposters” and more.\nCASTING\nStephen Root has been cast in the title role for the second season of Amazon’s drama series “ The Man in the High Castle .” He will portray “a mysterious figure” associated with the Resistance movement. Season 2 premieres Friday, Dec. 16.\nDATES\nBravo has announced the premiere date for its upcoming scripted series “ Imposters ” ( formerly titled “My So Called Wife” ), which will debut Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017 at 10 p.m. The hourlong dark comedy follows con-artist Maddie (Inbar Lavi), as her former victims team up to bring her down.\nGREENLIGHTS\nCinemax has greenlit a six-episode limited series, “Rellik,” Variety has confirmed. The drama is described as a “killer story told backwards.” The project — first reported by Deadline — hails from “The Missing” creators Harry and Jack Williams of Two Brothers Pictures, who will write and serve executive producers on the show. Other exec producers are Willow Grylls, Charlie Pattinson and Elaine Pyke of New Pictures, plus BBC’s Stephen Wright. Sam Miller is on board to direct. All3Media is also producing for BBC and HBO.\nStarz has greenlit “ Nude ,” a documentary film directed and produced by Anthony B. Sacco and Josh Shader . The project will explore today’s “perceptions of modeling, nude photography, and body image” connected to the modern world and “evolving social media landscape.” The film will shed light on “Treats!” founder Steve Shaw casting and creating his inaugural NU Muses project.\nNBC Universo has added “ Sons of Anarchy ” en Español to its upcoming 2017 lineup. NBC Universo acquired the U.S. television cable rights from 20th Television, and will begin airing the first season, dubbed in Spanish, in early 2017. “Sons of Anarchy” is created by Kurt Sutter, and stars Charlie Hunnam and Katey Sagal.\nRATINGS\nDisney TV movie “ Elena and the Secret of Avalor ” drew a veritable horde of children in the first three days of viewing. From Nov. 20 through 23, a whopping 2.25 million kids ages 2-11 watched the movie either on Disney Channel, Disney Junior, or on demand, and 4.4 million tuned in overall, the second-biggest audience for a kid cable network telecast this year. (The top spot goes to a Disney Channel airing of “Frozen” in February, lest you think anyone’s ready to let it go.)\nEXECUTIVES\nChaz Gray has been added to Spike TV ‘s team in the newly formed role as executive producer of current original series. Gray will report to the cabler’s SVP of original series, Chachi Senior, overseeing the production of several of the network’s series, including “Bar Rescue,” “Back to the Bar” and more. He previously served as executive producer on “Top Chef” and “The Real Housewives of Orange County” 100th episode special.\nDEALS\nITV America has signed a deal with executive producer Carlos King (“The Real Housewives of Atlanta”) to combine his company, Kingdom Reign Entertainment, as a production label under ITV America. Under the new partnership, King will serve as president of the label, and will develop and produce unscripted series across a range of different genres. He will report to ITV America CCO Adam Sher and Leftfield Entertainment CEO David George.\n“Carlos has an expert eye for talent and the ability to identify fascinating worlds with diverse lifestyles and experiences that are relatable, aspirational and fun to watch,” said Sher and George in a statement today. “He’s also a vibrant force of creativity and humor, which makes him a great partner. All of us at ITV America are eager to support Carlos as he continues to showcase strong characters, and to offer him the freedom to expand and create breakthrough content across many styles and genres.”\nKingdom Reign Entertainment is represented by CAA.\nOriana Schwindt contributed to this report.\nRelated stories\nDesigners Talk Emmy-Nominated Main Title Sequences\nAmazon Pushes 10 Free Pilots to YouTube, Facebook\nBritish Columbia Reduces Production Incentives but Expects Little Impact\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "The team here at New York is nothing if not opinionated, especially about the stuff they’re grabbing (and giving) for the holidays. From now until mid-December, we’ll be posting items that our staffers really stand behind — that also make great gifts. Below, staff writer Jada Yuan on the backpack that strikes up conversation in cafés.\nI spent months, even years looking for the perfect backpack that I could use to haul my computer around during the day but also take out to events at night and not feel like a hobo (I do a lot of reporting in the evening). Most of the fancy leather ones on the market have unpadded straps that hurt my shoulders and make me worry about my back. The ones with padded straps — like Jansport or Eastsport, even Herschel — are huge and make me feel like a sixth-grader.\nOnce, while out with a friend, I mentioned admiring her nephew’s backpack (it looked just the right size and very comfortable) — and she just went ahead and bought it for me. Now, it comes with me everywhere. It’s got a slim profile and a slot for both a computer and an iPad, making it perfect as a computer bag. When I’m traveling, it’s impossible to overstuff (it’s no Patagonia that I can only use to half-capacity), so airlines never hassle me for throwing it in an overhead bin along with my suitcase . Did I mention pockets? Tons for tape recorders, lipstick, pens, batteries, you name it. The straps are indeed padded and sport a bunch of loops so I can hang my water bottle from a carabiner when it won’t fit in my bag. It’s even a conversation starter: I get tons of compliments on the design (I have the version with the elk on it) in coffee shops — which is nice, since I’m single — but I think a lot of the other designs are classy, too. The price is so nice I’m thinking about getting another one (as a gift, or yes, for myself). And for those who mind, it’s vegan, too.\nBuy Focused Space Departure Backpack 80 , Amazon The Strategist is a new site designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

      "title": "FINRA Commits Mission-Critical App To Amazon Cloud",
      "text": "Over the last 2.5 years, a major Wall Street regulatory agency, FINRA, has found a home inside the Amazon cloud. It believes that \"cybersecurity is better in the public cloud than it is in private enterprise data centers,\" said Steve Randich, executive VP and CIO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nAnd what's good enough for the Wall Street regulators is good enough for many financial industry organizations. \"What we've done has stirred a lot of interest… We've had big banks coming in to ask us about our experience,\" said Randich, as he took center stage to talk about the move at ReInvent , AWS' annual user and developer event held this week in Las Vegas.\nSuch is the state of the public cloud today. A key convert has the potential to set off a stampede. Randich isn't able to disclose who is thinking about following FINRA into the cloud. But Capital One has stated it's putting more of its operations and customer applications into the public cloud, according to Rob Alexander in an announcement .\nFor FINRA, the move to the cloud was not an experiment or pilot project. Its first move was putting its primary, mission critical system onto AWS, its market surveillance application that searches through the day's trades looking for suspicious activity.\n\"We collect all orders for Quote: s and trades – 75 billion events per day. We process every day all the information that Visa and Mastercard process in six months,\" Randich told a keynote crowd that filled a giant hall at the Sands Expo Convention Center in the Las Vegas Venetian Hotel.\nWant to learn more about what happens when a market collapses? See NYSE, United Airlines Shutdowns Spark Paranoia .\nFINRA runs sophisticated surveillance queries against the data, looking for insider trading and evidence of trades occurring before regulations allow them to. After the May 6, 2010 \"flash crash\" when unexplained events kicked off a precipitous drop in the market, FINRA was authorized by the Security Exchange Commission to collect even more data, which it is in the process of dong. The flash crash was \"an unpleasant event,\" dropping the Down Jones Industrial Average for the day by 998 points. FINRA is charged with trying to prevent a repetition of that event.\nFINRA holds all the data it collects for a minimum of five years. Historical data is essential because in some cases an order is placed and no action taken on it until a given stock or stocks reach a strike point, where the trade must be executed. Understanding what happened in a trade is hard to do if the order authorizing it lies outside the data set that investigators are working with.\n(Image: EdStock/iStockphoto)\nTo discharge its responsibilities and continue to collect the immense amount of data that it works with – \"20 petabytes and getting larger,\" said Randich -- FINRA needed to stop supplying its own data center infrastructure and move into the cloud. The process started with planning to move the surveillance system in 2013. FINRA eventually devoted 500 IT staffers to the task and cut the application over in mid-2014. It eschewed hiring consultants or vendor expertise to do the job, developing the necessary knowledge of EC2 and skills to do it itself.\nin an interview with InformationWeek after the keynote, Randich said that finding the right people to make the move wasn't a problem. \"We started by letting them use the FINRA charge card (to establish an AWS account) and play with it. Then we began proofs of concept… people from all over the organization bought into it. Then they were brought together in a community of practice,\" he recalled.\nPart of the later stages was to get all the training they could from Amazon. \"We offered pretty much anyone the opportunity to get training,\" and with a sense that something big was in the works, more than enough FINRA IT staff was prepared to work with applications on EC2.\n\"It was very uncommon. We wanted to do it ourselves, not through a vendor,\" he added. That was because FINRA's future lay in the cloud and it had to have a staff with a depth of knowledge on how it worked.\nNow it wants to move its registration system into the cloud as well. That means moving an Oracle database system from a FINRA data center into one of the 10 AWS relational database services, possibly Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility, a new offering announced Nov. 30 . The SQL used in open source PostgreSQL is compatible with that used in Oracle database applications, but FINRA hasn't made a decision on which Amazon option it will use, Randich said in the interview.\nBut the move to the cloud has proven cost effective. \"We got some huge, pleasant surprises out of this that we did not expect at all,\" he told the keynote crowd in a sprawling Sands Expo hall. ReInvent has 32,000 registered attendees this year.\nAt its peak, FINRA's own data center mustered 3,000 virtual servers, with the number of physical servers less than that. In the cloud, FINRA can burst out to 11,000 nodes or virtual servers at a time. Over the course of a day, it may use as many as 30,000 virtual servers in total, with the number rising and falling according to need.\nThe elasticity of the cloud means that queries that used to take hours can now be completed in minutes or seconds. Pre-cloud, it wasn't unusual for a FINRA analyst to set a query running, go to lunch, and hours after he returned, the query was still chugging through data. Performance is at least 400% better in EC2, he said.\nUnusually heavy trading days used to generate so much data that FINRA's surveillance application might spend 2-3 days afterward processing all the data. Meanwhile, records from more current trading were piling up, waiting their turn until the weekend. In the cloud, a 20-minute query has been reduced to sub-second response times.\n\"Historically we had these bottlenecks,\" said Randich. By moving to the cloud, the FINRA investigative staff can generate more leads from the data, process more information, and supply a greater regulatory presence to the trading markets.\nFINRA has 20 marketplace abuses to watch for. It can do a better job the more queries it can run against a given day's data. Andy Jassy, executive VP of AWS, said during a ReInvent keynote that FINRA's move to the cloud has been helpful to Amazon. \"We've gotten an incredible amount of valuable feedback in our partnership with FINRA,\" he said.\nCharles Babcock is an editor-at-large for InformationWeek and author of Management Strategies for the Cloud Revolution, a McGraw-Hill book.

      "text": "December 2, 2016 , 6:00 PM Photo: Courtesy of Amazon Amazon has decided to cancel its female-led show Good Girls Revolt after only one season on the digital streaming platform, according to The Hollywood Reporter . The cancellation comes as a bit of a surprise, given that show was met with positive reviews and more viewers than any other Amazon Original after its debut in October. Good Girls Revolt follows the lives of three young women attempting to advance their careers in the sexist publishing industry of 1969. The show is based on the book by Amy Povich of the same title, which documents the landmark sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Newsweek by female employees in the '60s. The show came as a nod to second-wave feminist struggles and a struck a chord with viewers. So why the snub? THR says that Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios, simply “wasn’t a fan,” (I can’t help but wonder why) and didn’t think that the series would be competitive in awards season. When the second season was pitched to him, he passed. The rebuff feels like a micro version of last month’s presidential election, when feminist visions were crushed right in front of those who believed in them most. And I wasn’t the only one to take notice.Series creator Dana Salvo made a reference to the election and controversy over the popular vote when she responded to the decision on Twitter. Amazon passing on S2 of Good Girls Revolt. 💔 But so grateful we got to tell the story. We won the popular vote. Thank u Advertisement A cast member credited the show's supporters for helping her cope with the November 8 election. Amazon decided to cancel GGR. Your roars of support elevated me from the darkest election in history & I'll never stop fighting back for us. — Genevieve Angelson (@GenevieveAngel) December 2, 2016 But all is not lost. Sony Pictures Television is fighting for a recount reacquisition of rights to Good Girls Revolt, so it can shop the show around to other networks. Advertisement",

      "text": "From Amazon Echo and the Nest Learning Thermostat to Philips Hue light bulbs and the August Smart Lock , there are already loads of gadgets on the market that can make your home a little smarter. Now, two tech giants — Amazon and Intel — are coming together to \"advance the Smart Home ecosystem and extend natural language capabilities to consumers everywhere.\"\nThe companies on Thursday unveiled two new technology initiatives to further that mission. For starters, they're working together on Intel-based smart speaker reference designs that will feature Amazon Alexa. The new designs are meant to \"help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services ,\" Intel and Amazon said . Developers and manufacturers should be able to check out the designs at some point in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Amazon and Intel see a tremendous opportunity to bring the benefits of a personal voice experience to millions of new consumers and are collaborating to encourage developers and device manufacturers to extend natural voice interaction to more products via Amazon Alexa,\" Amazon's Ted Karczewski wrote in a blog post .",

Slightly regret returning this tbh as could have used eq on phone more effectively. Didnt rate the battery life on this though. I got about 4 hours out of mine. I have JBL Flip 3 on the way now which i got for £55 on Amazon, which seems a bargain. Hoping my search is at end.",

      "text": "seagate duet amazon drive cloud storage external hard for More This week, Seagate revealed an external storage device called the Seagate Duet. It’s the result of a collaboration between Seagate and Amazon to provide a portable storage solution specifically for Amazon Drive customers. Even more, the external drive includes a free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage for new Amazon Drive customers in the United States, a service that typically costs $60 per year.\nAmazon is taking pre-orders for the Seagate Duet external drive now for $100. Slated to be released on December 10, it provides 1TB of storage that automatically syncs to the Amazon Drive cloud storage service. Keep in mind that the free version of Amazon Drive only provides 5GB of online space, so users will need the yearly subscription to take full advantage of the Seagate Duet’s full syncing potential.\nMore : Seagate’s Backup Plus Portable sets a new bar, crams 5 TB into a tiny hard drive\nThere’s little to go by in regard to the actual hardware details of the new drive in Amazon’s product listing. However, it appears to be a rebranded version of Seagate’s Backup Plus Slim portable hard drive , which connects via a USB 3.0 port (USB 2.0 too), and works with both Windows PCs and Macs, the latter of which need the included NTFS driver.\nHere are the specs we managed to scrape up:\nModel number: STFX1000400 Capacity: 1TB Interface: USB 3.0 Number of hard drive platters: 2 Speed: 5,400 RPM Size: 4.47”(L) x 2.99”(W) x 0,38”(D) Weight: 0.33 pounds Transfer rate: Up to 220MB per second The drive uses perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR ) technology to store data on its two spinning magnetic discs (platters). This type of data recording provides more storage density than the traditional “longitudinal” recording. Imagine each magnetic disc as an optical disc or a vinyl record with thousands of invisible tracks storing millions of bits on each track. The perpendicular recording method places data bits pointed up or down perpendicular to the disk surface whereas the longitudinal method places the bits “circumferentially” along the track direct.\nOnce customers connect the new Seagate Duet drive to their Windows PC or Mac, the device automatically pulls up their Amazon account. After the login process, it will then begin syncing photos, music, pictures, and other personal data the user already has stored in Amazon’s cloud. At the same time, all files saved/moved to the external drive are automatically copied to Amazon Drive as well. What’s great with this solution is that media and files placed into the Amazon Drive app for smartphones and tablets will end up on the external drive too.\n“Accessing stored files, photos, and videos while away from the Seagate Duet drive is also easy using the Amazon Drive mobile app,” Seagate said . “This phone and tablet app gives access to photos and videos saved on the Seagate Duet drive and in the cloud. This way, it’s possible to relive the best moments with loved ones wherever and whenever.”\nCustomers who pre-order the Seagate Duet drive now from Amazon will receive free shipping. Gift-wrapping is also available for those who want to throw it under the Christmas tree later this month.\nSeagate’s Backup Plus Portable sets a new bar, crams 5 TB into a tiny hard drive Seagate’s Game Drive for Xbox SSD enables faster load times for seamless gaming Seagate revealed the world’s largest tiny hard drive with 5TB in 2.5 inches",

      "text": "Walmart's new gas-and-grocery hybrids could become a major threat to Amazon and Kroger (WMT) Published by Business Insider on Sat, 03 Dec 2016 Walmart is opening a new kind of gas stationthat offers more than just coffee, snacks, and fuel.The convenience stores, called Walmart Pickup and Fuel, also offer same-day pickup for groceries ordered online.There are only two locations right nowone in Huntsville, Alabama and the other in Thornton, Coloradobut if expanded, they could make Walmart an even bigger threat to companies like Amazonand Kroger that are betting big on the growth of online grocery shopping.The new storesoffergrab-and-go items, including hot sandwiches, healthy snacks, drinks, and a coffee bar, as well as basics like milk, eggs, and bread, according to Walmart. They are open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.For a wider selection of grocery items, online grocery pickup is available at the stores between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Customers can order groceries before 1 p.m. and pick them up that same day, after 5 p.m.Walmart employees pick and pack the groceries ata nearby Walmart supercenter, and load them into customers' cars at the Walmart Pickup and Fuel for free.Walmart already offers online grocery pickup at hundreds of stores. But this new store concept is meant to make that process easier and more convenient, thanks in part to the small size of the stores and parking lots.The conceptsounds eerilysimilar toa new kind of storethat Amazon is planning to launch.Amazonhas plans to roll out 20 grocery stores by the end of 2018. The stores will have different formats, but half of them will likely be \"click-and-collect\" drive-up spots for Amazon customers to pick up their online ordersjust like Walmart's new Pickup and Fuel stores.The other half of Amazon's new stores could look likeminiature versions of traditional grocery stores.Kroger has also been investing heavily in online grocery. The company offers online grocery pickup at more than 500 stores. But unlike Walmart, Kroger charges a fee for picking up online orders, which is about $4.95 per order in Richmond, Virginia.SEE ALSO:We went to Walmart for Black Friday ' and it was nothing like we expectedJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: 7 things you shouldn't buy on Black Friday",

      "title": "Alexa Is Getting Smarter: Amazon Voice Assistant Upgrades Skills From 100 To More Than 5,000",
      "text": "Amazon has announced that Alexa will be getting smarter in the next few weeks. The improvement to Alexa means that the intelligent personal assistant will not ask users needless questions as before. ( Amazon ) Advertisement \nAmazon's intelligent personal assistant Alexa is getting smarter as hundreds of new commands will be integrated to the system soon. \nThe voice interaction system from Amazon has assisted users since 2014 by playing music, creating lists, providing traffic and weather information, setting alarms and more. Prior to Black Friday 2017 , Amazon also announced Alexa-exclusive deals to help people shop on Amazon with voice commands. Alexa Is Getting Better \nBefore, Alexa was able to manage just 15 command categories called \"intents,\" which are used with voice commands. Intents allow Alexa to understand basic voice inquiries from users. Amazon has confirmed that in the coming weeks the company will add hundreds of new intents, slots and commands to the Alexa Skills Kit. However, these will be available for use only in the United States initially. It is likely that the command library will also be made available to users in other parts of the world in the near term. \nThe Alexa Skills Kit comprises tools that developers can use for creating skills. The inclusion of new intents and slots will streamline skill building, which will save time for developers. \nWhen users ask Alexa different questions, Amazon keeps track of how the intelligent assistant understands and then responds to queries. Amazon wants to improve on Alexa's natural language understanding. \nAmazon suggests that the number of skills in the Alexa Skills Marketplace has increased from about 100 at the beginning of 2016 to more than 5,000. Alexa Will Not Ask Too Many Questions \nAmazon also revealed that the company wants Alexa to have improved ideas on what a user is asking and not to ask as many clarifying questions. \n\"From a conversational aspect, I think there [are] a lot of trade-offs on doing it right. Alexa shouldn't come back and ask you [needless] questions. That would be really frustrating. But Alexa should always ask a question when needed, and the ability to have a conversation is super important as well,\" said Rohit Prasad, the vice president of Alexa at Amazon, in an interview with Backchannel. Alexa And Smart Homes \nThe concept of smart homes has been gaining traction in the last few years. Alexa-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo , Amazon Tap and Amazon Echo Dot work with a number of home products that users can control via voice commands, such as thermostats, lights, switches and more. \n\"Ask Alexa to switch on a lamp, turn on the fan, dim the lights or increase the temperature. Some products work directly with Alexa and other smart home ecosystems require a compatible hub,\" says Amazon. \nAs the demand for smart homes increases, the functional capability of Alexa-enabled devices is also expected to improve and Amazon will have to ensure that Alexa understands a wide range of commands to impress users.
