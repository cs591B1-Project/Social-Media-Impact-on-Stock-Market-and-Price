It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted \" but failed \" to see the company sold. Twitter's stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine. About Us",

      "text": "Business Twitter says COO Adam Bain to leave, Noto to take his place Adam Bain, Twitter's president of global revenue, stands in a conference room at his company's San Francisco headquarters. Photo: Reuters Published: 6:40 AM, November 10, 2016 Updated: 8:10 AM, November 10, 2016 \nSAN FRANCISCO - Twitter Inc said on Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, widely credited with building a robust advertising business at the company even as it struggled with user growth, is leaving to explore other opportunities. \n\"Mr. Bain will remain at Twitter in the coming weeks to assist with the transition of the chief operating officer role,\" the company said. \nThe move is a blow for struggling Twitter, which has hired bankers to field acquisition offers but has seen a dearth of potential bidders. The company said last month it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down. \nTwitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. \nNoto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business as well as Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue and built an advertising sales machine that generated some $2.2 billion last year. A popular executive who was once considered a possible chief executive for the company, Bain was named COO in October last year. \n\"I think Adam Bain is the most competent person at Twitter,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \"The one part of the business that actually worked was the part he works on, which is advertising.\" \nIn announcing his departure on Twitter, Bain heaped praise on CEO Jack Dorsey and added: \"I'm excited to take w me everything I've experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!\" \nTwitter has assumed a central role in public conversations around the world and U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump made it a centerpiece of his controversial election campaign. \nBut the company has struggled to make the service appealing to a broad audience and has been unable to address problems with abuse and harassment on the platform, which unlike rival Facebook allows people to remain anonymous. \nWith user growth stagnant at a little over 300 million compared to 1.7 billion for Facebook, Twitter has seen its stock price plunge to below $18 from a peak of $69 in early 2014. The company went public at $26 in 2013. \nCompanies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc considered an acquisition of Twitter earlier this year, sources said, but all three decided not to pursue a deal. \nTwitter has long had turmoil in the executive suite and a number of executives have departed since Dorsey returned as permanent CEO last year. \nPachter said he believed the latest moves were part of Twitter's efforts to sell itself. Noto is highly regarded on Wall Street, he noted. REUTERS",

      "text": "Home > Technology > America Votes 2016 Facebook and Twitter contend with their role in Trump's victory Facebook Inc will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four per cent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. PHOTO: AFP Nov 10, 2016 9:08 AM \n[SAN FRANCISCO] America just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it. \nFacebook Inc will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four per cent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. \nThe proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organisations. \nThose stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. \n\"This is a landmark,\" he said. \n\"Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didn't really have the influence.\" \nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: \"While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information - and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\" \nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company's role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the company's news feed was responsible for fuelling \"highly partisan, fact-light media outlets\" that propelled Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency. \n\"News feed optimises for engagement,\" Mr Goodlatte wrote. \n\"As we've learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.\" \nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. \nIn response to Mr Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: \"News feed isn't perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.\" \nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analysing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasise media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family. \nThe company's public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the \"invention\" of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n\"We can't read everything and check everything,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. \n\"So what we've done is we've allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.\" \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. \nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Mr Trump win, but Twitter Inc gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Mrs Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Mr Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. \n\"I can't think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,\" Mr Wasserman said. \nTwitter's shares rose 4.1 per cent Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasn't all been good for the company. As Mr Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. \nThese trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Mr Trump's critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter's inability to effectively address abuse on its platform - a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site. \nTwitter's executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. \n\"We have the world talking on this thing about the world,\" Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. \n\"So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.\" \nTwitter, like Facebook, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: \"For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?\" \nBLOOMBERG ",

The latest in line is Adam Bain, Chief Operating Officer and long time head of advertising sales. Not surprisingly, Bain took to Twitter to announce his decision via a flurry of tweets. It all started off with a couple of tweets that read, “So…I have some news. After 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.” Bain’s departure comes amid a difficult time for Twitter.

      "text": "Twitter chief operating officer steps down Twitter chief financial officer Anthony Noto to take over the job, serving in a dual role Published 12:25 PM, November 10, 2016 Updated 12:25 PM, November 10, 2016 RESIGNATION POST. Adam Bain announces his decision to step down on the social network owned by the company he's leaving. \nSAN FRANCISCO, USA – Just weeks after reporting job cuts and a disappointing fiscal quarter , Twitter announced Wednesday, Nov 9, that chief operating officer Adam Bain is leaving the company. \nTwitter chief financial officer Anthony Noto will take over Bain's job, serving in both posts until the board hires a new chief financial officer, the struggling social network said. \n\"Since joining Twitter in 2010, Adam has built an amazing team and a global business from the ground up,\" Twitter co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement. \n\"I'm grateful to Adam for everything he's done for Twitter, and for his leadership and friendship over the years.\" \nNoto, who became Twitter CFO in July 2014, will take over responsibility for revenue-generating operations along with partnerships. Bain was to remain for several weeks to help with the transition. \n\"I am honored by the trust that Jack has placed in me to take on this new role,\" said Noto. \nBain announced the move on his Twitter account as well. \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.</p>&mdash; adam bain (@adambain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambain/status/796473439317954560\">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>{/source} \nTwitter late last month reported a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30 of $103 million, compared with a $132 million loss a year earlier. Revenues meanwhile grew 8% year-over-year to $616 million, most of that from advertising. \nThe key metric of monthly active users rose only modestly to 317 million from 313 million in the prior quarter – a growth pace that has prompted concerns over Twitter's ability to keep up in the fast-moving world of social media. \nThe announced job cuts would amount to about 350 positions based on the Twitter website's headcount of 3,860 employees worldwide. \nTwitter said the restructuring \"is intended to create greater focus and efficiency to enable Twitter's goal of driving toward (net) profitability in 2017.\" \nEven though Twitter has never posted a profit, Dorsey said the latest quarterly results show upbeat signs. \nThe company suggested it could reach profitability for the first time in 2017. \nAnalysts however remain skeptical about Twitter's outlook for expansion, expressing concerns about its ability to entice users beyond its core base. \nTwitter shares were down more than 3% at $18.54 in after-market trades on Wednesday.

      "text": "Twitter executive Adam Bain heading out as company falters Associated Press / 02:32   \nNEW YORK — Twitter’s chief operating officer is leaving the company, the latest high-profile departure from the troubled communication service. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter said Wednesday that Adam Bain is stepping down and will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted — but failed — to see the company sold. Twitter’s stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. ADVERTISEMENT \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine.",

The company said last month it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down. \nTwitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. \nNoto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business as well as Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue and built an advertising sales machine that generated some $2.2 billion last year. A popular executive who was once considered a possible chief executive for the company, Bain was named COO in October last year. \n\"I think Adam Bain is the most competent person at Twitter,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \"The one part of the business that actually worked was the part he works on, which is advertising.\" \nIn announcing his departure on Twitter, Bain heaped praise on CEO Jack Dorsey and added: \"I'm excited to take w me everything I've experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!\" \nTwitter has assumed a central role in public conversations around the world and US President-elect Donald J Trump made it a centrepiece of his controversial election campaign. \nBut the company has struggled to make the service appealing to a broad audience and has been unable to address problems with abuse and harassment on the platform, which unlike rival Facebook allows people to remain anonymous. \nWith user growth stagnant at a little over 300 million compared to 1.7 billion for Facebook, Twitter has seen its stock price plunge to below $18 from a peak of $69 in early 2014. The company went public at $26 in 2013. \nCompanies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc considered an acquisition of Twitter earlier this year, sources said, but all three decided not to pursue a deal. \nTwitter has long had turmoil in the executive suite and a number of executives have departed since Dorsey returned as permanent CEO last year. \nPachter said he believed the latest moves were part of Twitter's efforts to sell itself. Noto is highly regarded on Wall Street, he noted.",

      "text": "Twitter executive Adam Bain heading out as company falters Updated 10 hrs ago ( … ) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Twitter's chief operating officer is leaving the company, the latest high-profile departure from the troubled communication service. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter said Wednesday that Adam Bain is stepping down and will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted — but failed — to see the company sold. Twitter's stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine. Tags",

In a series of tweets, he said he was moving onto “something new outside the company” but didn’t divulge further details.\nAfter 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.\n— adam bain (@adambain) November 9, 2016\nBain also thanked co-founders Ev Williams, Biz Stone, and Jack Dorsey, the current chief executive officer. Dick Costolo, who served as CEO from 2010 to 2015, was also included in Bain’s note of gratitude. Bain left the company of his own will.\nAnthony Noto, Twitter’s CFO, is assuming the COO role, and will be in charge of all revenue, sales, global partnerships, and business development. He’s been leading Twitter’s live video efforts, and will continue to serve as CFO while the company searches for his successor.\n“Since joining Twitter in 2010, Adam has built an amazing team and a global business from the ground up,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement to Quartz. “I’m grateful to Adam for everything he’s done for Twitter, and for his leadership and friendship over the years.”\nBain, who came to Twitter from Fox, was extremely well liked by his colleagues, and is credited with building the company’s multi-billion dollar advertising business.\nThe microblogging site’s stock was down nearly 3% in after-hours trading.\nLast month, Twitter laid off 9% of its workforce—many of the cuts were in the sales and marketing division under Bain—and killed off the popular six-second video sharing platform Vine. The company also vowed to present a game plan to curb harassment on the platform, which is yet to be released. Meanwhile, the company’s performance continues to disappoint. User growth and revenue have both been tapering off over the years and money-making seems far off.\nNumerous leaders around the globe have left amid the restructuring efforts: Karen Stocks, the company’s Australia managing director, departed on Oct. 28; India head Rishi Jaitly stepped down on Nov. 1; and Parminder Singh, managing director for the south Asia region followed soon after.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Just weeks after reporting job cuts and a disappointing fiscal quarter, Twitter announced Wednesday that chief operating officer Adam Bain is leaving the company. Twitter chief financial officer Anthony Noto will take over Mr Bain’s job, serving in both posts until the board hires a new chief financial officer, the struggling social network said. “Since joining Twitter in 2010, Adam has built an amazing team and a global business from the ground up,” Twitter co-founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement.\n“I’m grateful to Adam for everything he’s done for Twitter, and for his leadership and friendship over the years.” Mr Noto, who became Twitter CFO in July 2014, will take over responsibility for revenue-generating operations along with partnerships. Bain was to remain for several weeks to help with the transition.”I am honored by the trust that Jack has placed in me to take on this new role,” said Mr Noto.\nTwitter late last month reported a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30 of $103 million, compared with a $132 million loss a year earlier. Revenues meanwhile grew eight percent year-over-year to $616 million, most of that from advertising.\nThe key metric of monthly active users rose only modestly to 317 million from 313 million in the prior quarter — a growth pace that has prompted concerns over Twitter’s ability to keep up in the fast-moving world of social media. The announced job cuts would amount to about 350 positions based on the Twitter website’s headcount of 3,860 employees worldwide.\nTwitter said the restructuring “is intended to create greater focus and efficiency to enable Twitter’s goal of driving toward (net) profitability in 2017.” Even though Twitter has never posted a profit, Mr Dorsey said the latest quarterly results show upbeat signs. The company suggested it could reach profitability for the first time in 2017. Analysts however remain skeptical about Twitter’s outlook for expansion, expressing concerns about its ability to entice users beyond its core base. Twitter shares were down more than three percent at $18.54 in after-market trades on Wednesday.\nAFP \nThe post Twitter COO Adam Bain to leave the company; CFO Anthony Noto to take over his role appeared first on Tech2 .",

EPA/CJ GUNTHER \n  US President-elect Donald Trump's claim to the throne was a shock to many around the world, and supporters of his rival, Hillary Clinton , wasted no time taking to the streets and to social media to show their indignation. \nSoon, the hashtag #TrumpProtest – referring to several on-ground protests across the US after Trump's victory, most notably outside the Trump Towers in New York City – trended on Twitter worldwide. \nMany used the hashtag in a positive way, hoping to lend inspiration to fellow disappointed voters and show what was happening at the rallies.

And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it. \nFacebook Inc. will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. \n“This is a landmark,” he said. “Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didn’t really have the influence.” \nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.” \nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company’s role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the company’s news feed was responsible for fueling “highly partisan, fact-light media outlets” that propelled Donald Trump’s ascension to the presidency. “News feed optimizes for engagement,” Goodlatte wrote. “As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.” \nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: “News feed isn’t perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.” \nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family. The company’s public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the “invention” of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n“We can’t read everything and check everything,” Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. “So what we’ve done is we’ve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.” \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. \nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc. gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. “I can’t think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,” Wasserman said. \nTwitter’s shares rose 4.1% on Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasn’t all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trump’s critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter’s inability to effectively address abuse on its platform — a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site. \nTwitter’s executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. \n“We have the world talking on this thing about the world,” chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. “So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.” \nTwitter didn’t respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: “For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?” Bloomberg",

      "text": "Stock futures moved higher Thursday as investors cheered Donald Trump's presidential victory. Meanwhile, Twitter's ( TWTR ) Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain is stepping down. He will be replaced by Twitter's Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. Jack Dorsey remains CEO. Shares were lower in premarket trading. The company announced deep layoffs back in October as it struggles with growing users and monetization. Meanwhile, will Verizon ( VZ ) pull away from its pending $4.8 billion acquisition of Yahoo! ( YHOO ) ? Yahoo! raised that possibility in a quarterly filing, saying Verizon may try to terminate or renegotiate the deal. This as a major data breach of some 500 million Yahoo! accounts came to light in September, after Verizon agreed to the purchase price. The breach reportedly occurred some two years ago. Macy's ( M ) and Kohl's ( KSS )  release quarterly earnings before the markets open, while The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) is out with results after the markets close. TheStreet's Scott Gamm reports from the Nasdaq.",

      "text": "Published November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print File Photo \nBy Mark Joyella, TV Newser \n\nFox News chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch has congratulated staff at Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network for “phenomenal coverage” on Election Night. “We set the gold standard in the industry with our fine journalism, smart analysis and the most sophisticated screens on television,” Murdoch wrote.\nFor the entire night (7 p.m. through 3 a.m. ET), Fox News was the most-watched cable news network, with more than 12 million viewers. “This was the highest rated election night ever for both networks,” Murdoch said.\nHere’s Murdoch’s full memo:\nColleagues, \nPlease join me in congratulating the entire team at FOX News Channel and FOX Business Network on last night’s phenomenal coverage. We set the gold standard in the industry with our fine journalism, smart analysis and the most sophisticated screens on television. After receiving universal praise from both sides of the aisle throughout the election cycle, our most important audience — the viewers — validated those sentiments and watched both networks until 3am eastern time in record numbers — nearly 13 million viewers for FOX News and one million viewers for FOX Business, which tripled CNBC. This was the highest rated election night ever for both networks. \nThank you to everyone for making last night one of proudest moments in the history of FOX News Channel and FOX Business Network, and most of all, thank you for all of the immense time, effort and dedication you have put forth over the last two years.\nRegards, \nRead the full story at Adweek.com→",

(Alain Herzog/EPFL) \nLONDON –   Swiss scientists have helped monkeys with spinal cord injuries regain control of non-functioning limbs in research which might one day lead to paralyzed people being able to walk again.\nThe scientists, who treated the monkeys with a neuroprosthetic interface that acted as a wireless bridge between the brain and spine, say they have started small feasibility studies in humans to trial some components.\n\"The link between the decoding of the brain and the stimulation of the spinal cord - to make this communication exist - is completely new,\" said Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at the Lausanne University Hospital who surgically placed the brain and spinal cord implants in the monkey experiments.\n\"For the first time, I can imagine a completely paralyzed patient able to move their legs through this brain-spine interface.\"\nGregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) which led the work, cautioned that there are major challenges ahead and \"it may take several years before this intervention can become a therapy for humans.\"\nMore on this...

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The NFL has seen two of its games end in ties this season, which didn't exactly make many fans or players happy. That sentiment is easy to understand, considering players prepare all week and battle for 75 minutes only to come out of the game the same way they went into it: tied.\nHowever, that doesn't mean everyone is against ties in the NFL. Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis -- whose team tied the Redskins in Week 8 -- is perfectly fine with the way overtime is structured.\n#Bengals HC Marvin Lewis on OT rule: When you play 100 plays, that's enough football...I'm fine with regular season rule the way it is\n— SiriusXM NFL Radio (@SiriusXMNFL) November 10, 2016 More from FoxSports Tony Romo has taught Dak Prescott 'everything' to be successful Thursday Night Football: Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns Here's why Dak Prescott is more valuable than Ezekiel Eliott | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Whitlock 1-on-1: Joel Klatt thinks Deshaun Watson is the next Dak Prescott | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF He has a point. The longer games go on, the bigger the effect it has on a team's next game. It wears down players and leads to bad football as a result. This is particularly evident when teams have to play a game on a short week, such as a Thursday or Monday night game.\nThe NFL isn't likely to change its overtime rules despite the displeasure expressed by some for Lewis' very reason. Players can't take the toll of being out there for more than 100 snaps, nor should they have to.",

Follow @rawstory \nStudents at a western New York college are alarmed after they found a black doll hung in effigy on campus — and they wondered whether racial harassment will grow worse with the election of Donald Trump. \nThe doll hanging from a noose was discovered Wednesday in an elevator at Canisius College in Buffalo, where the student government has promised to address the incident, reported WKBW-TV . \nA black student-athlete told the TV station he was considering leaving the campus, saying he’d experienced similar racist bullying since enrolling at Canisius, where 71.9 percent of students are white and 6.9 percent are black. \nThe college president said Canisius would investigate the incident and punish anyone responsible for the “stupid act.” \nSeveral students told the TV station they feared racial harassment would grow worse with the election of Trump as president. \nAbout 90 miles away, in Wellsville, New York, residents painted over swastika graffiti found on a baseball dugout in town. \nA man walking his dog Wednesday spotted the swastika painted on the cinder block structure at Quackenbush Field, along with the words, “Make America white again,” reported The Daily Reporter . \nThe man called the newspaper to report the graffiti, but police said they had not received any complaints but would investigate, anyway. \nThe police chief said charges would not be filed unless a complaint were made, because the ball field was private property. \n“We’ll take a look at it, we might do a log entry,” said Tim O’Grady, the village police chief. “Unless somebody makes a complaint, we don’t have any cause for action. It’s vandalism, we’ll look into it.” \nSwastika graffiti, including the words, “Sieg heil 2016,” was also spotted on a building Wednesday in Philadelphia. This baby doll was found in a freshman elevator last night at Canisius.

In fact, its statement that it “is assessing the most advanced players in the sector” suggests it’s not quite sure.\nThe price is also unknown, but the company’s current model range -- all powered by those iconic, revvy single-cylinder engines with their signature exhaust note -- runs from around $3,500 to $7,500.\n \nShort Spin: 2017 Honda Grom | https://t.co/NREmnQG5UM \n— Fox Car Report (@FoxCarReport) November 10, 2016",

      "text": "Published November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Erick Erickson  \nPublished November 10, 2016  | FoxNews.com \nEditor's note: The following column originally appeared on TheResurgent.com. \n\nFor eight years the left has refused to hold itself accountable. Having once declared dissent patriotic, dissent for the last eight years has been homophobic, bigoted, and racist. Conservatives and people of faith have been hounded from their jobs, silenced, and punished for refusing to go along with the left’s agenda. The left demanded cultural homogeneity and is outraged that Americans refuse to go along with their anti-Christian secular agenda.\nOn Tuesday, Americans had enough and decided to seek fundamental change.\nToday, the left is protesting in the streets because of American democratic action. The left accuses Donald Trump of totalitarianism, but it is the left refusing to accept a democratic act. The left blasted Trump for suggesting the election was rigged. But they are okay with protesting a fair election and declaring it illegitimate because they hate the outcome.\nFor eight years I have watched parts of the right descend to madness as they presumed the worst about their opponents. Parts of the right had become convinced that the Clintons kill people and Barack Obama would refuse to vacate the White House. During all this, the left became convinced, by their own rhetorical overreach, that conservatives want to put black people back on plantations, castrate gays, and forcibly impregnate women.\nA week ago the Democratic Party insisted that everyone accept the legitimacy of the election. What we are seeing today is that much of the left think that, like so many other things, it is a one way street.\nWednesday night, their chickens came home to roost. Professional leftwing activists who have no skill other than agitation have trained a large group of people to do nothing but protest. Instead of trying to unite the country, they have flown into hysterics and temper tantrums.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "By Viknesh Vijayenthiran \nPublished November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print  (Roush) \nStill disappointed by Ford Motor Company’s [NYSE:F] decision to equip its  2017 F-150 Raptor with a V-6 ?\nDon’t sweat it because there are a handful of reputable tuning shops that offer F-150-based performance pickups packing V-8 grunt.\nAmong them is semi-official Ford tuner Roush, which at last week’s 2016 SEMA show unveiled its 2017 F-150 Nitemare.\nYears ago, Roush teamed up with Ford for a  prior version of the Nitemare F-150 . That one came with a supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 delivering 445 horsepower and 500 pond-feet of torque. For the 2017 F-150 Nitemare, Roush turned to a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 good for 600 hp and 557 lb-ft of torque.\nCouple the supercar-like output with the lightweight aluminum construction of the latest F-150 and you can imagine just how quick this steed will be. According to Roush, it will hit 60 mph from rest in just 4.2 seconds, making it, the tuner says, the “quickest factory street truck in the world.”\nOther mods include a high-flow exhaust system, a custom grille and front bumper cover, and 20-inch forged wheels with performance rubber. Customers will be able to select two- or four-wheel drive, and for those seeking true off-road capability Roush has  a few mods for that too . For example, one could add a full Fox suspension system and Mickey Thompson tires.\nPricing and availability details are yet to be announced.\nFor more SEMA  coverage, head to Motor Authority's  dedicated hub.",

Twitter has struggled recently to expand its user base and drive revenue, and it has never had an annual profit. (Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images) Samantha Masunaga ’s chief operating officer announced he is leaving the company, adding to the microblogging firm’s recent struggles.\nAdam Bain tweeted the news Wednesday, saying that after “six years and a once-in-a-lifetime run,” he told Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey that he was “ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.” \nTwitter said Bain will be replaced by the company’s current chief financial officer, Anthony Noto. Bain will help with the transition “over the coming weeks,” and the company said it has started to look for a new chief financial officer. \n“I have nothing but love for this unbelievable company & product,” Bain tweeted. “It’s been a privilege to have played a role in helping build something so special.” \n“I look at what we’ve built together and how far we’ve come, and I feel like I can leave the company now in a place of strength,” Bain continued. \nHe gave no details on what he might do next, telling Twitter followers to “stay tuned.” \nIn his own tweet, Dorsey said he had “much love and respect” for Bain, describing him as a “mentor, a partner and family forever.” \nBain’s departure comes at a difficult time for the San Francisco tech company. \nTwitter has struggled recently to expand its user base and drive revenue, and it has never had an annual profit. The company has tried to increase its live-streamed sports coverage by signing deals with the NBA and Pac-12 Networks, though analysts have said those plans were unlikely to attract new users. \nLast month, Twitter said it would shut down Vine , a video app the company bought about four years ago. Though popular, analysts said Vine — which allows users to create and view endlessly looping six-second videos — was too limiting for advertisers. \nTwitter has also long been the subject of takeover rumors. In September, the company was reportedly eyed by firms such as Google Inc., Walt Disney Co. and cloud-computing software firm Salesforce.com Inc., but no deal emerged.

      "text": "More » \nIt's odd to hear stand-up comic, actor, artist, and musician Demetri Martin refer to himself as a \"one-liner\" comedian. While it's true that his most recent standup special, Live (At The Time) is a collection of lines like, \"I have an 'L' shaped sofa. Lowercase,\" many of Martin's most memorable moments (whether it's onstage, as a correspondent on The Daily Show or on his own Comedy Central show Important Things with Demetri Martin ) prominently feature his guitar playing along with his drawings and animations. But in his own mind, he still regards himself as a Steven-Wright-inspired comic who rattles off a series of brief-but-memorable bon mots. \n\"I started with one-liners, and I still gravitate towards that,\" Martin says. \"Sometimes I vary up how I deliver them; I play guitar with them or put drawings with others, but I must've used 120 jokes or something like that on the Netflix special.\" \nAnd as far as Martin is concerned, that collection of jokes is gone for good. He feels like the time when a comedian could slowly create an hour of material by workshopping jokes in front of an audience is gone. \"People can go look them up online,\" he says. \"Sometimes it feels like people even watch them right before they come and see me. That, for a lot of us, means we really have to write new stuff faster, especially if you want to be on the road with it. So I'm working on a new batch of jokes and drawings.\" \nIn fact, for a while, he considered Twitter the bane of his existence, for various reasons. \"I would try a joke for the first time and people were already tweeting it,\" he says. \"It's so easy for people to do that. A lot of comedians have trouble with that because you're building your new hour and people have a chance to broadcast it before you're really finished with it. It's a humbling thing, because we need audiences to develop our work. Musicians might need that too, but it seems to me that you could write an album in your house without anybody hearing it and then release an hour of music that no one's ever heard before. But with stand-up, someone's heard it along the way. That does puncture that intimacy.\" \nBut it was also a problem because it made a lot of other comedians who typically did longer bits into interlopers on his territory. \"Twitter, I think, has made a lot of comics into one-liner comics because of the character limit,\" he says. \"So that was kind of a bummer for me because I felt like, 'Jeez, I've been doing one liners for a long time and now everyone's doing it.'\" \nAs a response to that trend, Martin has also started to improvise a lot more, which might be surprising to those who have seen his older performances. His delivery is so offbeat and singular that it's difficult to imagine him interrupting his rhythm to try something new. \"I like that because it keeps it fresh,\" he says. \"It's become more fun for me than telling jokes because it's more like making jokes with the audience. It feels like more of a conversation with the audience. The jokes are still there but there are nice breaks where it makes it a little more present. I felt less precious about someone sharing that because it's different every night. It mitigated some of the stress.\" \nIt might seem like a big risk to work without a net onstage, but Martin says that after 15 years of stand-up comedy, he's reached just the right level of fame to improvise well with his audience. \"I'm lucky, because even if I don't draw the biggest crowds, people are excited to see me and what I do,\" he says. \"It's a nice thing when you get to that place where you're not doing a show where people don't know what to expect. They're giving you the benefit of the doubt for a window of your time when you're onstage. I'm grateful for that. It's pretty validating.\" \nWhile on the road, Martin tries to stay disciplined, writing and drawing as much as possible. And that discipline has resulted in his first movie, Dean , a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. \"It going to be coming out in the spring,\" he says. \"I got Kevin Kline to play my father in it, which was great because I'm a fan of his. And it was really fun working with him. It's a comedy but it's kind of dramatic in some ways. I worked really hard on it. When you decide that you want to write and direct something and put it on camera, there's a lot of hubris in that. You've raised the stakes in a lot of ways. I found that it really compelled me to work my ass off to not embarrass myself.\"",

No buyer has stepped up for the social media company despite a record month in October for U.S. merger and acquisition announcements by value. The month saw the biggest tie-up proposal of the year in AT&T 's more than $85 billion tie-up with Time Warner. \n\"It's going to go through a lot of regulatory screening. It's beyond just Mr. [Donald] Trump. And the market expectation that this deal may or may not happen, materialize, is not very high,\" Alwaleed said. \n\"I understand it's a vertical integration, not horizontal, but still, I think it's going to go some deep scrutiny by the regulators in the United States,\" he said. \nAlwaleed is chairman of Kingdom Holding, whose top investments include Time Warner , Twitter , Citi , Apple and eBay , according to the firm's website. \nThe Saudi prince also told CNBC he was more positive about Trump , saying the real estate mogul would likely be different in office than as a candidate. \nOf his other investments, Alwaleed said Apple \"delivered very good results,\" but the market wants more from its management. \n\nHe said Citi is back to becoming \"a money-making machine\" given \"capable\" management and the potential for rising interest rates, adding the stock could rise to $60 or $70 a share. Shares of the bank were 2.4 percent higher, above $52 a share, in midday trading. \nThe Saudi billionaire also said \"Snapchat is a very good company.\" But at least for now, he said, \"I don't use Facebook or Snapchat. I only use Twitter.\"\n\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

By: Reuters | Published: November 10, 2016 4:18 AM Microblogging platform Twitter Inc has said Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain would leave the company to explore other opportunities. (Reuters) \nMicroblogging platform Twitter Inc has said Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain would leave the company to explore other opportunities. Twitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. \nNoto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business, and will manage Twitter’s global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and was named COO in October last year. \nThe popular but money-losing microblogging service has spent aggressively on product development and marketing in recent years. \nTwitter had hired bankers to field acquisition offers, but it has seen a dearth of potential bidders. \nSalesforce.com Inc, the last of a small cohort of companies including Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc believed to have been interested, said recently it would not pursue a deal. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO.

      "text": "Facebook and Twitter contend with their role in Trump's victory By Sarah Frier • Bloomberg ( … ) 123rf.com \nAmerica just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul-searching by the companies that shaped it. \nFacebook will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: False stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. \n\"This is a landmark,\" he said. \"Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact-checking, didn't really have the influence.\" \nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \"While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information — and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\" \nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company's role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile, said Thursday that the company's news feed was responsible for fueling \"highly partisan, fact-light media outlets\" that propelled Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency. \"News feed optimizes for engagement,\" Goodlatte wrote. \"As we've learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.\" \nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: \"News feed isn't perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.\" \nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts in favor of posts from friends and family. The company's public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the \"invention\" of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n\"We can't read everything and check everything,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. \"So what we've done is we've allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.\" \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. \nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. \"I can't think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,\" Wasserman said.",

      "text": "Published November 10, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) Nick Mangold isn't used to sitting out so long.\nOne game was tough, and so was missing two. Three games? That's a career first that the New York Jets center would rather not experience.\nMangold has a sprained right ankle that is likely to keep him out Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams.\nMore from FoxSports Packers QB Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss Tony Romo has taught Dak Prescott 'everything' to be successful Thursday Night Football: Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns ''It's getting better, slowly but surely,'' Mangold said Thursday. ''It's been frustrating being out this long and letting my guys down on the line and then the offense. I don't like not playing, so it's been difficult, but it seems to be trending where it's going up. So, hopefully it'll keep getting better and we'll get out there as soon as possible.''\nThe seven-time Pro Bowl selection has missed just six games in his 11-year NFL career, but never more than two in a row. A sprained ankle kept him out of two straight in 2011, but a setback with his current injury will probably keep him out for at least three straight.\nMangold was initially hurt on Oct. 23 against Baltimore when a teammate rolled into the back of his leg. He was replaced in that game by Wesley Johnson, who has started the last two in Mangold's place. Mangold remains in a walking boot after briefly getting out of it last week.\n''I was moving around and felt pretty good, and after a while, it wasn't feeling good,'' he said. ''They said we had to put it back in the boot and see if we could get it to calm down again before we start ramping things up again.''\nMangold blamed it on overdoing things when the ankle wasn't yet healed enough.\n''It was probably my own stupidity of trying to do too much too soon,'' he said. ''I'm not very good at listening to doctors. I hear what they say, but I'm not very good at listening.''\nMangold has a reputation of being a tough competitor who has played through various injuries and returned from ailments that appeared initially to possibly sideline him for some time. This one, however, has been different.\n''I've never had to deal with a so-called setback, so that's been difficult,'' he said. ''Usually, I've always trended in the right direction and as soon as I got injured, that next day was the worst I felt and I'd continue to get better. To have that go backward has been difficult. That's just the nature of how this injury has gone. It's something you have to try to work through.''\nThe 32-year-old center insisted he has no doubts that he'll be able to return soon from the injury.\n''Oh, of course. That's a given,'' he said. ''It's just when. Got this week coming up and then the bye week, and it usually helps to get the body healthy. Hopefully I'll be back as soon as possible. When that is, I don't know, but I'm always optimistic that the next week is the week I'll be back in there.''\nIn other injury news, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick practiced on a limited basis for the second straight day with a sprained left knee.\n''He's getting a little better,'' coach Todd Bowles said. ''He's taking some reps. He has to do some more, though.''\nFriday's practice will likely go a long way in helping determine whether Fitzpatrick or second-year QB Bryce Petty will start against the Rams. While some fans and media are clamoring for the Jets to start Petty, Bowles has remained steadfast in that Fitzpatrick will start as long as he's healthy.\n''For me to make a quarterback change, I'd have to have a quarterback controversy,'' Bowles said. ''Ryan is the starter, Bryce is the backup.''\nLinebackers Bruce Carter (quadriceps) and Josh Martin (concussion), tight end Kellen Davis (elbow) and cornerback Marcus Williams (ankle) did not practice. Wide receiver Brandon Marshall (foot), right tackle Breno Giacomini (shoulder), linebacker Darron Lee (ankle), defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson (ankle), cornerback Buster Skrine (knee) and offensive tackle Brandon Shell (shoulder) were all limited.\nNOTES: Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey acknowledged he was uncertain of the distance on third down early in the third quarter of the Jets' 27-23 loss at Miami on Sunday, when New York faced a third-and-1 but went with an empty backfield and Fitzpatrick threw incomplete to RB Matt Forte. ''That's a question that you ask yourself when you go back to it,'' Gailey said. ''You can always do something better that might have made a difference. When the ball goes on the ground, to be honest with you, I thought it was third-and-2. I thought it was third-and-2, 2 1/2 maybe, and then all of a sudden when I look up after I've called the play, it's third-and-1, a little over 1, maybe 1 1/2. I might have made a different call if I thought it was that down and distance.'' ... Bowles said the Jets used C.J. Spiller at kick returner over Jalin Marshall last Sunday because Marshall was playing more snaps on offense. The coach added that Spiller would continue to return kicks against Los Angeles. Spiller, signed last week, returned two kickoffs for 37 yards against the Dolphins.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

      "text": "More \nBy Sarah Frier | Bloomberg   \nAmerica just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul-searching by the companies that shaped it. \nFacebook will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: False stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. \n\"This is a landmark,\" he said. \"Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact-checking, didn't really have the influence.\" \nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \"While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information — and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.\" \nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company's role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile, said Thursday that the company's news feed was responsible for fueling \"highly partisan, fact-light media outlets\" that propelled Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency. \"News feed optimizes for engagement,\" Goodlatte wrote. \"As we've learned in this election, bull---- is highly engaging.\" \nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: \"News feed isn't perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.\" \nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts in favor of posts from friends and family. The company's public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the \"invention\" of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n\"We can't read everything and check everything,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. \"So what we've done is we've allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.\" \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. \nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. \"I can't think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,\" Wasserman said. \nTwitter's shares rose 4.1 percent Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasn't all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trump's critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter's inability to effectively address abuse on its platform — a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site. \nTwitter's executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. \n\"We have the world talking on this thing about the world,\" Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. \"So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.\" \nTwitter didn't respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: \"For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?\" related articles",

But last night, Wall Street Journal reporter Sara Germano tweeted a quote from New Balance’s Vice President of public affairs, reaffirming the Boston-based company’s objection to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and their support of a Trump Presidency.\n\nNew Balance is “the only major American company to make or assemble more than 4 million pairs of athletic footwear per year in the USA,” according to their website. NPD Group shows them leading in both men’s and women’s categories for the independent shoe channel, and second behind UGG brand in children’s. For what it’s worth, New Balance would likely have backed rival candidate Hillary Clinton, too, who reversed her stance on TPP after endorsing it three years ago as President Obama’s Secretary of State. On the campaign trail she, like Trump, opposed the deal, but her so-called flip-flop made some voters nervous that she’d change her position yet again if she made it to the White House.\nRead the full story at Forbes→",

Certainly,\" I wrote here at the Examiner one week ago.\nTurns out we were. I've been skeptical of traditional polling for some time now, but — columnist accountability time — I wasn't skeptical enough this year.\nLooking at the statewide polling averages showing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin nearly out of reach for Donald Trump, I thought it was more likely than not that Hillary Clinton would be president, and would win just over 320 electoral votes. In places that were a toss-up, I bought the Democrats' spin that their ground game would get out their vote. In order for Trump to win, I thought, he'd need states like Nevada, a place where early voting suggested he was weak, and thus he needed an awful lot to break his way in order to win.\nRead the full story at the Washington Examiner→",

      "text": "Twitter's chief operating officer Adam Bain has announced his departure Bain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue He built an advertising sales machine that generated $2.2 billion last year Three companies considered an acquisition of Twitter earlier this year But they all decided not to pursue a deal \nBy Sarah Dean For Mailonline and Reuters \nPublished: 11:27 EST, 10 November 2016 | Updated: 15:56 EST, 10 November 2016 \nTwitter's chief operating officer has announced he is quitting the troubled social media company. \nAdam Bain, widely credited with building a robust advertising business at Twitter even as it struggled with user growth, said on Wednesday he is leaving to explore other opportunities. \nThe move is a blow for struggling Twitter, which has hired bankers to field acquisition offers but has seen a dearth of potential bidders. \nThe company said last month it would cut 9 per cent of its global workforce to keep costs down. \nTwitter shares were down 4.3 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement yesterday. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue and built an advertising sales machine that generated some $2.2billion last year. \nTwitter's chief operating officer Adam Bain has quit the company after six years and having successfully built up its advertising operation \nBain, who joined Twitter after previously serving as President of the Fox Audience Network, said he was 'ready to change gears' \nA popular executive who was once considered a possible chief executive for the company, Bain was named COO in October last year. \n'I think Adam Bain is the most competent person at Twitter,' said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \n'The one part of the business that actually worked was the part he works on, which is advertising.' \nIn announcing his departure on Twitter, Bain said: 'After 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.' \nIn another tweet he said: 'Someone who worked w me said: \"When I wear a Twitter shirt w/the logo on chest, I feel like a superhero.\" For me, this has always been true.' \n'We took an organization and scaled it in every way possible. Most importantly, we did it right - in the right way - in a way that makes us proud,' he said. \nTwitter has long had turmoil in the executive suite and a number of executives have departed since Jack Dorsey (pictured) returned as permanent CEO last year \nBain heaped praise on CEO Jack Dorsey and added: 'I'm excited to take with me everything I've experienced at Twitter… Stay tuned!' \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. \n'Mr. Bain will remain at Twitter in the coming weeks to assist with the transition of the chief operating officer role,' the company said. \nNoto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business as well as Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. \nTwitter has assumed a central role in public conversations around the world and U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump made it a centerpiece of his controversial election campaign. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto (pictured), the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO \nBut the company has struggled to make the service appealing to a broad audience and has been unable to address problems with abuse and harassment on the platform, which unlike rival Facebook allows people to remain anonymous. \nWith user growth stagnant at a little over 300 million compared to 1.7 billion for Facebook, Twitter has seen its stock price plunge to below $18 from a peak of $69 in early 2014. The company went public at $26 in 2013. \nCompanies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc considered an acquisition of Twitter earlier this year, sources said, but all three decided not to pursue a deal. \nTwitter has long had turmoil in the executive suite and a number of executives have departed since Dorsey returned as permanent CEO last year. \nPachter said he believed the latest moves were part of Twitter's efforts to sell itself. Noto is highly regarded on Wall Street, he noted.",

      "text": "Twitter's COO Steps Down (TWTR, CRM) By Rakesh Sharma | November 10, 2016 — 4:08 AM EST \nShares for social media company Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ) dropped in after-hours trading on news that the company’s chief operating officer Adam Bain was stepping down. Anthony Noto, the company’s chief financial officer, will take over the COO’ s job and the company will search for a new CFO. \nBain was responsible for building Twitter’s ad sales business, a division that he started when he joined the company six years ago. Apart from releasing a statement about his move, Bain also took to Twitter to announce his departure in a series of tweets. “We took the company from $0 to billions faster than almost anyone’s done it,” he wrote . \nIn its latest quarter, the company reported revenues of $616 million, an increase of 30 percent from previous year figures. However, a quarter earlier, it had warned that its ad pricing was considered steep as compared to other players in the market. The entry of competitors like Snapchat, which has received top dollar from advertisers for its ability to attract the coveted teen demographic, has further eaten into Twitter’s market share. (See also: 3 Reasons Why Twitter Is An Excellent M&A Play ) FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nThe C-suite at Twitter has also been marked by executive churn since the company’s co-founder Jack Dorsey took over the reins last year. Bain’s departure from the company is the eighth major departure this year. According to a report in tech publication Recode, his division was “hit hard” during the company’s layoffs announced during last quarter’s earnings call. The New York Times wrote his departure was part of a “significant shake-up” at Twitter under Dorsey. As part of that shake-up, Dorsey has slashed costs and introduced new features in the company’s core products. Twitter was also rumored to be the subject of acquisition rumors in September, when several tech behemoths ranging from Salesforce.com Inc. ( CRM ) to Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) were said to be interested in it.

      "text": "Home / News / India / Currency ban backlash? Modi loses 3 lakh Twitter followers in 1 day Currency ban backlash? Modi loses 3 lakh Twitter followers in 1 day November 11, 2016 India , Top Stories Leave a comment \nADITYA MENON \nPime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes seems to have backfired. Besides anger on the streets and confusion in markets, Modi also appears to be facing a backlash on Twitter – a medium where he has ruled the roost for long. \nModi’s twitter following fell by over 3 lakh on 9 November, a day after he made the announcement on national television. \nAccording to data available through the analytical service Twitter Counter, Modi lost 3.13 lakh Twitter followers on Wednesday 9 November. Modi’s Twitter following fell by 3.13 lakh on 9 November. ((Source: Twitter Counter)) \nAccording to Trackalytics, another website which monitors social media analytics, Modi’s Twitter following fell by 3.18 lakh in one day. According to Trackalytics, Modi’s Twitter following fell by 3.18 lakh in one day (Trackalytics) \nWith 23.8 million followers, Modi is the most followed Indian on Twitter, a little ahead of actor Amitabh Bachchan, who has 23.3 million followers. This dip is abnormal as Modi’s following has been constantly increasing. \nIn November itself, Modi’s followers on Twitter have increased by around 25,000 every day. On 8 November, the day of the announcement, the increase was even higher – close to 50,000. But Modi’s announcement on the evening of 8 November that the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will now be illegal tender, seems to have turned the tide. \nTake a look at the following graph which shows a constant increase since September, with this sudden dip on 9 November. Modi’s following has been consistently increasing for the past 2 months, until 9 November. ((Source: Twitter Counter)) \nNormally, the only time such sudden fall in followers takes place is when Twitter removes fake Twitter handles. But that should have led to a decrease in the number of followers for other political leaders as well. That hasn’t been the case. For instance, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s followers and those of Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi have increased in the past couple of days. \nIf the dip in followers is indeed linked to the new demonetisation policy, it is a worrying sign for the BJP. \nIt would be safe to assume that the backlash to the policy outside the virtual world would be much greater. \nA Twitter spokesperson responded to Catch’s story and said that the reduction of followers was due to spam accounts being deleted. The spokesperson, however, did not wish to be named. \nHe/she did not explain why there has been no reduction in the followers of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi in the corresponding period as they too could have been affected by the deletion of spam accounts. \nTwittter also did not respond when Catch asked why such a reduction in the number of Modi’s followers didn’t take place at all in the past two months and that it suddenly happened immediately after the demonetisation announcement. \nWith inputs from Amit Kumar Bajpai and Sahil Bhalla \nCourtesy: Catch News",

Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!” Trump wrote in a tweet Thursday evening. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nThousands of people have been out in the streets across the US, since Trump won the 2016 presidential race with 290 electoral votes, leaving Hillary Clinton officially behind, although she won the popular vote. \nChanting anti-Trump slogans, such as “not my president” or “we reject president-elect” , people have been occupying streets in cities from California to New York, expressing their displeasure with the presidential race’s outcome. Second night of protests sweep nation following election of #DonaldTrump https://t.co/YVHkSGrWe0 pic.twitter.com/qsL7WXitkK \n— RT America (@RT_America) November 11, 2016 \nIn March, when his campaign was in full swing, Trump warned of “riots” if he lost the GOP convention, where he ended up being nominated. \n“I think you’d have riots,” he told CNN at the time, saying that he was “representing many millions of people” and they would be rightfully angry. Trump’s Democratic rival, Clinton secured 228 electoral votes, which is less than required minimum of 270 votes.",

(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP) By Robert Jablon and Andrew Dalton / Associated Press \nLOS ANGELES — President-elect Donald Trump fired back on social media after demonstrators in both red and blue states hit the streets for another round of protests, showing outrage over the Republican’s unexpected win. \nDemonstrations occurred in many cities across the country — Portland, Ore., Chicago, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Florida, California, Maryland, and Kentucky — each drew a few hundred people, less than the thousands that gathered in various protests that surged after it became clear Trump had won Tuesday’s election. \nLate Thursday night, Trump went on Twitter to take on the protesters. Trump tweets: “Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!” Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nThen this morning he said: Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nIn Portland Thursday night hundreds of people marched throughout the city as protests turned violent, with people smashing store windows and lighting off firecrackers. Police declared the protests a riot, said there were people with baseball bats in the crowd and told people via loudspeaker to move on. \nOregon Department of Transportation officials closed portions of Interstate 5 and Interstate 84 in the area intermittently as a precaution. \nIn Denver , protesters managed to shut down Interstate 25 near downtown Denver briefly Thursday night. \nDenver police tweeted around 10 p.m. that demonstrators made their way onto the freeway and traffic was halted in the northbound and southbound lanes. Police say the interstate was reopened about half an hour later as the crowd moved back downtown. \nEarlier protests in Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs on Wednesday and Thursday went off peacefully. \nIn San Francisco’s downtown, high-spirited high school students marched through, chanting “not my president” and holding signs urging a Donald Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived the marchers from the sidelines. \n“As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up,” said Claire Bye, a 15-year-old sophomore at Academy High School. “I’m fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I’m fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people.” \nIn New York City, a large group of demonstrators once again gathered outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue Thursday night. They chanted angry slogans and waved banners baring anti-Trump messages. \n“You got everything straight up and down the line,” demonstrator David Thomas said. “You got climate change, you got the Iran deal. You got gay rights, you got mass deportations. Just everything, straight up and down the line, the guy is wrong on every issue.” \nProtesters briefly shut down interstate highways in Minneapolis and Portland, Ore. In Philadelphia, protesters near City Hall held signs bearing slogans like “Not Our President,”‘‘Trans Against Trump” and “Make America Safe For All.” About 500 people turned out at a protest in Louisville, Kentucky and in Baltimore, hundreds of people marched to the stadium where the Ravens were playing a football game. \nHundreds of protesters demonstrated outside Trump Tower in Chicago and a growing group was getting into some shoving matches with police in Oakland, Calif . \nAnother protest was building in Los Angeles , where 28 people were arrested Wednesday for blocking traffic during a demonstration that also saw vandalism to some buildings and a news truck. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, condemned what he called a “very, very small group of people” that caused problems in that demonstration but said he was proud of the thousands more that peacefully protested. \n“I actually thought it was a beautiful expression of democracy. I think it was a marvelous thing to see the next generation of this country get engaged and involved,” he said at a news conference, adding that at one time in his life he might have joined them. \nAs expected, the demonstrations prompted some social media blowback from Trump supporters accusing protesters of sour grapes or worse, though there were no significant counter-protests. \nTrump supporters said the protesters were not respecting the democratic process. \nAs of Thursday, Democrat Hillary Clinton was leading Trump in votes nationwide 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, but Trump secured victory in the Electoral College.",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print (STATS) - Though South Dakota State has been busy racking up individual records, the Jackrabbits are keeping their focus on an important team goal heading into the final weeks of the regular season.\nNo. 11 South Dakota State hopes to take another step toward making history Saturday when it hosts rival South Dakota in the South Dakota Showdown Series. The Jackrabbits (6-3, 5-1) enter the weekend tied with No. 4 North Dakota State atop the Missouri Valley Football Conference as they chase the first conference title in school history.\n\"We still have our goals in front of us and our goal this week is to be 1-0 and not to think about what that accomplishes down the road,\" SDSU coach John Stiegelmeier said. \"We need to be ready for the rivalry game. We need a great crowd to help us out.\"\nMore from FoxSports Utah running back Joe Williams explains why he left football N'Keal Harry caps wacky 31-yard touchdown for Arizona State (12) Utah pounds Arizona State in bruising 23-point victory Warriors Among Us: Clint Bruce - A Letter to My Father The Jackrabbits rebounded from their first league defeat - 38-21 at Illinois State - last weekend when they pulled away with a big second half for a 49-24 home win over Missouri State. Taryn Christion completed 22 of 37 passes for 324 yards and ran for 25 yards on nine carries to set the school's single-season record with 3,163 yards of total offense.\n\"Taryn is having a great year,\" Stiegelmeier said. \"Our offense is having a great year. He's got some good fat guys in front of him and really good receivers. The fact that he's setting records and looking at more records is a credit to himself but also everybody doing their job.\"\nTight end Dallas Goedert, one of those offensive stars, had seven catches for 113 yards and a touchdown against the Bears. Jake Wieneke set the MVFC career mark for receiving yards with 3,899 after adding six receptions for 114. Goedert and Wieneke each crossed the 1,000-yard mark on the season, becoming the first Jackrabbit tandem to accomplish that feat in the same year.\nSDSU, which leads the conference in total offense with 471.9 yards per game, seems likely to continue putting up big numbers against a South Dakota defense that allows a league-high 463.6 per contest.\nAfter a promising 3-1 start in conference play, the Coyotes (4-5, 3-3) have dropped their last two games by a combined eight points. South Dakota's rally from a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit fell short in Saturday's 35-28 loss at Southern Illinois.\n\"We have to avoid putting ourselves into positions where we're down early in games because against the quality of teams that we play in this league, it's hard to battle back,\" South Dakota coach Bob Nielson said. \"Obviously, for us, we have to get back on the winning track.\"\nQuarterback Chris Streveler, a junior transfer from Minnesota, has been a bright spot. He completed 22 of 38 passes for 219 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions and also ran for 113 yards and a score against the Salukis. This, after throwing for 378 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 102 yards and a score in a 35-34 home loss to Western Illinois on Oct. 29.\n\"He's certainly come along here in the last few weeks,\" Nielson said. \"I think he's had a better understanding of the offense and understands the expectations that we have of him and has become a much more consistent player.\"\nThis will be the 109th meeting, and the Jackrabbits hold a slim 51-50-7 series advantage after winning the past seven matchups. Wieneke finished with six receptions for 180 yards and Kyle Paris ran for two late touchdowns last November when SDSU rallied for 20 fourth-quarter points on the way to a 30-23 victory at South Dakota.\n\"Our guys certainly understand who we're playing and the importance of the game, not just for them as a football team, but also how much more interest there is around the state,\" Nielson said. \"(The Jackrabbits are) a very good football team. They've got big playmakers on offense at every position. They're a team that we're going to have to execute at a very high level against.\"\n---\nAROUND THE LEAGUE=\nNorth Dakota State (8-1, 5-1), which is seeking at least a share of its sixth consecutive MVFC title, will try to keep pace with the Jackrabbits on Saturday when it hosts Indiana State (4-6, 2-5).\nNo. 17 Youngstown State (6-3, 4-2) hopes to stay in the mix as it takes on visiting Southern Illinois (3-6, 1-5) this weekend, while No. 19 Western Illinois (6-3, 3-3) hosts Northern Iowa (4-5, 3-3). Illinois State (5-5, 3-4) will try to continue its push toward a playoff spot with its third straight win Saturday against visiting Missouri State (4-5, 2-4).",

      "text": "By Michael Lombardi \nPublished November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print FOX Sports contributor Michael Lombardi is a personnel evaluator by trade who served as the Cleveland Browns general manager in 2013. Lombardi began his career with the San Francisco 49ers organization in 1984. He spent time with the 49ers (1984-86), Browns (1987-95, 2013), Philadelphia Eagles (1997-98), Oakland Raiders (1999-2007) and New England Patriots (2014-15) during his career, earning Super Bowl rings with San Francisco (1985) and New England (2014). Most recently, he served as a special assistant to the Patriots coaching staff during the 2014 and 2015 seasons, working closely with head coach Bill Belichick. Before every big NFL game, he assembles a report that breaks down the matchup from a front office perspective. He shared his seven-point look at Sunday's Dallas Cowboys vs. Pittsburgh Steelers game ( FOX, 4:25 p.m. ET ) with us. \n1. Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell has no touchdowns in five games. The Steelers need him to be the main man to win. Bell does, however, already have more receptions this year (36) than he did in six games last year (24).\n2. Both defenses are based around their star linebackers. The Cowboys go as Sean Lee goes, and the Steelers go as Ryan Shazier goes.\nMore from FoxSports Packers QB Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss Tony Romo has taught Dak Prescott 'everything' to be successful Thursday Night Football: Baltimore Ravens vs. Cleveland Browns 3. Four-time Pro Bowl Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey returned last week after suffering a dislocated thumb on the second play of the game, but he was limited to 19 snaps. He had surgery Monday and plans to practice Friday and play Sunday . \"He's going to have the ability to snap,\" coach Mike Tomlin told reporters. \"We'll give him a couple days to let it calm down from the procedure.\"\n4. In his first game back from knee surgery last week, Ben Roethlisberger had no lower body-power to drive the ball. He could not make a good throw because the ball kept pointing down. He throws more with his lower body than his arm.\n5. Ezekiel Elliott (above) and the Cowboys must control the pace of the game and use the clock. Dallas is fifth in the league in first-down offense, so it should look to own the down-and-distance game given that the Steelers' defense ranks 24th in the same area.\n6. The Steelers got killed in the kicking game last week -- too many mistakes. After three straight losses, expect them to play their best game of the season.\n7. The Steelers and Cowboys have the same philosophy on defense: play the run, no big plays and handle the red zone. Each team must win the red zone to win -- this game comes down to that phase. Pittsburgh ranks eighth in the league in red-zone scoring efficiency, and Dallas ranks 11th. On defense, the Steelers rank third and the Cowboys 12th in the same category.",

      "text": "Trump’s Twitter response to protestors was a little ambiguous, and were kinda confused? Since the results of the this week’s election, there are millions of people across America who are upset that Hillary Clinton won’t be our next president — and, honestly, livid over Donald Trump’s victory. There have even been a number of organized, anti-Trump protests and gatherings.\nAnd, as he does , Trump took to Twitter to complain about the protests …but then seemingly backtracked. For some context, Lady GaGa staged a protest outside Trump Tower in NYC, and there have even been numerous post-election protests by high school students (not to mention larger demonstrations all over the country). And it seemed like initially Trump didn’t understand why people were taking to the streets, because from his perspective it was a successful election.\nJust had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 Quick question, what exactly is a “professional protestor”?\n\nAnyway, Trump seemed to completely reverese direction the following morning. \nLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 S it seems that now Trump not only doesn’t think the protesting is unfair, but he’s actively praising the participants. Something tells us he was forced to do some major damage control after that initial post (since peaceful protesting is kind of one of those things that makes America, you know…great). And we have a feeling we’ll be seeing more of them in the future.\nHuge anti-Trump rally growing in Oakland #occupyoakland #notmypresident #donaldtrump #USElection2016 pic.twitter.com/uzGBAWfUI6 \n— Jim Kroft (@jimkroft) November 11, 2016 San Francisco is standing up!

Because regardless of your political party, or who you wanted to win this year’s election, we can all agree that the freedom to express ourselves and our beliefs is an American right that must be encouraged and protected.

      "text": "Utes' 49-26 win over ASU puts Twitter on emotional roller coaster By Holli Joyce, KSL.com Contributor | Posted Nov 11th, 2016 @ 1:21am 2  \nTEMPE, Arizona — The sleep-walking Utes awakened in the second quarter to begin what would be a demolition in the desert. \nNo. 15 Utah (8-2, 5-2 Pac-12) beat Arizona State (5-5, 2-5) 49-26 at Sun Devil Stadium Thursday night, though it didn’t come without worry. It was the first time the Utes won in Tempe since 1976. I like when Utah wins. It's fun when Utah wins. — Ute Pilot (@ute_pilot) November 11, 2016 \nThe Utes struggled, to say the least, in the first quarter. They lost fumbles on their first two drives — one on a bad snap and the other on an option toss that bounced off running back Joe Williams’ hands. Well, that was not an ideal start. pic.twitter.com/jHrfTnSj4c — Avery Mills (@alynn422) November 11, 2016 Do we get the ball at half now? — Khmer Ute (@KhmerUte) November 11, 2016 \nFollowing their first turnover, safety Marcus Williams, who was in his first game back from injury, stopped Arizona State from capitalizing on Utah’s mistake with an interception in the end zone. The Utes couldn’t take advantage as they lost the ball again with the failed option pass, setting up an Arizona State field goal. \"Uh, yeah, if you could go ahead and give us the 🏈 back, that'd be greeeeaatttt.\" - @Utah_Football , probably. pic.twitter.com/oZb9ELtqhd — Pac-12 Network (@Pac12Network) November 11, 2016 So thankful for a healthy Marcus Williams 😭😭😭 — Taylor Cella (@Taylor_McKell97) November 11, 2016 \nThe Sun Devils continued to score, putting up 10 more points in the quarter. By the end of the first, Arizona State led Utah 13-0. Utah fans were left frustrated, knowing the Utes control their destiny of becoming Pac-12 South division champions. Their team repeatedly made poor decisions and couldn’t connect with each other. It had an entire week off with a bye, yet somehow the team seemed to melt in the desert. Watching the PAC-12 title and Rose Bowl slip away at the hands of ASU.... pic.twitter.com/DvzO8wUKQG — Paul Yoachum (Yoke) (@yokester74) November 11, 2016 Insanity: doing the same thing on offense every year and expecting different results. — Dahlelama (@dahlelama) November 11, 2016 \nThen it clicked. \nQuarterback Troy Williams led the Utes to a 14-13 lead within five minutes of the second quarter. Williams connected with receivers Raelon Singleton for 64 yards and Siaosi Wilson for 27 yards. Williams also threw another touchdown pass to Singleton for 17 yards late in the first half. By the end of the quarter, Utah was up 21-20 and fans were joyous. Update: my mood has changed for the better. — Akot 🙌🏽🇨🇦 (@Utebuntu) November 11, 2016 \nAgainst the league’s best rush defense, Utah planned to throw more than run. But the Sun Devils couldn’t shut out running back Joe Williams. He broke free for an 82-yard run to tack on seven more points for Utah early in the third quarter. He finished with 193 total yards and two touchdowns, averaging 12.1 yards per carry. I love love love that Joe Williams runs away from PAC-12 talent. Wow — Ute Central (@utecentral) November 11, 2016 Love watching this replay of joe Williams #utes @Utah_Football pic.twitter.com/o4SnD9rImR — It's Trav (@__Trav_) November 11, 2016 Joe Williams looking like the next Usain Bolt out there! Joe got that mojo! #UTAHvsASU — Sarah (@Jazzbug20) November 11, 2016 \nArizona State quarterback Manny Wilkins found receiver Tim White for a 12-yard touchdown to finish the third quarter. The Sun Devils tried to tie the score at 28, but their two-point conversion failed thanks to the Utes’ defense, which constantly pressured the quarterback. \nAlthough the defense gave up big plays, Sack Lake City was alive and well. Defensive end Hunter Dimick recorded five of the team’s 11 sacks, a single-game record. Utah also finished with 22 tackles for loss.",

      "text": "International Business Twitter outperforms on ads for BuzzFeed's election livestream Twitter said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on an election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram. Posted 12 Nov 2016 02:05 The Twitter Inc. logo is shown with the U.S. flag during the company's IPO on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, November 7, 2013. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Buzzfeed employees work at the company's headquarters in New York January 9, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo A \nREUTERS: Twitter said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on an election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram. \nTwitter Inc partnered with BuzzFeed to host their election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon’s “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard’s “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream, but said by email that it overdelivered between two to three times on its live ad impressions that were guaranteed, meaning advertisers' content was viewed by more people than had been promised. \nTwitter handled the ad sales, and split half the revenue with Buzzfeed, according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe overperformance for advertisers came at a much-needed time for Twitter, which has staked its future on video. The company has made a point of getting advertisers to move toward video buys instead of in-feed text and photo-based ads as a way of stemming its declining ad revenue growth. \nOn Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, a key figure in building Twitter's ad business, announced he was leaving the company in what was seen as a big blow. Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, who attended BuzzFeed's election night broadcast in New York, will replace him in the interim while the company seeks a permanent successor. \nAt least one of the advertisers, PVH Corp’s Izod, is eager to work with Twitter more in the future. \n“We’re going to look long and hard about increasing our presence there,” said Mike Kelly, executive vice president of The Marketing Group, PVH’s in-house agency. “We walked away a bit changed in our point of view.” \nIzod ran a 60-second video featuring presidential debate sensation Ken Bone in his trademark red Izod sweater; BuzzFeed also had Bone on during the broadcast, and many BuzzFeed staffers wore Bone’s trademark sweater. \nThe Buzzfeed broadcast began around 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) and ended sometime after midnight (0500 GMT), and was watched by a total of 6.8 million unique viewers. The average minute audience, the best metric to use when comparing to a TV audience, was 165,000 viewers globally. By comparison, Fox News drew 12.2 million viewers. \nHosting BuzzFeed’s stream was seen as a bit of an upset for Twitter, as most had expected BuzzFeed to work with Facebook instead. Unlike Facebook Live, Twitter’s video strategy more closely mimics what viewers see on television. \nThe company has signed deals with numerous U.S. professional and college sports leagues, most notably with the National Football League, in an effort to both increase its stalled user base and court larger advertisers that have traditionally worked with television, but are looking to reach consumers who are not subscribed to a cable TV package. \n(Reporting by Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) - Reuters",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson (right) catches a 13-yard touchdown pass in front of Minnesota Vikings cornerback Captain Munnerlyn during the second half. \nLANDOVER, Md. -- It wasn't all that long ago that Mike Zimmer's Minnesota Vikings and Jay Gruden's Washington Redskins were both on lengthy winning streaks.\nMinnesota opened 5-0; Washington won four in a row at one point. When the Redskins (4-3-1) host the Vikings (5-3) on Sunday, the clubs will be trying to put an end to winless ruts that threaten to curb their playoff ambitions.\n\"It is a pivotal point. We need to put all our energy, our focus physically and mentally, into this game and into these next few weeks,\" Washington defensive lineman Ricky Jean Francois said. \"This next stretch is going to tell you who's making the playoffs or not; if we're going to win the division again or not.\"\nMore from FoxSports The Outlaws of Camp Pendleton Skip Bayless argues Dak Prescott will beat the Pittsburgh Steelers | UNDISPUTED Packers QB Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss Aaron Rodgers is fired up after Sunday's loss His coach, Gruden, concurred.\nThe third-place team in the NFC East comes off its bye week after a loss and a tie that followed its four-game winning run, and after the Vikings come to town, the Redskins' schedule does not get easier: vs. Green Bay, at Dallas, at Arizona, at Philadelphia.\n\"You hate to make one game more important than the other, but these next two games in general are going to be important. They're two home games that are very, very big for us,\" said Gruden, who was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati when Zimmer ran the defense there. \"We're in a position where we don't have a lot of room for error.\"\nThe NFC North-leading Vikings, meanwhile, have dropped three consecutive games.\n\"After the first five weeks, we were extremely confident. ... And the last three weeks, the confidence level has gone down, right?\" Zimmer said.\n\"But that's why this game is not just about the physical part of it, but it's about the mental part of it, and the way the team feels about itself,\" he said. \"You start out a season and you're 0-2, everybody thinks you're awful. You start out the season 2-0, everybody thinks you're great. But there's so many fluctuations and emotions throughout a 16-game season.\"\nHere is what else to know about Sunday's game:\nNO PRO BOWL TACKLE \nWashington's Pro Bowl left tackle, Trent Williams, begins his four-game suspension for violating the league's drug policy, a major loss for a team that will plug in Ty Nsekhe at that key position. Nsekhe is a 31-year-old who'll be making the third NFL start of his career. \"Trent is in a class by himself at tackle, he really is,\" Gruden said, \"but when you're talking about tackle in the NFL, Ty belongs, and I think he'll do fine.\"\nWALSH STICKS \nThe Vikings considered switching kickers this week, bringing in a half-dozen free agents for a tryout, but they're sticking with the struggling Blair Walsh for now. Walsh missed his league-worst third extra point and had a field-goal try blocked last week, leaving him 12 for 15 on PATs and 12 for 16 on FGs this season.\n\"At some point in time, you have belief and confidence in guys,\" Zimmer said, \"because you know what they've done in the past.\"\nFAT ROB \nRedskins rookie RB Robert Kelley, he of the \"Fat Rob\" nickname, is expected to again be the featured back, instead of Matt Jones, after running for 87 yards on 21 carries and catching a 1-yard TD pass in his first NFL start. Kelley was an undrafted free agent out of Tulane, where he never got even 100 carries in a season. \"I'm happy with how far I came,\" Kelley said.\nLAPSES ON DEFENSE \nOne of the most troubling trends for the Vikings during their three-game slide has been some lapses by their dominant defense. Chicago and Detroit were a combined 14 of 28 on third downs, dropping the Vikings to 12th in the NFL in opponents' third-down conversion rate at 38.3 percent, hurt by penalties and uncharacteristic missed tackles.\nRED-ZONE PROBLEMS \nThe Redskins have been able to drive up and down the field, but they've been stymied when they get close to the end zone, ranking 30th in the NFL in red-zone efficiency. \"There are times where, in the rhythm of the play, guys aren't going to always be open. You know, if teams play max coverages and cover people, maybe everyone's not open, and that's where I look and say, `Can I scramble? Can I make a play off-schedule?'\" QB Kirk Cousins said. \"So those would be the two things that come to mind personally for me that I can try to improve down in the red zone.\"\nMINNESOTA (5-3) at WASHINGTON (4-3-1) \nSunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox\nOPENING LINE -- Redskins by 2\nRECORD VS.

Vikings WR Stefon Diggs, who played in college at Maryland, had career-high 13 catches for 80 yards last week vs. Detroit. ... Minnesota has five turnovers through eight games, lowest midpoint total in team history, including only one interception in 276 passes. ... After 5-0 start, Vikings have lost last three games; they haven't dropped four straight since Oct. 13-Nov. 3, 2013. ... DE Brian Robison has six sacks and three forced fumbles in past nine games. ...

WR Jamison Crowder, emerging as top target for Cousins, leads Redskins with four TD catches, had nine catches for 107 yards and TD in last game. ... TE Jordan Reed's 14 TD catches tied for most among players at his position since 2015. ... LB Ryan Kerrigan leads Redskins with seven sacks; LB Trent Murphy next with six; no one else on team has more than two. ... Fantasy Tip: Redskins RB Robert Kelley, who should be available in many leagues, should continue to get increased workload after running for career-high 87 yards and TD in last game. ... Vikings' running game has been real problem, but Redskins tend to give up rush yards in chunks -- and Minnesota RB Matt Asiata scored three TDs last time these teams met.",

      "text": "Twitter Explodes With ‘Assassinate Trump’ Threats (Friday, November 11th, 2016 02:58 PM) \nTwitter is exploding with people calling for president-elect Donald Trump to be assassinated. \nThe Republican real-estate billionaire beat Hillary Clinton handily to become the next president of the United States, but that hasn’t stopped lots of people calling for somebody to murder him. \nSome posts called for both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to be assassinated, and there’s even an #AssassinateTrump hashtag, the NY Post is reporting . Ads By Artscroll: \nAnother user wrote that the “only” remaining question after Tuesday’s historic and polarizing election is who will “assassinate” Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Some users even cited that date as a deadline for the assassination. \nThe development comes as demonstrators continued to take to the streets for a second day across the US against Trump’s victory in the country’s presidential election. \nThe Secret Service does not comment publicly on its protective operations, but threats of assassination on social media have resulted in investigations in the past. \n( YWN World Headquarters – NYC )",

      "text": "Liberals angry that Donald Trump smoked Hillary Clinton in the presidential election earlier this week have not been shy about demonstrating just how morally degenerate they can really be. Many have taken to the streets and rioted over the whole affair, refusing to accept Trump as the new president, apparently forgetting it’s their own fault for running the most corrupt politician of our time as their nominee.\nWhat’s even more despicable is how these individuals have taken to Twitter to suggest assassinating the newly-elected president. So much for that “tolerance” they keep preaching about, right?\n Liberals tweet the UNTHINKABLE about Trump, Twitter's response is ASTOUNDING... Look what Huma was spotted doing outside Hillary campaign HQ... BREAKING: Trump announces new role for Mike Pence...\nTo top it all off, it doesn’t seem that Twitter is doing a whole lot about it.\nAccording to the NY Post , The shock and anger over Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House has triggered a flood of calls on Twitter and other social media outlets for the president-elect to be assassinated — and authorities will investigate all threats deemed to be credible, The Post has learned.\nBut that message of inclusion was apparently lost in social media circles, particularly Twitter, where a simple search can reveal dozens and dozens of calls to gun down the next leader of the free world. Some posts called for both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to be assassinated, and there’s even an #AssassinateTrump hashtag.\n“Trump chose the literal worst case scenario as VP so nobody would try to impeach or assassinate him,” one user posted on Twitter.\nAnother user wrote that the “only” remaining question after Tuesday’s historic and polarizing election is who will “assassinate” Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Some users even cited that date as a deadline for the assassination.\nOther postings called for users who used the inflammatory hashtag to be contacted by authorities.\nA security source told The Post that the Secret Service would investigate all social media postings containing credible threats, adding that there’s a difference between someone saying they’re planning to kill the president and suggesting that someone else should attempt an assassination. Generally, indirect threats are not prosecuted, according to the source, and investigators will “prioritize” them before determining their credibility.\nHere’s a small sampling of the idiocy these dolts are putting on Twitter: Why isn't #AssassinateTrump trending? Lol\n— Kailey Derhousoff (@kaileydmusic) September 27, 2016\nThe most powerful #NeverTrump act we can perform is to #AssassinateTrump – liberals just too pussy I guess… https://t.co/FmBlmTetfZ\n— nepotist (@nepotist) September 25, 2016\nHey don Let's see what happens when 20 snipers all shoot at you at the same time. Let's see what happens @realDonaldTrump #assassinatetrump\n— Mike The Quick (@BIRDFAN7) September 17, 2016\nWhat’s even more infuriating is it doesn’t seem anyone at Twitter is doing anything to ban or remove these calls for assassinating the president. Pretty disturbing and massively hypocritical, wouldn’t you say?\nRemember when Milo Yiannopoulos was booted from the social media giant?\nvia Breitbart :\nBreitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos has been suspended from Twitter once more just 20 minutes before his “Gays for Trump” event takes place at the Republican National Convention.\nThe justification for the suspension is currently unknown, although it could be as a result of Milo’s run-in with Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones on the site. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey publicly reached out to Jones late on Monday evening after she complained about “abuse” on the platform. Milo was suspended despite the fact that he sent no abusive tweets to the actress.\nYes, that’s right. Milo got into an Internet scuffle with an actress, and he gets booted to the curb. Folks come out of the woodwork to talk about assassinating the president, suddenly all those in charge over at Twitter have disappeared.\nThen there’s the case of conservative writer Kassy Dillon, also booted from social media for retweeting the same actress mentioned above.\nvia Heat Street :\nKassy Dillon, a contributor to Campus Reform and Heat Street and founder of Lone Conservative, was suspended temporarily from Twitter following Tweets made about Leslie Jones.\nWhile Twitter has not yet returned a request for comment, the suspension appears to be related to an experiment in which Dillon repeated Jones’ tweets, word for word, in an effort to expose bias.\n“The only reason why I tweeted copies of what Leslie said is to show bias,” Dillon told Heat Street. “If this famous actress actress does it, it’s okay, but if I do the same thing as a conservative writer, Twitter punishes me for it.”\nDillon believes that the suspension was in part because she has been campaigning hard to reinstate Milo Yiannopoulos to Twitter and pushing the #FreeMilo hashtag.\nAgain, tweeting about a celebrity, one who actually encouraged a human being to kill themselves, gets you banned, yet threatening the president gets ignored?\nTwitter’s CEO needs to make a statement about this ASAP, making it clear they will not tolerate such threats against the president and that each one that gets reported will be sent to the FBI for investigation.\nThose involved in this garbage should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for participating in something so vile and wicked.\nJust imagine what would have happened had conservatives reacted this way to Obama’s victory?\nTime to grow up, folks.\n[This article was written by Michael Cantrell]",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Minnesota Vikings left guard Alex Boone was sidelined last week against Detroit because of a concussion, a first for his eight-year NFL career. He'd only missed four games to injury before, all because of knee trouble. Boone has since passed the post-concussion testing, cleared to take the field for practice on Wednesday.\nHe has returned with some deeper perspective, as well as better equipment. Boone's wife and oldest child urged him to ditch the helmet he'd been wearing for years, the oldest model left in the league, he estimated.\n\"They don't want to wheel me around when I'm 35, so I will be trying a new helmet this week and probably from here on out,\" he says, reflecting on his old helmet like a little kid's security blanket. \"I've always loved it, and now I'm going to have to upgrade to one of these new fancy things that I'm not happy about.\"\nMore from FoxSports Chargers LB Korey Toomer thought he could talk back to John Pagano through his helmet Philip Rivers might be the best trash talker in the NFL Will Antonio Gates break the NFL record for touchdowns by a tight end? The Outlaws of Camp Pendleton Boone predictably found the concussion protocol \"annoying,\" complaining about the time he had to spent sitting in front of a computer answering questions to prove his mental acuity was back to normal. But he recognized the seriousness of the injury.\n\"This is a brutal game, and sometimes you get hit in the head and things go wrong,\" Boone said. \"I have kids, and the last thing I want is to have them take care of me at 35. It's hard because I want to play and I want to do everything, but at the same time it's serious and I've got to be a dad at the same time.\"",

(AP) Linebacker Justin Houston will have to wait at least another week before making his season debut for the Kansas City Chiefs after he was ruled out for Sunday's game at Carolina.\nHouston had surgery to repair his left ACL in February and was removed from the physically unable to perform list this week. But the Chiefs are being careful with his recovery and are giving him at least another week to get ready for game action.\nMaclin has been ruled out with a groin injury. He hurt it in practice last week and tweaked it again on the Chiefs' first series in their 19-14 victory over Jacksonville.\nMore from FoxSports Chargers LB Korey Toomer thought he could talk back to John Pagano through his helmet Philip Rivers might be the best trash talker in the NFL Will Antonio Gates break the NFL record for touchdowns by a tight end?

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print We're a nation bitterly divided.\nAnd, no, I'm not talking about who should be the fourth-ranked team in the College Football Playoff.\nA presidential election like no other has come and gone, sending half the nation into the streets for a euphoric dance, the other half into the streets for a defiant protest.\nMore from FoxSports Chargers LB Korey Toomer thought he could talk back to John Pagano through his helmet Philip Rivers might be the best trash talker in the NFL Will Antonio Gates break the NFL record for touchdowns by a tight end? The Outlaws of Camp Pendleton There seems no middle ground, nothing we can all agree on.\nIt's time for sports to bring us together.\nWith a nod to Stephen Colbert, who issued a similar plea on election night , here's some things we should all be able to agree on:\n- The NFL is overexposed. There's no reason pass off the winless Cleveland Browns as worthy of being shown to the entire country (or at least those who can find NFL Network on channel 2,345). That was quite evident from the snoozefest we witnessed Thursday night, when the Brownies' offensive game plan in a 28-7 loss to Baltimore consisted mainly of incompletions, 2-yard runs, turnovers, sacks and yet another quarterback change. The NFL should be played on Sundays, with one game on Monday. No mas to Thursday night.\n- On a similar note, college football should be played on Saturdays. End of story. We don't need games on Thursday night (hey, those kids are supposed to go to class the next day, so at least play along with the charade). We certainly don't need them on Friday nights. High school football is meant for Friday nights, not the Big Ten .\n- We know Nick Saban has some weighty issues on his plate, like the Iron Bowl and winning another national championship. But the Alabama coach should at least know about Election Day .\n- It's time for Tiger Woods to retire. We want to remember him as perhaps the greatest player in golf history, not some aging, hairline-receding, injury riddled version of Willie Mays or Muhammad Ali, trying to desperately to hang on to a game he can no longer play at the highest levels.\n- They still have fighting in the NHL? Seriously, what century is this? Ban that silliness immediately. If you need a fighting fix, check out YouTube. Those guys really wailed on each other in the truly Neanderthal days .\n- LeBron James should take up baseball. Maybe he can do for the Indians what he did for the Cavaliers. But forget about asking him to play quarterback. Not even a King can help the Browns.\n- The College Football Playoff should expand to eight teams, with spots going to the five Power Five conference champions, the highest-ranked champion from the Group of Five, and the next two highest-ranked teams regardless of league. No more conference championship games. The first or second weekend of December is for the quarterfinals. The semifinals remain on New Year's Day, followed by the national championship game a week or so later. See how easy that was.\n- No one wants to have a beer with Bill Belichick. Or have him pick out what they're going to wear to work. But we all want him to coach our favorite football team.\n- Please let there be a day when no city bids for the Olympics. Clearly, that's the only way to let the IOC know the rest of the world has finally figured out that its every-two-years prize is really nothing more than an extortion plot designed to drive cities (and even countries) into bankruptcy. We love the Olympics, but we hate all the red ink and broken promises it leaves behind.\n- The Chicago Cubs took us on a marvelous ride, but enough with trying to turn a World Series victory into some sort of spiritual, life-affirming triumph over a 108-year-old curse. Besides, you want suffering? Let me introduce you to the A-T-L. While the Windy City has celebrated titles in all the major sports over the last three decades, Atlanta has managed one championship over a combined 168 baseball, football, basketball and hockey seasons. And it doesn't even have the NHL anymore, having lost not one, but two team to Western Canada.\n- Billionaire owners should pay for their own stadiums and arenas. Kudos to San Diego for being one of the rare cities that told a team what it could do with its plan to have the citizenry pick up the tab for a private enterprise. That decision will likely send the Chargers to Los Angeles, but it's not a bad drive to make eight times a year while spending public funds on things that actually benefit everyone, like better schools and parks.\n- Baseball needs to do many things to make itself more appealing to a younger generation, but getting rid of the organist is NOT one of them. Matthew Kaminski of the Braves is proof of that.\n- Finally, there's something really comforting about watching winners and losers shake hands at the end of a hard-fought contest and knowing there's always next season.\nYep, we can all agree on that.\n---\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.

By: Reuters   4:51 AM Twitter partnered with BuzzFeed to host an election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon.com Inc’s “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod. (Reuters) \nTwitter Inc said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on a U.S. election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram. \nTwitter partnered with BuzzFeed to host an election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon .com Inc’s “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream, but said by email that it overdelivered between two to three times on its live ad impressions that were guaranteed. \nVideo from advertisers fetches higher rates than text and photo-based ads and is seen as key revenue source for Twitter. Snapchat has been building up its ad sales team ahead of next year’s IPO and Instagram will take a larger role in growing Facebook Inc’s ad revenue. \nAt least one of the advertisers, PVH Corp’s Izod, is eager to work with Twitter more in the future. \nIzod ran a 60-second video featuring presidential debate sensation Ken Bone in his trademark red Izod sweater.“We’re going to look long and hard about increasing our presence there,” said Mike Kelly, executive vice president of the Marketing Group, PVH’s in-house agency. “We walked away a bit changed in our point of view.” \nTwitter handled the ad sales, and split half the revenue with BuzzFeed, according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe BuzzFeed broadcast began around 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) and ended sometime after midnight (0500 GMT), and was watched by a total of 6.8 million unique viewers. The average minute audience, the best metric to use when comparing to a TV audience, was 165,000 viewers globally. By comparison, Fox News drew an average minute audience of 12.2 million. \nThe overperformance for advertisers came at a much-needed time for Twitter, which has staked its future on video. The company has made a point of getting advertisers to move toward video buys as a way of stemming its declining ad revenue growth. \nOn Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, a key figure in building Twitter’s ad business, announced he was leaving the company in what was seen as a big blow. Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, who attended BuzzFeed’s election night broadcast in New York, will replace Bain while still holding his current title until the company finds a new CFO. \nHosting BuzzFeed’s stream was seen as a bit of an upset for Twitter, as most had expected BuzzFeed to work with Facebook instead. Unlike Facebook Live, Twitter’s video strategy more closely mimics what viewers see on television. \nThe company has signed deals with numerous U.S. professional and college sports leagues, most notably with the National Football League, in an effort to both increase its stalled user base and court larger advertisers that have traditionally worked with television, but are looking to reach consumers who are not subscribed to a cable TV package. \nShares of Twitter closed up nearly 1 percent at $18.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

      "text": "(Credit: Twitter) If the recent protests across the United States are anything to go by, one can safely say that there are many people that are unhappy with the US Presidential 2016 election results. Not just adults but even children are disappointed with the prospect of a Trump presidency. One 5-year-old girl couldn’t help but burst into tears after she got to know that Donald Trump is the President-elect of the United States.\nArab-American YouTuber Adam Saleh recently tweeted a video of his little niece Reema's emotional reaction after she saw him win another state while watching the election news coverage on TV. In the video, she is also heard innocently saying that she plans to vote for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\nWell, too bad Reema that Trump won. But one should never forget to hope for the best. Click on the link below to view the video:\nReema is only 5 years old. She knows that we're Muslim and started crying when she saw Donald Trump winning... đ° smh pic.twitter.com/jt6tlw1UEi\n— Adam Saleh (@omgAdamSaleh) November 9, 2016",

      "text": "By Andre Vergara \nPublished November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Bill Stanfill, the leader of the \"No-Name Defense\" on the 1972 Miami Dolphins team that went undefeated, has died. He was 69.\nStanfill, an All-American defensive tackle at Georgia and winner of the Outland Trophy, was a four-time Pro Bowler in an eight-year career with Miami. He anchored the Dolphins defense along with Nick Buoniconti, winning back-to-back Super Bowls in 1972 and '73. \nHe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame along with coach Vince Dooley in 1998.\nMore from FoxSports Will the Steelers stop the Cowboys winning streak? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Hue Jackson has the most secure job in the NFL | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Warriors Among Us: Raul Mercado Warriors Among Us: Billy Hurley \"Bill was probably the greatest athlete as a lineman I ever coached,\" Dooley told The Associated Press. \"He could have been a great tight end as well. Against the triple option, he was the only player that could take the quarterback, the dive back, and the pitch man. Bill was a great person, great warrior, and a great Bulldog.\"\nStanfill's health suffered after his football career and he was featured in a 2001 Sports Illustrated article that detailed the myriad physical problems he endured. He was forced to use a walker after hip-replacement surgery and still felt the effects of a near-fatal injury from a 1975 preseason game. He banged heads with a teammate and nearly severed his spinal cord.\nHe was hospitalized after a bad fall earlier this year and suffered complications during treatment. He died in hospice care in Albany, Ga.\n\"Just wish I'd made some of the money they're making today,\" he told SI. \"It would make this a lot easier to live with.\"",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Virginia nose tackle Donte Wilkins is among the fourth- and fifth-year seniors that will be honored before Virginia's final home game Saturday against Miami, and also part of a class with some notoriety.\nWilkins and his classmates will be the first in a long time to leave Virginia without ever having participated in a bowl game, but also the key components in what they believe is a burgeoning transformation.\nHe hopes that any emotions that surface don't arrive until after the game.\nMore from FoxSports FOX Sports Florida Midday Minute 'Plus': College football weekend preview Hurricanes' Mark Richt: 'I know I'll do a better job next year' Aztecs are shooting for Top 25 with the hopes of hosting the MWC Championship ACC Profile: Brad Kaaya on influence of Mark Richt on Miami ''Maybe after the season when I think about it, but it's more we got work to do, we've got an 80-play game that we've gotta play, so that's what I'm focused on right now,'' Wilkins, one of three Virginia captains, said.\nWhile the Cavaliers (2-7, 1-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) hoped a major turnaround would happen in Bronco Mendenhall's first season, the Hurricanes (5-4, 2-3) looked like they were making it happen early in the season with new coach Mark Richt in charge. They started the season with four straight wins and reached No. 10 in the Top 25.\nHowever, just as quickly as Miami rose, it fell, losing four games in a row, assuring the program that once lived near the top of college football that it would again fall short. The Hurricanes have never played for the ACC championship since joining the league in 2004, and have lost six of 10 ACC meetings with the Cavaliers.\nRicht, though, cautions against reading too much into this years' results, for either program.\n''The first season is always one of change, one of everybody learning each other and all that kind of thing,'' he said. ''There's a lot of really good teams that don't have a winning record around the country.''\nThat would include Miami if not for a 51-28 victory last weekend against Pittsburgh.\n''If we didn't win this last one, we'd be in the same boat,'' Richt said.\nInstead, they are one victory from becoming bowl-eligible for the ninth consecutive season.\nHere are some things to look for when Miami visits Virginia:\nRECORD CHASING: Virginia senior Taquan ''Smoke'' Mizzell is 10 receiving yards shy of becoming the first player in ACC history at accumulate 1,500 rushing yards and 1,500 receiving yards in his career. Mizzell has 1,742 rushing yards and would be the ninth 1,500-1,500 player at the Bowl Subdivision level since the 2000 season. ... Senior WR Keeon Johnson needs 17 receiving yards to become the 36th Cavalier with 1,000 receiving yards for his career.\nBUILDING BLOCKS: Miami and Virginia have started the most freshmen this season among ACC schools. The Hurricanes lead with five, and the Cavaliers and Florida State are tied for second, each having started four.\nORANGE CRUSH: Miami ranks second nationally with 81 tackles for a loss this season, and that will be a point of great concern for the Cavaliers. Since getting pounded early in the second half against Pittsburgh three weeks ago, Cavaliers quarterback Kurt Benkert has been skittish in the pocket and too quick to start scrambling. Against the speed of Miami's defense, that could expose him to taking hits on his still-ailing non-throwing shoulder.\nRED ZONE: One of Virginia's positives despite its record has been its red zone productivity. The Cavaliers have scored on 27 of 30 trips inside the red zone, and are third nationally with an 80 percent touchdown conversion rate. Their only failures inside the opposing 20? A lost fumble and missed field goals from 20 and 30 yards.\nBEST EVER BRAD?: Hurricanes junior quarterback Brad Kaaya, coming off a 356-yard effort against Pittsburgh that included four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown, has played his way into the top five of most quarterbacking career lists for Miami. He ranks third in yards, total yards, touchdowns, completionsand attempts.",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) The Los Angeles Angels have signed right-hander Jesse Chavez to a $5.75 million, one-year contract.\nThe Angels also designated outfielder Rafael Ortega for assignment Friday night.\nChavez went 2-2 with a 4.43 ERA in 62 games last season for the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched exclusively as a reliever at the start of his career and again last season, but also started 47 games over the 2014 and 2015 seasons for Oakland.\nMore from FoxSports Craig Counsell contract extension press conference Fall League profile: Jamie Westbrook ADD/DROP: Animals! Would Kevin Kiermaier rather make a great catch or a great throw? The Southern California native is joining his seventh team during a nine-year career in the big leagues.\nChavez is likely to compete for a spot in the Angels' starting rotation, which has lost depth due to injuries. Matt Shoemaker, Tyler Skaggs and Ricky Nolasco are also in the rotation along with ace Garrett Richards.",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) Dalvin Cook ran for 108 yards and Deondre Francois tied a season high with three touchdown passes to help No. 20 Florida State rout Boston College 45-7 on Friday night.\nCook became only the second Seminoles back to go over 100 yards in 15 meetings against the Eagles and the first since Ricky Williams had 109 yards in 1980.\nThe junior, who also had a touchdown on 18 carries, moved within 19 yards of breaking Warrick Dunn's school career mark of 3,959 yards.\nMore from FoxSports Playoffs, 1st round: Khalil Shakir takes this punt right back where it came from FOX Sports Florida Midday Minute 'Plus': College football weekend preview Hurricanes' Mark Richt: 'I know I'll do a better job next year' Aztecs are shooting for Top 25 with the hopes of hosting the MWC Championship Francois completed nine of his first 11 passes, and the Seminoles scored on their first two drives.\nA 6-yard scoring strike to Auden Tate marked the first time Florida State (7-4, 4-3 ACC, No. 18 CFP) has scored on its opening drive since Sept. 24 at South Florida. The freshman was 16 of 24 for 183 yards, but suffered a shoulder contusion late in the third quarter and did not return.\nSean Maguire came in and added a pair of touchdowns. Tate, who had six receptions for 101 yards, had two touchdowns.\nThe Eagles (4-6, 1-5) had three first downs on their first two drives before having nine straight three-and-outs. They averted a shutout with 3:21 remaining in the fourth quarter on a 1-yard touchdown run by Richard Wilson.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\nFlorida State dropped a spot after last Saturday's come-from-behind victory at North Carolina State, but it should go up a couple spots after its most convincing victory of the season.\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nBoston College: This is the first time since 2003 the Eagles have faced three ranked teams in a season. Based on the results, they might be hoping it doesn't happen anytime soon. No. 3 Clemson, No. 5 Louisville and 20th-ranked FSU outscored the Eagles 153-24.\nFlorida State: For once the Seminoles were able to get off to a fast start as it led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Going into the game, they had been outscored 31-3 in the first quarter in their past five games.\nUP NEXT\nBoston College: The Eagles step outside of conference play to host Connecticut. This will be the first meeting between the two Northeast schools since 2004.\nFlorida State: The Seminoles close out the ACC portion of their schedule at Syracuse. They have won eight straight over the Orange.\n---\nMore AP college football at www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP-Top25\n---\nFollow Joe Reedy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/joereedy",

      "text": "Published November 11, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Florida State's Dalvin Cook picks up yardage as Boston College's defender Isaac Yiadom moves in for the tackle in the first half of an NCAA college football game, Friday, Nov. 11, 2016, in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Steve Cannon) \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Dalvin Cook ran for 108 yards and Deondre Francois tied a season high with three touchdown passes to help No. 20 Florida State rout Boston College 45-7 on Friday night.\nCook became only the second Seminoles back to go over 100 yards in 15 meetings against the Eagles and the first since Ricky Williams had 109 yards in 1980.\nThe junior, who also had a touchdown on 18 carries, moved within 19 yards of breaking Warrick Dunn's school career mark of 3,959 yards.\nMore from FoxSports Playoffs, 1st round: Khalil Shakir takes this punt right back where it came from FOX Sports Florida Midday Minute 'Plus': College football weekend preview Hurricanes' Mark Richt: 'I know I'll do a better job next year' Aztecs are shooting for Top 25 with the hopes of hosting the MWC Championship Francois completed nine of his first 11 passes, and the Seminoles scored on their first two drives.\nA 6-yard scoring strike to Auden Tate marked the first time Florida State (7-4, 4-3 ACC, No. 18 CFP) has scored on its opening drive since Sept. 24 at South Florida. The freshman was 16 of 24 for 183 yards, but suffered a shoulder contusion late in the third quarter and did not return.\nSean Maguire came in and added a pair of touchdowns. Tate, who had six receptions for 101 yards, had two touchdowns.\nThe Eagles (4-6, 1-5) had three first downs on their first two drives before having nine straight three-and-outs. They averted a shutout with 3:21 remaining in the fourth quarter on a 1-yard touchdown run by Richard Wilson.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS \nFlorida State dropped a spot after last Saturday's come-from-behind victory at North Carolina State, but it should go up a couple spots after its most convincing victory of the season.\nTHE TAKEAWAY \nBoston College : This is the first time since 2003 the Eagles have faced three ranked teams in a season. Based on the results, they might be hoping it doesn't happen anytime soon. No. 3 Clemson, No. 5 Louisville and 20th-ranked FSU outscored the Eagles 153-24.\nFlorida State : For once the Seminoles were able to get off to a fast start as it led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Going into the game, they had been outscored 31-3 in the first quarter in their past five games.\nUP NEXT \nBoston College: The Eagles step outside of conference play to host Connecticut. This will be the first meeting between the two Northeast schools since 2004.\nFlorida State: The Seminoles close out the ACC portion of their schedule at Syracuse. They have won eight straight over the Orange.",

Tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands of South Koreans were expected to rally in Seoul on Saturday demanding the ouster of Park in what would be one of the biggest protests in the country since its democratization about 30 years ago. The letters read \"Park Geun-hye should step down.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)  (The Associated Press) \nPrevious Next SEOUL, South Korea –   Tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands of South Koreans were expected to rally in Seoul on Saturday demanding the ouster of President Park Geun-hye in what would be one of the biggest protests in the country since its democratization about 30 years ago.\nPolice anticipate about 170,000 people to turn out near City Hall and an old palace gate, while the protest organizers estimate as much as a million participants.\nIt will be the latest of a wave of massive rallies against Park, whose presidency has been shaken by suspicion that she let a shadowy longtime confidante to manipulate power from behind the scenes.\nPark's friend, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, is also suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled.\nDespite rising public anger, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's resignation or impeachment over fears of negatively impacting next year's presidential race. However, they have threatened to campaign for resignation if she doesn't distance herself from state affairs.\nThe protest on Saturday was expected to be the largest in the capital since June 10, 2008, when police said 80,000 people took part in a candlelight vigil denouncing the government's decision to resume U.S. beef imports amid persisting mad cow fears. Organizers then estimated the crowd at 700,000.\nIn the summer of 1987, millions of South Koreans rallied in Seoul and other cities for weeks before the then-military government caved in to demands for free presidential elections.\nIn an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park on Tuesday said she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2.\nProsecutors have arrested Choi, one of her key associates and two former presidential aides who allegedly helped Choi interfere with government decisions and amass an illicit fortune at the expense of businesses.\nProsecutors also on Friday summoned the chairman of steelmaker POSCO over allegations that Choi and her associates tried to forcibly take over the shares of an advertisement company previously owned by the steelmaker.On Tuesday, they raided the headquarters of smartphone giant Samsung Electronics, the country's largest company, which is under suspicion of spending millions of dollars illicitly financing the equestrian training of Choi's athlete daughter.\nUnder South Korea's criminal litigation law, which requires suspects to be either indicted or released within 20 days of their arrest, prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge Choi.\nThere is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her action. The president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, under South Korean law, but she can be investigated.\nPark has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days.",

Egypt’s shock therapy reforms are rewriting the social contract that long ruled the country _ “accept autocracy, receive bread.” The currency has dropped in value after being floated, and subsidies have been cut, hiking prices on the poor. Now some demand political reforms and a lifting of the heavy security hand in turn, but it seems unlikely.(AP Photo/Amr Nabil)  (The Associated Press) \nPrevious Next CAIRO –   From as early as the 1950s, Egypt's rulers have had an unspoken social contract with Egyptians: Forfeit genuine democracy and freedoms and, in return, you get to live on the cheap with heavy state subsidies keeping down prices of basic items and services — bread, sugar, rice, fuel, water and electricity.\nNow Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the latest in Egypt's string of military officers-turned-presidents, has had to do the unthinkable to rescue the tanking economy of the Arab world's most populous nation.\nThe currency has been floated freely for the first time and subsidies are being substantially cut. Prices have jolted upward as the Egyptian pound plunged in value and, overnight, fuel and gasoline became more expensive. The measures, carried out hours apart on Nov. 2. have caused panic among a population where poverty, unemployment and inflation are already high.\nAt the same time, his government is keeping the iron grip it has held the past two years, curtailing freedoms, giving security forces a free rein, jailing thousands and managing a media machine that demonizes dissidents.\nThe question is how long el-Sissi can keep a lid on discontent while, it is hoped, reforms bring economic growth that will ease the pain. Already, some voices are calling for political reforms as well.\nOn Friday, Egypt received its reward for the painful shock therapy measures when the International Monetary Fund approved a $12 billion bailout package, including an immediate first installment of $2.75 billion. The hope is that the bailout plus reforms will salvage state finances and signal to international investors to start putting money back into the country.\nThe same day gave a sign of the firm security hand. Calls for protests against the economic measures fizzled, with almost no one turning out in the streets. For days ahead of time, police had warned of harsh measures against anyone heeding the calls, which officials blamed on the banned Muslim Brotherhood.\nBut analysts warn that a popular backlash can still come.\n\"People are angry and frustrated over the rise in prices, but there is no leadership to organize protests. People cannot just take to the streets,\" said Khaled Dawoud, spokesman for the Democratic Alliance, an umbrella of six small left-center parties.\n\"But you cannot rule out something happening out of the blue given the widespread anger.\"\nAbout 40 percent of Egypt's 92 million people live under or hover just above the poverty line — making them vulnerable to even small price hikes. Even before the measures, prices were going up on staples, electricity, and water. Now the Egyptian pound, which traded at 8.8 to the dollar before the flotation, is at around 17 to the dollar.\nOn everyone's mind are bread riots that erupted in 1977 and forced then-President Anwar Sadat to back off his attempt to cut subsidies.\nEl-Sissi and his government have promised programs to cushion the impact, including shifting from general subsidies to cash help directed at the poor and greater steps to ensure only the needy receive subsidized goods.\n\"What is required now ... is to liberate the political environment in parallel with the freeing of the economy from its shackles,\" political scientist Ahmed Abd Rabbou said in a column this week in the independent Al-Shorouq daily.\nThere is little sign of that happening.\nDuring the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, the millions who took to the streets chanted for a new social contract: Bread, human dignity and social justice.\nInstead, the country was mired in crisis, first under nearly 17 months of direct military rule and later with an elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, at the helm for a year.\nEl-Sissi led the military's ouster of Morsi in 2013 and was elected president a year later, promising stability and an improved economy. He launched a series of mega projects that brought the state and military more into the economy but whose benefits were questioned by economists, including an $8.5 billion extension of the Suez Canal and plans to turn 1.5 million desert acres to farmland.\nHis security agencies, meanwhile, jailed thousands, mostly Islamists, but also secular and leftist activists who fueled the 2011 uprising. A wide sector of the public backed the moves, convinced that stability was the priority.\n\"Under el-Sissi, Egypt entered a new contract: The contract of submission,\" said Negad Borai, a rights lawyer who was put under criminal investigation after he proposed legislation against torture.\n\"The validity of this contract and its continuity will hinge on the extent to which the state is willing to go to crush dissent.\"\nIn the weeks leading up to the currency flotation and fuel price hikes, pro-government TV show hosts persistently berated Egyptians, saying they don't work hard enough, depend too much on handouts or consume too much food or fuel. They also talked up fears of the Brotherhood stirring up unrest, warning Egypt could fall into chaos like Syria or Iraq if a firm hand is not kept.\nIn his speeches, el-Sissi echoed that with repeated calls, wrapped in nationalist language, for Egyptians to work harder and consume less.\nProminent analyst Abdullah el-Sennawi warned that Egyptians are being asked to sacrifice when the state is not.\n\"There are conditions for everything. In this instance, they include ending political oppression, releasing detained young people, a more just distribution of burdens, introducing strict and tangible austerity in state institutions and fighting graft with actions, not just words,\" he wrote in a column on Wednesday.\nMichael W. Hanna, an Egypt expert with New York's Century Foundation, says the measures were way overdue but could have been taken earlier under better terms and more secure circumstances. Now the government must show it can shepherd the changes through.\n\"It's an open question whether this will transition to something more sustainable and the government is disciplined enough to see through a reform process.\"\nSome economists have said the government not only has to push forward with the reforms but also lift the hand of the government and military from the economy to let in investment.\nIn an article published this week, Ziad Bahaa el-Din, a former deputy prime minister, prescribed a remedy that includes reviewing el-Sissi's mega-projects, regulating state intervention in the economy and improving the business climate. He also called for political reform, \"without which economic performance will not improve.\"\nBut the state is deeply wary of easing its security grip.\nIbrahim Eissa, a critic of el-Sissi, wrote this week in the daily al-Maqal that popular anger is high, and authorities know that the lack of backlash so far is only \"an artificial calm.\"\n\"It's like a layer of ice that covers a lake of anger, concern, alarm and rejection for the policies of the current regime.\"",

      "text": "Back in August, Twitter put the call out for entries to their first annual Twitter Awards , which aims to recognize the best performing advertisers on the platform.\nWell, the results are now in , so without further ado, here are the winners of each category of the 2016 Twitter Awards, along with a summary (from Twitter) about each campaign and some key performance stats.\nThe Live Award The Live Award aims to recognize the campaign that best used Twitter to connect with people live during events, television, and global moments. The winner of this category was NASCAR.\nCool suit @DaleJr ! 500th tweet of these hashtags wins his #DAYTONA500 fire suit! Rules: https://t.co/lB97h16f1T pic.twitter.com/0hE41rAJOS\n— NASCAR (@NASCAR) February 21, 2016 “The “Ready. Set. Race” campaign sought to ignite the racing spirit in fans and increase engagement around the annual Daytona 500 stock car race. With a branded @NASCAR emoji and the Twitter logo painted on the Daytona infield, @NASCAR introduced the Hashtag 500 race on Twitter. The campaign invited fans to “race” for real driver gear — flags, helmets, bent metal from crashes — in real time by Tweeting specific hashtags at different moments during the live race. It was all about fast cars and faster thumbs.”\nCampaign results: More than 13,000 mentions in one minute - setting a record for the largest social media spike in history 640% increase in Twitter followers 22.5% live audience growth 3X year-over-year increase of engagement around race day The Impact Award The Impact Award recognized the campaign that utilized the most thoughtful, creative strategy to generate significant ROI. The winner of this award was Snickers Australia for their “ Hungerithm ” campaign.\n“With the “you’re not you when you’re hungry” brand story in mind, @SnickersAU discovered that the mood of Twitter gets surlier between meal times. Yes, even the internet gets hangry. The Snickers Hungerithm, an algorithm that monitored Twitter’s collective mood and sentiment, came to the rescue. When the mood on Twitter was chill, the price of a Snickers at 7-Eleven stayed at AU$1.75. But when the mood plummeted, so did the price. The angrier the internet became, the cheaper Snickers got. The Hungerithm connected social promotion to in-store purchases by allowing people to check Twitter’s mood every 10 minutes and claim coupons on their phones.”\nCampaign results: More than 30 million earned media impressions, and more than 150 online articles with an earned PR value of more than AUS$1.4 million 120% increase in brand mentions on Twitter 400% increase in website visits (above benchmark) More than 150,000 Snickers sold during campaign The Creativity Award The Creativity Award recognizes the most creative and innovative campaign on the platform. The winner of this category was Airbnb.\nThis weekend, #LiveInTheMovies with Airbnb. What movie would you live in? https://t.co/lvcw7smzTe\n— Airbnb (@Airbnb) February 26, 2016 “Global rental agency @Airbnb couldn’t run a TV spot during the Oscars. In fact, it couldn’t even mention the Oscars. The #LiveInTheMovies campaign was the genius workaround that allowed @Airbnb to tap into the massive Oscars audience with funny, personal, and entertaining Tweets.\nThe campaign asked the Twitter audience which movie it would most like to live in and then Tweeted back with listings that matched their dream locations — a tiny island off of Costa Rica for that one guy who wanted to live in “Jurassic Park,” for example. Then @Airbnb really went rogue (and live) by Tweeting listings that looked to be straight out of the Oscar-winning movies, as the winners were being announced on TV.”\nCampaign results: 63 million impressions 1.3 million video views Outpaced paid TV advertisers in both conversation and reach The Scale Award The Scale Award celebrates the campaign that generated the most worldwide awareness and engagement, and had a major cultural impact. The winner in this category was Dove’s “Dear Media”.\nRT if you take pride in what female athletes do, not how they look. https://t.co/ATzYkfgCRS #MyBeautyMySay pic.twitter.com/BtZG4uQtlJ\n— Dove (@Dove) August 9, 2016 “ @Dove is a leader in the movement to empower women to define beauty on their own terms. To tackle the sexist remarks written about female athletes before and during one of the world’s largest sporting events, @Dove gave fans all over the world the opportunity to Tweet the offensive statements back to the original sources with the hashtag #MyBeautyMySay . It was a powerful, interactive, and quietly confrontational way to bring everyday sexism to light.”\nCampaign results: More than than 40,000 Tweets using the #MyBeautyMySay hashtag 321 million users reached 1.2 billion earned media impressions The Customer Award The Customer Award aims to highlight the business that excelled most at using Twitter for customer service. The winner of this category was Apple Support.\nMade a mistake while using Calculator? Swipe to delete and keep crunching numbers. pic.twitter.com/K8UN2gour8\n— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) August 15, 2016 “The average online customer service response time is a long, grueling 17 hours. Hours. @AppleSupport decided to do something about that sad stat and use Twitter to respond to customer inquiries and comments. Because of the live nature of Twitter they are also able to pick up conversations with customers at any time, and incorporate rich media into responses to provide even more help to people when and where they need it most.”\nCampaign results: More than 150,000 likes and Retweets on @AppleSupport since its launch in March 2016 Ranks first among support accounts for average engagements and average engagements for followers As you may have noted, there was originally six categories – the #Growth Award which aimed to recognize small business use of Twitter ads, is absent. I’ve asked Twitter why it was excluded, but my assumption would be that they didn’t get enough entrants in this category.\nIt’s an interesting overview of some of the top performing Twitter campaigns of the year, with lessons to be learned from each. In particular, it’s interesting to note the performance metrics Twitter has used – especially for the Impact Award, which provides direct sales data. Those stats are important, as they bring a more tangible, results-driven perspective to the data, which can help others develop better understandings of how similar approaches could impact their bottom line.\nYou can visit the Twitter Marketing website for a full rundown of each category, along with Silver and Bronze medal winners in each section to provide further context on what makes a winning Twitter campaign.",

The film’s trailer was launched at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\nManan Mehta, vice president — marketing and merchandising, Yash Raj Films, said: “Twitter is the ignition point of the entire marketing strategy of Befikre. On Befikre, we have engaged and built an audience of relevant followers in the shortest time span. \n“ Befikre is the first Bollywood film to deploy the emoji and we are stoked with the audience response.”\nPratiksha Rao, head — media partnerships for Southeast Asia, Twitter, said that this is the first time Twitter has collaborated with a Bollywood movie for a special emoji.\n“We are excited to continue partnering with Yash Raj Films on their unique use of Twitter for Befikre and other upcoming projects,” said Rao.",

      "text": "OPINION: \nAs we gear up for what will surely be a combative presidential term, and as Twitter’s most toxic users succeed in poisoning the service, more pressure should be placed on the company to ensure that updated policies and tools are in place to protect users.\nNow is the time for Twitter to prove it has what it takes to curb abuse.\nCompany chief executive Jack Dorsey has publicly come out against harassment on Twitter, saying in July that “abuse is not part of civil discourse. It shuts down conversation and prevents us from understanding one another. No one deserves to be a target of abuse online and it doesn’t have a place on Twitter.” His statement came amid outcry over public figures like Leslie Jones abandoning the service after being attacked by users without any satisfactory resolution. Ultimately, Twitter terminated the offending accounts and banned Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos .\nWith Donald Trump’s rise to the presidency comes a reinvigorated spirit among trolls and those harboring hate for women, people of color, Muslims, Jews, and anyone not conforming to their vision of what the U.S. should be. USA Today reported earlier this week that white supremacists are ganging up on supporters of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, urging them to commit suicide. This is only one case in the sea of toxicity that has emerged in just the past couple of days.\nConversations will continue on Twitter, but the platform must provide not only defenses to its users, but for developers, who can filter out hurtful and demeaning tweets so that ideas and knowledge are shared. Dissenting opinions, debate, and dialogues of all sorts has its place on these platforms, but with constant abuse and harassment with little remedy can not only diminish usage but dissuade others from participating in conversations.\nAs more racism, sexism, harassment, and abuse comes out, it’s imperative that social media companies enact policies, create better tools, and empower third-party developers to protect users so a free-flowing exchange of information can occur. If Twitter wants to be a place for news and real-time conversation — the modern town square — it needs to do more to moderate its most vicious users.\nIn an SEC filing last month, Twitter promised it would implement “meaningful” safety updates in November, but has so far failed to provide specifics, instead punting the decision until after the election. As Twitter’s user-base stagnates and investors grow increasingly skeptical of its core business, what will Twitter do next? Under what will likely become a polarizing presidential term, it’s time for Twitter to put up or shut up .\nOn Wednesday, Dorsey tweeted that he believes “all people are created equal,” but what Twitter has shown signs of, at least publicly, is that trolls and abusers have more rights and protections than ordinary users — the users who still struggle to find a reason to use the service in the first place. The company may very well be working on things behind the scenes, but it’s not doing a good enough job convincing its users and everyone else that it can stand up to bullies and offer the service most people want.\nTo be fair, Twitter offers users some ways to fight back. There’s a report feature that lets you notify Twitter of harassment, and the company’s quality filter setting is now available to everyone (previously it was only available to those with verified accounts ).\nAnd Twitter has engaged with groups such as Samaritans, GLAAD, and Women, Action, and the Media to better educate it on ways to protect its users. But what’s the next logical step to empower people to defend themselves?\nWith Facebook, people have to use their real names, but on Twitter you can be anyone. With Twitter scaling beyond just its traditional service to now include live video, how will well-baked safety mechanisms factor in? Twitter has to prove it is ready for this task — that it’s not about just making it easier to tweet, but also that it’s a reasonably safe place to do so.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to tweet a message urging unity among the American people as the nation continued to show signs of division over the results of a contentious and ugly election.\n\"This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!\" Trump tweeted .\nThe president-elect's tweet came as thousands took to city streets for the fourth day after election night to protest its results , with many chanting slogans like \"not my president\" and \"no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\"\nDemonstrators have crowded in front of Trump Tower in Manhattan, blocked highways and roads across the country, and swarmed streets and college campuses in protests that have become more heated. During a march in Portland, Oregon, Friday night,  a demonstrator was shot and injured , police said. The night before, police deemed an anti-Trump protest in Portland was  a riot  because of increasingly dangerous behavior.\nTrump's most recent tweet urging unity stood in contrast to his initial response to the protests. Late Thursday night, he took to the social-media outlet to slam protesters and the media.\n\" Just had a very open and successful presidential election,\" he wrote on Twitter . \"Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\" \nWhen the tweet drew sharp criticism, Trump quickly changed his tone, tweeting : \"Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\" \nBut activists geared up for another round of demonstrations throughout the weekend. A number of groups in major cities like New York and Chicago have planned protests throughout Saturday.  \nAshley Lynne Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton and who joined a demonstration in Denver on Thursday , said of her protesting: \"It's not that we're sore losers. It's that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.\" \nNOW WATCH: 'HOLD UP!': Watch Obama defend a Trump protester and scold the crowd at a Clinton rally \n",

      "text": "  Associated Press Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print PORTLAND, Ore. –   The Latest on nationwide and international protests against President-elect Donald Trump (all times PST):\n1:25 p.m.\nSeveral thousand anti-Trump protesters are marching in downtown Los Angeles, denouncing his campaign pledge to deport people who entered the U.S. illegally and his crude comments about women.\nCheers, chants and flag-waving mark Saturday's procession, which stretches for blocks through the Civic Center.\nNo arrests have been made even though the train of demonstrators occasionally snarled traffic.\nThe mood seemed enthusiastic rather than angry. There are no reports of vandalism or fire-setting, which have marred previous demonstrations around the nation.\n___\n11:55 a.m.\nPolice have set up barricades in front of some of the most expensive stores in New York City as an anti-Donald Trump protest makes its way along Fifth Avenue.\nDuring the demonstration, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who is a Trump critic, entered the lobby of Trump Tower with a camera crew in tow and asked to see Trump. He was denied.\nMoments later, Nigel Farage, the head of the \"Leave\" movement that propelled the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, also arrived and was allowed up.\nTrump frequently links his campaign to the \"Brexit\" movement. Farage would not say if he was playing a role in Trump's transition.\n___\n11:45 a.m.\nPolice in Portland, Oregon, say they have detained four people in connection with a shooting that left one wounded during a protest of President-elect Donald Trump.\nA news release says police believe the four are gang members.\nThe man who was shot early Saturday while participating in a march is recovering and is expected to survive. Police say a shooter was in a vehicle on a bridge that spans the Willamette River and that there was a confrontation with someone in the protest march. A man got out of his vehicle and fired multiple shots before fleeing.\nPolice say 17 people have been arrested in Portland since protests began. Police said Saturday that nine people have been booked into the Multnomah County Jail. Six others were given criminal citations, and two juveniles were released to their parents.\nSince Trump's election Tuesday, thousands around the country, spurred by fear and outrage, have taken to the streets in largely non-violent protests.\n___\n10:50 a.m.\nAbout 2,000 protesters have been marching along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan shouting \"not my president\" and other slogans.\nThe protesters rallied at New York's Union Square on Saturday before picking up steam and taking their cause into the street and toward Trump Tower.\nFifth Avenue was crowded with protesters for blocks. Police lined both sides, following along on foot and on motorcycle, but the group remained peaceful.\n___\n9:55 a.m.\nIn Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted \"No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here\" as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction.\nTwenty-nine-year-old yoga teacher Sonja (SON'-yuh) Spray says she heard about the Saturday morning demonstration on Facebook and decided to join the protest over the election of Donald Trump. She carried a sign reading, \"WOMEN are NO JOKE.\"\nSpray, who voted for Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections, says she has signed an online petition urging the Electoral College to elect Clinton.\nShe says she's concerned Trump's election condones a view that women are \"playthings\" and his presidency will threaten civil rights and gay marriage. She says she's \"part of the reminder that we still have a say in our own country.\"\n___\n8:40 a.m.\nAbout 200 people have been arrested in Los Angeles after a mainly peaceful protest over the election of Donald Trump as president.\nPolice say about 3,000 people took to the streets Friday night, winding up near City Hall after several hours of marching. Some waved American flags or carried signs reading \"Not My President.\"\nPolice began breaking up the protest at around 2 a.m. Saturday and arrested people for failure to disperse.\nPolice tell City News Service that three juveniles were arrested during the march for throwing a bottle at a police officer, vandalizing a police cruiser and curfew violation.\nThousands are expected to join protests throughout the weekend in L.A., San Francisco, Las Vegas and overseas.\n___\n7:50 a.m.\nAbout 300 people protested Donald Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy by the German capital's landmark Brandenburg Gate.\nThe peaceful protesters Saturday waved signs with slogans like \"Love Trumps Hate\" and \"Make Love, Not Trump.\"\nAhead of national elections in Germany next year, the anti-immigrant nationalist Alternative For Germany party, known as AfD, has been gaining support. One protester's sign read \"Germany: Don't make the same mistake in 2017, AfD=Trump.\"\nAfD co-leader Frauke Petry applauded Trump's election, saying Friday it offered \"a historic opportunity to address erroneous global economic and social developments of the past decades.\"\nPresident Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump's election.\n___\n3:35 a.m.\nPolice in Portland, Oregon, say a person has been injured in a shooting on a Willamette (wil-AM'-it) River bridge during a protest of President-elect Donald Trump.\nAuthorities say the person has been taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and police are looking for the suspect.\nThey say the suspect was in a vehicle early Saturday morning on the Morrison Bridge and there was a confrontation with someone in the protest march.\nA police news release says the man got out of his vehicle and fired multiple shots injuring the person before fleeing, likely in his vehicle.\nSince Trump's election Tuesday, thousands around the country, spurred by fear and outrage, have taken to the streets in largely non-violent protests.\n___\n1:30 a.m.\nPolice in Portland, Oregon, say they are investigating a shooting on a bridge where people protesting President-elect Donald Trump were marching.\nPolice on Saturday morning said on Twitter that they were \"investigating shooting on Morrison Bridge. One person down. Everyone needs to leave the area immediately!\"\nPolice earlier had tweeted that protesters were headed to the bridge, which spans the Willamette River in Portland. Authorities were asking potential witnesses to \"line up on the south side of the bridge and wait to talk to police.\"\nNo further information was released.\nOn Friday night, police said they used flash-bang grenades to disperse a crowd filled with hundreds of people in the area downtown area.\nSpurred by fear and outrage, demonstrators around the country were marching to protest Trump's victory.\nThe spirited demonstrations Friday on college campuses and along downtown streets were mostly peaceful following previous outbreaks of window-smashing and fire-setting.\n____\n10:30 p.m.\nPortland, Oregon police are using flash-bang grenades Friday night to disperse a crowd filled with hundreds of people protesting President-elect Donald Trump.\nPortland Police said on Twitter those were the only devices being used at the time to move protesters out of the area downtown.\nPolice said three separate marches were taking place throughout the city.\nSpurred by fear and outrage, demonstrators around the country were marching to protest Trump's victory.\nThe spirited demonstrations Friday on college campuses and along downtown streets were mostly peaceful following previous outbreaks of window-smashing and fire-setting.",

Law Enforcement Division officials will work to determine the cause of the fire and where it started. Fire Chief Reece Bertholf says the blaze broke out early Saturday morning.\nBefore the building broke ground, someone spray painted \"Racist\" in red letters on its sign in July 2015.\nBeaufort County Black Chamber CEO and president Larry Holman says the fire could set the $2.2 million project back at least a year. It was to be completed in December with a grand opening in January.\nBeaufort County is about 100 miles south of Charleston.",

(AP) Zack Drayer threw three touchdown passes and ran for one, helping St. Francis to a Northeast Conference championship and an automatic bid to the FCS playoffs with a 31-21 win over Central Connecticut on Saturday.\nBoth feats are first-time achievements for the Red Flash, who joined the conference in 1998.\nSt. Francis (7-3, 5-0) led 17-7 after one quarter, but Jacob Dolegala's second TD pass cut it to 17-14. St. Francis pulled away with TD conversions off muffed punts in the second and third quarters, both capped by Drayer touchdowns.\nMore from FoxSports Kansas attempts tricky camouflage kick return Oklahoma players and fans show respect for injured Baylor QB White burns Longhorns with great TD catch on his back Holgorsen explodes on RBs coach after red zone fumble Drayer ran for a 2-yard score with 6:42 left in the first half to make it 24-14, and he tossed a 6-yard TD to Zack Drayer with 11:47 left in the third quarter to salt the game away. Both drives started within 25 yards of the Blue Devils' goal line.\nDolegala passed for 318 yards and two touchdowns and added a rushing TD for Central Connecticut (2-8, 1-4).\nSt. Francis has won two in a row vs. CCSU after losing 19 of its first 22 against the Blue Devils.",
