      "text": "December 6, 2016 11:02 AM High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

      "text": "Donald Trump has ditched his stakes in Apple, Google , J.P. Morgan Chase, Nike , Microsoft , a spokesperson for the president-elect said Tuesday.\nThe investment moves, which included selling shares of not only those companies, but all of his stakes in public traded companies, appear to be part of the president-elect’s effort to remove some of the many conflicts of interest Trump will have to tackle as president. \nTrump Transition spokesperson Jason Miller told reporters that the real estate mogul made the stock sales in June. The disclosure came on a call with reporters after one asked about Trump’s stake in Boeing--a company that Trump criticized on Twitter Tuesday .\nCritics have argued that Trump’s stock holdings could be a conflict of interest for the president-elect after he steps in to the White House on Jan. 20. The president-elect held an interest in several financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, as well as energy companies such as Halliburton and ExxonMobil. Those holdings have worried onlookers, who say that it could skew the president-elect’s stance of Wall Street regulation and climate change. Trump had already gotten criticism for owning a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company trying to develop the Dakota Access Pipeline .\nIt’s unclear when exactly Trump sold out of those holdings, though the S&P 500 was up roughly 2% at the beginning of June, before falling following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union on June 24.\nGranted, Trump had a relatively small fraction of his over wealth in the stock market, according to May filings with the Federal Election Commission. Just $91.5 million of his estimated $4 billion net worth was invested in the stock market, many of which were large-cap, value stocks, which generally do better than others when the market drops. But it also means that he hasn’t benefitted from the so-called Trump Bump. The stock market is up over 3% since Trump was elected president. \nThe bulk of Trump’s wealth is still tied up in his real estate development company, which will continue to create conflicts for the president-elect, and be an issue for critics.\nHere were Trump’s 14 biggest stock holdings, according to the May filing , including shares of companies that Trump criticized on the campaign trail . (Campaign finance disclosure laws only require candidates give a range of value for their investments.)\n14. Alphabet : $100,000 to $200,000\n13. Caterpillar : $100,000 to $200,000\n12. Phillips 66 : $100,000 to $200,000 \n\n11. Celgene : $100,000 to $250,000\n10. Gilead Sciences : $100,000 to $250,000\n9. Visa : $100,000 to $251,000\n8. General Electric : $100,000 to $250,000\n7. Johnson and Johnson : $100,000 to $250,000\n6. Nike : $100,000 to $250,000\n5. McKesson : $100,000 to $250,000\n4. J.P. Morgan Chase : $100,000 to $251,000\n3. PepsiCo: $150,000 to $350,000\n2. Microsoft : $300,000 to $600,000\n1. Apple : $600,000 to $1.251 million\nTrump is also expected to discuss his business holdings, as well as plans for the Trump Organization, at a Dec. 15 news conference. Trump has said he plans to turn over operations of his company to his adult children, though he has not given details on that transition.",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 2:02 PM High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

      "text": "\nThe long and bloody court battle between Samsung and Apple over design patents took yet another turn today. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that Samsung does not have to pay $399 million to Apple, overturning an earlier appeals court ruling in this case.\nSee also: Samsung officially takes the Apple Patent case to the Supreme Court December 14, 2015 This case started in 2011 when Apple filed a lawsuit against Samsung, claiming the Korean company had violated its design and other patents for its iPhone on many of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones. In 2012, a jury ruled in Apple’s favor, stating Samsung must pay $930 million in damages. In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the jury’s verdict, but also ruled the iPhone’s appearance could not be protected through trademarks, and cut Samsung’s payment down to $548 million, which it paid Apple in December of that year ,\nHowever, Samsung decided to take the case to the Supreme Court . Today all of the Justices ruled that patent violators, like Samsung in this case, don’t have to give up all the profits of their device that is infringing on patents, if the violations are just for specific components in that product.\nThe battle between the two tech titans is not over yet. The Supreme Court has now sent the matter back to the lower courts to see if they can decide what specific patents, and what amount of money, should be considered in this case. In other words, get ready for more legal briefs and court documents to come in this legal slug fest.",

(Source: Raycom Media) By SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"   Science & technology news More>>",

      "text": "WHAT: A new version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" from Apple to showcase the iPhone 7&apos;s dual camera system.\nWHO: Apple\nWHY WE CARE : A (very) young and winsome Juliet anxiously awaits her Romeo. Clad in a swishing, silken cape, the similarly youthful Romeo runs through the moonlit streets of Verona and arrives at the Capulet castle. The star-crossed youngsters deliver a perfect rendition of the balcony scene from Act II Scene II of Shakespeare’s classic.\nWho is the producer of this cinematic epic? Some heavyweight Hollywood type? Nah, actually it’s just dad. It’s Juliet’s dad with an iPhone 7, demonstrating that the phone’s camera system capabilities are so advanced that a video of your kid’s school play can feel like a real movie. Even when you’re so choked with parental pride your eyes are filled with tears.\nThe 30-second spot is the latest in Apple’s \"Practically Magic\" campaign, which kicked off in September with \" Balloons ,\" a spot launching expressive messaging. Both ads clearly aiming to convey the human emotions that can be experienced when using devices, rather than the nuts and bolts of the technology.",

      "title": "The Jony Ive Computer Apple Didn’t Include In Its Monograph | Co.Design | business + design",
      "text": "Perhaps you heard. A few weeks ago, Apple released a book called Designed by Apple in California : a $300 hardcover containing 450 photos of Apple products, chronicling almost 20 years of Apple&apos;s industrial design—and specifically, Jony Ive &apos;s Apple industrial design.\nApple sent me a review copy. My first impression? At almost 12 pounds, Designed by Apple in California is Apple&apos;s heaviest product this side of a 27-inch iMac. Seriously, there are weaponized toilet tank lids that weigh less than this thing.\nBut I also thought where the book started was interesting: 1998&apos;s candy-colored iMac G3, the first Mac released after Steve Jobs came to Apple. This is an important computer, true. But it&apos;s not the first computer Jony Ive designed for Apple. Nor is it his most forward-looking.\nThat honor would go to the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, sometimes shortened as the TAM, first released in 1997 at the eye-watering price of $7,499, or about double what a Mac Pro will cost you today. Only 12,000 were ever made, making it a collector&apos;s item to this day.\nWhat&apos;s amazing about the TAM is that it foreshadows a lot of the work Ive would do on the Mac line over the next two decades. Like the current iMac, it&apos;s a slim, flat-screen all-in-one, released during an era when computers were distinctly cube-shaped. Everything&apos;s integrated: the screen, the speakers, the disc drive, and so on. It had an LCD screen, five years before they came to the rest of the Mac line, and weighed half as much as the iMac G3, released the following year.\nIf Apple under Ive has been defined by its obsessive pursuit of ever thinner, lighter devices, then the TAM was ahead of its time. But it&apos;s interesting to see other future Apple innovations the TAM took a stab at. Consider, for example, the fact that the TAM shipped with a removable trackpad that could be used alongside the keyboard, 13 years before Apple unveiled the Magic Trackpad .\nIt&apos;s true, the TAM doesn&apos;t share the same material sensibility as later Ive designs. It&apos;s mostly plastic, but that was typical of the era: Apple wouldn&apos;t really switch over to aluminum and glass as its primary materials for another decade. Yet, in this promotional video, a young, skinny, and curiously unshaven Ive delivers a very familiar sounding ode to the care his team put into the TAM&apos;s material process: The die-cast metal foot, for example, or the addition of metallic flaking to the plastic lacquer used in the case, all to give the TAM a premium feel and luster.\nIn any design retrospective of Ive&apos;s time at Apple, the TAM is an important computer to mention. So why is it missing from Designed by Apple in California?\nSpeculatively, there are two possible reasons why the TAM didn&apos;t make the cut ( Co.Design reached out to Apple to find out more, and will update this post when we receive a response). First of all, Ive designed it before Steve Jobs took back the company; everything else in the book is decidedly post-Jobs. Second, Jobs himself reportedly hated the TAM , and made one of his first acts upon coming back as CEO the product&apos;s discontinuation. (This was also the period during which he briefly considered firing Ive .)\nOutside of that, though, I think a big reason why Ive might have decided not to include it in Designed by Apple in California is simply that it doesn&apos;t share the same design language as the rest of the products in the book. It feels like a prototype, while the other products feel fully formed; a compromised iteration of Ive&apos;s grand vision pushed through a corporate culture that wasn&apos;t yet ready to truly let Ive put industrial design first and foremost.\nThat&apos;s an understandable perspective, but it&apos;s still a shame that it&apos;s missing from Designed by Apple in California. Because as Ive points out with all of his typical, soft-spoken, navel-gazing eloquence in the TAM promotional video above: \"While [the TAM] doesn&apos;t have the answers for all the questions it asks, it&apos;s an important product . . . \" It&apos;s the thesis of so much of Ive&apos;s work at Apple to follow.",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nBut Apple may see 'disproportionately large chunk' of wearable sales this quarter with late-September Series 2 launch\nFitbit Inc. may have had a few downtrodden quarters and provided a disappointing holiday outlook, but the company's 11% increase in shipments during the third quarter may be a bellwether of better-than-expected holiday sales.\nFitness bands continued to outpace smartwatches during the fall quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-shipments-plunge-70-in-third-quarter-2016-12-05), climbing 3.1% to 23 million shipments, while the smartwatch category tumbled 52% to 2.8 million units from 5.5 million in the year-earlier period, according to a report published this week from industry tracker IDC.\nFitness bands, which don't tether to smartphones and sync with third-party apps like their more advanced smartwatch brethren, are expected to maintain a commanding lead over smartwatches during the holiday shopping season, according to analysts.\n\"I'm bullish on the immediate and short-term prospects for fitness bands,\" said Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearable team.\n\"Fitbit(FIT) will do well [during] the holidays,\" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at tech-consulting company Moor Insights & Strategy.\nFitbit's share of the overall wearables market climbed to 23% last quarter from 21.4% in the year-earlier period as shipments rose an estimated 11%, according to IDC. China's Xiaomi, which makes the Mi fitness band, followed as a close second with a 16.5% share.\nApple Inc.(AAPL) may also benefit from a strong holiday quarter in its wearables division. It launched the Series 2 just ahead of the holiday shopping season, which should help it maintain its market lead in the niche smartwatch market category.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/lBmjTRpDUON)\nApple's share of the smartwatch market fell to 41.3% in the calendar third quarter, compared with 70.3% in the year-earlier period, while next-closest competitor Garmin Ltd.'s(GRMN) share skyrocketed to 20.5% from just 2.3% in the year-earlier period. However, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 2 and cut prices for the first-generation watch with just two weeks left in the calendar third quarter, which means the fourth quarter could show lopsidedly higher demand as the product category benefits from pent-up demand for a watch refresh and holiday promotions.\n\"Apple Watch will see a disproportionately large chunk of its sales this year in the fourth quarter,\" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at tech-consulting company Jackdaw Research.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters this week that Apple recorded the best sell-through rate ever for the watch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-rallies-after-ceo-cook-tries-to-reassure-investors-2016-12-06) during the first week of holiday sales. That wouldn't be reflected in IDC's report, which covers the calendar third quarter that ended on September 30, but could serve as a bellwether for a year-over-year improvement in Apple Watch calendar fourth-quarter sales.\n\"I think Apple planned for the holiday quarter very purposefully and played to the strengths of where the market is right now\" with products such as the Nike-branded runner's watch that focus on health and fitness, said Llamas.\nStill, challenges for all wearable companies, including the market leaders, remain, and will likely surface again after the holidays.\nApple's share of the total wearables market declined during the quarter, with shipments tumbling 71% year-over-year and its share declining to 1.1% from 3.9% in the year-earlier period, according to IDC. Garmin's share rose slightly to 5.7% from 5.3% in the year-earlier period, fueled by the success of its fitness bands.\nFitbit, meanwhile, needs to assess how to maintain its growth after the holiday rush is over, particularly as the company comes off a weaker-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings report, said Moorhead. Last month, Fitbit provided a revenue outlook for the holiday quarter between $725 million and $750 million, which was sharply below the $985 million analysts had forecast in a FactSet survey. Analysts have since tempered those expectations, and are now calling for sales of $741 million, in line with Fitbit's view. But Fitbit's estimate nevertheless implies year-over-year growth of just 4%, which would mark a quarter-over-quarter deceleration.\nFitbit needs \"to focus on a broader strategy of what they're going to be when they grow up because the segment there and now is not high growth,\" Moorhead said.\nShares of Apple rose 0.2% to $109.35 in early afternoon trade, though they remain down 8.1% in the past 12 months. Those of Fitbit fell 1.5% to $7.91, though they're down a whopping 76% from 12 months ago. Garmin's stock fell 0.5% to $51.86 on Tuesday, but it's up 37% on the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, is up close to 8% in the past year. The Nasdaq Composite has risen more than 3.5%.\n-Jennifer Booton;\n 1420ET\n ",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File An Apple iPhone at left, and a Samsung Galaxy S III. The phones are the subject of a long-running legal battle between the two companies; Apple was awarded millions of dollars from Samsung for copying patented design elements of the iPhone, but Samsung is challenging that ruling at the Supreme Court. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Oakland Warehouse Manager Refuses to Answer Safety Questions Apple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. Extreme Weather: Snow in Hawaii AP At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. 1 or 2 Hours Less Sleep for Driver Increases Crash Risk: Study But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nBut Apple may see 'disproportionately large chunk' of wearable sales this quarter with late-September Series 2 launch\nFitbit Inc. may have had a few downtrodden quarters and provided a disappointing holiday outlook, but the company's 11% increase in shipments during the third quarter may be a bellwether of better-than-expected holiday sales.\nFitness bands continued to outpace smartwatches during the fall quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-watch-shipments-plunge-70-in-third-quarter-2016-12-05), climbing 3.1% to 23 million shipments, while the smartwatch category tumbled 52% to 2.8 million units from 5.5 million in the year-earlier period, according to a report published this week from industry tracker IDC.\nFitness bands, which don't tether to smartphones and sync with third-party apps like their more advanced smartwatch brethren, are expected to maintain a commanding lead over smartwatches during the holiday shopping season, according to analysts.\n\"I'm bullish on the immediate and short-term prospects for fitness bands,\" said Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearable team.\n\"Fitbit(FIT) will do well [during] the holidays,\" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at tech-consulting company Moor Insights & Strategy.\nFitbit's share of the overall wearables market climbed to 23% last quarter from 21.4% in the year-earlier period as shipments rose an estimated 11%, according to IDC. China's Xiaomi, which makes the Mi fitness band, followed as a close second with a 16.5% share.\nApple Inc.(AAPL) may also benefit from a strong holiday quarter in its wearables division. It launched the Series 2 just ahead of the holiday shopping season, which should help it maintain its market lead in the niche smartwatch market category.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/lBmjTRpDUON)\nApple's share of the smartwatch market fell to 41.3% in the calendar third quarter, compared with 70.3% in the year-earlier period, while next-closest competitor Garmin Ltd.'s(GRMN) share skyrocketed to 20.5% from just 2.3% in the year-earlier period. However, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 2 and cut prices for the first-generation watch with just two weeks left in the calendar third quarter, which means the fourth quarter could show lopsidedly higher demand as the product category benefits from pent-up demand for a watch refresh and holiday promotions.\n\"Apple Watch will see a disproportionately large chunk of its sales this year in the fourth quarter,\" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at tech-consulting company Jackdaw Research.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters this week that Apple recorded the best sell-through rate ever for the watch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apples-stock-rallies-after-ceo-cook-tries-to-reassure-investors-2016-12-06) during the first week of holiday sales. That wouldn't be reflected in IDC's report, which covers the calendar third quarter that ended on September 30, but could serve as a bellwether for a year-over-year improvement in Apple Watch calendar fourth-quarter sales.\n\"I think Apple planned for the holiday quarter very purposefully and played to the strengths of where the market is right now\" with products such as the Nike-branded runner's watch that focus on health and fitness, said Llamas.\nStill, challenges for all wearable companies, including the market leaders, remain, and will likely surface again after the holidays.\nApple's share of the total wearables market declined during the quarter, with shipments tumbling 71% year-over-year and its share declining to 1.1% from 3.9% in the year-earlier period, according to IDC. Garmin's share rose slightly to 5.7% from 5.3% in the year-earlier period, fueled by the success of its fitness bands.\nFitbit, meanwhile, needs to assess how to maintain its growth after the holiday rush is over, particularly as the company comes off a weaker-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings report, said Moorhead. Last month, Fitbit provided a revenue outlook for the holiday quarter between $725 million and $750 million, which was sharply below the $985 million analysts had forecast in a FactSet survey. Analysts have since tempered those expectations, and are now calling for sales of $741 million, in line with Fitbit's view. But Fitbit's estimate nevertheless implies year-over-year growth of just 4%, which would mark a quarter-over-quarter deceleration.\nFitbit needs \"to focus on a broader strategy of what they're going to be when they grow up because the segment there and now is not high growth,\" Moorhead said.\nShares of Apple rose 0.2% to $109.35 in early afternoon trade, though they remain down 8.1% in the past 12 months. Those of Fitbit fell 1.5% to $7.91, though they're down a whopping 76% from 12 months ago. Garmin's stock fell 0.5% to $51.86 on Tuesday, but it's up 37% on the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, is up 7.5% in the past year. The Nasdaq Composite has risen more than 6%.\n-Jennifer Booton;\n 1414ET\n ",

      "text": "A A \nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \n\n© 2016 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close ",

Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, Senior Research Analyst, IDC Mobile Device Trackers. \nBasic wearables, primarily comprised of fitness bands, accounted for 85 per cent of the market and experienced double-digit growth. \nFitbit, with a 23 percent share, was once again the market leader in the third quarter as the vendor released a long-awaited refresh for the \"Charge HR\" wireless activity wristband with \"Charge 2\". \nXiaomi stood second with 16.5 per cent market share. \"The company across all business lines continues to struggle to gain any significant traction outside China,\" the report added. \nWith a market share of 5.7 percent, Garmin stood third as the company with one of the widest portfolios among all the vendors. \n\"The company managed to expand its channel presence over the past year, focusing on numerous sports equipment chains and independent retailers,\" the report noted. \nSamsung, with 4.5 percent market share, stood fifth and the company was able to sustain shipments of its Gear S2, particularly the cellular-enabled versions, through various wireless service providers, the findings showed. \nIDC expects the momentum for basic wearables to continue for the remainder of 2016. However, smart wearables capable of running third-party apps will likely continue to struggle in the near term.",

      "text": "  The case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n“The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n“Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty — knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNo clarity \nObservers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n“Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n“Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,” he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of “fundamental principles of visual design.” \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n“By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties’ ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,” Goldman told AFP.",

      "text": "7 creative decals that'll make us miss Apple's glowing MacBook logo It's the end of an era: the glowing Apple logo is dead. TJ Donegan December 05, 2016 \nOver the past two years, Apple has continuously overhauled most of its existing product lineup with fresh new designs. From the iPhone, to the iPad, to the MacBook, Apple has shown that it's not afraid to, in the parlance of editors everywhere, \"kill its darlings.\" \nWhile some of these changes are clearly for the better, many could charitably be described as \"puzzling.\" But not all of these changes have received the same amount of attention. One change that hasn't received much press: the death of the glowing Apple logo on the MacBook. \nBeginning with the 12-inch MacBook that debuted last year and carrying over to the newest MacBook Pro models, the glowing Apple logo on the back of MacBooks has been replaced. Where the logo used to be a piece of translucent plastic that allowed the screen's backlight to shine through is now a simple piece of reflective metal. \nWhile it brings the design of the MacBooks more in line with the iPhone (which have a similar reflective logo), it's just not as clever or unique of a design. Everyone has reflective metal logos. They're boring. It also means the death of one of the last vestiges of the \"fun\" Apple design ethos that carried the company from the candy-coated iMacs of the 1990s up until the iPhone a decade ago. \nBut in true Irish wake fashion, we're not here to just mourn the death of one of our favorite design touches; we're here to celebrate it, and the creative ways people have dressed the logo up to make it their own. The best part? You can still buy these, along with one of the few MacBooks that still have glowing logos to pair them with.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago \nYesterday, Apple released new beta builds of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, and watchOS 3.1.1 . tvOS 10.1 was notably missing from the mix, so it's no surprise that the company seeded Developer Beta 5 today. \nThe release notes for today's build - which is 14U593 - don't show anything specific that's new. The update itself will include bug fixes and stability improvements, as well as the new TV app (which will also be in iOS 10.2) that was announced in October . \nTV is meant to be a hub for all of your video content, with the exception of Netflix, which won't be supported . While it works across numerous apps, you'll be able to purchase TV shows and movies from iTunes, and get recommendations through the Watch Now section. \nWhen Apple announced the app, it said that it would arrive via a software update in December, so you shouldn't have to wait too long for a public release of tvOS 10.1, as well as iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2, and watchOS 3.1.1. Of course, there is no Public Beta program for tvOS. Tags",

      "title": "Chinese Consumer Group Complains of Spontaneous iPhone 6 Fires, but Apple Blames 'Physical Damage'",
      "text": "  Chinese Consumer Group Complains of Spontaneous iPhone 6 Fires, but Apple Blames 'Physical Damage' Tuesday December 6, 2016 11:36 am PST by Juli Clover As Apple's iPhone 6s is facing scrutiny in China over a battery issue that causes unexpected shutdowns, a Chinese consumer group has complained of a separate problem with the iPhone 6 - spontaneous battery fires. According to the The Wall Street Journal , the Shanghai Consumer Council says it received eight reports from Chinese users claiming their smartphones spontaneously caught on fire, but Apple inspected the devices and says \"external physical damage\" is to blame. Apple said it analyzed the affected phones and found that the fires followed \"external physical damage.\" The company encouraged customers with issues to visit an Apple store or contact company support. \"We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,\" Apple said in a statement. Given that the iPhone 6 has been available since 2014 and there have been no notable reports of device fires, Apple's physical damage explanation rings true. With the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which had a true faulty part leading to fires, reports from around the world started flooding in just weeks after the device was released. Complaints from Chinese consumer groups over iPhone 6s battery problems led Apple to introduce a repair program for iPhone 6s devices that unexpectedly shut down, and Apple has gone out of its way in China to explain the issue and assure customers that it is not safety related. Apple's repair program will see it providing new batteries to customers with iPhone 6s devices primarily manufactured between September and October of 2015. Just today, Apple expanded the repair program to encompass a small number of customers \"outside of the affected range\" who are also experiencing shutdowns. On its Chinese site , Apple explained that the iPhone 6s shutdown issue was caused by exposure to \"controlled ambient air\" during the manufacturing process, which caused the battery to degrade faster than a normal battery. Next week, Apple plans to introduce a diagnostic tool that will allow it to gather information and better manage battery performance levels to prevent shutdowns. With iOS 10 .2 nearly ready to launch, it's likely the diagnostic capability will be included in that update. As Apple's third largest market after the United States and Europe, China has become increasingly important to Apple over the last several years. Apple has made an effort to introduce a number of retail stores in the country, and it has made a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing . Despite its efforts, Apple has struggled in China. In Apple's third quarter earnings report , revenue in China was down 33 percent year over year, dropping from $13 billion in 3Q 2015 to $8.9 billion in 3Q 2016. Chinese officials have said Apple is \"too deeply established in the country's core industries,\" and along with recent trouble over its iPhones, Apple has also struggled with its iTunes Movie and iBooks Store in China, which were shut down by Chinese administrators in April and did not return until September .",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Supreme Court slashes Apple's patent victory over Samsung The Supreme Court unanimously decided Apple is not entitled to profits from Samsung's Galaxy phone line, but is entitled to the value of the copied elements. | Topic: Mobility \niPhone 6 vs Samsung Galaxy S6. Image: Josh Miller/CNET \nApple just got its profits sliced by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). In its Samsung design patent case decision, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Court states Samsung should only pay Apple for infringement based on the design of the copied components , not the entire phone. This will save Samsung, and cost Apple, hundreds of millions. \nOriginally, Apple had been awarded $399 million for Samsung's design infringement of Apple iPhone's patented rounded corners and user interface. Now, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will decide how much Samsung owes Apple. \nSCOTUS reasoned that, while the Patent Act's Section 289 states selling an \"article of manufacture\" with a patented design is illegal, and that patent infringers \"shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit ,\" the law was too broadly applied in this case. Sotomayor explained, an \"article of manufacture\" incorporates both the entire product and its components. Therefore, the earlier decision that Samsung should pay damages based on the sales of its smartphones \"cannot be squared\" with the patent law. \"Thus reading 'article of manufacture' in §289 to cover only an end product sold to a consumer gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase .\" \nSamsung had argued this exact point. Samsung claimed that since a design patent is applied to only a component of a product, legal penalties should be limited to those profits attributable to the component . Samsung had argued that that the logic behind Apple's $399-million victory could have been applied to all the profits from an 18-wheel tractor-trailer , which included a patent infringing single cup holder. SCOTUS agreed. It's not known yet exactly how much this victory will save Samsung.",

Apple Offers iPhone 7 Plus Portrait Mode Tips From Professional Photographers Learn from some of the best by Brent Dirks December 6, 2016 \nTo help get the most out of the awesome iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode, Apple has just offered a host of great tips from professional photographers . \nOfficially arriving with iOS 10.1 , portrait mode – also known as the bokeh effect – has been previously revered for high-end DSLR cameras. Some beautiful images Credit: Apple \nHead over to Apple’s site to see all of the spectacular images. Apple also talks to the photographers for some great real-world tips: \nWedding photographer Benj Haisch said Portrait mode “is absolutely changing the way I look at mobile photography. Having a wide angle 28 mm equivalent paired with the 56 mm equivalent and Portrait mode has been game-changer in achieving professional results without bringing any additional equipment.” He says, “having soft, diffused lighting will help with keeping the photo flattering to your subject. Find a space that isn’t too busy or distracting, as Portrait mode will create a photo that really pops.” \nI’ve been using Portrait mode since it arrived in October , and have been extremely impressed. \nIf you’re still in the market for an iPhone 7 and are on the fence about what model to purchase, Portrait Mode alone is enough for me to recommend the larger iPhone 7 Plus to virtually anyone, especially users who rely on the handset as their go-to camera. \nThe special effect is reserved only for the larger iPhone 7 because of the dual-lens camera that features both a telephoto and wide-angle lens. \nCombining the dual lenses along with advanced machine learning allows the iPhone to capture an image with the subject sharp and in focus while the background is blurred.

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. Cupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Samsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. The patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. On the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 2:02 PM High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

      "text": "12/06/16 AT 2:13 PM Close \nSamsung may not be as guilty of copying Apple’s designs in a legal sense, but it sure seems to be following in its footsteps according to a rumor first reported by SamMobile that claims the company will remove the headphone jack on its Galaxy S8. \nSamsung’s move to remove the headphone jack from its flagship smartphone shouldn’t come as a total shock. The company does have a “keeping up with the Joneses” type rivalry with Apple, so it’s only right the Korean manufacturer would follow suit with the Cupertino company’s decision to ditch the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 . \nRumors about the Galaxy S8 being without headphone jack had been circulating for some time, as well. Reports earlier this year from Digital Music News indicated the company would move toward creating a proprietary USB-C headphone connector. \nSamsung wouldn’t be the first company to make the jump to the USB-C port for audio output, either. Motorola’s Moto Z and Moto Z Force devices have already adopted the universal port for audio purposes, as have some Chinese smartphone manufacturers. \nThe decision to ditch the headphone jack will of course appear as though it’s an attempt to copy Apple, but it may also serve as a way to block the company. \nApple is a backer of the USB-C port—making it the primary port on its laptop line for everything including charging the device—but it’s yet to embrace the plug for audio. Its laptops still sport a headphone jack and the iPhone allows wired audio through the company’s proprietary Lightning port. Related Stories",

      "text": "Rob Lever | AFP | Published — Wednesday 7 December 2016 \nThis file photo taken on August 1, 2016 shows the Samsung logo displayed on a screen prior to the start of a launch event for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in New York. (AFP / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Drew Angerer) \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era.The justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court.The 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.”But the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty.“The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion.“Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.”The court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details.The case is one element of the $548 million penalty — knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents.Observers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property.Dennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent.“Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post.Crouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation.“Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,” he wrote.Samsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation.Apple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of “fundamental principles of visual design.”Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device.“By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties’ ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,” Goldman told AFP.

Apple was not immediately available to comment.\nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in its home town, Cupertino, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them. The department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant’s existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nFor more about Apple, watch: \nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.",

The price of Apple Watch Series 2 is $369 and $269 for series 1. Of course, that's the price for the basic models, if you are looking for something fancier, the price can go up to as high as $1099.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Founders of Apple’s Anobit Co-lead $10 Million Investment in Israeli Security Startup \nSecdo, a cybersecurity startup with offices in New York and Israel, has raised $10 million in venture capital funding from some high profile investors. \nLeading the Series A round were RDC, an arm of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elron Electronic Industries elrnf ; Marius Nacht, cofounder and chairman of Check Point Software Technologies chkp , Israel’s most well-known cybersecurity firm; and the founders of Anobit, a semiconductor chip designer that Apple aapl acquired for as much as $400 million to $500 million in 2011. \nShai Morag, Secdo cofounder and CEO, and several of the company’s backers share a common history. Morag, Check Point’s Nacht and Anobit’s Ofir Shalvi are veterans of Talpiot, a prestigious and highly exclusive leadership program within the Israel Defense Forces. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nGil Barak, chief technology officer and cofounder of Secdo, said that the idea for the two-year-old company grew partly out of his experience in the Israeli military’s Unit 8200, often described as Israel’s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency. \n“We tried to create a platform that mimics what a high tier security forensics investigator in an enterprise would do, like Mandiant-type investigations,” Barak told Fortune on a call, referring to Mandiant, the well-known incident response arm of the cybersecurity firm FireEye feye , which FireEye picked up for about $1 billion a couple of years ago . \n“With Secdo the process is entirely automated,” he said. For more on cybersecurity, watch: \nSecdo aims to sift through the deluge of security alerts that flood corporate security operations centers and automatically take defensive action based on that information. The tool is designed to record the activity within an organization’s IT systems, trace breaches back to their source, and fix the problems. \n“Security teams are overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to respond effectively due to limited resources and the complexity of forensic collection and analysis,” Secdo CEO Morag said in a statement. \nOn a call with Fortune , Anobit’s Shalvi compared the technology to the systems that protect casinos, which have to deal with all kinds of threats to their business. \n“Just collecting an entire video feed from cameras is not effective,” Shalvi said. “It’s not just about recording everything, but about building a story in smart way.” \nSecdo said it would use the funding to expand its sales in the U.S., its customer support, and its research and development.

      "text": "Apple Watch sales are \"off the charts\" according to Tim Cook Don't worry, Apple's smartwatch is doing just fine... Tuesday December 6, 2016 @michaelsawh \nTim Cook has revealed that Apple Watch sales are at a record high just a day after an IDC report suggested sales of its smartwatch had declined by 71% year-on-year. \nWhile Apple never shares precise sales figures of its devices, Cook gave an update via email to Reuters suggesting that all is good on the wearable front and that sales are \"off the charts\". \nRead this : Swimming with Apple Watch Series 2 and Fitbit Flex 2 \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook said. \n\"During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he added. \nIDC's latest report suggested that Apple had sold 1.1 million of its smartwatches in Q3 2016. That's in comparison to 3.9 million Watch sales for the same period last year. \nWe should factor in of course that this covers a period prior to the launch of the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2 , the latter of which scored very well in our review. We also named the Series 2 our Smartwatch and Wearable of the Year . \nStill, it's unsurprising that Cook has come out in defence of the Apple Watch, but with no precise sales figures, it's still impossible to know how well it's actually doing.

You'll also be able to view GPS signal strength and get live audio cues to keep you informed on your progress. \nRunkeeper, which was bought by Asics earlier this year , is the first of the major fitness apps to become more Series 2 friendly. We're expecting more to follow suit with Strava having already confirmed that it is working on a new Apple Watch app that's expected to land in 2017. \nThe latest update is available to download now. If you're giving it a try, let us know what you make of it when you're out running and cycling with your Apple Watch. Shop for recommended smartwatches on Amazon Samsung Gear S2",

      "title": "SCOTUS Trims Restitution for Apple in Samsung Copyright Case",
      "text": "SCOTUS Trims Restitution for Apple in Samsung Copyright Case \nAttorneys for Samsung have likened the case to making an automaker turn over the full profits for a car, for infringing on cup holder design. The Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled on Dec. 6 that Samsung does not have to give up $399 million in profits for copying aspects of Apple's iPhone design into its Android phones. The court ruled Dec. 6 that the South Korean IT products giant does not have to return all the profits from its phones that were found to infringe upon Apple's copyrighted design of the iPhone. Thus it is not liable for at least $399 million of the $930 million patent-infringement award Apple wants as restitution. Thus, Apple may be able to recover damages from Samsung based on the profits the South Korean company made only from the feature or features that were infringed upon--not the entire smartphone. This indicates Samsung may still be liable for the remaining $531 million the plaintiff is asking the court to mandate. The case will continue in courts at a later date predicated on that premise. Case Defines Difference Between Design and Utility IP The case defines into sharp resolution the legal differences in separating the design and utility intellectual property of a device. The Supreme Court's decision brings damages law for design patents into accord with the damages law for utility patents, intellectual property attorney Case Collard of Dorsey & Whitney told eWEEK in a media advisory. \"No longer can a patent holder get all of the profits from the sales of a product infringing a design patent. Instead, they may recover the profits attributable to the infringing feature,\" Collard said. \"Design patents are an often overlooked tool to protect IP. While they are still very valuable, this decision reduces slightly the advantages of a design patent by limiting the amount of damages that can be recovered.\" In 2012, after three years of legal back-and-forth, in a number of countries, a U.S. court ordered Samsung to pay $930 million to Apple for infringing on patents related to smartphone design, including the use and layout of icons on the Home screen. That amount was lowered from an earlier award of $1.05 billion. Samsung challenged a $399 million portion of the $930 million, arguing that it amounts to the total profits it earned on the 11 smartphones found to infringe on Apple designs. Three Samsung Phones Found to Have Infringed on iPhone Design More specifically, design patents protect the way a thing looks, while utility patents protect the way it works; three Samsung phones were found to have infringed on the look of the iPhone. Samsung argued that it's unfair to make it hand over its entire profits on a superficial aspect of its devices, and that such a ruling would ultimately hurt innovation. Attorneys for Samsung have likened the case to making an automaker turn over the full profits for a car, for infringing on cup holder design, while others have argued that the cup-holder analogy isn't accurate. In a \"friends of the court\" filing on behalf of Apple, industrial design professionals note that Article 289 in the U.S. Patent Code \"authorizes a patent owner to recover an infringer's total profit from an infringing article of manufacture.\" They continued: \"In determining the relevant 'article of manufacture,' the jury should consider the scope of the claimed design [and] the extent to which the design determines the appearance of the product as a whole.\" They then offered the example of a car company intentionally copying the design patent for a Volkswagen Beetle, and how, were a \"reasonable observer\" to buy the car believing it to be a Beetle, \"Volkswagen would be entitled only to the profits that the counterfeiter earned on the car's outer body shell, not on the car itself.\" Reporting by Michelle Maisto was used in the composition of this story. \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Buy shares of TPK Holding ( 3673TW ) in advance of Apple ’s ( AAPL ) move to organic-light emitting diodes in the iPhone, is the advice of Narci Chang with J.P. Morgan in a note to clients this morning.\nChang, who has an Overweight rating on TPK shares, and a price target of 100 New Taiwan Dollars, cites an article from ChinaTimes stating that the company is “said to be the exclusive touch panel lamination supplier for the OLED touch bar on Apple’s new MacBook Pro.”\nThis, to Chang, is a run-up to TPK supplying an “ iPhone 8 ,” presumably the next model, coming out sometime next year, which many think will have a radical new design that employs OLED :\nWe believe MacBook Pro’s OLED touch bar adopts an out-cell touch panel structure, with an ITO-glass-based out-cell touch sensor laminated on top of the OLED display that is supplied by Samsung (OW, covered by JJ Park) together with the cover glass. We note TPK is the exclusive supplier for this multi-touch touch panel of special shape at present. We expect the revenue contribution of this MacBook pro touch bar could be less than 5% of TPK’s 2017 revenue. However, this business paves the way for TPK’s potential business opportunities to all the OLED display devices Apple might pursue in the future. This also proves that TPK remains the leading touch panel partner in Apple’s product roadmap, in our view. We cautiously expect TPK to turn more aggressive on OLED touch film-sensor related capacity once the customers’ orders are firm by 4Q16-1Q17. We reiterate our view that TPK is the runner-up in the race for 5.8” iPhone 8’s OLED out-cell touch panel orders, only second to Nissha Printing (OW, covered by Itaya Masashi). \nTPK shares today closed down 10 cents at 55.10 in Taipei trading.",

Articles: 2 Seeds: 44 Comments: 3830 Since: Mar 2008 US supreme court rules for Samsung in $399m patent dispute with Apple Current Status: Blessed (1) Seeded by Gulliver Swift View Original Article: The Guardian Seeded on Tue Dec 6, 2016 11:09 AM Discuss: ! \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top US court in recent years. \nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399m of $548m it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple’s iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. \nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930m in damages. The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, in May 2015, upheld the patent infringement verdict but said the iPhone’s appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung’s damages back by $382m. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term “article of manufacture” in US patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. keyboard shortcuts: V vote up article J next comment K previous comment",

      "text": "Supreme Court throws out $339M judgment against Samsung in Apple dispute   1:30 PM SAM HANANEL, Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. About Us",

      "text": "Apple adds four more providers to single sign-on support in iOS 10.2 & tvOS 10.1   12:01 pm PT (03:01 pm ET) Four additional TV providers have joined support for Apple's single sign-on feature in iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1, though a number of conspicuous gaps remain. The new options include CenturyLink Prism, Hawaiian Telecom, MetroCast, and Guam's GTA —earlier ones included Dish, DirecTV, Hotwire, and Sling TV. Once enabled through the \"TV Provider\" menu in Settings, single sign-on lets people enter their cable, satellite, or internet TV credentials once and unlock channels across multiple apps, at least when those apps support the feature. Still missing are a number of major services like Spectrum, Google Fiber, AT&T U-verse, Verizon Fios, and Comcast Xfinity, plus the main competition for Sling, Sony's PlayStation Vue. iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 are both still in beta however, so more providers could be added in coming days. Both updates may reach the public as soon as next week . Single sign-on will be especially crucial for another aspect of the updates, Apple's new \"TV\" app, which should make it easier to find, launch, and resume TV shows through a central interface. On the Apple TV, in fact, people will be able to reassign the remote's Home button to jump back to the TV app, rather than the tvOS homescreen. Topics:",

      "text": "More Charts \nSamsung and Apple remain the two biggest players in smartphones, but the last few months has suggested there are cracks in their respective foundations. Samsung is still dealing with the fallout of its Galaxy Note 7 debacle , and Apple appears to be banking on its next iPhone being a home run. \nWhen it comes to premium smartphones, though, some analysts think Apple is in better shape. This chart from Credit Suisse shows that while Apple’s share of the high-end market — here defined as phones sold for $400 or higher — has grown as of late, Samsung’s has started to taper off. \nCredit Suisse expects the trend to continue going forward. In a note released on Tuesday, the firm says it sees the Galaxy Note 7 mess and the long-predicted “supercycle” of iPhone 8 demand being “positive drivers for the iPhone business going forward.” Meanwhile, Credit Suisse says it’s “concerned” about the spectre of the Note 7 looming over Samsung’s premium Galaxy phones in the long-term. \nAll that said, just because this is how things could play out between the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 doesn’t mean it’s how the smartphone market will unfurl as a whole. The wave of affordable Chinese phones remains a challenge to both, for one. And while Apple’s margins are still massive, many analysts think they’ll continue to decline . \nCredit Suisse here defines \"high-end smartphones\" as phones with an average selling price of at least $400.

      "text": "tweet none \nThe corporate logo of Samsung Electronics Co. is seen in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) AP   12:08PM WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.Cupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.Samsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.The patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.On the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related Topics:",

      "text": "Apple will publish its AI research The frequently secretive company is opening up about its machine learning work. Save David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nApple isn't exactly known for sharing its research with the world, but it's making a big exception to that rule. Company AI director Russ Salakhutdinov has revealed that Apple will publish its machine learning research. In other words, some of the discoveries it makes behind closed doors will be available to academia. We've asked Apple for more details and will let you know if it can elaborate on its plans, such as whether this will apply to many of its findings, or just those it deems safe to disclose. However, the move raises a question: why open the kimono when AI is a fiercely competitive field? \nThe most likely answer: this is at least partly about attracting talent to Apple. Researchers in AI (and many other fields) like to have their work publicly shared and recognized. They're more likely to be interested in joining Apple if they know their breakthroughs won't be treated as trade secrets to be kept under lock and key. Don't be surprised if Apple has more success building its AI team in the future, particularly when it wants to recruit professors and others who still want to contribute to science. Apple will start publishing, according to @rsalakhu at #nips2016 pic.twitter.com/I0ndKKc2vB",

      "text": "Dec 6, 2016 11:49am Apple's lawsuit held that Samsung's handsets (left) violated the iPhone's design patent (right). Image: Samsung/Apple \nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple, sending the case back to a lower court to determine damages. \nSamsung had been ordered to pay Apple $399 million for infringing on iPhone patents addressing features such as a front face with rounded corners and bezel. The South Korean company appealed that judgment, saying it was unfairly inflated considering the relative unimportance of the patented features at the heart of the case. \nThe Supreme Court in March agreed to take the case in a move that’s likely to have a significant impact on the patent-litigation landscape. \n“Section 289 of the Patent Act provides a damages remedy specific to design patent infringement,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote (PDF) in the 8-0 ruling. “This case involves the infringement of designs for smartphones. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified the entire smartphone as the only permissible ‘article of manufacture’ for the purpose of calculating Section 289 damages because consumers could not separately purchase components of the smartphones. The question before us is whether that reading is consistent with Section 289. We hold that it is not.” \nRELATED: IA panel: SCOTUS shouldn’t feed the patent trolls in Apple v. Samsung \nApple initially brought the suit in 2011, saying 11 Samsung handsets violated its patents. Samsung was eventually ordered to pay Apple $930 million, but a U.S. Court of Appeals lowered the amount to $548 million in May 2015. \nSamsung agreed in December to pay Apple the lowered figure to settle the case, but the South Korean company continued to press its appeal of $399 million of that amount. Google, Facebook, Dell, HP and others took up Samsung's cause, writing in a single amicus brief that the \"interpretation of antiquated laws\" could diminish innovation, encourage patent trolls and negatively affect consumers and the economy. \nThat's because if the court had ruled that the \"article of manufacture\" was the entire smartphone, and not just certain design elements, all profits for those smartphones would be up for grabs. That precedent could then enable patent trolls and litigious companies to create a viable \"industry of litigation\" at the expense of manufacturers, the amicus brief noted. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a legal brief (PDF) in June asking the Supreme Court to return the case to a trial court for more litigation. \nThe decision doesn’t entirely resolve this specific dispute, but returns the case to a lower court to determine how much Samsung should pay.

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Samsung in Apple patent case  59   \nIt looks like Samsung might just wiggle its way out of the $399 million fine it was ordered to pay to Apple after a lengthy patent dispute case, though it won’t get out entirely unscathed. Many of you will have likely heard about Apple’s lawsuit against Samsung, in which Apple argued that it owned a patent for a rectangular smartphone with rounded edges. After years and years of court proceedings, eventually a jury ruled against Samsung. However, after making its case to the Supreme Court in the US, it looks like the fine is going to be reassessed. \nThe Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling saw eight justices throw out the appeals court ruling that ordered Samsung to pay $399 million to Apple. To be clear, the original ruling that Samsung infringed on Apple’s design patents still stands. However, the $399 million fine has been reversed, meaning a lower-level court will need to reassess the case and come up with a more suitable fine. \nImage Source: Supreme Court. \nSamsung’s defence to the Supreme Court argued that the fine was unfair as it was based on all profits made selling infringing devices. However, design is just one element of a smartphone and not the sole contributing factor to sales, so the fine should be recalculated based on a percentage of the profits made, rather than the whole amount. \nSo now the case has been sent back to lower court for further proceedings. We should hear a revised order at some point in 2017. \nKitGuru Says: While the Supreme Court didn’t put an end to this case entirely, it has given Samsung the opportunity to lessen the blow a bit one more time. Hopefully once the revised ruling comes through, we won’t have to hear about this particular lawsuit ever again.",

The justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court.\nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component.\nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\"\nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that \"doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\"\nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details.\nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents.\n- No clarity -\nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property.\nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent.\n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post.\nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation.\n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,\" he wrote.\nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation.\nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design,\" citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle.\n- 'Sigh of relief' -\nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that \"large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now\" even if the case is not settled.\nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling.\n\"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,\" Black said.\nThe lower court's interpretation of design patents, Black said, \"would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products -- especially in the tech sector.\"\nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award.\n\"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,\" Love said.\nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents\n\"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple's first jury verdict in 2012,\" he said.\n\"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.\"",

      "title": "U.S. Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple",
      "text": "By Andrew Chung (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung <005930.KS> in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple(AAPL.O), throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million (£314.8 million) penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future.\nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favouring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colourful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nThe legal dispute centred on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY\nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products.\n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview.\nRepresentatives from Apple and Samsung could not immediately be reached for comment.\nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

      "text": "Andri Koolme/Flickr \nApple is proud of the camera on its iPhones. \nOn Tuesday, Apple enlisted some pro photographers to provide some tips for using the iPhone 7 Plus, which can create some beautiful photographs. It's got a double lens, which enables it to create a cool blurry background for certain photographs, called \"bokeh.\" \nIf you'd like to hear more about the pro photographers Apple collected, look at their photographs, and read their advice, it's on Apple's newsroom blog . We've also collected the tips below: Get up close to your subject to bring out the details. Minimize the background to cut out the distractions from your subject. Try to find the shade and put the sun behind your subject as a nice back light. Pulling the exposure down just a hair can make images look more cinematic. When taking photos of animals, give your pup some space. Portrait mode uses the telephoto lens, so a distance of about eight feet away is recommended. Have treats ready. You'll get the best results when your subject isn't moving. Soft, diffused lighting will help with keeping the photo flattering to your subject. Find a space that isn't too busy or distracting, as Portrait mode will create a photo that really pops.",

      "text": "Cancel The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to send a copyright case between Samsung and Apple back to a lower court. Jang Se-young/Newsis via AP \nThe Supreme Court backed Samsung in a legal dispute with Apple on Tuesday, providing a bit of good news at the tail end of a year to forget for the South Korean electronics giant. \nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court decided a copyright dispute between Samsung and Apple should be sent back to lower courts, scrapping a previous appeals court decision that put Samsung on the hook for $399 million for copying aspects of Apple's iPhone design in its products. \n\"The Supreme Court has given Samsung a slight reprieve. This decision was only about damages, so Samsung's liability for infringing Apple's patent still stands,\" Case Collard, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney international law firm, said in a statement Tuesday. \nSarah Burstein, an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma's College of Law, notes that this is the first time the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a \"substantive design patent issue\" in more than 100 years.

Post to Facebook Apple says iPhone 6S battery issue bigger than first thought It tells Chinese customers that it's not just phones made between Sept-Oct 2015.  //usat.ly/2gOLICe   Apple says iPhone 6S battery issue bigger than first thought Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 3:28   Let's hope the new iPhone isn't a step down from its predecessors. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Kyle Looney) \nApple's iPhone 6S battery issue is larger than the company first thought. \nThe problem: iPhone 6S devices that shut down the phones abruptly. After announcing an exchange program last month for certain phones, Apple said Tuesday that the issue may extend beyond phones manufactured in September or October of 2015. Apple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models \n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future version of iOS. \nThe company stresses that the issue poses no safety risk to users. \nApple declined to comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus. \nThe problem stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs. \nThose with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues are encouraged to go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones. Tim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns \nApple is the latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably recalled and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S. \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal  ",

      "text": "You cannot buy the Apple Watch Nike+ band direct from Apple, but there are many alternatives that allow you to buy a knock off Apple Watch Nike band that looks and feels very similar. This will not unlock the special Nike+ Apple Watch faces, but if you just want a band that looks like the Nike+ Apple Watch then you are in luck.\nAdvertisement\nThe OULUOQI Nike+ watch band on Amazon is under $20 and after using it for over a month it’s clearly an amazing Apple Watch Nike+ band replacement option.\nFor $18.99 you can turn your Apple Watch into a Nike+ Apple Watch lookalike . This band works with the Apple Watch, Apple Watch series 1 and Apple Watch series 2. It is available in 38mm and 42mm sizes. OULUOQI offers black and yellow (volt) and black and grey.\nThis is an awesome Apple Watch Nike+ watch band replacement.\nThe OULUOQI black and volt color option looks almost identical to the official Apple Watch Nike+ band. When people see my watch, most think that it is the Nike+ version of the watch.\nAdvertisement\nTypically Apple Watch band alternatives, especially those that attempt to replicate the look of an official band, fail the test of time. The little things that make a band comfortable might not be there and the fit and feel of the band can degrade quickly.\nAdvertisement\nThat’s not the case with the OULUOQI Nike+ Apple Watch band replacement. This band is made of soft silicon and after a month of use the band feels just as good as it did on day one. Although available at a fraction of the cost of an official Apple Watch band, this is as soft and pliable as the official Apple Silicon sports bands.\nIt uses the same sport band style clasp, and even with taking the watch on and off close to 100 times during this review period the clasp stays securely in place and the watch band opening is the same size. The ventilation openings are a nice touch and I prefer this to the standard Apple Watch Sport band.\nOULUOQI Apple Watch Nike+ Bans Simply Awesome Well Worth the Price The best Apple Watch Nike+ band alternative that you can buy makes your Apple Watch look like the Nike+ model for less than $20. Buy Now Another positive is that this band doesn’t warp to the curves of your wrist like the official Apple Watch bands do. There is also no discoloration to the bright yellow (volt) color after heavy use. By far this is my favorite Apple Watch band, and it’s the best Apple Watch Nike+ watch band for the money.\n29 Exciting Things You Can Do With the Apple Watch Answer Calls on the Apple Watch 1 / 29 You can answer a call on your Apple Watch using it as a small Bluetooth speaker phone. After using a similar feature from a Samsung watch we know you'll definitely want to use this only for short calls and to be conscious of where you are taking calls. If you wouldn't talk on speakerphone, you shouldn't talk on your Apple Watch.\nAdvertisement\nYou cannot answer a FaceTime or FaceTime Audio call on the Apple Watch. You can choose to answer and transfer a call to the iPhone.\n1 / 29",

      "text": "Andri Koolme/Flickr \nApple is proud of the camera on its iPhones.\nOn Tuesday, Apple enlisted some pro photographers to provide some tips for using the iPhone 7 Plus, which can create some beautiful photographs. It's got a double lens, which enables it to create a cool blurry background for certain photographs, called \"bokeh.\" \nIf you'd like to hear more about the pro photographers Apple collected, look at their photographs, and read their advice, it's on Apple's newsroom blog . We've also collected the tips below: \nGet up close to your subject to bring out the details. Minimize the background to cut out the distractions from your subject. Try to find the shade and put the sun behind your subject as a nice back light. Pulling the exposure down just a hair can make images look more cinematic. When taking photos of animals, give your pup some space. Portrait mode uses the telephoto lens, so a distance of about eight feet away is recommended. Have treats ready. You'll get the best results when your subject isn't moving. Soft, diffused lighting will help with keeping the photo flattering to your subject. Find a space that isn't too busy or distracting, as Portrait mode will create a photo that really pops. NOW WATCH: What those tiny rivets on your jeans are for \n",

      "text": "Shanghai consumer agency reports spontaneous iPhone 6 fires, Apple refutes claim By Tuesday, December 06, 2016, 12:34 pm PT (03:34 pm ET) With a battery repair program already in place, Apple is under more fire from consumer protection agencies in Shanghai, with eight claims of iPhone 6 fires —but Apple blames external damage for the problem after inspection of the afflicted devices. Shanghai's Consumer Council had gathered the reports of spontaneous combustion in the iPhone 6 family in conjunction with its own investigation of consumers' devices shutting down unexpectedly, according to the Wall Street Journal . As a result of the most recent complaint, Apple investigated the fires, and disassembled the afflicted devices. Apple notes that it had found \"external physical damage\" to all of the devices involved in the fires. Apple further added that the customers who had experienced the fires should visit an Apple store, or contact support venues regarding the incidents. \"We appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices,\" Apple said in a statement. The other battery issue that resulted in a repair program was discovered to be as a result of a battery component exposed to \" controlled ambient air \" longer than necessary during the assembly process. As a result, Apple explained on the Chinese website that the afflicted batteries degrade faster, and shut down the phone when voltage is too low to sustain computing operations safely. Apple notes that the battery flaw as a result of the air exposure \"is not a safety issue.\" Apple recently began a battery swap program, allowing owners of iPhone 6s with the affected battery to get their phone fixed for free, or a refund if they previously paid for out-of-pocket repairs to the device. Apple recently introduced a Web tool for checking eligibility for the repair based on device serial number . Topics: ",

      "text": "Who is Killing American Manufacturing? \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNo Clarity \nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design.\" \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n\"By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties' ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,\" Goldman said. \nBy Rob Lever",

      "text": "Apple’s WWDC app typically gets a major update in the run-up to its annual developer conference. The remainder of the year, it’s unusual for the app to receive updates other than bug fixes and compatibility updates. Now, you can filter WWDC session videos by whether they have been downloaded or watched. \nToday’s update of the WWDC app is a little different. Apple has introduced three substantive changes to the WWDC app: Filters to show whether a session video has been downloaded or watched; 3D Touch support for peeking and popping session lists; and Support for dark mode on the Apple TV. \nFor developers, the WWDC app’s utility extends beyond the conference itself, so it’s nice to see Apple refining the app this late in the year. With hundreds of videos available, the new filters are a welcome way to weed out watched, space-hogging videos.

      "text": "(Adds comment from Apple, details on waste claims)\nDec 6 (Reuters) - The California Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said Apple Inc agreed to pay $450,000 to settle state claims that it had mishandled hazardous electronic waste at facilities in Silicon Valley.\nApple also agreed to increase inspections to settle allegations about facilities in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, the Agency's Department of Toxic Substances Control said.\n\"This matter involves an oversight in filing paperwork to close one of our recycling facilities as part of our expansion to a larger site,\" Apple spokeswoman Alisha Johnson told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n\"We've worked closely with 1/8the Department of Toxic Substance Control 3/8 to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site. As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.\"\nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them.\nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant's existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Dan Grebler and Alan Crosby)",

      "text": "(Adds details of state allegations)\nDec 6 (Reuters) - The California Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said Apple Inc agreed to pay $450,000 to settle state claims that it had mishandled hazardous electronic waste at facilities in Silicon Valley.\nApple also agreed to increase inspections to settle allegations about facilities in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, the Agency's Department of Toxic Substances Control said. Apple was not immediately available to comment.\nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in its home town, Cupertino, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them. The department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant's existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Chris Reese and Dan Grebler)",

      "text": "MORE WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Samsung's violation of Apple's smartphone design patents may involve only a component, rather than the entire product — a decision that means Samsung might not have to pay penalties reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThe unanimous decision from Justice Sonia Sotomayor was a much-needed victory for Samsung, beset with problems ranging from smartphones that burst into flames to washers with exploding tops. It initially faced nearly $1 billion in penalties, later reduced to $548 million, for imitating elements of the iPhone's design. Nearly $400 million is at stake in the current dispute.\nThe justices reasoned that the patent infringement could affect just a component of the phones, such as their appearance, rather than all their capabilities. During oral argument in October, Chief Justice John Roberts had noted Samsung did not infringe on \"all the chips and wires.\"\n\"The term 'article of manufacture' is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote.\nThe legal battle between the two technology giants represented the first design patent case to reach the high court in more than a century. A jury in 2012 had ruled that because Samsung infringed on three of Apple's iPhone design patents, it must fork over the entire profits from the phones in question.\nSamsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, had told the justices the award was improper. \"A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,\" she said.\nSamsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, answers questions outside the Supreme Court following oral argument Oct. 11. (Photo: Kevin Wolf, AP Images for Samsung)\nNow the case will return to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to determine what portion of its profits Samsung must pay — a process several justices predicted will be difficult. While some product designs may be relatively insignificant, others — such as a Volkswagen Beetle, some justices noted — are iconic.\n\"We decline to lay out a test for the first step of the damages inquiry in the absence of adequate briefing by the parties,\" Sotomayor said. \"The Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand.\"\nThe five-year-old battle between the world's two most successful smartphone makers had threatened to upend the tech industry. It was watched closely by companies with a stake in the outcome — from Facebook, Google, Dell and Lenovo on Samsung's side, to more than 100 designers from companies such as Nike and Calvin Klein in Apple's corner.\nThe decision, in essence, reshapes a more-than-century-old law on design patents, says Case Collard, a partner at the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney who focuses on intellectual property.\n“No longer can a patent holder get all of the profits from the sales of a product infringing a design patent,” Collard says. “Instead, they may recover the profits attributable to the infringing feature.”\nContributing: Jon Swartz from San Francisco.",

      "text": "Feature Here's what kids really think of Apple's Swift Playgrounds learn-to-code app Apple has partnered with Code.org to offer free Hour of Code sessions for kids at all of its stores. Staff Writer, Macworld | Dec 6, 2016 12:49 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nThis year, Apple embarked on a mission to help teach kids how to code, so it developed Swift Playgrounds to make it fun, even for grown-ups. Now, Apple is bringing the fun to its stores. \nApple has partnered with Code.org to offer in-store, hour-long coding sessions at all 487 retail locations around the world. The weeklong initiative is inspired by Code.org’s Hour of Code online tutorials , and launched on Monday to coincide with Computer Science Education Week . \nIn addition to Code.org’s Block sessions, Apple store employees will also be guiding kids on how to start using Swift Playgrounds ( free in iTunes ), its learn-to-code app for iPad that launched with iOS 10. Macworld's executive editor called Swift Playgrounds a “triumph” , so I stopped by the Apple store in Union Square to see if the kids agreed. \n“It’s easy,” said Daniel, an 8-year-old who came to the Apple store with his dad and 6-year-old sister. “But I’m familiar with commands and functions.” \nThis was Daniel’s first time using Swift Playgrounds, but he has been learning to code since he was 5. First, he started taking tutorials on Khan Academy , the non-profit online education service, and then at Microsoft’s in-store YouthSpark summer sessions, which are akin to Apple Camp . \nDaniel’s dad, Jose, decided to sign up for Apple’s Hour of Code session to get his son more interested in their family’s Apple products at home. Currently, Daniel likes to code using Adobe’s Dreamweaver on a PC. \n“I didn’t know that there was something to teach him how to code for Apple, as well,” Jose said, hoping that Swift Playgrounds will get Daniel to spend more time using their family’s iPad. \nEven though Daniel seemed to think Swift Playgrounds was “easy,” he’d still get visibly excited whenever he completed an early level, the ones designed for beginners. That’s the genius behind Playgrounds: It combines puzzle-like moments of delight that resonate with kids while offering valuable lessons regardless of your familiarity with coding. Apple \nIf you can't make it to the Apple Store, there's even a new Hour of Code challenge inside the Swift Playgrounds app. \nIn fact, a few people at Apple’s in-store Hour of Code were much older than the intended 8-12 age range. These twenty-something beginners certainly learned during their Hour of Code session because Swift Playgrounds works for them, too. Like a good puzzle game, there is no learning curve and it gets more complicated as you go along. \nDaniel said he was up to the challenge, and that he sees himself continuing to use Swift Playgrounds at home. Naturally, Daniel wants to be a developer when he grows up. \nKids trying out Swift Playgrounds at the Apple flagship store in Union Square, San Francisco. \n“I want to develop games, but not fighting games,” Daniel said. “And maybe an app that sends money faster.” \nEvery Apple store will be hosting Hour of Code sessions until Sunday, December 11, but you need to pre-register online. You can check here if there’s availability at your local Apple store. \nYou can also install Swift Playgrounds on your iPad—now with new Hour of Code challenges—and start your self-taught journey into learning to code in Swift.

      "text": "Apple Officially Launches Single Sign-On Posted by Evan Selleck on Dec 06, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nEarlier today, Apple rolled out support for four new TV providers for its single sign-on feature, but the company had more in store. \nToday, Apple officially launched the single sign-on feature to those using iOS 10 and tvOS 10. Up until recently the feature was only available within the iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 betas, which were updated regularly, but Apple has seen fit to release the feature ahead of those platforms’ public launch. \nTo access the new feature, and sign into a supported TV provider, just head into Settings and then find the TV Provider option. Selecting that will bring up options to choose from, including CenturyLink, Dish, DirecTV, and others. The single sign-on feature is available only in the United States (and the territory Guam). \nSingle sign-on officially went live in a preview state in early November, alongside beta releases of iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1. With it, iOS and tvOS users can sign in once with their credentials post which they will be automatically logged in to that service in any app. It should make signing into multiple apps easier, which will make watching content faster as well.

      "text": "December 6, 2016 at 9:38 am | UPDATED: December 6, 2016 at 1:05 pm \nCUPERTINO — In a unanimous decision Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lower court’s $399 million judgment against Samsung for violating patents involving Apple’s iPhone. \nThe decision overturns a victory that Apple had won in the Washington, D.C. based U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The case will now go back to that court for any further proceedings, including determining what, if any, lower penalties Samsung may have to pay Apple. \nTech giants such as Google, Facebook and Hewlett Packard Enterprise had urged the Supreme Court to take up Samsung’s appeal of its patent loss to Apple over the copying of iPhone technology, warning that the outcome against Samsung “will lead to absurd results and have a devastating impact on companies” because of the implications of how patent law is applied to technology products such as smartphones. \nIt was the first time the Supreme Court made a ruling on a product design since 1885, when it heard a case involving carpet designs. Case Collard, an intellectual property lawyer with the law firm Dorsey & Whitney, said the 8-0 court opinion, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, may end up being historical in its reach. \n“The Supreme Court’s decision brings damages law for design patents into accord with the damages law for utility patents,” Collard said. “No longer can a patent holder get all of the profits from the sales of a product infringing a design patent. Instead, they may recover the profits attributable to the infringing feature.” \nJustice Sotomayor wrote that the lower court went too far in its ruling when it declared Samsung had to pay fines based on the entire iPhone, instead of just the components that may have been copied when Samsung was designing its smartphones. One of the central arguments in the case was the use of the term “article of manufacture,” and how it applied to the parts used to make a smartphone. \nThe lower court had ruled that the “article of manufacture” was the entire phone in question, and, thus, based Samsung’s penalties on the profits it made from the sale of its phones. But Sotomayor said such a description was applied too broadly in this case and that the “article” could be just one part of the phone. \n“The term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not,” Sotomayor wrote in her 11-page opinion . \nRob Enderle, director of technology research firm the Enderle Group, said the court’s ruling “is pro-competition and pro-development and anti-patent troll” because the earlier ruling would have put any firm found compromising on a single patent in a complex technology device potentially liable for all the profits from the sale of that product. \n“Both tactically and strategically this ruling is good for Samsung,” Enderle said. \nThe case centered around three iPhone patents for how icon layouts appear on the device’s screen, the design appearance of the front of the phone and the rounded rectangular shape of the front of the iPhone. The five-year-long battle stemmed from Apple’s allegations that Samsung had copied iPhone-related designs for use in its Galaxy and other smartphones. \nIn Apple’s lower-court win, the judgment called for Samsung to pay damages that were based upon the total profits Samsung had earned on the products in question. Samsung was originally hit with a $1.05 billion verdict in 2012 for violating not just Apple patents, but trademarks, too. The trademark damages were eventually thrown out on appeal, leaving Samsung with a fine of $548 million, which it paid in December 2015. However, Samsung took the case to the Supreme Court in an effort to get back $399 million of that penalty which the company viewed as excessive. \n“This is a tricky case,” said Tim Bajarin, president of tech research firm Creative Strategies. “There are many broad issues that still haven’t been resolved. There are serious dollar amounts involved, and if the decision gets narrowed, it could have ramifications regarding intellectual property ownership.” \nThe case being sent back down the lower court is viewed as a huge win for Samsung, as any further penalties will certainly be less than the $399 million amount the Supreme Court rejected. Bajarin said there is no chance that Apple will drop the case because “both sides have too much skin in this to leave behind.” \nNeither spokespeople for Apple, nor Samsung, immediately returned requests for comment. Apple shares edged up 0.3 percent to $109.48 in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Tags:",

      "text": "Subscribe to the MacRumors Newsletter Apple's Single Sign-On Service Now Live Tuesday December 6, 2016 12:49 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple today officially launched Single Sign-on, the service designed to allow cable subscribers to sign in once with their cable credentials to gain access to all cable-restricted content in iOS and tvOS apps. Single Sign-on is limited to the United States, and according to a support document , is available for the following providers: CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telecom, Hotwire, MetroCast, and Sling. While Single Sign-on was introduced and tested in the tvOS 10 .1 and iOS 10 .2 betas, the feature was remotely released today to all iOS 10 and tvOS 10 devices. Using Single Sign-on does not require one of the betas, and is instead immediately available to all iPhone and Apple TV users running iOS 10 or tvOS 10. With Single Sign-on, customers with a supported provider will use the Settings options in iOS or tvOS to sign in with their cable credentials. From then on, when accessing a supported app that requires a cable subscription, the app will ask to use the saved sign-on credentials. To get to Single Sign-on on iOS devices, open the Settings app and scroll down to \"TV Providers.\" The process is the same on the Apple TV - open the Settings app and choose the TV Providers option to sign in. Most cable channels and content providers offer individual apps on the Apple TV and iOS devices, but still require cable authentication before users can access content. Prior to Single Sign-on, customers were required to enter their credentials in each individual app, a frustrating and time-consuming process. Single Sign-on will play a key part in the upcoming \"TV\" app that's set to debut in iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1. The TV app serves as sort of an Apple-designed television guide that lets customers find new content and keep track of what they were watching across multiple devices. At the current time, Single Sign-on is available to a limited number of customers, but its availability will expand as Apple signs the necessary deals with cable providers. Single Sign-on also requires apps to implement support for the feature, and many apps have not yet introduced Single Sign-on support.",

But the Jabra Sport Elite is more than just a pair of cordless earbuds for you to listen to music during your runs - it actually monitors your workouts. \nIt is equipped with a heart-rate monitor that is supposed to have an above-90 per cent reading accuracy. It works with the Jabra Sport Life app to track your activities and analyse your fitness level. It also provides you with personalised real-time audio coaching during your workouts. \nThe earbuds are sweat-proof and water resistant down to 1m for 30min.

Thus, you can see what you are capturing with ease, using the live-view remote on your wrist. \nThe action camera also comes with an underwater housing that has water resistance of down to 60m. Its excellent 4K video quality is accentuated by its superb image-stabilisation technology that prevents any major shakes.   'For fitness buffs'.  ",

The complex took in 1.1 million pounds of waste before being closed in Jan. 2013.\n\nThe Sunnyvale complex is said to have processed 800,000 pounds of waste before regulators were told it existed. On top of this, the company is accused of taking toxic dust swept off the floor to a site lacking the authority to handle it.\n\nApple further failed to report and track waste exports, regulators said, or mark used oil containers as hazardous.\n\nThe incidents conflict with the public image Apple has crafted for itself, which depict it as one of the most environmentally responsible companies in the world. Its electronics have been stripped of many dangerous chemicals, and the company has worked aggressively to use renewable energy at as many of its stores and offices as possible.",

      "text": "International Business Samsung prevails over Apple in US$399m patent appeal The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a US$399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. Posted 07 Dec 2016 00:41 Updated 07 Dec 2016 04:10 Samsung is the world's largest producer of smartphones. (AFP/DON EMMERT) A \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday (Dec 6) overturned a US$399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the US$399 million penalty - one element of a major patent infringement case - was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that \"doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the US$548 million penalty - knocked down from an original US$1 billion jury award - Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNO CLARITY \nObservers had been watching to see how the court - which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century - would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design,\" citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle. \n'SIGH OF RELIEF' \nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that \"large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now\" even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. \n\"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,\" Black said. \nThe lower court's interpretation of design patents, Black said, \"would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products - especially in the tech sector.\" \nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n\"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,\" Love said. \nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents \n\"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple's first jury verdict in 2012,\" he said. \"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.\" - AFP/de",

      "text": "By Michael Firth Neowin LLC @techfirth · 16 minutes ago with 2 comments \nLast week, Apple published a support article on its Chinese website outlining the technical reasons behind a spate of iPhone 6s devices that have recently suffered severe battery problems. \nThe problems, which seemed to arise not long after the release of iOS 10, turned out to be a physical battery problem, with Apple clarifying that affected units having been \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for longer than they should have been. \nAcknowledging the problem, Apple launched a free repair program last month for 'a very small number' of affected devices. Specifically, it's devices with serial numbers that contain these characters in their 4th and 5th position; Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, QC, QD, QF, QG, QH (thanks to ariusbb for pointing out the affected range via comments on our previous coverage). \nHowever, Apple published an update to the support article today, this time stating that it is investigating phones with issues outside of the previously reported range; \n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown. \" \nThe statement goes on to say that Apple will update its diagnostic tools via an iOS update to be released next week, which is likely to be the public version of iOS 10.2 ; \n\"In an effort to gather more information, we are including additional diagnostic capability in an iOS software update which will be available next week. This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown.\" \nWhen logging a support call with Apple for iOS devices, an Apple representative can activate specific diagnostic tools on an affected device (with the owner's permission) and collect the subsequently created logs. \nIt's possible that due to large numbers of complaints from customers outside of the affected range, Apple is looking at the possibility of a wider battery problem, or that a software or firmware update has adversely impacted the battery life or charging routine of some devices.",

      "text": "Apple adds more television providers to Single Sign-On in new iOS 10.2 beta Submitted by Marshall Walker on December 6, 2016 - 2:43pm \nMore television providers have been added to Apple's Single Sign-On in the fifth iOS 10.2 beta. CenturyLink Prism, Hawaiian Telecom, MetroCast, and GTA are now available in the new TV Provider section of the Settings app on iOS devices. The four new providers join DirecTV, Dish, Hotwire, Sling TV, who singed up to support the new feature since it was originally announced. While it is safe to assume Apple will be adding more providers in the future, some major companies, such as Comcast, are still holding out, and may eventually decide not to support the new feature at all. \nApple has been focusing on improving its television and movie streaming capabilities with the upcoming launch of tvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2. A lot of television services offer individual apps on Apple TV and iOS devices, but they all require users to sign in individually to access each app's content. Single Sign-On allows users to authenticate only once on supported apps across multiple devices. \nApple has also introduced a new TV app to iOS devices so users can easily access all their purchased media through one hub. The new app features a Watch Now section that displays content, such as newly released television episodes, from all of your connected apps. It also includes a Library with all purchased movies and series, and a Store for making additional purchases through iTunes. \nBoth iOS devices and the Apple TV will be more user friendly when tvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 are finally launched to the general public, presumably in December. Apple today has added universal search support to both the AMC and The Hallmark Channel, bringing the overall list to around 40 supported channels in the US. \nSingle Sign-On and universal search are two of the new features in tvOS that finally put Apple TV on the track to be the product Apple always promised it would be. The new additions should also help holiday sales of the set-top box. \nThe fourth-generation Apple TV is available starting at $149 through apple.com . It ships with Apple's redesigned Siri remote, Siri support, and its own App Store for purchasing games and third party apps. tags:",

      "title": "Opinion analysis: Justices tread narrow path in rejecting $400 million award for Samsung’s infringement of Apple’s cellphone design patents",
      "text": "The court said just about as little as possible in its opinion today in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. , in which it rejected the $400 million verdict Apple had won based on allegations that Samsung’s cellphones infringed design patents covering the original iPhones. In essence, the court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision to uphold a jury verdict and sent the case back to let the Federal Circuit define the appropriate legal standard.\nThe case involves an obscure statute not discussed by the Supreme Court in half a century, which grants protection for “design patents,” a type of intellectual property that is related to, but much easier to acquire than, the “utility patents” at issue in the Supreme Court’s most prominent intellectual-property cases of the last few decades. Apple had several design patents on the original iPhones, covering such things as the shape of the face (black and rectangular with rounded corners) and the grid of icons on the black screen. A jury concluded that the Samsung cellphone models sold shortly after release of the original iPhones infringed those design patents, and it awarded Apple all the profits Samsung made from the infringing phones.\n\nThe design patents, though, cover only a small part of the iPhones, which include hundreds if not thousands of electronic components, many of which are themselves protected by utility patents and are arguably irrelevant to the external look and feel of the device that the design patents protect. That raises the legal question whether the statute in fact requires Samsung to pay all the profits from the infringing phones (as the Federal Circuit held) or whether it would be enough for Samsung to pay Apple all the profits attributable to the infringing design. The relevant statute states that the award should include all profits from the “article of manufacture” to which Samsung “applie[d] the patented design.” The main question, then, is whether the “article of manufacture” is necessarily the phone itself or instead is just the case and screen to which the design patents relate. The Federal Circuit concluded that it was not appropriate to distinguish between the phone and its exterior, and accordingly affirmed the jury’s verdict awarding Apple all profits from the infringing phones.\nAll eight justices joined Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s cautious opinion ruling in Samsung’s favor. The opinion starts by summarizing the statute and the Federal Circuit’s categorical conclusion that “article of manufacture” always refers to the end product sold to consumers. The opinion then offers a sparse three pages rejecting that conclusion. Importantly, the opinion says almost nothing about the purposes or goals of the design-patent statute. Rather, it takes the position that the text of the statute compels rejection of the Federal Circuit’s end-product rule.\nThe opinion rests directly (and almost exclusively) on the idea that, according to its dictionary definition, an “article of manufacture” is any “thing made by hand or machine.” To the court, it follows directly from that definition that an article of manufacture could be either an entire “product sold to a consumer” or, at least in some cases, “a component of that product.” As Sotomayor explains, “[t]hat a component may be integrated into a large product . . . does not put it outside of the category of articles of manufacture.”\nThat narrow holding, though, is all the court gives us. The opinion tells us nothing at all about the correct answer to this case, because it offers no guidance on how one might go about distinguishing the “article of manufacture” of relevance from the actual cellphones at issue. It’s not just that the opinion doesn’t specify the relevant article of manufacture (the case? the screen? both?) – the opinion doesn’t even instruct the Federal Circuit definitively to reject the entire cellphone as the article of manufacture. All we are told is that the Federal Circuit has to define a test under which it would be possible that components could be treated as articles of manufacture; if the Federal Circuit creates such a test and applies it to define the cellphone as the article of manufacture, the parties might end up exactly where they were before this case came to the court. Leaving no doubt about the court’s agnosticism, the opinion goes out of its way to emphasize that the justices intend to offer no direction on how to address or resolve the definitional problem. Among other things, the opinion notes that the federal government has suggested a test, but that neither of the parties has briefed the issue. Accordingly, “in the absence of adequate briefing by the parties,” the court leaves the problems of defining and applying the appropriate standard for the Federal Circuit to resolve.\nGiven the discussion at the oral argument, none of this should be surprising, because several justices expressed the view that the Federal Circuit was better situated to work out the details of such a test in the first instance. Still, it may come as a surprise to Apple and Samsung that their briefs weren’t “adequate” to shed more light on the correct answer to their dispute. At bottom, this might best be seen as just another of the minimalist decisions that have issued so frequently from the still-diminished eight-member court.\n[ Disclosure : Goldstein & Russell, P.C., whose attorneys contribute to this blog in various capacities, is among the counsel to the petitioners in this case.

      "text": "Wed, Dec 7, 2016, 8:29 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 1 hr 31 mins Samsung prevails over Apple in $399 mn patent appeal By Rob Lever | AFP – 11 hours ago Recommend View Photo \nSamsung is the world's largest producer of smartphones \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that \"doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \n- No clarity - \nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design,\" citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle. \n- 'Sigh of relief' - \nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that \"large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now\" even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. \n\"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,\" Black said. \nThe lower court's interpretation of design patents, Black said, \"would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products -- especially in the tech sector.\" \nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n\"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,\" Love said. \nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents \n\"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple's first jury verdict in 2012,\" he said. \n\"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook UK may need new law to trigger Brexit AAP \nThe British government will need to put forward a parliamentary bill to trigger formal European Union divorce talks …",
