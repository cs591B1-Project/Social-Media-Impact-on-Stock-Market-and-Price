      "text": "By: Zamansky LLC via Business Wire News Releases   13:51 PM EST NOTICE TO EXXON CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES: Zamansky LLC Investigates the Exxon Savings Plan for Possible ERISA Violations NOTICE TO EXXON CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES: Zamansky LLC Investigates the Exxon Savings Plan for Possible ERISA Violations Over Its Allegedly Fraudulent Reserves Reporting. \nZamansky LLC announces that it has commenced an investigation of Exxon Mobil Corporation ( NYSE: XOM )(“Exxon”) on behalf of its current and former employees over the Exxon Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for potential violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). ERISA imposes fiduciary duties to prudently manage and invest plan assets. We are investigating whether these duties were violated by the continued offering of the Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 as an investment option for employees under the Plan. \nOn November 7, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Exxon and its CEO and CFO. The lawsuit alleges that Exxon fraudulently overstated its oil and gas reserves, their value and the costs of extraction, in view of internal reports it had on the impact of global climate change. The lawsuit alleges that the misrepresentations were material, and that they artificially inflated Exxon’s stock price before it fell as news came out. \nAccording to employee stock and investment fraud attorney, Jake Zamansky, current or former Exxon employees who purchased and held Exxon stock through the Plan from January 2016 through October 2016 may have had their retirement savings damaged. The allegations about Exxon’s reserves reporting fraud raise serious issues whether the Plan’s fiduciaries properly executed their duties under ERISA, he states. ERISA is designed to protect employees’ retirement savings from imprudent and inappropriate investments, Zamansky states. \nWhat Current and Former Exxon Employees Can Do \nIf you are an existing or former Exxon employee who purchased and held Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 through the Exxon Savings Plan, please contact our firm for an evaluation of your rights. You can contact Jake Zamansky by telephone at (212) 742-1414 or by email at . \nAbout Zamansky LLC \nZamansky LLC is a leading stock law firm specializing in securities fraud, ERISA and employment class actions.

      "text": "NEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE) Zamansky LLC announces that it has commenced an investigation of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM)(“Exxon”) on behalf of its current and former employees over the Exxon Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for potential violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). ERISA imposes fiduciary duties to prudently manage and invest plan assets. We are investigating whether these duties were violated by the continued offering of the Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 as an investment option for employees under the Plan.\nOn November 7, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Exxon and its CEO and CFO. The lawsuit alleges that Exxon fraudulently overstated its oil and gas reserves, their value and the costs of extraction, in view of internal reports it had on the impact of global climate change. The lawsuit alleges that the misrepresentations were material, and that they artificially inflated Exxon’s stock price before it fell as news came out.\nAccording to employee stock and investment fraud attorney, Jake Zamansky, current or former Exxon employees who purchased and held Exxon stock through the Plan from January 2016 through October 2016 may have had their retirement savings damaged. The allegations about Exxon’s reserves reporting fraud raise serious issues whether the Plan’s fiduciaries properly executed their duties under ERISA, he states. ERISA is designed to protect employees’ retirement savings from imprudent and inappropriate investments, Zamansky states.\nWhat Current and Former Exxon Employees Can Do\nIf you are an existing or former Exxon employee who purchased and held Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 through the Exxon Savings Plan, please contact our firm for an evaluation of your rights. You can contact Jake Zamansky by telephone at (212) 742-1414 or by email at jake@zamansky.com .\nAbout Zamansky LLC\nZamansky LLC is a leading stock law firm specializing in securities fraud, ERISA and employment class actions.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 1/2 left right An Exxon sign is seen at a gas station in the Chicago suburb of Norridge, Illinois, U.S., October 27, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young 2/2 By Liz Hampton | HOUSTON \nHOUSTON Sunoco Logistics Partners ( SXL.N ) said on Wednesday it is forming a joint venture with Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), giving the midstream company strategic assets near the Dakota Access line while expanding its West Texas footprint for the second time in less than two months. \nThe joint venture, called Permian Express Partners, will consist of assets owned by both companies, according to a statement. Sunoco Logistics will take a stake of 85 percent, while Exxon will control the remaining 15 percent. \nSunoco Logistics will contribute its Permian Express 1 and 2, Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines to the joint venture. Exxon's contribution includes its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines, Hawkings gathering system, an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. \nThe joint venture expands the footprint of Sunoco Logistics in West Texas, home to the prolific Permian Basin shale play. It comes less than two months after an announcement to buy Vitol's crude oil unit in the Permian for $760 million. \nOil companies in recent months have rushed to secure acreage and assets in the Permian Basin, considered \"a sweet spot\" for U.S. shale producers. This has driven up dealmaking among both exploration and production companies and midstream operators. \nThe access to Exxon's terminal gives Sunoco a \"foothold\" in Patoka, Illinois, an important oil hub in the Midwest that connects to the Dakota Access pipeline, said Dominic Haywood, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London. \nUnder the deal, Sunoco Logistics will operate the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, which has been delayed by regulatory issues and intense opposition by environmentalists and Native American groups. Construction was halted in September, but the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president may give the project a boost, as he is expected to support energy development. \nPart of Exxon's Patoka to Nederland, Texas, Pegasus pipeline, is currently shut. The line leaked about 5,000 barrels of oil in a residential neighborhood in Arkansas 2013, resulting in a $2.63 million fine for Exxon. \n(Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by David Gregorio) Next In Commodities",

      "text": "Share By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Sunoco Logistics Partners said on Wednesday it is forming a joint venture with Exxon Mobil , giving the midstream company strategic assets near the Dakota Access line while expanding its West Texas footprint for the second time in less than two months. The joint venture, called Permian Express Partners, will consist of assets owned by both companies, according to a statement. Sunoco Logistics will take a stake of 85 percent, while Exxon will control the remaining 15 percent. Sunoco Logistics will contribute its Permian Express 1 and 2, Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines to the joint venture. Exxon's contribution includes its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines, Hawkings gathering system, an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. The joint venture expands the footprint of Sunoco Logistics in West Texas, home to the prolific Permian Basin shale play. It comes less than two months after an announcement to buy Vitol's crude oil unit in the Permian for $760 million. Oil companies in recent months have rushed to secure acreage and assets in the Permian Basin, considered \"a sweet spot\" for U.S. shale producers. This has driven up dealmaking among both exploration and production companies and midstream operators. The access to Exxon's terminal gives Sunoco a \"foothold\" in Patoka, Illinois, an important oil hub in the Midwest that connects to the Dakota Access pipeline, said Dominic Haywood, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London. Under the deal, Sunoco Logistics will operate the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, which has been delayed by regulatory issues and intense opposition by environmentalists and Native American groups. Construction was halted in September, but the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president may give the project a boost, as he is expected to support energy development. Part of Exxon's Patoka to Nederland, Texas, Pegasus pipeline, is currently shut. The line leaked about 5,000 barrels of oil in a residential neighborhood in Arkansas 2013, resulting in a $2.63 million fine for Exxon. (Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by David Gregorio) Reblog",

      "text": "18,660.00 128.00 (0.69%) NOTICE TO EXXON CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES: Zamansky LLC Investigates the Exxon Savings Plan for Possible ERISA Violations Share NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zamansky LLC announces that it has commenced an investigation of Exxon Mobil Corporation ( XOM )(“Exxon”) on behalf of its current and former employees over the Exxon Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for potential violations of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). ERISA imposes fiduciary duties to prudently manage and invest plan assets. We are investigating whether these duties were violated by the continued offering of the Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 as an investment option for employees under the Plan. On November 7, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Exxon and its CEO and CFO. The lawsuit alleges that Exxon fraudulently overstated its oil and gas reserves, their value and the costs of extraction, in view of internal reports it had on the impact of global climate change. The lawsuit alleges that the misrepresentations were material, and that they artificially inflated Exxon’s stock price before it fell as news came out. According to employee stock and investment fraud attorney, Jake Zamansky, current or former Exxon employees who purchased and held Exxon stock through the Plan from January 2016 through October 2016 may have had their retirement savings damaged. The allegations about Exxon’s reserves reporting fraud raise serious issues whether the Plan’s fiduciaries properly executed their duties under ERISA, he states. ERISA is designed to protect employees’ retirement savings from imprudent and inappropriate investments, Zamansky states. What Current and Former Exxon Employees Can Do If you are an existing or former Exxon employee who purchased and held Exxon stock from January 2016 through October 2016 through the Exxon Savings Plan, please contact our firm for an evaluation of your rights. You can contact Jake Zamansky by telephone at (212) 742-1414 or by email at .

      "text": "Date: November 10, 2016 Suzanne McCarron, Vice President of Public and Government Affairs at Exxon Mobil Corporation (Photo: Exxon Mobil) \nTwo days after Donald Trump won the White House, Exxon Mobil vice president Suzanne McCarron made clear the oil giant’s position on climate change. \nIn a tweet Thursday morning, she wrote , “The Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange .” \nTrump made waves on the campaign trail vowing to “cancel” U.S. involvement in the pact, which was agreed to by close to 200 world leaders in Paris almost 12 months ago. \nSince Trump’s unexpected victory in Tuesday’s election, Republicans have been cheering a quick end for President Obama’s efforts to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. \nBut it doesn’t look like Exxon, a steady GOP donor, is on board. \nMcCarron, Exxon’s vice president of public and government affairs, linked to a statement that appeared to be written last week when the company commended officials for the “entering into force” of the climate deal. \n“The Paris agreement and the initial Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledged by its signatories reflect the dual challenge of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring the world has adequate access to affordable and reliable supplies of energy,” the statement read. \nInvestors have increasingly speculated that oil companies could face a dire financial future as world governments work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Major oil companies like Exxon and BP are now advocating for countries to clear up the uncertainty and put carbon regulations in place. \nUnder the Paris agreement, countries would dramatically ween themselves off fossil fuels over the remainder of the century towards limiting a rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius.

      "text": "Options Action: A bullish bet on Exxon      21 Hours Ago | 02:44 ‹ 02:44 Options Action: A bullish bet on Exxon      21 Hours Ago 01:57 Facebook's bad week      11/04/16 5:31 PM ET 05:53 Here's how to protect your portfolio post-election      11/04/16 5:46 PM ET › Energy stocks are surging and one big oil company in particular could see a big breakout in the short term. \nWednesday following the election, the options pits were in a flurry with traders focused on oil giant ExxonMobil . One trader bought 10,000 of the December 90-strike calls for $0.49 when Exxon was trading at $85.80. \nA total of 39,000 of the same December 90-strike calls were bought in the session, and Exxon saw three times its average daily call volume on Wednesday. These calls break even at $90.49, which means that Exxon still needs to rise another 3 percent from Thursday trading levels by December expiration. \nDan Nathan of RiskReversal.com, however, thinks such a surge is within reach given how energy stocks have behaved. Energy stocks have rallied more than 2.5 percent since the election, but Nathan sees the energy stock-tracking ETF ( XLE ) making \"a series of higher lows\" that have taken XLE back above the \"breakout level\" of around $70. \n\n\nThis bodes well for Exxon, a key component of XLE. Exxon has rallied almost 3 percent since Tuesday's election, and Nathan has high hopes that Exxon could rally back to levels it hasn't seen since July. \n\"This is a stock that trades with a 3.5 percent dividend yield or so,\" Nathan said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\" \"This is one where you could probably see above $90 with stable crude over the next month.\" \n\n\nExxon has rallied alongside crude, with the stock up 12.5 percent year to date.",

      "text": "Common Dreams Facing Class-Action Lawsuit from Investors, Exxon Threatens to Depose 17 State AGs \nIgnoring growing shareholder pressure, Exxon escalates its battle against state attorneys general who are investigating the oil giant for climate fraud by 0 Comments \n\"This development should be taken very seriously by all fossil fuel companies.\" (Photo: Mike Mozart /flickr/cc) \nExxon investors filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday against the oil giant for its failure to disclose climate change risks—the world's first lawsuit of its kind. \nThe suit came the same day that Exxon threatened 17 state attorneys general, who are investigating the oil giant for such climate fraud, with depositions. Such a move would pull the attorneys general into costly legal fights that would go on for years, according to InsideClimate News. \nThe lawsuit's claim is over Exxon's recent swift drop in value, which followed the company's disclosure that it had been overvaluing about one-fifth of its oil and gas assets. The shareholders allege that \"information disclosed to the market by Exxon was materially false and misleading,\" writes UK-based environmental law firm ClientEarth. \nClientEarth senior corporate lawyer Alice Garton said : \nThis development should be taken very seriously by all fossil fuel companies. It's no longer feasible to say the low oil price environment is temporary. The Paris Agreement is now in effect. Fossil fuels are in structural, and not cyclical decline—contrary to the rosy picture proffered by the industry. ClientEarth is investigating how far UK companies should also be reflecting this structural decline in their accounts and, where we find shortcomings, will bring legal challenges. \nIndeed, analysts have warned that Exxon's finances are extremely precarious, partly as a result of investigations over the company's years-long failure to disclose climate risks, and that shareholders should take Exxon to task. \nIn response to the lawsuit, Exxon sent Bloomberg BNA a statement describing its claims as \"'frivolous' and the allegations as 'false and completely without merit,'\" the financial outlet reports . \nMeanwhile, InsideClimate News writes that an Exxon attorney on Wednesday \" told a New York judge that the company is working on deposing at least 17 attorneys general and their staffs who earlier this year joined with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman under the banner of AGs United for Clean Power .\" \nInsideClimate News continues: \nT hat plan came to light during a hearing in Exxon's battle with Schneiderman over his office's investigation into whether the company violated consumer fraud laws in connection with climate change-related disclosures. \nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is locked in a court battle with Exxon in Texas over her investigation of the company, said Exxon's legal strategy is \"calculated to initiate no-holds-barred discovery\" against the attorneys general, according to a motion her office filed in the Texas case. \"If the court endorses Exxon's effort,\" reports the environmental outlet, \"Healey said in her latest motion in Texas court, it will likely achieve ' Exxon's goal of putting off as long as possible any investigation into the critically important question of whether Exxon broke the law and deceived consumers and investors about the role of its products in causing climate change.'\" This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Share This Article",

      "text": "Sunoco, Exxon combine pipeline assets in new joint venture Wed Nov 9, 2016 11:41pm GMT [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Liz Hampton \nHOUSTON Nov 9 (Reuters) - Sunoco Logistics Partners said on Wednesday it is forming a joint venture with Exxon Mobil , giving the midstream company strategic assets near the Dakota Access line while expanding its West Texas footprint for the second time in less than two months. \nThe joint venture, called Permian Express Partners, will consist of assets owned by both companies, according to a statement. Sunoco Logistics will take a stake of 85 percent, while Exxon will control the remaining 15 percent. \nSunoco Logistics will contribute its Permian Express 1 and 2, Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines to the joint venture. Exxon's contribution includes its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines, Hawkings gathering system, an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. \nThe joint venture expands the footprint of Sunoco Logistics in West Texas, home to the prolific Permian Basin shale play. It comes less than two months after an announcement to buy Vitol's crude oil unit in the Permian for $760 million. \nOil companies in recent months have rushed to secure acreage and assets in the Permian Basin, considered \"a sweet spot\" for U.S. shale producers. This has driven up dealmaking among both exploration and production companies and midstream operators. \nThe access to Exxon's terminal gives Sunoco a \"foothold\" in Patoka, Illinois, an important oil hub in the Midwest that connects to the Dakota Access pipeline, said Dominic Haywood, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London. \nUnder the deal, Sunoco Logistics will operate the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, which has been delayed by regulatory issues and intense opposition by environmentalists and Native American groups. Construction was halted in September, but the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president may give the project a boost, as he is expected to support energy development. \nPart of Exxon's Patoka to Nederland, Texas, Pegasus pipeline, is currently shut. The line leaked about 5,000 barrels of oil in a residential neighborhood in Arkansas 2013, resulting in a $2.63 million fine for Exxon.

      "text": "Exxon Misled Investors About Climate Risks, Suit Says NEWS \nBloomberg BNA’s Corporate Law & Accountability Report is available on the Corporate Law Resource Center. This news service keeps corporate practitioners informed of legal developments of... \nBy \nNov. 8 — ExxonMobil Corp. is misleading investors about the drop in its oil and gas reserves resulting from climate change risks and the decline in oil prices, according to a class action filed in federal court ( Ramirez v. ExxonMobil Corp. , N.D. Tex., No. 16-cv-03111, complaint filed 11/7/16 ). \nPedro Ramirez Jr. filed the class suit Nov. 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on behalf of investors, holding the company responsible for the drop in stock price in September, and accusing the company of overstating the size of its recoverable oil and gas reserves. \nIn a series of misleading statements made between February and October, ExxonMobil posted positive projections about its oil reserves even though it was aware that it wouldn’t be able to extract as much due to potential carbon limits arising from climate change, the lawsuit charged. The investors also said the company refused to write down—or reduce the value of—any of its oil and gas reserves, which the lawsuit said had been overstated, in the face of declining global oil prices. \nAs a result, the investors allege that the price of Exxon common stock plummeted to a close of $82.54 per share on Sept. 20, down more than 13 percent from the stock’s high of more than $90 per share, erasing billions of dollars of market capitalization. Not Profitable \nOn Oct. 28, Exxon publicly acknowledged that “it might have to write down 3.6 billion barrels of oil sand reserves and one billion barrels of other North American reserves that Exxon now conceded were not profitable to produce under current prices,” the lawsuit said. \nExxonMobil sent Bloomberg BNA a statement Nov. 8 describing the lawsuit as “frivolous” and the allegations as “false and completely without merit.” \nThe company said it would defend its financial reporting practices, saying it was confident it fully complied with all legal and accounting requirements. \n“This lawsuit misstates our financial reporting and repeats the same tired allegations pushed by activists and inaccurate media reports that claim we reached definitive conclusions about climate change decades before the world’s experts and while climate science was in an early stage of development,” the company said. “This is simply not credible.” \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Amena H. Saiyid in Washington at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Larry Pearl at For More Information \nThe complaint is available at http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Ramirez_Jr_v_Exxon_Mobil_Corporation_et_al_Docket_No_316cv03111_N . \nCopyright © 2016 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.

      "text": "print \nBy Liz Hampton \nHOUSTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Sunoco Logistics Partners said on Wednesday it is forming a joint venture with Exxon Mobil , giving the midstream company strategic assets near the Dakota Access line while expanding its West Texas footprint for the second time in less than two months. \nThe joint venture, called Permian Express Partners, will consist of assets owned by both companies, according to a statement. Sunoco Logistics will take a stake of 85 percent, while Exxon will control the remaining 15 percent. \nSunoco Logistics will contribute its Permian Express 1 and 2, Permian Longview and Louisiana Access pipelines to the joint venture. Exxon's contribution includes its Longview to Louisiana and Pegasus pipelines, Hawkings gathering system, an idle pipeline in southern Oklahoma and its Patoka, Illinois terminal. \nThe joint venture expands the footprint of Sunoco Logistics in West Texas, home to the prolific Permian Basin shale play. It comes less than two months after an announcement to buy Vitol's crude oil unit in the Permian for $760 million. \nOil companies in recent months have rushed to secure acreage and assets in the Permian Basin, considered \"a sweet spot\" for U.S. shale producers. This has driven up dealmaking among both exploration and production companies and midstream operators. \nThe access to Exxon's terminal gives Sunoco a \"foothold\" in Patoka, Illinois, an important oil hub in the Midwest that connects to the Dakota Access pipeline, said Dominic Haywood, an analyst at Energy Aspects in London. \nUnder the deal, Sunoco Logistics will operate the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, which has been delayed by regulatory issues and intense opposition by environmentalists and Native American groups. Construction was halted in September, but the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president may give the project a boost, as he is expected to support energy development. \nPart of Exxon's Patoka to Nederland, Texas, Pegasus pipeline, is currently shut. The line leaked about 5,000 barrels of oil in a residential neighborhood in Arkansas 2013, resulting in a $2.63 million fine for Exxon.

U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Texas ruled Thursday that the company could add New York to the case. \nThe company said in its filing that the two attorneys general were “conducting improper and politically motivated investigations of Exxon Mobil in a coordinated effort to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.” \nMassachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether Exxon Mobil violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate. \nA Schneiderman representative couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on the Friday Veterans Day holiday. \nHealey argued in a filing Monday that Exxon Mobil was trying to use the Texas court to dodge an Oct. 26 order by a New York court to comply with a subpoena to turn over accounting documents about how climate change will affect its finances. \n\n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

      "text": "Comments Exxon Mobil Corp. sued New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to stop his investigation into what the company knew about climate change. \nThe oil giant on Thursday revised a lawsuit it filed in June against Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Texas ruled Thursday that the company could add New York to the case. \nThe company said in its filing that the two attorneys general were “conducting improper and politically motivated investigations of Exxon Mobil in a coordinated effort to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.” \nMassachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether Exxon Mobil violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate. \nA Schneiderman representative couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on the Friday Veterans Day holiday. \nHealey argued in a filing Monday that Exxon Mobil was trying to use the Texas court to dodge an Oct. 26 order by a New York court to comply with a subpoena to turn over accounting documents about how climate change will affect its finances. \nThe case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth) Copyright 2016 Bloomberg. Get Insurance Journal Every Day Subscribe",

      "text": "November 14, 2016 Exxon Mobil’s Beaumont refinery (Jake Daniels/The Enterprise) \nExxonMobil is expanding its Beaumont polyethylene chemical plant, adding a new unit and increasing the facility’s capacity by 65 percent, the company announced on Monday. It estimated the work will create 1,400 construction jobs and 40 permanent positions. \nA growing demand for high performance plastics plus an abundant supply of cheap U.S. shale gas, the feedstock for plastics, is motivating the expansion, Exxon said. \nThe company manufactures polyethylene products for packaging applications that deliver light-weight, damage-resistant films. \nExpansion has already started. The new unit will begin operations in 2019. Exxon estimates it will generate $20 billion in economic activity in the first 13 years of operation. \nCurrent polyethylene production capacity is 1 million metric tons per year. The new unit will add another 650,000. \n“The availability of vast new supplies of U.S. shale gas and associated liquids for feedstock and energy is a significant advantage that enables expansion to meet strong global demand growth in polyethylene,” Cindy Shulman, vice president of ExxonMobil’s plastics and resins business, said in a statement. \nThe plant expansion is ExxonMobil’s third significant investment in the Beaumont area in 18 months, the company said.",

      "text": "Exxon Mobil Corp. has agreed to pay $12 million for environmental damages caused by a 2011 pipeline break that spilled 63,000 gallons (238,474 liters) of oil into Montana 's Yellowstone River and prompted a national debate over lax pipeline safety rules, officials said Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. The payment is meant to settle claims from the U.S. and state governments that the crude oil killed fish and wildlife and damaged thousands of acres along an 85-mile (137-kilometer) stretch of the famous river that flows through southern Montana.

XOM says the Beaumont project builds on supply advantages created by the expansion of its Mont Belvieu plastics plant in Texas, where two similar polyethylene units are being added; combined, the new Beaumont uniti will increase XOM's U.S. polyethylene production by 40%, or nearly 2M metric tons/year. XOM’s previously announced investments at Beaumont include expansion of the refinery’s crude refining capacity in 2015 and, earlier this year, construction of a new unit to increase domestic supply of ultra-low sulfur gasoline and diesel.

      "text": "Seth Wenig By Caitlin MacNeal  06 AM EDT \nExxon Mobil has added New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to a lawsuit attempting to block Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's investigation into whether Exxon lied to its investors about what it knew about climate change, Inside Climate News reported. \nIn the newly expanded lawsuit, Exxon argues that the state probes are motivated by political beliefs about climate change. \n\"Attorneys General Schneiderman and Healey have joined together with each other as well as others known and unknown to conduct improper and politically motivated investigations of ExxonMobil in a coordinated effort to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change,\" the complaint reads. \nThe New York attorney general, along with attorneys general in other states, has launched a probe into Exxon, looking into whether the company committed financial fraud by allegedly hiding from investors what it knew about climate change and its effects. The probes prompted Exxon to launch a counter-lawsuit in Texas seeking to block the investigations launched by New York and Massachusetts. \nExxon has already shared some documents with Schneiderman's office regarding the probe. And a New York court ruled last month that Exxon and its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, must comply with a subpoena from the New York attorney general seeking additional documents. \nThe investigations by the state attorneys general have come under scrutiny by Republicans on the House Science Committee, who have charged that the states are conducting a partisan witch hunt.

      "text": "Exxon in Negotiations With Chad About Record $74 Billion Fine Daniel N'Doh Nadjitan Share View photos Exxon Mobil Corp. signage is displayed on a fuel pump at a gas station in Richmond, Kentucky, U.S., on Wednesday, April 29, 2015. Exxon Mobil Corp. is scheduled to release earnings data on April 30. Photographer: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg More Exxon Mobil Corp. is negotiating with Chad’s government about a record $74 billion fine the oil company was told to pay last month by a court in the central African nation because of a dispute over royalties. While the world’s biggest oil producer by market value has appealed the Oct. 5 ruling by the High Court, the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Thomas Dingamgoto, a lawyer for the company, said in an interview in the capital, N’Djamena.

The court imposed the fine in response to a complaint from the Finance Ministry that a consortium led by Irving, Texas-based Exxon hadn’t met its tax obligations. The court also demanded the oil explorer pay $819 million in overdue royalties. More from Bloomberg.com: World’s Biggest Real Estate Frenzy Is Coming to a City Near You The penalty, almost six times Chad’s gross domestic product, is in line with the customs code of a regional organization of which Chad is a member, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States, according to the government’s general director of legal affairs, Fang Langou Operal. ‘Fraudulent Behavior’ The code stipulates that “in the event of fraudulent behavior, as is the case, the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud,” Operal said in an interview in N’Djamena late Monday. He declined to elaborate. Chad says that the consortium should pay 2 percent in royalties on crude exports, even if Exxon argues that it signed a convention with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0.2 percent, according to Dingamgoto. “That convention wasn’t ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state,” Operal said. Judicial workers including judges have been on strike for at least two weeks to protest a reduction of allowances, alongside medical staff and teachers. The government announced a series of austerity measures earlier this year to cope with a steep decline in oil income, which is its main source of foreign revenue. Exxon began exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been pumping oil there since 2003. The company also operates a pipeline that hauls Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export. The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp. and Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd. Chevron sold its stake in Chad in 2014. More from Bloomberg.com",

      "text": "Oil company’s fine appeal has been delayed by the talks Fine exceeds penalty imposed on BP after Deepwater Horizon Share on Facebook \nExxon Mobil Corp. is negotiating with Chad’s government about a record $74 billion fine the oil company was told to pay last month by a court in the central African nation because of a dispute over royalties. \nWhile the world’s biggest oil producer by market value has appealed the Oct. 5 ruling by the High Court, the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Thomas Dingamgoto, a lawyer for the company, said in an interview in the capital, N’Djamena. \nThe penalty exceeds the $61.6 billion financial blow BP Plc incurred after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 killed 11 rig workers and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with crude for months, and is more than 70 times larger than the $977.5 million Exxon was ordered to pay fishermen and other victims of the 1989 Valdez oil spill in Alaska. \nThe court imposed the fine in response to a complaint from the Finance Ministry that a consortium led by Irving, Texas-based Exxon hadn’t met its tax obligations. The court also demanded the oil explorer pay $819 million in overdue royalties. \nThe penalty, almost six times Chad’s gross domestic product, is in line with the customs code of a regional organization of which Chad is a member, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States, according to the government’s general director of legal affairs, Fang Langou Operal. ‘Fraudulent Behavior’ \nThe code stipulates that “in the event of fraudulent behavior, as is the case, the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud,” Operal said in an interview in N’Djamena late Monday. He declined to elaborate. \nChad says that the consortium should pay 2 percent in royalties on crude exports, even if Exxon argues that it signed a convention with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0.2 percent, according to Dingamgoto. \n“That convention wasn’t ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state,” Operal said. \nJudicial workers including judges have been on strike for at least two weeks to protest a reduction of allowances, alongside medical staff and teachers. The government announced a series of austerity measures earlier this year to cope with a steep decline in oil income, which is its main source of foreign revenue. \nExxon began exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been pumping oil there since 2003. The company also operates a pipeline that hauls Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export. The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp. and Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd. Chevron sold its stake in Chad in 2014. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

      "text": "(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is negotiating with Chad over a record $74 billion fine the U.S. oil company was told to pay by a court in the central African nation over unpaid royalties, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\nExxon has appealed the Oct. 5 court ruling, but the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Bloomberg reported, citing a lawyer for Exxon. ( http://bloom.bg/2fRpf5n )\nExxon declined to comment.\nThe court decision fined a consortium led by Exxon over 44 trillion CFA francs ($73.44 billion) - nearly four times BP's Deepwater Horizon settlement and roughly seven times Chad's annual gross domestic product.\nThe consortium, which includes Malaysian state oil firm Petronas (PETRA.UL) and Chadian oil company SNT, were found to owe the country nearly 484 billion CFA francs ($808 million) in royalties, according to the court judgement.\nIt did not explain why the penalty amounted to more than 90 times that amount.\nThe unpaid royalties stem from a dispute over fees, sources in the Chadian Finance Ministry have told Reuters. The Finance Ministry, they said, is seeking a 2 percent royalty fee from the consortium, a rate the defendants have said is higher than the agreed level.\nPetronas and SNT could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n($1 = 599.1400 CFA francs)\n\n(Reporting by Vishaka George in Bengaluru and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Sandra Maler)",

      "text": "Exxon in negotiations with Chad about $74 billion penalty By Bloomberg \nExxon Mobil Corp. is negotiating with Chad’s government about a record $74 billion fine the oil company was told to pay last month by a court in the central African nation because of a dispute over royalties. \nWhile the world’s biggest oil producer by market value has appealed the Oct. 5 ruling by the High Court, the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Thomas Dingamgoto, a lawyer for the company, said in an interview in the capital, N’Djamena. \nThe penalty exceeds the $61.6 billion financial blow BP Plc incurred after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 killed 11 rig workers and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with crude for months, and is more than 70 times larger than the $977.5 million Exxon was ordered to pay fishermen and other victims of the 1989 Valdez oil spill in Alaska. \nThe Chadian court imposed the fine after the Finance Ministry said a consortium led by Irving, Texas-based Exxon hadn’t met tax obligations. The court also demanded the oil explorer pay $819 million in overdue royalties. \n“This dispute relates to disagreement over commitments made by the government to the consortium, not the government’s ability to impose taxes,” Todd Spitler, an Exxon spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “It is vital for all parties to honor the terms of a contract and abide by applicable law in order to achieve the desired long-term benefits envisioned when projects begin.” \nThe penalty, almost six times Chad’s gross domestic product, is in line with the customs code of a regional organization of which Chad is a member, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States, according to the government’s general director of legal affairs, Fang Langou Operal. \n‘Fraudulent Behavior’The code stipulates that “in the event of fraudulent behavior, as is the case, the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud,” Operal said in an interview in N’Djamena late Monday. He declined to elaborate. \nChad says that the consortium should pay 2 percent in royalties on crude exports, even if Exxon argues that it signed a convention with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0.2 percent, according to Dingamgoto. \n“That convention wasn’t ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state,” Operal said. \nJudicial workers including judges have been on strike for at least two weeks to protest a reduction of allowances, alongside medical staff and teachers. The government announced a series of austerity measures earlier this year to cope with a steep decline in oil income, which is its main source of foreign revenue. \nExxon began exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been pumping oil there since 2003. The company also operates a pipeline that hauls Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export. The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp. and Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd. Chevron sold its stake in Chad in 2014.",

The court also demanded the oil explorer pay $819 million in overdue royalties.\n“This dispute relates to disagreement over commitments made by the government to the consortium, not the government’s ability to impose taxes,” Todd Spitler, an Exxon spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “It is vital for all parties to honor the terms of a contract and abide by applicable law in order to achieve the desired long-term benefits envisioned when projects begin.”\nThe penalty, almost six times Chad’s gross domestic product, is in line with the customs code of a regional organization of which Chad is a member, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States, according to the government’s general director of legal affairs, Fang Langou Operal.\n‘Fraudulent Behavior’\nThe code stipulates that “in the event of fraudulent behavior, as is the case, the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud,” Operal said in an interview in N’Djamena late Monday. He declined to elaborate.\nChad says that the consortium should pay 2 percent in royalties on crude exports, even if Exxon argues that it signed a convention with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0.2 percent, according to Dingamgoto.\n“That convention wasn’t ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state,” Operal said.\nJudicial workers including judges have been on strike for at least two weeks to protest a reduction of allowances, alongside medical staff and teachers. The government announced a series of austerity measures earlier this year to cope with a steep decline in oil income, which is its main source of foreign revenue.\nExxon began exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been pumping oil there since 2003. The company also operates a pipeline that hauls Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export. The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp. and Malaysia’s state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd. Chevron sold its stake in Chad in 2014.\n--With assistance from Joe Carroll To contact the reporter on this story: Daniel N'doh Nadjitan in N'Djamena at nnadjitan@bloomberg.net.

      "text": "Published: 1:00 AM, November 16, 2016 Updated: 7:50 AM, November 16, 2016 \nExxon Mobil Corp <XOM.N>is negotiating with Chad over a record $74 billion fine the U.S. oil company was told to pay by a court in the central African nation over unpaid royalties, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. \nExxon has appealed the Oct. 5 court ruling, but the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Bloomberg reported, citing a lawyer for Exxon. ( http://bloom.bg/2fRpf5n ) \nExxon declined to comment. \nThe court decision fined a consortium led by Exxon over 44 trillion CFA francs ($73.44 billion) - nearly four times BP's Deepwater Horizon settlement and roughly seven times Chad's annual gross domestic product. [nL5N1CC52Q] \nThe consortium, which includes Malaysian state oil firm Petronas <PETRA.UL> and Chadian oil company SNT, were found to owe the country nearly 484 billion CFA francs ($808 million) in royalties, according to the court judgment. \nIt did not explain why the penalty amounted to more than 90 times that amount. \nThe unpaid royalties stem from a dispute over fees, sources in the Chadian Finance Ministry have told Reuters. The Finance Ministry, they said, is seeking a 2 percent royalty fee from the consortium, a rate the defendants have said is higher than the agreed level. \nPetronas and SNT could not immediately be reached for comment.

      "text": "Exxon in negotiations with Chad about record $74 billion fine Daniel N'doh Nadjitan, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nExxon Mobil Corp. is negotiating with Chad's government about a record $74 billion fine the oil company was told to pay last month by a court in the central African nation because of a dispute over royalties. \nWhile the world's biggest oil producer by market value has appealed the Oct. 5 ruling by the High Court, the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Thomas Dingamgoto, a lawyer for the company, said in an interview in the capital, N'Djamena. \nThe penalty exceeds the $61.6 billion financial blow BP Plc incurred after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 killed 11 rig workers and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with crude for months, and is more than 70 times larger than the $977.5 million Exxon was ordered to pay fishermen and other victims of the 1989 Valdez oil spill in Alaska. \nThe court imposed the fine in response to a complaint from the Finance Ministry that a consortium led by Irving, Texas-based Exxon hadn't met its tax obligations. The court also demanded the oil explorer pay $819 million in overdue royalties. \nThe penalty, almost six times Chad's gross domestic product, is in line with the customs code of a regional organization of which Chad is a member, the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States, according to the government's general director of legal affairs, Fang Langou Operal. \nThe code stipulates that \"in the event of fraudulent behavior, as is the case, the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud,\" Operal said in an interview in N'Djamena late Monday. He declined to elaborate. \nChad says that the consortium should pay 2 percent in royalties on crude exports, even if Exxon argues that it signed a convention with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0.2 percent, according to Dingamgoto. \n\"That convention wasn't ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state,\" Operal said. \nJudicial workers including judges have been on strike for at least two weeks to protest a reduction of allowances, alongside medical staff and teachers. The government announced a series of austerity measures earlier this year to cope with a steep decline in oil income, which is its main source of foreign revenue. \nExxon began exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been pumping oil there since 2003. The company also operates a pipeline that hauls Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export. The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp. and Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional. Chevron sold its stake in Chad in 2014. ",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nJacobs Engineering Group Inc. ( JEC - Free Report ) secured a contract from Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM - Free Report ) , for an undisclosed amount. Per the deal, Jacobs would be providing its premium engineering, construction management and designing services for part of a new 650 kTa polyethylene facility of Exxon Mobil, located in its Beaumont polyethylene plant. \nPer the contract, Jacobs would be supporting the installation as well as works of various offsite facilities of the plant, such as interconnecting piping and rail, for the new polyethylene train. Post completion, the facility will produce pelletized polyethylene which shall be used for manufacturing plastic products. \nJacobs declared that it would design an efficient and safe construction plan for the 650 kTa polyethylene facility, and improve the degree of versatility and integration of the plant as well. \nWe believe that the latest expansion contract received from Exxon Mobil would reinforce Jacobs’ ongoing organic growth strategy. Moreover, the company has recently won a number of major Australian transportation contracts. All these deals are expected to boost Jacobs’ top line in the quarters ahead. \nHowever, amid such prospective deals, Jacobs carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Major headwinds such as a strong U.S. dollar, cutthroat industry competition and dismal pricing environment in the global mining and energy markets have been hurting the company’s growth prospects. \nJACOBS ENGIN GR Price",

[nL5N1CC52Q] \nThe consortium, which includes Malaysian state oil firm Petronas PETRA.UL and Chadian oil company SNT, were found to owe the country nearly 484 billion CFA francs ($808 million) in royalties, according to the court judgment. \nIt did not explain why the penalty amounted to more than 90 times that amount. \nThe unpaid royalties stem from a dispute over fees, sources in the Chadian Finance Ministry have told Reuters. The Finance Ministry, they said, is seeking a 2 percent royalty fee from the consortium, a rate the defendants have said is higher than the agreed level. \nPetronas and SNT could not immediately be reached for comment. \n(Reporting by Vishaka George in Bengaluru and Ernest Scheyder in Houston; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Sandra Maler) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Exxon agrees to pay millions for Yellowstone River spill \nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — An Oregon man who died after falling into a scalding Yellowstone National Park hot spring in June was looking for a place to “hot pot,” the forbidden practice of soaking in one of the park’s thermal features, officials said. \nSable Scott told investigators that she and her 23-year-old brother, Colin, left a boardwalk near Pork Chop Geyser and walked several hundred feet up a hill in search of “a place that they could potentially get into and soak,” Deputy Chief Ranger Lorant Veress told KULR-TV (bit.ly/2fulh4g) in an interview. \nAs Sable Scott took video of her brother with her cellphone on June 7, he reached down to check the water temperature and slipped and fell into a thermal pool about 6 feet long, 4 feet wide and 10 feet deep, according to a National Park Service incident record first reported by KULR. \nPark officials did not release the video or a description of it, but the report said it also chronicled Sable Scott’s efforts to rescue her brother. \nSearch and rescue rangers spotted Colin Scott’s body floating in the pool the day of the accident, but a lightning storm prevented recovery, the report said. \nThe next day, workers could not find any remains in the boiling, acidic water. \n“In very short order, there was a significant amount of dissolving,” Veress said. \nThe report included images of several signs warning people of the dangers of the park’s geothermal features and of traveling off walkways in the area where Colin Scott died. \nThe National Park Service did not issue any citations in the case. \nScott was on a college graduation trip with his sister at the time of his death, which came a day after six people were cited for walking off-trail at the park’s Grand Prismatic Spring. \nA week later, a tourist from China was fined $1,000 for breaking through the fragile crust in the Mammoth Hot Springs area, apparently to collect water for medicinal purposes.

      "text": "Exxon to depose Massachusetts, NY AGs in climate case By Timothy Cama - 11/18/16 10:01 AM EST \nA federal judge is allowing Exxon Mobil Corp. to depose the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York over those states’ climate change investigations into the oil giant.Judge Ed Kinkeade of Texas ordered that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) go to Dallas Dec. 13 for a deposition, and that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) also be “available” in Dallas that day. ADVERTISEMENT Kinkeade said he will issue an order for Schneiderman’s deposition once he responds to Exxon’s claims against him.Healey and Schneiderman are both investigating whether Exxon committed fraud by downplaying the science of climate change and its effect on its business in communications to the public and investors.Exxon wants the federal court to dismiss the attorneys general’s investigative demands, arguing that they are illegal because they were made in bad faith and for political purposes.The controversy has exploded in the last year as a representation of environmentalists’ demands to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for climate change, and the companies’ charges that their rights to free speech are being violated.Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the deposition reinforces a previous order from Kinkeade that allowed discovery in Exxon’s challenge to Healey.“We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit,” Jeffer said in a statement. “We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.”Healey’s office declined to comment on the order, and Schneiderman’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

      "text": "  Valerie Richardson     \nA federal judge has advised two Democratic attorneys general leading the charge against ExxonMobil to appear for pretrial testimony on their climate-change investigations. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey are scheduled to undergo depositions by Exxon attorneys on Dec. 13 in Dallas, according to the Thursday order by U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade. \nExxon is challenging the prosecutors’ subpoenas demanding thousands of documents and communications related to probes into whether the company committed fraud by misleading the public about its research on global warming. \nExxon has argued that the investigations are politically motivated “witch hunts” that violate the First Amendment, while the Democrats have countered that “fraud” is not protected by the Constitution. \n“The court’s order reinforces its original order that discovery be permitted after finding statements made by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey about her investigation into ExxonMobil were of concern to the court and may constitute bad faith,” said Exxon spokesman Alan T. Jeffers. \nHe referred to an Oct. 13 order by Judge Kinkeade permitting Exxon to conduct discovery in order to determine whether Ms. Healey was motivated by “bias or prejudgment.” \nMr. Schneiderman was added to the order last week. \n“We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit,” Mr. Jeffers said in a Friday statement. “We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.” \nBoth Ms. Healey and Mr. Schneiderman have defended their probes as legitimate inquiries into whether Exxon misrepresented its research to consumers and investors. \nSchneiderman spokesman Eric Soufer has also accused the company of “forum-shopping” by filing its case in Texas instead of New York. \n“We will respond appropriately,” said Mr. Soufer in a Friday statement. \nMr. Schneiderman won a round last month when the New York State Supreme Court ordered Exxon to produce the subpoenaed documents, a decision the company is appealing. \n“We are pleased with the Court’s order and look forward to moving full-steam ahead with our fraud investigation of Exxon,” Mr. Schneiderman said in an Oct. 26 statement . \nHe leads a coalition of 17 attorneys general — 16 Democrats and one independent — who vowed at a March 29 press conference to “fight for climate progress” by pursuing fossil-fuel companies and others who challenge the catastrophic climate-change position. \nAt the press conference, the attorneys general cited a 2015 InsideClimate News series called “Exxon: The Road Not Taken,” which accused Exxon of working “at the forefront of climate denial” by concealing research on the seriousness of climate change, prompting the #ExxonKnew social-media campaign. \nExxon has argued that its research was publicly available, inconclusive and no different from that undertaken by scientists elsewhere. \n“We reject attempts to portray legitimate scientific observations and differences on policy approaches as climate denial,” said Mr. Jeffers in an earlier statement. “To suggest that we had reached definitive conclusions, decades before the world’s experts and while climate science was in an early stage of development, is not credible.”",

      "text": "11/19/16 AT 8:32 AM Close \nTwo state attorneys general will be deposed next week in relation to fraud investigations they launched to find out if Exxon had committed fraud by denying climate change science to the public and investors. The depositions are a win for the oil giant, which alleges the two law enforcement officials had acted in bad faith and with political motivations to damage the oil and gas industry. \nNews broke Friday that Judge Ed Kinkeade of Texas ruled in favor of bringing in New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to be questioned. Critics of the lawsuit and the judge’s decision responded Friday saying the depositions present an unprecedented intervention in law enforcement investigations that sets a dangerous precedent. \n“This will have a terribly chilling effect on any prosecutor looking into the behavior of public companies because they’ll have to factor in that the company will use this tactic to impede the investigation from the very start” Brad Campbell, president of the Indiana-based non-profit Conservation Law Center told International Business Times. \nThe former Justice Department trial attorney in the ‘90s added: “This is really extraordinary and the precedent is so dangerous in terms of the impact on law enforcement that there really should be either a circuit court order or the Supreme Court will need to intervene if this judge continues down this road.” \nThe controversy surrounding the two attorneys general has been brewing for months after they announced their investigations to hold oil companies accountable for their role in climate change, which is the result of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. Exxon and other fuel companies charge that their rights to free speech have been violated by the investigations. \nLast month, Kinkeade issued a discovery order against Healey that opened the door for Exxon to access a range of documents including her internal phone records and other communications or depositions related to the case. That discovery was justified, Exxon argued, because Healey had spoken in an “anticipatory nature” publicly before investigations into the fraud allegations were finished. \nJust a week ago, discovery related to Schneiderman was also granted by Kinkeade, an appointee of former President George W. Bush. Related Stories Report Predicts Bleak Future For Exxon Mobil \n“We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit,” Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Spokesman, said of the depositions in a statement . “We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.” \nHealey and other attorneys general announced their investigations into Exxon for potentially misleading investors and the public on the dangers of climate change in March at a conference titled “AGs United for Clean Power.” \n“Fossil fuel companies that deceived investors and consumers about the dangers of climate change should be, must be, held accountable,” Healey said then. “We can all see today the troubling disconnect between what Exxon knew, what industry folks knew, and what the company and industry chose to share with investors and with the American public.” \nWhen contacted by the International Business Times, Healey’s office declined to comment on the deposition orders. Schneiderman’s office did not return an email for comment.  ",

      "text": "Exxon Climate Judge Orders ‘Unprecedented’ Questioning (3) Erik Larson Nov 20, 2016 4:36 am ET (Bloomberg) -- A federal judge in Texas is giving Exxon Mobil Corp. an unprecedented chance to question a state law-enforcement officer who is investigating whether the energy company hid damaging data about climate change from investors. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas on Thursday ordered Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to appear in the city on Dec. 13 to face questions from Exxon lawyers. The company claims her probe into the company’s public statements about global warming is politically motivated. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company’s lawsuit last week. He’s fighting to avoid being deposed, but was \"advised\" by the judge to appear in Dallas on the same date. Douglas Gansler, the attorney general of Maryland from 2007 to 2015, said he’s never heard of an instance where a company under investigation by a state sues and wins permission to question law-enforcement officers. \"Not only is it unusual, it’s unprecedented,\" Gansler, a Democrat who isn’t involved in the litigation, said in an interview. \"It’s completely inconsistent with the law and the functioning of our government.\" Company Information Massachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether Irving, Texas-based Exxon violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding from investors information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate and may impact its businesses. The states are also looking into whether Exxon has properly accounted for its oil-and-gas reserves following a global drop in prices. Exxon has denied the allegations, saying the valuation of its assets meets all legal standards. The company has denied wrongdoing in the case. \"We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit.\" said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon’s spokesman. \"We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.\" Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, called the ruling a “windfall to lawbreakers.” Drug Lords, Mobsters “For the first and only time, a federal judge is forcing the chief law enforcement official of a state to disclose sensitive sources and methods before even being allowed to gather evidence,” Campbell said in an e-mailed statement. “Drug lords and mobsters will use this ruling as a new shield against investigation and prosecution.” Schneiderman filed his own lawsuit against Exxon in state court in New York, saying the company has failed to comply with a demand for records about the impact of climate change on the valuation of its assets. The state’s top cop claims Exxon is likely delaying in the hope that it’ll succeed in the Texas case before the company is forced to hand over the documents. \"We will respond appropriately,\" Schneiderman spokesman Eric Soufer said without elaborating. Healey has argued that Texas doesn’t have jurisdiction in the matter and is awaiting a ruling on a request to dismiss Exxon’s suit. \"We continue to litigate against Exxon in Massachusetts state court, where this dispute properly belongs, and will fight aggressively to investigate whether Exxon Mobil deceived consumers and investors about the impact of fossil fuels,\" Healey’s spokeswoman, Chloe Gotsis, said in a statement. The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). (Updates with comment in ninth paragraph.) ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "by Neela Banerjee, John H. Cushman Jr., David Hasemyer, and Lisa Song InsideClimate News, 88 pp., $5.99 (paper) What Exxon Knew About the Earth’s Melting Arctic an article by Sara Jerving, Katie Jennings, Masako Melissa Hirsch, and Susanne Rust Los Angeles Times , October 9, 2015 How Exxon Went from Leader to Skeptic on Climate Change Research an article by Katie Jennings, Dino Grandoni, and Susanne Rust Los Angeles Times , October 23, 2015 Big Oil Braced for Global Warming While It Fought Regulations an article by Amy Lieberman and Susanne Rust Los Angeles Times , December 31, 2015 Archival Documents on Exxon’s Climate History available at www.climatefiles.com Smoke, Mirrors and Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco’s Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, January 2007, available at www.ucsusa.org Pascal Sittler/REA/Redux Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil, at the World Gas Conference, Paris, June 2015 \nEarlier this year our organization, the Rockefeller Family Fund ( RFF ), announced that it would divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies. We mean to do this gradually, but in a public statement we singled out ExxonMobil for immediate divestment because of its “morally reprehensible conduct.” 1 For over a quarter-century the company tried to deceive policymakers and the public about the realities of climate change, protecting its profits at the cost of immense damage to life on this planet. \nOur criticism carries a certain historical irony. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil, and ExxonMobil is Standard Oil’s largest direct descendant. In a sense we were turning against the company where most of the Rockefeller family’s wealth was created. (Other members of the Rockefeller family have been trying to get ExxonMobil to change its behavior for over a decade.) Approached by some reporters for comment, an ExxonMobil spokesman replied, “It’s not surprising that they’re divesting from the company since they’re already funding a conspiracy against us.” 2 \nWhat we had funded was an investigative journalism project. With help from other public charities and foundations, including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund ( RBF ), we paid for a team of independent reporters from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism to try to determine what Exxon and other US oil companies had really known about climate science, and when. Such an investigation seemed promising because Exxon, in particular, has been a leader of the movement to deny the facts of climate change. 3 Often working indirectly through front groups, it sponsored many of the scientists and think tanks that have sought to obfuscate the scientific consensus about the changing climate, and it participated in those efforts through its paid advertisements and the statements of its executives. \nIt seemed to us, however, that for business reasons, a company as sophisticated and successful as Exxon would have needed to know the difference between its own propaganda and scientific reality. If it turned out that Exxon and other oil companies had recognized the validity of climate science even while they were funding the climate denial movement, that would, we thought, help the public understand how artificially manufactured and disingenuous the “debate” over climate change has always been. In turn, we hoped this understanding would build support for strong policies addressing the crisis of global warming. \nIndeed, the Columbia reporters learned that Exxon had understood and accepted the validity of climate science long before embarking on its denial campaign, and in the fall of 2015 they published their discoveries in The Los Angeles Timess . 4 Around the same time, another team of reporters from the website InsideClimate News began publishing the results of similar research. 5 (The RFF has made grants to InsideClimate News , and the RBF has been one of its most significant funders, but we didn’t know they were engaged in this project.) The reporting by these two different groups was complementary, each confirming and adding to the other’s findings. \nFollowing publication of these articles, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began investigating whether ExxonMobil had committed fraud by failing to disclose many of the business risks of climate change to its shareholders despite evidence that it understood those risks internally. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey soon followed Schneiderman with her own investigation, as did the AG s of California and the Virgin Islands, and thirteen more state AG s announced that they were considering investigations. \nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton each called for a federal investigation of ExxonMobil by the Department of Justice. Secretary of State John Kerry compared Exxon’s deceptions to the tobacco industry’s long denial of the danger of smoking, predicting that, if the allegations were true, Exxon might eventually have to pay billions of dollars in damages “in what I would imagine would be one of the largest class-action lawsuits in history.” 6 Most recently, in August, the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the way ExxonMobil values its assets, given the world’s growing commitment to reducing carbon emissions. An article in The Wall Street Journal observed that this “could have far-reaching consequences for the oil and gas industry.” 7 We didn’t expect ExxonMobil to admit that it had been at fault. It is one of the largest companies in the world—indeed, if its revenues are compared to the gross domestic products of nations, it has one of the world’s larger economies, bigger than Austria’s, for example, or Thailand’s 8 —and it has a reputation for unusual determination in promoting its self-interest. 9 One way or another, we expected it to fight back—most likely, we thought, by proxy, through its surrogates in the right-wing press and in Congress. \nSure enough, various bloggers have been calling for “the Rockefellers” 10 to be prosecuted by the government for “conspiracy” against Exxon under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act. 11 (Such lines of attack are being tested and refined, and we expect they will soon be repeated in journals with broader readership.) And in May, Texas Republican Lamar Smith, the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, sent a letter to the RFF and seven other NGO s (including the RBF , 350.org, Greenpeace, and the Union of Concerned Scientists), 12 as well as all seventeen AG s who said they might investigate ExxonMobil. He accused us of engaging in “a coordinated effort to deprive companies, nonprofit organizations, and scientists of their First Amendment rights and ability to fund and conduct scientific research free from intimidation and threats of prosecution,” and demanded that we turn over to him all private correspondence between any of the recipients of his letter relating to any potential climate change investigation. When we all refused, twice, to surrender any such correspondence, Smith subpoenaed Schneiderman, Healey, and all eight NGO s for the same documents. \nWe will answer Smith’s accusations against us presently. In order to explain ourselves, however, we first have to explain what Exxon knew about climate change, and when—and what, despite that knowledge, Exxon did: the morally reprehensible conduct that prompted our actions in the first place. Large oil companies must possess considerable scientific expertise. In that respect as in others, Exxon has always been an industry leader: the company today says it employs about 16,000 scientists and engineers. 13 And the basic mechanism of climate change is relatively straightforward, long-established science. In the 1850s, John Tyndall discovered that atmospheric carbon dioxide acts as a “greenhouse gas,” meaning that it reflects heat rising from the earth back to the planet’s surface. The Swedish geochemist Svante Arrhenius realized at the beginning of the twentieth century that people were burning fossil fuels in quantities great enough to warm the entire planet with the CO 2 they released. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson told Congress, “This generation has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale through…a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.” 14 So it is no surprise that by the late 1970s and early 1980s, Exxon scientists largely understood climate change—not only its basic mechanism but many of its implications, including its potential implications for the oil business—and had explained it to the company’s leaders. \nIn 1977, for example, an Exxon scientist named James Black gave a presentation to the company’s Management Committee. He explained, accurately, what the “greenhouse effect” is and how measurements of atmospheric CO 2 that had been taken since 1957 showed it was steadily increasing. And, although emphasizing that climate science still had to deal with untested assumptions and uncertainties, he said that “current opinion overwhelmingly favors attributing atmospheric CO 2 increase to fossil fuel combustion.” 15 “Present thinking,” Black added a year later, “holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.” 16 \nBy 1980, a report written by Exxon’s Canadian subsidiary and distributed to Exxon managers around the world stated matter-of-factly, “It is assumed that the major contributors of CO 2 are the burning of fossil fuels…and oxidation of carbon stored in trees and soil humus…. There is no doubt that increases in fossil fuel usage and decreases in forest cover are aggravating the potential problem of increased CO 2 in the atmosphere.” 17 The next year Roger Cohen, director of Exxon’s Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences Laboratory, wrote in an internal memo that by 2030, projected cumulative carbon emissions could, after a delay, “produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the earth’s population).” 18 \nIn 1982, Cohen added that “over the past several years a clear scientific consensus has emerged”: atmospheric CO 2 would double from its preindustrial quantity sometime in the second half of the twenty-first century, producing an average increase in global temperature of three degrees Celsius, plus or minus 1.5 degrees. “There is unanimous agreement in the scientific community,” he went on, “that a temperature increase of this magnitude would bring about significant changes in the earth’s climate, including rainfall distribution and alterations in the biosphere.” 19 \nIt was clear, too, what a problem these conclusions posed for the oil industry. As a 1979 Exxon memo reported, \nModels predict that the present trend of fossil fuel use will lead to dramatic climatic changes within the next 75 years…. Should it be deemed necessary to maintain atmospheric CO 2 levels to prevent significant climatic changes, dramatic changes in patterns of energy use would be required. 20 \nIn other words, the world would have to curtail its use of fossil fuels substantially. Senior Exxon scientist Henry Shaw warned management that according to the predictions of the National Academy of Sciences, global warming, not any lack of supply, would force humankind to stop burning fossil fuels. 21 \nIn 1982, an Exxon environmental affairs manager named Marvin Glaser wrote a thirty-nine-page primer on climate change that he distributed widely among management. 22 It confirmed that, despite remaining points of scientific uncertainty, “mitigation of the ‘greenhouse effect’ would require major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.” If these weren’t achieved, Glaser warned, “all biological systems are likely to be affected” and “there are some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered,” including an expected “dramatic impact on soil moisture, and in turn, on agriculture,” and, eventually, the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, which would flood “much of the US East Coast, including the State of Florida and Washington D.C.” He believed that “potentially serious climate problems are not likely to occur until the late 21st century,” but added, “once the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible.” Darren Staples/Reuters Climate scientist James Hansen at a mock gravestone declaring ‘Climate Change: A Matter of Life and Death,’ Coventry, England, March 2009 If much was already understood about climate change, however, there were still points of uncertainty. Scientists knew that the ocean, for example, would absorb some fraction of the CO 2 being added to the atmosphere (and become more acidic in the process), but just how much was unclear. They also knew that the ocean acted as a thermal reservoir—that it would absorb a great deal of the additional heat reflected back to the planet’s surface from increased atmospheric CO 2, beginning to release it only after a considerable delay, perhaps of decades. But just how long that delay would be depended on how much mixing there was between the ocean’s upper and lower depths, and that wasn’t well understood either. \nCohen’s “clear scientific consensus” notwithstanding, such lingering questions meant that scientists still disagreed about precisely how much the climate would change, and how quickly. The computerized models they were building to forecast those effects were also considered much more reliable in predicting average global changes than specific regional ones (except near the poles, where almost everyone agreed that warming would be particularly severe). None of these legitimate uncertainties in climate science, however, implied any doubt about its main conclusions: that the changing climate would soon have dramatic impacts on the earth, and that it was primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. 23 \nMany Exxon scientists and executives wanted to be able to predict how severe climate change would be and when, to better anticipate changes in energy policy. They wanted not only to understand the science thoroughly, but to earn a reputation as trusted leaders in it so they could better defend the company’s interests against “conclusions drawn from the [international research] program which might be biased for political or other reasons.” 24 As Henry Shaw put it, “We should determine how Exxon can best participate in [climate research] and influence possible legislation on environmental controls. It is important to begin to anticipate the strong intervention of environmental groups and be prepared to respond with reliable and credible data.” 25 \nSo, with its extraordinary resources, Exxon became a corporate leader in climate science. It equipped its largest supertanker as a research vessel, measuring CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere and at different depths of the ocean all along the ship’s route. 26 It also became expert in computerized climate modeling, not only to evaluate the predictions of others but to help improve such models. Ultimately, one of its scientists published nearly fifty peer-reviewed papers about various technical aspects of climate change. 27 \nThe company’s early findings may not have been quite what management was looking for, however. In 1985, for example, Exxon astrophysicist Brian Flannery and NYU physicist Martin Hoffert wrote a chapter for a US Department of Energy report using their own climate models to predict global warming of as much as six degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century unless greenhouse gas emissions were reduced. 28 As Roger Cohen had written three years earlier, “The results of our research are in accord with the scientific consensus on the effect of increased atmospheric CO 2 on climate.” Cohen believed that “our ethical responsibility is to permit the publication of our research in the scientific literature; indeed to do otherwise would be a breach of Exxon’s public position and ethical credo on honesty and integrity.” 29 \nThen, however, in 1988, the United States was struck by the costliest drought in its history. Widespread heat waves were blamed for more than five thousand deaths; fires swept over the West, engulfing much of Yellowstone National Park. That June, the NASA scientist James Hansen told Congress that “the greenhouse effect is real, it is coming soon, and it will have major effects on all peoples.” 30 Suddenly the notion of global warming was everywhere— Time named “Endangered Earth” its “Planet of the Year.” And Exxon’s public position changed dramatically. \nIn August 1988, an Exxon public affairs manager drafted a memo called “The Greenhouse Effect.” He acknowledged that “the principal greenhouse gases are by-products of fossil fuel combustion.” However, he wrote, the “Exxon Position” would now be to “emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions regarding the potential enhanced greenhouse effect.” 31 What did that mean? In 1989 Duane LeVine, Exxon’s manager of science and strategy development, told the company’s board of directors that the scientific consensus was now that global temperatures would rise by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius by the middle of the twenty-first century, with “enormous potential global impacts.” But, he added, “arguments that we can’t tolerate delay and must act now can lead to irreversible and costly Draconian steps.” So Exxon would “extend the science,” convincing policymakers and the public that climate change was still insufficiently understood and that more research needed to be done before significant action could be warranted. Meanwhile, it would emphasize the cost of reducing carbon emissions. 32 \nThis strategy recalled to us the conclusions of the book Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming , in which the historians of science Naomi Oreskes (Harvard) and Erik Conway (California Institute of Technology) tell the story of what they call the “Tobacco Strategy.” Tobacco industry scientists and executives knew by 1953 that smoking caused cancer. Rather than see sales diminish, however, they decided to deceive the public. Since the proof of smoking’s danger was established by science, they resolved on a long-term effort to create doubt about that science. And they realized that the best, most credible messengers in a campaign to discredit established science would be other scientists. 33 \nThe tobacco industry found and funded scientists who, “cherry-picking data and focusing on unexplained or anomalous details,” would argue that the causal link between smoking and cancer had not been proven. (Since there are lingering uncertainties around any settled point of science—why some smokers get lung cancer and others don’t, for example—this is always an easy argument to make, even when it is a specious one.) By this time, the scientific consensus was that smoking’s danger had been proven; those who denied it were dramatically outnumbered. But the industry also funded a network of “free-market,” antiregulatory think tanks to repeat and amplify the claims of its scientists. (It tried to hide the fact that it was paying these scientists and think tanks, often routing its payments through front groups like law firms or right-wing foundations.) \nThen the industry manufactured an artificial “‘debate,’ convincing the mass media that responsible journalists had an obligation to present ‘both sides’ of it.” The industry didn’t need to win this debate, its leaders realized; only to keep it going. “Doubt is our product,” explained a tobacco executive’s 1969 memo, “since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the minds of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.” 34 \nAs we know, this campaign ultimately failed, but it succeeded for an astonishingly long time. The tobacco industry didn’t begin losing court cases until the 1990s, some four decades after realizing that its product killed its customers. 35 In the meantime, it made enormous profits. Other industrial leaders took note, and when they found themselves in similar situations—when scientists had shown that their businesses were causing acid rain, depleting the ozone layer, or harming human health, and when, in consequence, they faced the prospect of governmental regulation—they began copying the tobacco strategy. In doing so they often relied on the same small group of scientists and think tanks that the tobacco industry had used. 36 When Exxon began to “emphasize the uncertainty” of climate science, the scientists who espoused its positions were often veterans of those earlier denial campaigns. Among them were Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, Robert Jastrow, and Bill Nierenberg. They had all been reputable, prominent physicists during the cold war, but they eventually became, essentially, professional deniers of science, arguing on one issue after another that findings harmful to industry were “unproven,”“junk science.” Oreskes and Conway believe that their motivation was less mercenary than ideological, although they were often paid by the organizations they directed or worked with, which in turn were supported by the industries they defended. They were all fervent anti-Communists and ardent free-market purists. Especially after the cold war ended, they saw environmentalists as the next great threat to capitalism, since, by pointing out the damage industry sometimes does to the environment and human health, defenders of the environment are implicitly criticizing the workings of free markets and bolstering the case for regulation. 37 \nThese men were not experts in climate science, and the reports they wrote, though adorned with “the trappings of scientific argumentation—graphs, charts, references, and the like,” were not “subject to independent peer review—the most basic requirement of any truly scientific work.” 38 It seems quite clear that they sometimes consciously misrepresented real science in their arguments, persisting even after their fallacies and distortions were revealed publicly. 39 Sometimes Seitz and Singer and others simply tried to smear the legitimate climate scientists whose work seemed most threatening to them. 40 Either way, their claims were echoed, promoted, and “validated” by the same free-market think tanks that had previously fought the scientific consensus on issues like smoking, acid rain, and the ozone layer—think tanks that Exxon funded. 41 Then the fake debate they created was broadcast further and given an additional veneer of credibility by journalists, some of whom were persuaded by spurious arguments about the need for “balanced” reporting, even on issues the scientific community considered settled, and some of whom, it turned out, were simply in Exxon’s pay. 42 \nExxon didn’t always rely on the writings of such scientists. For decades it published frequent “advertorials” on the editorial page of The New York Times , questioning the reality of climate change or its human cause, or arguing that predictions about global warming were too unreliable to justify efforts to prevent it. 43 And in 1997, for example, at the World Petroleum Congress in Beijing, Exxon CEO Lee Raymond gave a speech in which he claimed, falsely, that “the earth is cooler today than it was twenty years ago.” (1997 would be the hottest year ever measured; that record has been broken repeatedly since then.) 44 Raymond went on to disparage the climate models his own scientists had helped develop, and concluded by saying: \nLet’s agree there’s a lot we really don’t know about how climate will change in the twenty-first century and beyond. That means we need to understand the issue better, and fortunately, we have time. It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or twenty years from now. 45 In 1998 Exxon participated in a $6 million public relations campaign by the American Petroleum Institute (a trade association which Exxon heavily influenced and supported) to prevent the United States from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The “action plan” for this campaign stated: \nVictory will be achieved when: average citizens “understand” (recognize) uncertainties in climate science; recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the “conventional wisdom”…[and] those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality. \nBut, it cautioned, “unless ‘climate change’ becomes a non-issue, meaning that the Kyoto proposal is defeated and there are no further initiatives to thwart the threat of climate change, there may be no moment when we can declare victory for our efforts.” 46 The campaign was highly successful: the US never did join the Kyoto Protocol. \nStill, ExxonMobil (as it became in 1999) continued to spend extraordinary sums on lobbying, directly and through trade associations: $240 million since 1998. 47 And in 2001, soon after President George W. Bush was inaugurated, the company’s chief lobbyist sent a memo to the White House making several requests. He asked the new administration to get rid of the scientist who chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ), the UN body that is the world’s leading authority on the subject. He also asked that a number of other scientists and officials be fired from their jobs in the White House and the State Department, to be replaced by known climate skeptics. 48 Exxon CEO Raymond and Vice President Dick Cheney were old friends, and Cheney had already taken practical control of the administration’s energy policy. 49 ExxonMobil got its wishes. 50 As Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill said around the same time to the Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine Todd Whitman, when she told him that Cheney had convinced Bush to repudiate his campaign promises about limiting carbon emissions, “We just gave away the environment.” 51 \nExxonMobil and its allies are still standing in the way of effective action to address climate change, as we will show in a second article. \n— This is the first of two articles . 1 \nSee www.rffund.org/divestment . ↩ 2 \nSee Rupert Neate, “Rockefeller Family Charity to Withdraw All Investments in Fossil Fuel Companies,” The Guardian , March 23, 2016; Joe Carroll, “Rockefellers Dump Exxon Holdings That Made Family’s Fortune,” Bloomberg , March 23, 2016. ↩ 3 \nSee, e.g., Justin Farrell, “Corporate Funding and Ideological Polarization About Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America , January 5, 2016; Steve Coll, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power (Penguin, 2012), pp. 184–185, 619–620; Union of Concerned Scientists, “Smoke, Mirrors and Hot Air: How ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco’s Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science,” January 2007, pp. 1–3. ↩ 4 \nSara Jerving, Katie Jennings, Masako Melissa Hirsch, and Susanne Rust, “What Exxon Knew about the Earth’s Melting Arctic,” Los Angeles Times , October 9, 2015 ( graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/ ); Katie Jennings, Dino Grandoni, and Susanne Rust, “How Exxon Went from Leader to Skeptic on Climate Change Research,” Los Angeles Times , October 23, 2015 (graphics.latimes.com/exxon-research/); Amy Lieberman and Susanne Rust, “Big Oil Braced for Global Warming While It Fought Regulations,” Los Angeles Times , December 31, 2015 (graphics.latimes.com/oil-operations/). ↩ 5 \nSee insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken , reviewed in these pages by Tim Flannery, “Fury Over Fracking,” April 21, 2016. ↩ 6 \nSee Lisa Song, “Sanders Calls for Investigation of ‘Potential Corporate Fraud’ by Exxon,” InsideClimate News , October 20, 2015; Timothy Cama, “Hillary Joins Call for Federal Probe of Exxon Climate Change Research,” The Hill , October 29, 2015; Jeff Goodell, “John Kerry on Climate Change: The Fight of Our Time,” Rolling Stone , December 1, 2015. ↩ 7 \nSee Bradley Olson and Aruna Viswanatha, “ SEC Probes Exxon Over Accounting for Climate Change,” The Wall Street Journal , September 20, 2016. ↩ 8 \nSee Ken Cohen’s “So How Did ExxonMobil Do in 2014?” February 3, 2015 ( www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2015/02/03/so-how-did-exxonmobil-do-in-2014/ ) for the company’s most recent self-reported yearly global revenues.

In an effort that lasted for more than ten years, family members met repeatedly with senior ExxonMobil executives, including CEO Rex Tillerson, urging them to acknowledge what a grave threat climate change poses and to move more seriously into the field of clean energy. (See Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, “A Rockefeller Explains: Why I Lost Faith in Exxon Mobil and Donated My Shares,” Los Angeles Times , February 15, 2016.) When those discussions proved fruitless, the same family members began introducing resolutions at ExxonMobil’s annual shareholder meetings, most of which were meant to force the company to recognize the danger of remaining so committed to fossil fuels in the age of climate change. The company fought and defeated all those resolutions. (See Leslie Eaton and Russell Gold, “Rockefeller Rebellion Turns Up Heat on Exxon,” The Wall Street Journal , May 24, 2008; Suzanne Goldenberg, “Rockefeller Family Tried and Failed to Get ExxonMobil to Accept Climate Change,” The Guardian , March 27, 2015.) When Tillerson succeeded Lee Raymond as CEO of ExxonMobil at the start of 2006, Senators Jay Rockefeller and Olympia Snowe wrote him a letter accusing ExxonMobil of having contributed to the climate denial campaign by joining other corporations in sponsoring a “pseudo-scientific, non-peer reviewed echo chamber. The goal has not been to prevail in the scientific debate, but to obscure it,” employing “strategies all-too reminiscent of those used by the tobacco industry for so many years.” “We are convinced,” the senators said, “that ExxonMobil’s longstanding support of a small cadre of global climate change skeptics, and those skeptics’ access to and influence on governmental policymakers, have made it increasingly difficult for the United States to demonstrate the moral clarity it needs across all facets of its diplomacy,” and they asked Tillerson to end ExxonMobil’s support of “climate change denial front groups.” (See www.climatefiles.com/bp/2006-letter-exxonmobil-ceo-rex-tillerson-senators-snowe-rockefeller/ .) The Rockefeller Brothers Fund has been an early leader in the movement to divest from fossil fuel companies. The ExxonMobil shareholder resolutions sponsored by Rockefellers were supported by a majority of adult family members, but, counting only descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and their spouses and step-children, there are now over 270 living members of the family with different interests and different political perspectives; they rarely do anything unanimously, and it makes little sense to speak of “the Rockefellers” as some sort of monolithic entity. Although the boards of the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund are still led by members of the family, they are independent, distinct institutions. In these articles we are speaking only for the Rockefeller Family Fund. ↩ 11 \nSee, e.g., Tom Shepstone, “Is It Now Time for a Rockefeller RICO Lawsuit?” Natural Gas Now , April 16, 2016. ↩ 12 \nThe other three subpoenaed groups are the Climate Reality Project, the Climate Accountability Institute, and the Global Warming Legal Action Project. The RFF has made grants to the Union of Concerned Scientists and to 350.org for their climate work in recent years, including one $50,000 grant to 350.org in 2012 supporting its work to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for blocking efforts to mitigate climate change. ↩ 13 \nSee www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2015/10/15/ExxonMobil’s-commitment-to-climate-science/ . ↩ 14 \nSee Oreskes and Conway, Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming , pp. 170–171. ↩ 15 \nSee www.climatefiles.com/exxonmobil/1978-exxon-memo-on-greenhouse-effect-for-exxon-corporation-management-committee/ .

      "text": "BOSTON A federal judge in Texas has ordered Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to submit to questioning from Exxon lawyers, according to Bloomberg.\n>> Read more trending stories\nThe business publication reports that the massive oil company has been given “an unprecedented chance to question a state law-enforcement officer.”\nHealey is investigating whether the company hid what it knew about climate change as early as the 1970s.\nMultiple investigations accuse Exxon of hiding early findings that showed a link between global warming and the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and gas. Exxon denies that it suppressed findings from its own research, which dates back more than 30 years.\nAccording to Bloomberg, U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade, in Dallas, has ordered Healey to appear in court on Dec. 13 to face questions from Exxon.\nExxon has called the state investigations an effort to silence the company in the public debate about climate change.\nTwo environmental groups that were issued subpoenas said Texas Republicans involved in the case have been acting on behalf of Exxon and other oil companies that have contributed thousands of dollars to their campaigns.\n\"Rep. [Lamar] Smith's acceptance of large donations from big oil and gas (companies) provides explanation into his history of baseless attacks against climate science,\" the groups 350.org and Greenpeace USA said in a statement. Since 2008, Smith has received a total of $675,597 from the fossil fuel industry, $19,500 which came directly from Exxon Mobil, the groups said.\nSmith is among a large group of congressional Republicans who reject mainstream climate science. He said Healey and New York’s attorney general were pursuing \"a political agenda\" on behalf of environmental groups that are fighting Exxon over decades-old research related to climate change.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was added to the company’s lawsuit and has been advised by Kinkeaded to appear in court alongside Healey, according to Bloomberg.",

      "text": "BOSTON A federal judge in Texas has ordered Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to submit to questioning from Exxon lawyers, according to Bloomberg.\n>> Read more trending stories\nThe business publication reports that the massive oil company has been given “an unprecedented chance to question a state law-enforcement officer.”\nHealey is investigating whether the company hid what it knew about climate change as early as the 1970s.\nMultiple investigations accuse Exxon of hiding early findings that showed a link between global warming and the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and gas. Exxon denies that it suppressed findings from its own research, which dates back more than 30 years.\nAccording to Bloomberg, U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade, in Dallas, has ordered Healey to appear in court on Dec. 13 to face questions from Exxon.\nExxon has called the state investigations an effort to silence the company in the public debate about climate change.\nTwo environmental groups that were issued subpoenas said Texas Republicans involved in the case have been acting on behalf of Exxon and other oil companies that have contributed thousands of dollars to their campaigns.\n\"Rep. [Lamar] Smith's acceptance of large donations from big oil and gas (companies) provides explanation into his history of baseless attacks against climate science,\" the groups 350.org and Greenpeace USA said in a statement. Since 2008, Smith has received a total of $675,597 from the fossil fuel industry, $19,500 which came directly from Exxon Mobil, the groups said.\nSmith is among a large group of congressional Republicans who reject mainstream climate science. He said Healey and New York’s attorney general were pursuing \"a political agenda\" on behalf of environmental groups that are fighting Exxon over decades-old research related to climate change.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was added to the company’s lawsuit and has been advised by Kinkeaded to appear in court alongside Healey, according to Bloomberg.",

      "text": "Exxon Climate Judge Orders ‘Unprecedented’ Questioning (3) Erik Larson Nov 20, 2016 9:17 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- A federal judge in Texas is giving Exxon Mobil Corp. an unprecedented chance to question a state law-enforcement officer who is investigating whether the energy company hid damaging data about climate change from investors. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas on Thursday ordered Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to appear in the city on Dec. 13 to face questions from Exxon lawyers. The company claims her probe into the company’s public statements about global warming is politically motivated. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company’s lawsuit last week. He’s fighting to avoid being deposed, but was \"advised\" by the judge to appear in Dallas on the same date. Douglas Gansler, the attorney general of Maryland from 2007 to 2015, said he’s never heard of an instance where a company under investigation by a state sues and wins permission to question law-enforcement officers. \"Not only is it unusual, it’s unprecedented,\" Gansler, a Democrat who isn’t involved in the litigation, said in an interview. \"It’s completely inconsistent with the law and the functioning of our government.\" Company Information Massachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether Irving, Texas-based Exxon violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding from investors information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate and may impact its businesses. The states are also looking into whether Exxon has properly accounted for its oil-and-gas reserves following a global drop in prices. Exxon has denied the allegations, saying the valuation of its assets meets all legal standards. The company has denied wrongdoing in the case. \"We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit.\" said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon’s spokesman. \"We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.\" Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, called the ruling a “windfall to lawbreakers.” Drug Lords, Mobsters “For the first and only time, a federal judge is forcing the chief law enforcement official of a state to disclose sensitive sources and methods before even being allowed to gather evidence,” Campbell said in an e-mailed statement. “Drug lords and mobsters will use this ruling as a new shield against investigation and prosecution.” Schneiderman filed his own lawsuit against Exxon in state court in New York, saying the company has failed to comply with a demand for records about the impact of climate change on the valuation of its assets. The state’s top cop claims Exxon is likely delaying in the hope that it’ll succeed in the Texas case before the company is forced to hand over the documents. \"We will respond appropriately,\" Schneiderman spokesman Eric Soufer said without elaborating. Healey has argued that Texas doesn’t have jurisdiction in the matter and is awaiting a ruling on a request to dismiss Exxon’s suit. \"We continue to litigate against Exxon in Massachusetts state court, where this dispute properly belongs, and will fight aggressively to investigate whether Exxon Mobil deceived consumers and investors about the impact of fossil fuels,\" Healey’s spokeswoman, Chloe Gotsis, said in a statement. The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). (Updates with comment in ninth paragraph.) ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Comments A federal judge in Texas is giving Exxon Mobil Corp. an unprecedented chance to question a state law-enforcement officer who is investigating whether the energy company hid damaging data about climate change from investors. \nU.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas on Thursday ordered Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to appear in the city on Dec. 13 to face questions from Exxon lawyers. The company claims her probe into the company’s public statements about global warming is politically motivated. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company’s lawsuit last week. He’s fighting to avoid being deposed, but was “advised” by the judge to appear in Dallas on the same date. \nDouglas Gansler, the attorney general of Maryland from 2007 to 2015, said he’s never heard of an instance where a company under investigation by a state sues and wins permission to question law-enforcement officers. \n“Not only is it unusual, it’s unprecedented,” Gansler, a Democrat who isn’t involved in the litigation, said in an interview. “It’s completely inconsistent with the law and the functioning of our government.” \nCompany Information \nMassachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether Irving, Texas-based Exxon violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding from investors information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate and may impact its businesses. The states are also looking into whether Exxon has properly accounted for its oil-and-gas reserves following a global drop in prices. \nExxon has denied the allegations, saying the valuation of its assets meets all legal standards. The company has denied wrongdoing in the case. \n“We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit.” said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon’s spokesman. “We did not start this, but we will see it through and will vigorously defend ourselves against false allegations and mischaracterizations of our climate research and investor communications.” \nBrad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, called the ruling a “windfall to lawbreakers.” \nDrug Lords, Mobsters \n“For the first and only time, a federal judge is forcing the chief law enforcement official of a state to disclose sensitive sources and methods before even being allowed to gather evidence,” Campbell said in an e-mailed statement. “Drug lords and mobsters will use this ruling as a new shield against investigation and prosecution.” \nSchneiderman filed his own lawsuit against Exxon in state court in New York, saying the company has failed to comply with a demand for records about the impact of climate change on the valuation of its assets. The state’s top cop claims Exxon is likely delaying in the hope that it’ll succeed in the Texas case before the company is forced to hand over the documents. \n“We will respond appropriately,” Schneiderman spokesman Eric Soufer said without elaborating. \nHealey has argued that Texas doesn’t have jurisdiction in the matter and is awaiting a ruling on a request to dismiss Exxon’s suit. \n“We continue to litigate against Exxon in Massachusetts state court, where this dispute properly belongs, and will fight aggressively to investigate whether Exxon Mobil deceived consumers and investors about the impact of fossil fuels,” Healey’s spokeswoman, Chloe Gotsis, said in a statement. \nThe case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). Copyright 2016 Bloomberg. Get Insurance Journal Every Day Subscribe",

Roosevelt Road Search mug shots, government salaries, crime maps and more at our Right2Know page. \nA woman told police a man took $150 from her pocket Friday night at a Little Rock convenience store. \nA police report said the man got into her car at the Exxon gas station located at 612 E. Roosevelt Road around 7:30 p.m. After entering through the passenger side, he demanded money. He took the cash from her right hip pocket and three phone chargers that were in the car. The robber then left in a black sedan. \nThe 25-year-old woman told police the man went by the name “Three” and that she had his phone number. She didn’t give the number to police. \nPolice said an officer later stopped a black sedan matching the description of the robber’s getaway car, but the man inside it ran away and the officer was unable to identify him. \nThe robber was described as a black male who stands about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 150 pounds.

Heads will be exploding worse than what we have recently seen. Their whole reason to exist and their life goals would all be undone in one court judgment. Of course the true believers would continue to carry the torch but would be pushed to the side like U.S. pro-Nazis prior to 1938. No one would ever listen to them again.

      "text": "AG Healey vows to fight judge’s deposition order in Exxon case Chris Villani Monday, November 21, 2016 Credit: Christopher Evans Attorney General Maura Healey comments Attorney General Maura Healey promised to “vigorously oppose” a Texas judge’s order for her to testify in a deposition relating to her office’s probe of Exxon Mobil’s climate change policy and said she has no plans to visit the Lone Star State for the Dec. 13 hearing.\n“Our position in this ligation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices,” Healey told reporters today at the State House. “It’s been disappointing to see Exxon fight the request for basic information. Our job as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions.”\nHealey launched her probe of Exxon Mobil’s research in April, arguing the oil giant was deceiving consumers and investors. Exxon Mobil filed for an injunction — which Healey’s lawyers have moved to dismiss — to stop her on First Amendment and other grounds.\nJudge Ed Kinkeade late last week ordered Healey, along with New York AG Eric Schneiderman to answer questions in a Dallas courtroom deposition Dec. 13.\n“We are vigorously opposing any order to testify or produce discovery,” Healey said. “We believe we are on strong legal ground, not only with respect to the questions that we asked, but also to the position that this court has no jurisdiction over us.\n“In simple terms, what the court has done is inappropriate,” the AG added.\nAsked whether Healey has plans to travel to Texas for the deposition, she replied, “No, I don’t and we will take it up on appeal.”\nKinkeade has noted Exxon Mobil has charged Healey with attempting “to satisfy a political agenda” and said in his order he wants to know more about what is behind her probe before he finds for either side.\nAsked whether the investigation is politically motivated, Healey, a Democrat, said, “that couldn’t be further from the truth. This was about gather information. Our job as an attorney general’s office is to make sure we are asking questions as appropriate.”\nHealey said she did not expect Exxon, which has sued her office both in Texas and in Massachusetts and lobbied a Texas congressman on the congressional committee on science and technology to convene hearings against the AG’s probe, to be so strongly opposed to the inquiry.\n“We were surprised to see Exxon fight this so vigorously from the outset and that has taken many different forms,” Healey said, detailing the two lawsuits and congressional lobbying efforts. “To me it’s disturbing because one thing you don’t want, you don’t want to see interference with an investigation, you don’t want to see influence with an investigation. We will go wherever the facts take us but, at a minimum, we are entitled to receive information and, at a minimum, I hope that’s what the court will decide in our favor.”\nFirst Amendment Attorney Harvey Silverglate told the Herald yesterday that Healey could try to appeal being deposed, but doesn’t think she’d win. Still, he said, Kinkeade’s order is so unusual a higher court would likely hear her objections.",

      "text": "AG Healey vows to fight judge’s deposition order in Exxon case Chris Villani Monday, November 21, 2016 Credit: Christopher Evans Attorney General Maura Healey comments Attorney General Maura Healey promised to “vigorously oppose” a Texas judge’s order for her to testify in a deposition relating to her office’s probe of Exxon Mobil’s climate change policy and said she has no plans to visit the Lone Star State for the Dec. 13 hearing.\n“Our position in this ligation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices,” Healey told reporters today at the State House. “It’s been disappointing to see Exxon fight the request for basic information. Our job as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions.”\nHealey launched her probe of Exxon Mobil’s research in April, arguing the oil giant was deceiving consumers and investors. Exxon Mobil filed for an injunction — which Healey’s lawyers have moved to dismiss — to stop her on First Amendment and other grounds.\nJudge Ed Kinkeade late last week ordered Healey, along with New York AG Eric Schneiderman to answer questions in a Dallas courtroom deposition Dec. 13.\n“We are vigorously opposing any order to testify or produce discovery,” Healey said. “We believe we are on strong legal ground, not only with respect to the questions that we asked, but also to the position that this court has no jurisdiction over us.\n“In simple terms, what the court has done is inappropriate,” the AG added.\nAsked whether Healey has plans to travel to Texas for the deposition, she replied, “No, I don’t and we will take it up on appeal.”\nKinkeade has noted Exxon Mobil has charged Healey with attempting “to satisfy a political agenda” and said in his order he wants to know more about what is behind her probe before he finds for either side.\nAsked whether the investigation is politically motivated, Healey, a Democrat, said, “that couldn’t be further from the truth. This was about gather information. Our job as an attorney general’s office is to make sure we are asking questions as appropriate.”\nHealey said she did not expect Exxon, which has sued her office both in Texas and in Massachusetts and lobbied a Texas congressman on the congressional committee on science and technology to convene hearings against the AG’s probe, to be so strongly opposed to the inquiry.\n“We were surprised to see Exxon fight this so vigorously from the outset and that has taken many different forms,” Healey said, detailing the two lawsuits and congressional lobbying efforts. “To me it’s disturbing because one thing you don’t want, you don’t want to see interference with an investigation, you don’t want to see influence with an investigation. We will go wherever the facts take us but, at a minimum, we are entitled to receive information and, at a minimum, I hope that’s what the court will decide in our favor.”\nFirst Amendment Attorney Harvey Silverglate told the Herald yesterday that Healey could try to appeal being deposed, but doesn’t think she’d win. Still, he said, Kinkeade’s order is so unusual a higher court would likely hear her objections.",

Advertisement \nIn court filings, the oil company accuses Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of taking politically motivated actions intended to force the company into complying with their preferred policies on climate change. \n\"The investigations launched by Attorneys General Schneiderman and Healey amount to nothing more than an unlawful exercise of government power to further political objectives,\" Exxon's attorneys write in a Nov. 10 amended complaint. \"The shifting justifications they have presented for their investigations are pretexts that have become more and more transparent over time.\" \nExxon also argues that some of the requests in Healey's civil investigative demand \"appear to target groups simply because they hold views with which Attorney General Healey disagrees.\" \nHealey on Monday denied that her investigation into Exxon was political in nature. \n\"Our position in this litigation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices, and it's been disappointing to see Exxon fight requests for basic information,\" she said. \"Our jobs as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions and when we become aware of instances of potential fraud -- potential fraud on consumers -- it's our job to be able to ask questions, ask companies for information and have companies produce that information.\" \nAsked if she planned to go to Texas for the deposition, Healey said, \"No, I don't, and we'll take it up on appeal.\" \n\"We're vigorously opposing any order to testify or submit to discovery,\" she said. \nIn his order, Kinkeade also advised Schneiderman to be available to give a deposition on Dec. 13. \nHealey said she has not spoken to Schneiderman about the deposition order.",

      "text": "Energy   6:28pm EST UPDATE 1-Exxon says fire hits giant Baton Rouge refinery \n(Adds Exxon statement) \nHOUSTON Nov 22 A fire hit ExxonMobil Corp's refinery and chemical plant complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company said on Tuesday. \nThe incident was the third in two days to hit Gulf refineries, taking the total refining capacity impacted to over 1.1   and pushing up the cost of gasoline relative to other fuels. \nLocal media reported that around five people had been injured in the fire, which broke out at a gasoline-producing alyklation unit. \nBaton Rouge General Hospital was preparing for four people to be admitted to the regional burns unit, a hospital spokesperson said. \nThe plant is the fourth-largest refineries in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 barrels per day (bpd). \nThe refinery was hit by flooding in August, forcing Exxon to shut down one of the crude processing units at the plant and curtail output at another. The plant returned to normal output in September. \n(Reporting by Erwin Seba, Jarrett Renshaw and Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Simon Webb, Chris Reese and Bernard Orr) Next In Energy",

Exxon fire crews were able to put the fire out, a BRFD spokesperson said. Ambulances took four of the five injured people to the burn unit at Baton Rouge General. \nThe burn patients were listed in critical condition Tuesday evening. \nAs WBRZ and WBRZ.com were first to report, Isobutane was involved. Isobutane, a colorless gas, can have a faint petroleum-like smell. It is used in refrigeration systems and as a propellant in aerosol sprays. \nWatch a recap of WBRZ's breaking news coverage HERE (this link redirects to Facebook). \nThere was no off-site impact. \n\nFollow the publisher of this post on Twitter: @treyschmaltz More News ",

      "text": "U.S. | Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 7:08pm EST Exxon says small fire hit giant Baton Rouge refinery By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON \nHOUSTON Four people were injured in a small fire on Tuesday afternoon at ExxonMobil Corp's refinery and chemical plant complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the company said on Tuesday. \nThe incident was the third in two days to hit Gulf refineries, cutting fuel production in the region at plants with over 1   (bpd) of capacity. January gasoline futures jumped as much as 0.75 percent late on Tuesday. \nExxon said the fire was extinguished around 4 p.m. local time and it had accounted for all staff at the refinery. \nBaton Rouge General Hospital prepared for four people to be admitted to the regional burns unit, a hospital spokesperson said. \nThe fire broke out at an 18,750 bpd gasoline-producing alyklation unit as workers prepared to restart it following repair work, sources familiar with the plant's operations said. The refinery is the fourth-largest in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 barrels per day (bpd). \nThe Baton Rouge plant was hit by flooding in August, forcing Exxon to shut down one of the crude processing units and curtail output at another. The plant returned to normal output in September. \n  Jarrett Renshaw, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Catherine Ngai; Editing by Bernard Orr and Andrew Hay) Next In U.S.",

Obviously we didn't achieve that today, and that's what makes this a sad day,\" said Mark Northcutt, refinery plant manager. \nAn Exxon spokeswoman said there were no fatalities at the scene, and while other workers may have suffered minor injuries, only four were transported to the hospital. \nEarly reports from first responders suggested the victims may have been injured by isobutane, a flammable gas that is similar to propane, after a fire broke out at the plant around 4 p.m. \nA spokeswoman with Baton Rouge General Hospital confirmed all four patients were being treated at their facility’s burn unit and are in critical condition. The names of the injured people were not released. Third ambulance with lights, sirens just left the plant. No word on condition of patients. At least 4 believed hurt pic.twitter.com/rEZL0x44N0 — Elizabeth Vowell (@ElizabethWAFB) November 22, 2016 \nEMS and the Baton Rouge Fire Department were among emergency crews who responded. BRFD's hazmat team was on hand to monitor any dangerous chemicals that may have been released by the blaze. Crews reported no threat to the public. \nAnytime there is an incident inside the facility, hazmat teams will respond and monitor the facility to make sure the air quality stays safe for citizens living in the area. \n\"They did that in this instance and of course picked up no readings that we can tell at this time,\" said BRFD spokesman, Curt Monte. \nNorthcutt said plant officials are unsure how the fire started and will begin an investigation immediately. For now, he said their biggest focus is the injured workers. \n\"Right now what's important is, frankly, it's not the investigation, it's the individuals who were impacted and our hearts and prayers go out to them,\" said Northcutt. \nCopyright 2016 WAFB .

      "text": "Download PDF version 06:11 23 Nov 2016 Exxon has started drilling the Mesurado-1 which has the potential to discover billions of barrels of oil offshore Liberia. The well is located 50 miles from the Liberian coast \nShares in Canadian Overseas Petroleum Limited ( LON:COPL ) advanced on Wednesday as US oil supermajor ExxonMobil began drilling a high impact exploration well offshore Liberia. \nCOPL owns a 17% stake in the exploration project, though its share of drilling costs are covered by Exxon. \nThe well, known as Mesurado-1, is located some 50 miles from the Liberian coast and is in 2,500 metres of water. \nMesurado’s target has been estimated to host 1.78bn to 4.2bn of gross prospective recoverable oil resources, which would equate to between 305mln and 720mln barrels net for COPL’s interest in the project. \nThe project is on trend with exploration successes in neighbouring countries such as Sierra Leone, Senegal, Cote D’Ivoire and Ghana.
