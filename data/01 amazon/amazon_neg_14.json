One of the most notable ones thus far has been the Nextbit Robin for just $169.99 , but if you're in the market for something with a camera setup that's a bit more impressive (and certainly a lot more unique), we've got a feeling you might be interested in this deal. As part of their Countdown to Black Friday promotion, Amazon is offering $150 off of the Asus ZenFone Zoom. This brings the cost of the phone down to $249 from $399, creating for a total savings of about 38%. Just what do you get for $249 though? First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room - the camera. The ZenFone Zoom features a 13MP camera on the back that is capable of delivering 3X optical zoom. This means that you're able to zoom in with the camera sensor up to three times without losing any photo quality, and it really is quite impressive that Asus was able to pack all that power into a relatively slim and trim body. Other specs for the phone include a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS display, quad-core Intel Atom processor clocked at 2.3GHz, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. Bundle all of that with the impressive camera system that the ZenFone Zoom is packing in, and you're looking at a rather attractive package for $249 - especially if you're a photography nut.",

      "text": "November 14, 2016 3:00 AM Good news for CBS, HBO and Amazon: Several new shows renewed By CHRIS BARTON AND LIBBY HILL Los Angeles Times   \nMonday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks. \nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms \"Man With a Plan\" and \"The Great Indoors,\" which means five of the network's newcomers will endure through the fall. \n\"The Great Indoors\" stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and \"Man With a Plan\" marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from \"Friends\" to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. \"The Great Indoors\" was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers. \nThe new CBS shows \"Bull,\"\"MacGyver\" and \"Kevin Can Wait,\" which stars Kevin James in the season's top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall. \nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama \"Code Black,\" which is in its second season. \nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons. \n\"Westworld,\" a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes. \nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series \"Insecure.\" Created by and starring Issa Rae, \"Insecure\" examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman. \nAlso scoring a second season is \"Divorce,\" the series that brought \"Sex and the City\" star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart. \nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro's semi-autobiographical series \"One Mississippi,\" a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past. \nThe second season of \"One Mississippi\" will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.

      "title": "Amazon Sues Merchants Over Selling Counterfeit Items",
      "text": "For the first time in Amazon’s 20-plus year history, Amazon is suing merchants that are selling counterfeit items on its marketplace.\nThe Seattle-based company filed two lawsuits in the state of Washington Monday. One filing is against ToysNet, a company that reportedly develops a counterfeit item that is a reproduction of the Forearm Forklift, a fabric strap that allows wearers to more easily move heavy furniture and other items. Amazon says its fraud detection system flagged the ToysNet for selling fake items, but the the seller produced invoices to prove the items were not counterfeit. Amazon counters that these invoices were forged.\nIn another lawsuit against Joana Ferreira, Amazon partnered with Fitness Anywhere, the developers of TRX, a popular exercise fabric strap sold on Amazon. In the suit, Amazon writes that the seller Ferreira started selling copies of the TRX on Amazon.com, falsely claiming they were genuine TRX equipment.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nIn recent months, Amazon’s marketplace, which sells everything from toilet paper to Mickey Mouse t-shirts to exercise equipment, has come under fire for selling counterfeit items. CNBC reported earlier this year that counterfeit items sold by third party sellers—many of whom are China-based—are becoming increasingly problematic for the e-commerce giant. According to the report, Amazon has been “courting” more Chinese manufacturers lately, opening the marketplace up to more counterfeit items. Because of this, some sellers are losing trust in the marketplace and are even complaining of a loss in sales. Apple recently said that many of the so-called Apple-branded chargers for smartphones and laptops sold on Amazon are fake, for instance. Amazon is an authorized reseller of Apple products.\nIn August, Amazon started imposing steeper fees and requiring additional paperwork from suspicious sellers in response. The fees, which ranged from $1,000 to $1,500, were assessed to sellers who were dealing counterfeit items. The company, which says it invests tens of millions of dollars annually to combat sales of bogus items, also employs a team of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to operate its anti-counterfeiting program.\nAmazon isn’t the only e-commerce site battling forgeries. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also struggled with fake items. Specifically, Alibaba’s flagship e-commerce marketplace Taobao, has been known for selling counterfeit goods. Alibaba has openly committed $160 million in anti-counterfeiting efforts.\nAmazon Sues More Than 1,000 ‘John Does’ for Writing Fake Reviews\nThe timing of these suits also ties in with the holiday season, which is usually the highest revenue generating period for Amazon. The company likely wants to make sure its customers know anything they buy from the e-commerce company is genuine and not counterfeit. It also wants to assure sellers that they are not at risk of losing sales to competitors that are selling fakes. According to a CNBC report, Forearm Forklift saw annual revenue plunge 30% since 2008 due to a loss in sales because of the fakes sold on Amazon.\nAmazon declined to comment on the filings for Fortune.",

      "text": "U.S. Internet companies including Facebook fb and Amazon amzn have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform, and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms.\nThe letter sent on Friday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet’s Google googl , Uber, and Twitter twtr , represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign.\n“The Internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialog,” reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters.\nSome of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market.\nOther goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s daily technology newsletter.\nThey include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally.\nThe association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was “softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.”\nWhile urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted.\nTrump’s often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda.\nTrump has also urged a boycott of Apple aapl products over the company’s refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, Calif. shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States.",

Show Caption Previous Next \nMAINEVILLE, Ohio -- Maineville Police Chief John Reynolds was fired for using the village's Amazon account to make personal purchases, the village solicitor said. \nKevin McDonough, an attorney with Wood & Lamping LLP, said Reynolds had Amazon deliver the items to his home. \nReynolds used his own credit card but was able to avoid paying taxes on the items because of an exemption for municipalities, McDonough said. The total savings was about $13. \n\"This was nothing more than an inadvertent mistake made by Mr. Reynolds because the village Amazon account and his personal Amazon account were linked,\" a statement from his attorney, Cori Besse, said. \"He used his own credit card to make purchases of personal items, and did not realize that the 'tax exempt' box from the village Amazon account had been checked when making them.\" \nAccording to a letter from Mayor William Shearer to the village council, an employee noticed a purchase in April, but Reynolds assured her it was a mistake. She noticed more purchases over the summer, Shearer's letter said. \nBesse said Reynolds plans to appeal his termination in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas, saying it's wrong on both the law and the facts. \nVShearer declined to comment. \nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Reynolds had been village police chief since January 2006; before that, he worked for the Hamilton Township Police Department and the Warren County Sheriff's Office.

      "title": "Amazon Is Cutting Wrapping Paper This Holiday Season",
      "text": "When Amazon amzn ships millions of gifts to customer doorsteps this holiday season, one thing will be noticeably missing from the majority of the brown cardboard boxes emblazoned with its logo: wrapping paper.\nFor the first time, the e-commerce juggernaut—which saw last year’s holiday-quarter sales increase 22%, to $35.7 billion—is ditching its customary blue-and-gold wrapping paper in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Instead, Amazon will offer velvet gift bags in five sizes and three colors (red, silver, and blue) to fit presents of different shapes and sizes, ranging from a palm-size BB-8 droid replica from Star Wars to a DJI Phantom Drone. Pricing for the velvet bags will range from $3.49 to $5.99—the same as what gift wrap cost previously.\nAmazon’s velvet gift bags come in five sizes and three colors to fit presents of different shapes and sizes, offering a more environmentally-conscious option to traditional gift wrap. Photo: Courtesy of Amazon “Our guiding North Star is the minimization of packaging,” says Kara Hurst, Amazon’s director of worldwide sustainability and social responsibility. “Wrapping paper has no value.”\nHurst joined Amazon two years ago in her current role, which was new for the 22-year-old company. Her mission: to help Amazon become more environmentally conscious as it looks to scale a multibillion-dollar e-commerce business as Walmart wmt and Target tgt try to threaten its lead. A big part of her job, Hurst explains, is determining how to streamline the packaging of millions of goods shipped each year.\nIn a small laboratory in Seattle, Hurst has a team tasked solely with brainstorming strategies to improve Amazon’s packaging. She is more acutely focused on Amazon’s 123 fulfillment centers worldwide—massive warehouses in which a mix of robots, industrial machines, and humans package and sort orders.\nThis holiday season robots will be working full-time as Amazon doubles down on deploying “frustration-free packaging,” explains Hurst. This type of packaging debuted in 2008, using recyclable cardboard while excluding excess materials, such as extra internal boxes and the plastic casings found around batteries. All box forms can be opened by hand without a box cutter. This year, Amazon says, more than 1 million items will be shipped with frustration-free packaging, instead of hundreds of thousands in years past.\nAn example of Amazon’s Frustration-Free Packaging. “The Love 2 Learn Elmo” doll, on left, uses recyclable cardboard—avoiding excess materials—and can be opened by hand without tools. The standard packaging, on right, uses more material and can be more difficult to open. Photo: Courtesy of Amazon But Amazon isn’t turning to environmentally friendlier practices purely out of altruism. “They can save money by reducing packaging costs and increase room on trucks for more sales by making ­packages smaller,” says Colin Sebastian, a senior equity research analyst with Robert W. Baird.\nWhile Hurst declined to place a number on the benefits of eliminating wrapping paper and superfluous boxes, she confirms that there is a “definite cost savings for the company.”\nSebastian concurs: “This is classic Amazon.”\nA version of this article appears in the December 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Out of the Box.”",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters WASHINGTON : U.S. internet companies including Facebook Inc and Amazon Inc have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms. The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet's Google, Uber [UBER.UL] and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. “The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,” reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign. They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was \"softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.\" While urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted. Trump's often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda. Trump has also urged a boycott of Apple Inc products over the company's refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year's San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States. In a statement, Beckerman said the internet industry looked forward to working closely with Trump and lawmakers in Congress to \"cement the internet’s role as a driver of economic and social progress for future generations.\" -Reuters",

      "text": "by IWB · November 14, 2016 \nThe stock market’s post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. \nApple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump’s policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2 percent to an all-time high. \nNo single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. \n“Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” \nSource:",

      "title": "Amazon Readies Second Season of 'One Mississippi' Starring Tig Notaro",
      "text": "\"Making a show as comic and tragic as One Mississippi is a risk. Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare,\" said Joe Lewis , Head of Comedy and Drama, Amazon Studios. \"We're grateful for the audience response and we’re excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate's brilliance in season two.\" \nStarring Emmy Award nominated comedian Tig Notaro ('Transparent'), created by Notaro and Diablo Cody ('Young Adult'), with Kate Robin ('Six Feet Under') serving as Showrunner, 'One Mississippi' follows Tig's return to her hometown in Mississippi when her mother passes away unexpectedly. As she copes with the tragedy and deals with events from her past, the series becomes a poignant and surprisingly humorous exploration of family. The show also stars Noah Harpster ('Transparent'), John Rothman ('Law & Order'), and Stephanie Allynne ('Comedy Bang! Bang!'). Notaro, Cody, Robin, M. Blair Breard ('Better Things'), Dave Becky ('Master of None'), and Louis C.K. ('Louie') will be Executive Producers for season two. \nIn addition to the forthcoming second season, the entire first season of 'One Mississippi' is now available to stream on P rime Video. Other upcoming Amazon premieres include ' Mozart in the Jungle ' season three on December 9 and ' The Man in the High Castle ' season two on December 16. A current Amazon Prime subscription costs $99 per year or $11 per month. Likewise, Prime Instant Video is available as a standalone service for $9 per month.",

      "text": "COMMENT NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 25: Actress Tika Sumpter appears on Amazon's Style Code Live on August 25, 2016 in New York City. Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Amazon \nCan overdue library books land you in jail? They can in Johnston County, N.C., according to one actress who says her mother was arrested Monday for a library fine. \nActress Tika Sumpter, 36, who portrayed First Lady Michelle Obama in the movie “Southside With You,” took to Twitter on Monday afternoon to blast the Public Library of Johnston County and Smithfield in Smithfield, N.C., after she said her mother was arrested for having a $10 library fine. \nMake sure you turn in your library books North Carolina! My mom was just arrested for having a late fee of 10 dollars on an overdue book! \n— Tika Sumpter (@iamtikasumpter) November 14, 2016 \n“Make sure you turn in your library books North Carolina!” the actress tweeted. “My mom was just arrested for having a late fee of 10 dollars on an overdue book!” \nAn overdue book should NEVER result in a warrant. This is a legal scam. @northcarolina @SmithfieldLibra @PatMcCroryNC @RoyCooperNC \n— Tika Sumpter (@iamtikasumpter) November 14, 2016 \n“An overdue book should NEVER result in a warrant,” Sumpter added in a follow up tweet. “This is a legal scam.” \nThe Johnston County library website says that it charges a fine of 25 cents per item per day for printed books and 50 cents per item per day for audio books, music CDs, and movies. There is no indication on the public portion of the site that library fines can result in arrests. \nSumpter brought up a salient point about how laws like this get on the books in the first place. \n\n— Tika Sumpter (@iamtikasumpter) November 14, 2016 \n“Presidential elections matter, but your local elections matter just as much,” she tweeted. \nThankfully, Sumpter’s mother did not have to spend that long in custody. The actress tweeted a few hours later that her mother was free and said that every cop at the jail was in disbelief. \nYes sir. She’s out now. Every cop at the jail thought it was absolutely ridiculous. They couldn’t even believe it. Smh #ncgov https://t.co/MDIx06Euxp \n— Tika Sumpter (@iamtikasumpter) November 15, 2016 \n“Yes sir. She’s out now,” Sumpter tweeted. “Every cop at the jail thought it was absolutely ridiculous. They couldn’t even believe it.” Share this:",

      "title": "Trump Tech Meltdown Hits Fourth Day as Amazon Cut by $35 Billion",
      "text": "Trump Tech Meltdown Hits Fourth Day as Amazon Cut by $35 Billion Monday, 14 Nov 2016 06:57 PM Close A A \nThe stock market’s post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. \nApple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump’s policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2 percent to an all-time high. \nNo single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. \n“Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” \nThe S&P 500 slipped less than one point for a second day of losses, with tech giants bearing the worst of the rout. The FANG block of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 2.4 percent. The group has dropped every day since Trump’s victory, sinking 8 percent for the worst retreat since February amid concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. \nThe industry, which largely supported Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders including Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos clashed with Trump during the election. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than $30 billion in value since Tuesday’s vote. \n“It’s a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,” said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. “If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they’re stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,” he said. “He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You’d have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.” \nAny slowdown in tech earnings may deal a blow to a market that just emerged from a five-quarter profit slump, the longest since the global financial crisis. While S&P 500 income rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, profit at tech firms expanded almost 8 percent, actual results and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. \nThe decline in tech shares came after they extended their leadership at the fastest rate in four years, raising their representation in the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point to a 15-year high of 21.4 percent in the third quarter. From Apple to Facebook, mega techs now occupy half of the top 10 spots in ranks of the most valuable American companies, matching the number at the peak of internet mania. \nFor now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2 percent of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies, shares expected to benefit from Trump’s plans to boost fiscal spending and ease regulations. Banks climbed 2.3 percent Monday, extending their gains since Trump’s victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2 percent in that time. \n“The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,” said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. “Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.” \n\n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

      "text": "After launching a $2.5 million initiative for university teams to further develop AI-driven conversational bots last month, Amazon just selected the teams it plans to sponsor for the challenge.\nAmazon received applications from more than 100 teams at universities across 22 countries. \nAs a result, Amazon selected 12 teams instead of 10 to receive a $100,000 stipend to develop their AI bots. Most of the teams selected are in the U.S. with others from Canada, the U.K., Italy, and Czech Republic. \nThe Alexa Prize, which launched last month , is a competition for university teams to develop ‘socialbots’ on Amazon’s Alexa AI platform that can hold a natural conversation with humans. Amazon initially planned to sponsor 10 teams to explore and further develop different areas of conversational artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing and common sense reasoning. \nThroughout the course of the next year, the 12 teams will develop their bots and the winning team will win $500,000. Additionally, if the winning team’s bot can ‘converse coherently and engagingly with humans on popular topics for 20 minutes,’ Amazon plans to award a $1 million research grant to that team’s university. \n“For the Socialbot Challenge, the goal is to build an Alexa skill that will converse with people about trending societal topics and events in a turn-by-turn format,” an Amazon spokesperson told the IoT Daily. \n“In order for machines to be truly intelligent, they must be able to participate in conversation, demonstrating an understanding of the world and cultural moments.” \nAmazon appears to not have a focus on any potential marketing and advertising implications of conversational AI bots. \n“The use cases for socialbots are not for marketing or advertising; instead, the goal is to make Alexa even more engaging and enable students to advance their research in this area,” Amazon told the Daily. \nHowever, some brands have already been using such bots for marketing and advertising purposes. \nFor example, agency executives discussed using chatbots to engage with consumers on behalf of brands at the MediaPost OMMA Bots and Chat conference during Advertising Week. \nIn that panel discussion, Natalie Monbiot, senior vice president and managing partner of strategic innovation at UM, said her team created a chatbot last year for a client as part of a broader campaign. \nThe chatbot was designed to engage with consumers as one of the characters of a new movie and received high engagement rates. On average, consumers engaged with the chatbot for 10 minutes, but some conversations were as long as two and a half hours, according to Monbiot. \nHere are the university teams selected for the Alexa Prize challenge: \nCarnegie-Mellon University (two teams) \nPrinceton University \nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute \nUniversity of California, Berkeley \nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz \nUniversity of Washington \nUniversity of Montreal \nUniversity of Edinburgh \nHeriot-Watt University \nUniversity of Trento \nCzech Technical University, Prague",

      "text": "Share This Amazon Fulfillment opens in Mericle spec building in Center Point West.cv15amazonWarren Ruda / The Citizens’ Voice WARREN RUDA / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER The Amazon fulfillment center in Pittston Twp. is recruiting to fill 350 positions at its warehouse. Lightbox link Lightbox link \nPITTSTON TWP. — E-commerce giant Amazon has quietly opened in CenterPoint Commerce and Trade Park West in Pittston Twp. and is hiring hundreds of workers. \nThe company, the largest internet-based retailer in the world, is recruiting for 350 warehouse positions paying $13 an hour, said Christine Jensen, administrator of Pennsylvania CareerLink Luzerne County. \nThe annual salary for a warehouse position at Amazon is $27,040, according to www.jobgateway.pa.gov. \nAmazon has moved into a 399,500-square-foot building constructed by Mericle Commercial Real Estate Services at 250 Enterprise Way, the fifth-largest building in the park. \nA sign leading to the building on a 51-acre site reads, “Welcome Amazonians.” \nA spokesman inside the building and Mericle spokesman Jim Cummings both referred questions to Amazon’s corporate headquarters. \nA call and email to Amazon were not returned, but recent news reports from around the state have stated Amazon plans to add thousands of more jobs in Pennsylvania. Gov. Tom Wolf announced earlier this year that Amazon.com will add at least 5,000 new full-time jobs in Pennsylvania over the next three years. \nPennsylvania is one of the top employment centers for Amazon’s giant retail warehouses. \nThe online retail and internet services giant runs 13 fulfillment warehouses and distribution centers in the state, according to published reports. \nAmazon also has a 650,000-square-foot fulfillment center in the Humbolt Industrial Park in Hazle Twp. and employs 2,200 workers. \nThe Hazle Twp. facility is the largest employer in the area’s industrial parks and one of the area’s largest commercial or industrial buildings. \nQuidsi, which is owned by Amazon.com, also has a distribution center in Covington Industrial Park in Lackawanna County. \nThe shift to online and mobile shopping continues to grow and has led to a number of fulfillment and distribution centers opening in CenterPoint Commerce and Trade Park in Pittston and Jenkins townships in recent years. \nThere are now 29 buildings in the park, totaling seven million square feet, consisting of firms such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Neiman Marcus and J.P. Boden. \nContact the writer: dallabaugh@citizensvoice.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

      "text": "Amazon now pays out instantly for video game trade-ins Posted WhatsApp   \nAmazon is gearing up for the Christmas season by allowing customers to get instant vouchers for trading their unwanted possessions. \nThe U.S. retail giant has long-offered a trade-in option in exchange for gift card credit, but now — with Christmas just 40 days away — its new ‘Instant Payment’ service lets you get your money right away… before you’ve even sent the item over. That down for its previous policy of 10 days. \nThere’s a small catch, the instant payment service is initially live for video games and related accessories only. But it is very easy to use . \nSimply submit details of the item/items that you wish to return, after which gift card credit is immediately dispatched. You then have seven days to mail the item to Amazon, via a UPS location, using a printable, prepaid shipping label that is provided on the Amazon website. \nAmazon stressed that trade-in values vary based on the condition of the item in question, but some rough prices for popular gaming products are as follows: Nintendo Wii U Console: up to $150 Sony PlayStation 4 500GB Console: up to $170 Microsoft Xbox One 500GB: up to $115 FIFA 17: up to $25 Paper Mario Color Splash: up to $30 Gears of War 4: up to $26 \nThe initiative will welcomed by many customers as the costly present-buying season approaches, but don’t bank on being able to spend your trade-in cash on the hottest thing in gaming now: an NES Classic. The much-sought-after Nintendo console is, well, much sought after… with its first batch selling out on Amazon last week in a matter of seconds . Luckily Amazon has plenty of other items on display. \nMore details on Amazon Instant Payment are here .",

      "text": "November 14, 2016, 5:18 PM Amazon sues marketplace sellers for alleged counterfeit goods By Bloomberg News A toy seller is among the vendors Amazon filed lawsuits against in its push to keep counterfeit products of its site. \n(Bloomberg)—Amazon.com Inc. filed two lawsuits against vendors allegedly selling counterfeit goods through its online marketplace, stepping up efforts to keep fakes off the site heading into the holiday shopping season. \nOne suit targets ToysNet of Hacienda Heights, Calif.; Disk Vision of Brandon, Fla.; and individuals who Amazon says sold counterfeit Forearm Forklifts, straps used to carry heavy and bulky items. Amazon, No. 1 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , said it removed the fake items in June, and said Disk Vision forged an invoice to trick Amazon into reinstating the product listing. Another lawsuit targets several individuals who allegedly sold bogus TRX Suspension Trainers, an exercise system. The lawsuits were filed Monday in state court in Seattle. Amazon provided copies of the complaints, which couldn’t immediately be verified in court records. \nLast month, Apple Inc. (No. 2) sued an Amazon seller , claiming the business sold fake Apple products— some of them unsafe—on Amazon.com. As its marketplace grows, Amazon has been taking action to bolster its reliability and boost credibility with customers. Last year, it filed a suit against more than 1,000 people it said wrote fake product reviews on its website, threatening shopper confidence in its consumer reviews. The company last month clamped down on so-called incentivized reviews , in which customers write about products they receive free or at discounted prices. \n“Amazon’s customers trust that when they make a purchase through Amazon’s website—either directly from Amazon or from one of its millions of third-party sellers—they will receive authentic products manufactured by the true manufacturer of those products,” according to Monday’s complaints. \"When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon’s brand and causing irreparable reputational harm.\" Topics",

      "text": "Gift giving season may be nearly upon us, but Amazon's Christmas elves were just caught up in a decidedly un-festive event, as one of the retail giant's biggest UK warehouses caught fire last night. Over 1,000 workers were evacuated from the distribution warehouse in Staffordshire just after 2am this morning (November 13), according to BBC News. Local reports add that a total of six fire crews, which is over 30 firefighters, were called to the scene to fight the fire. It was successfully dealt with, and the crews left at around 6am. According to Staffordshire Police, around 1,100 workers were evacuated when the fire broke out. There are no reported injuries among any of Amazon's staff nor the firefighters, and the cause of the fire remains under investigation. Speaking to The Birmingham Mail, Amazon confirmed that a fire had broken out in a brief statement. \"There was a small fire in the Rugeley fulfilment centre in the early hours of this morning, which was quickly extinguished,\" the statement read. Amazon has also reassured customers that the fire will not result in a delay in Christmas deliveries. In the run up to Christmas, plans are in place to hire 4,500 seasonal employees at the warehouse to help cope with the demand placed on the website by eager gift-givers and Amazon's mammoth 12 days of Black Friday sales. The sale is set to begin tomorrow (November 14), and finish on the official Black Friday date of November 25. ",

      "text": "With Amazon dropping its Echo connected speaker recently, ordering pizza and checking the football scores has never been easier. And while you can also enlist the help of the Alexa voice assistant to tap into your music, Amazon's music offering just isn't as strong as Spotify or Apple Music. That is, of course, until now. The retail giant has today launched Amazon Music Unlimited in the UK, a platform which boasts a library of over 40 million songs and will attempt to dent the influence of its rivals. Related: 9 Amazon Echo Skills you need to try If you happen to be a Prime member, you can stream until your ears are content for the exchange of £7.99 a month - or a lump drop of £79 for the year. Not being part of Amazon's special little club will see you pay £9.99, meanwhile. And while this price point puts it around par with Apple and Spotify, an incentive with Echo is the real selling point here. Echo owners will be offered a £3.99 p/m subscription on one device, meaning you can slightly offset the device's £149.99 asking price. So, why switch from the included Prime Music or a rival? Well, Music Unlimited will allow you to access some personalised playlists and personalised radio stations, and jump your song access by around 38 million. By pairing with Echo, you can also lazily inquire as to what that band's new song is instead of having to painfully search the internet. With Apple taking its precious time before potentially entering the smart hub game, it could be time to give ol' Amazon a chance.",

      "title": "Amazon sues alleged counterfeit sellers",
      "text": "Amazon has been more aggressive in court lately in trying to clean up fake reviews, too.\nPhoto by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images Amazon filed two lawsuits against sellers of allegedly counterfeit products, part of a broader crackdown on fakes sold through the internet retailer.\nThe lawsuits, filed in a Washington state court on Monday, allege more than 20 companies and individuals were involved in selling knockoff exercise and furniture moving equipment.\nThe suits follow a handful of lawsuits that crack down on fake customer reviews , but appear to be Amazon's first against merchants accused of selling fake goods.\nAmazon, which declined to comment for this story, has escaped the criticism leveled at other online retailers, most notably Chinese rival Alibaba, for selling counterfeits through their websites. Amazon has mostly avoided such criticism, in part because of its years of investments in anti-counterfeiting technology and staff.\nAs the Seattle retailer continues to grow at a rapid pace, however, suppressing counterfeit listings may be getting more difficult. The company now lists hundreds of millions of items online.\nIn one notable counterfeit flashpoint, shoemaker Birkenstock pulled its products from Amazon earlier this year amid what it said was a rash of counterfeits. Last month, Apple sued a supplier of allegedly fake charging cables and power adapters that were sold on Amazon.\nAmazon has already made it harder for third-party sellers to list items from big-name brands like Nike and Hasbro without additional fees and proof that the products came from the manufacturer or a distributor.\n\"It's somewhat overdue,\" Emily Wilcox, co-owner of baby clothing company Fayebeline , said Monday after hearing about the suits. \"If Amazon is going to continue to be a nice platform for sellers and a place for people to build brands, we need that type of support.\"\nWilcox said her company, which generates nearly all its revenue on Amazon, has had to hire a contract worker to search Amazon on a weekly basis to find and try to remove counterfeits of Fayebeline designs. While she said fakes on Amazon have been manageable for her business, she's heard from other Amazon sellers who have been \"completely crippled\" by counterfeiters.\nAmazon says just \"a small number of bad actors\" are involved in trying to sell fakes on the site.\nIn one of the new counterfeit suits, Amazon alleged ToysNet of California, Disk Vision of Florida and 10 unknown individuals supplied and sold on Amazon bogus Forearm Forklift furniture moving straps, which are trademarked and patented by Above All Co.\nIn another suit, Amazon alleged Cheng Hak Yung, also known as Joana Wong Ferreira, and Man Hong \"Sandra\" Chau, both of New York, as well as 10 unknown defendants, made and sold fake TRX workout gear.\nCNET wasn't able to reach the defendants, except for a a woman named Man Hong \"Sandra\" Chau, a dentist from Flushing, NY. She said she hadn't heard of the lawsuits when reached by phone Monday.\n\"I've never sold anything on Amazon,\" she said. \"I buy things on Amazon.\"\nSince September, Amazon has blocked the alleged counterfeit sellers from its site and removed all their listings from Amazon.com.\nAmazon alleged breach of contract and false advertising in the suits, and asked the court to allow it to permanently ban the defendants and their employees from selling on Amazon's websites.\nAmazon is looking for these broad bans because counterfeiters tend to take great lengths to hide their identities, often changing to new seller accounts and payment methods, as well as using several fake names and addresses, to get back on Amazon even after first being caught.\nAmazon also said these sellers tend to keep offshore bank accounts, so they can move their funds from illegal sales outside of US jurisdiction.",

      "text": "Amazon Photo Amazon will offer speedy delivery of items from Bartell Drugs in the Seattle area in a new expansion of its Prime Now program .\nBartell Drugs delivery, launching Tuesday, creates a new connection between the 126-year-old Seattle-based drugstore chain and the Seattle-based online retail giant. Bartell Drugs will be the first drugstore chain to offer delivery through Prime Now, which offers free two-hour delivery and $7.99 one-hour delivery to Amazon Prime members.\nAmazon says the Prime Now app will offer access to 90 percent of Bartell’s inventory.\nBartell Drugs delivery will be available initially from Prime Now in Capitol Hill, Columbia City, Mercer Island, Renton, Sammamish, and the University of Washington. The company says more areas will be added soon. Bartell Drugs delivery will run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekends.\nAmazon’s partnerships with traditional retailers are the latest example of the company blurring the line between online retail and bricks-and-mortar shopping. Amazon also works with grocery stores, restaurants and other retailers for Prime Now delivery, in addition to delivering items from its own warehouses.\nPrime Now is now available in more than two dozen U.S. cities.",

      "text": "Amazon ordered to refund parents for their kids' in-app purchases 14 hours ago A federal judge told Amazon to make things right Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media \nHey, parents! Remember that time you had to sell the house because your kid spent all your money buying pretend farm animals or bubbles or whatever on their Kindle Fire? Well, we have good news for you: A federal judge has ordered Amazon to pay you back for those in-app purchases. \nMore: 5 sticky financial situations and how to get out of them \nAccording to the FTC, some of the kid-friendly games available on Amazon's app store were marked as \"free,\" but since they had to be connected to an Amazon account in order to be downloaded, that meant they were also connected to the credit card associated with that Amazon account. Yup, once your kid downloaded a \"free\" game, they also had access to your credit card. \"Amazon chose to set up the payment process [so that] kids could incur charges without their parents' knowledge,\" wrote the FTC on their website. The total cost of all those charges? Over $86 million. \nRuh-roh. \nMore: 16 Amazon reviews that are pure comic genius \nTo their credit, once Amazon learned internally that this was happening, they also freaked the eff out. One employee said in an email that this was \"clearly causing issues for a large percentage of [Amazon's] customers.\" So they went about trying to fix it, and by 2013, set up the system so that a password was required for any in-app purchases. This was almost a great idea, except for two fatal flaws. First, the password was only required for purchases over $20, and second, after a purchase, there was a 15-minute \"put it on my tab\" window during which purchases could be made without a password. \nOh, Amazon. Your heart was in the right place, but apparently, you have never met children before. Do you have any idea how much money a kid can rack up in 15 minutes of 99-cent purchases? We bet there's a family living under a bridge somewhere that can tell you. \nAmazon will start setting up a method for identifying and notifying parents who are eligible for a refund in early 2017. And in case you were wondering, that refund won't be coming in the form of a gift card — Amazon asked, and the judge said no.",

      "title": "Trump tech meltdown hits fourth day with Amazon cut by US$35 bil",
      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg   4:13   \nNEW YORK (Nov 15): The stock market’s post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. \nApple Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7% for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump’s policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1% over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2% to an all-time high. \nNo single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. \n“Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,” Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about US$1.8 billion. “Without their participating, that’s definitely going to create a headwind for the market.” \nThe S&P 500 slipped less than one point for a second day of losses, with tech giants bearing the worst of the rout. The FANG block of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 2.4%. The group has dropped every day since Trump’s victory, sinking 8% for the worst retreat since February amid concern about the impact of Trump’s policies on trade overseas, where US technology companies thrive. \nThe industry, which largely supported Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders including Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos clashed with Trump during the election. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than US$30 billion in value since Tuesday’s vote. \n“It’s a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,” said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. “If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they’re stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,” he said. “He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You’d have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.” \nAny slowdown in tech earnings may deal a blow to a market that just emerged from a five-quarter profit slump, the longest since the global financial crisis. While S&P 500 income rose 2.7% in the third quarter, profit at tech firms expanded almost 8%, actual results and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. \nThe decline in tech shares came after they extended their leadership at the fastest rate in four years, raising their representation in the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point to a 15-year high of 21.4% in the third quarter. From Apple to Facebook, mega techs now occupy half of the top 10 spots in ranks of the most valuable American companies, matching the number at the peak of internet mania. \nFor now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2% of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies, shares expected to benefit from Trump’s plans to boost fiscal spending and ease regulations. Banks climbed 2.3% on Monday, extending their gains since Trump’s victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2% in that time. \n“The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,” said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. “Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.” Related Articles",

      "text": "by David November 15, 2016, 2:56 am \nGoogle Home, Google’s long-awaited answer to Amazon’s popular voice assistant, Amazon Echo, has been released in the United States on November 4, 2016 for US$129, and we are excited to put the two against each other to see which one is more useful. What Is Amazon Echo? \nAmazon Echo has been available since 2014, so it’s only polite to start with it. “Amazon Echo is a hands-free speaker you control with your voice. Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more—instantly. All you have to do is ask,” describes Amazon their voice-controlled speaker on its official website. \nWhen the company first released Echo, nobody imagined that it would sell over 3 million units in less than 2 years. The product enabled people to play music, control other gadgets, ask questions, and more in a new, intuitive way that appeals to tech enthusiasts and casual users alike. Take a look at Echo’s product reviews and you’ll see how it helps elderly and people with disabilities manage daily tasks and have fun. \nThis is possible thanks to Alexa, an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon.com’s Lab126. Alexa can do all sorts of useful things, including voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real-time information. She can also control smart devices, acting as a home automation hub. \nTo active Echo’s voice recognition, all you have to do is say “Alexa,” and the device responds instantly with a sound prompt and an attractive, blue LED ring situated at the top of the unit. Under the ring is an array of seven microphones with beam-forming technology and enhanced noise cancellation for 360° voice recognition. You can stand across the room and even have music playing and Echo will still understand you without any problems. \nAmazon Echo remembers your previous commands and questions, adapting to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences. This means that the more you use it, the smarter and more accurate it will become. But if you don’t want to wait for Echo to learn new tricks all by itself, you can enhance its capabilities with Skills . There are currently thousands of different skills, such as ordering a pizza from Domino’s, requesting a ride from Uber, opening your garage with Garageio, and more. \nAmazon has also developed a complementary app for Android, iOS, and desktop browsers, which acts as a companion to your Alexa device for setup, remote control, and enhanced features. The app mirrors your interactions with Alexa, giving you more information and control. What Is Google Home? \nGoogle describes Google Home as “a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant.” The executive behind the project, Mario Queiroz, was the man who has launched Chromecast, the only truly successful living room product Google has ever launched. As such, Google Home is sort of an extension of Chromecast, designed to directly compete with Amazon Echo. \nIn terms of build and design, Home is a small, sleek speaker with far-field microphones and surround sound speakers. To trigger the voice recognition feature, simply say “Ok Google” followed by a number of different questions and commands. You can trigger Home to play music, podcasts, or radio from services like Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, and TuneIn, get real-time answers including the latest on weather, traffic, finance, sports, local businesses, and more. \nGoogle’s extensive experience with search and information retrieval helps Google Home give accurate contextual answers that never fail to surprise with their accuracy. You can customize your Google Home voice-activated speaker using seven colorful bases and make it fit your home decor. \nAs of now, Google Home doesn’t support simultaneous connection to multiple Google accounts, nor does Google provide public APIs for third-party developers, like Amazon does with Echo. The company says that both features will come in time, but we have to wait to see just how long it will take. Comparison of Amazon Echo and Google Home \nPerhaps because Google Home is a younger product, its functionality is still somewhat limited, compared to Amazon Echo. For example, Google Home can’t set reminders, give you directions how to get somewhere, or add events to your Google Calendar. Amazon Echo has no problem with any of the tasks, and it even supports Google Calendar, Google’s own calendar. \nFor regular Amazon shoppers, Echo does a fantastic job of ensuring that your shopping card is never empty for too long. You can search for items and add them with just your voice. In case there are several options to choose from, Amazon will prompt you the next time you log into your shopping card on their site. \nGoogle Home has an edge over Echo when it comes to answering questions. At times, Echo gives rather obscure answers, whereas Google Home is almost always eerily accurate, as if Google had a large database filled with your browsing history, previous search queries, purchases, and other personal information (which they, of course, do have). \nSimilar to Google Now’s cards, Google Home has the My Day feature, which provides weather and traffic information, an overview of your calendar events, and a brief summary of current news by saying “good morning.” It’s a fun, informative way how to start a day, and it makes you feel like your Google Home assistant was made just for you. \nBoth devices are equally good at picking up your voice commands from across the room even with music playing in the background. Google Home has only two microphones, while Alexa has seven, but it doesn’t seem to matter in practice. However, the same doesn’t apply for listening to music. There, Amazon Echo is clearly superior, delivering much fuller sound even at higher volume levels. Google Home holds up reasonably well until you increase the volume too much, which causes the small speakers inside to crackle. \nAmazon Echo easily wins when it comes to the sheer number of supported third-party gadgets and services. Google has yet to release developer APIs for its assistant, making its usage as an IoT hub somewhat limited. The only exception is its superb support for Chromecast. You can tell it which show or movie you would like to watch and control the playback with your voice. Verdict \nThe race is on, and only time will tell which company will be able to entice more customers with its intelligent voice assistant. Right now, Amazon benefits from its maturity and much better third-party support. Google, on the other hand, is doing whatever they can to leverage the power of their search engine to its maximum potential, giving people highly accurate answers to their questions. \nAt the end of the day, what matters the most is which ecosystem you use more. We believe that regular Amazon customers and Prime subscribers should go with Amazon Echo, despite its higher price tag. Devoted Google users can grab Google Home now or wait a year or two until Google extends their third-party support.",

      "text": "Amazon’s Echo Could be a Stepping Stone for the Smart Home November 14, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham \nWhen Amazon announced and debuted the Echo back in 2014, many people weren’t quite sure what it was meant to do. At the time, it appeared to be a Bluetooth speaker that had some Google Now-like capabilities. But in the (almost) two years since the Echo debuted, Alexa has gotten better and better and is actually the front-runner for the connected or smart home. Amazon wants Alexa to be your personal assistant, sort of like Google’s Assistant. But one thing that Amazon needed to do was to get Alexa into more hands. And they did just that. By creating cheaper Echo products in the Amazon Echo Dot and the Amazon Tap. They also brought Alexa to their tablets and Fire TV products. \nAmazon wants Alexa to be everywhere. This is a big part of the reason why Amazon has been selling the Echo Dot in 6-packs (you actually buy five and get the sixth for free). Allowing you to get an Echo Dot for every room in your house and even take one for your desk at work. But why does Amazon want this? Because it gets you deeper into their ecosystem. It’s not quite clear how Amazon is going to bring in revenue from Alexa – other than selling hardware with Alexa on it – but that will come soon enough. Right now, Amazon is working on perfecting Alexa and giving her loads of new skills. Not to mention it’s being integrated with other products and platforms like Philips Hue and Nest, to control your smart home. \nResearchers believe that the Echo – and more specifically the Echo Dot due to its price point – will be a way to get more and more people into the smart home space. Seeing as many smart appliances are pretty pricey – in fact a smart outlet is about the same price as the Echo Dot. But getting things started with the Echo Dot, Amazon Tap or the Amazon Echo can make things a bit easier, especially where they work with many different platforms already. It has been an interesting two years for Amazon’s Alexa and Echo already, and it’s going to be an interesting future for the products too.",

You obviously save on bags but please be aware that it's quite messy to empty containers and maybe better to do outside the house. So consider this.",

      "text": "Friday, 3:07 PM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper \nAmazon will have to reimburse customers whose children ran up large bills making in-app purchases, says a federal judge. The FTC sued Amazon in 2014 following consumer complaints about the ease with which children were able to spend money in apps. Amazon wanted to offer customers gift cards, but U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said Amazon must instead notify impacted customers and allow them to make a claim for cash reimbursement. Amazon's apps and app store now require passwords to make purchases. Apple and Google were hit with similar complaints and eventually settled with the government.",
