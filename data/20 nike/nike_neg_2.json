      "text": "Loading... \nNike finally brought back the cult-classic running model in the Nike Zoom Spiridon earlier this year. The OG colorway disappeared from store shelves as quick as one might expect given the silhouette’s near-decade-long absence while NikeLab offerings and an upcoming collaboration with Roundel London will cement the Spiridon as one of 2016’s best models. Nike Sportswear didn’t stop there either, utilizing the Spiridon’s unique midsole for the Nike Zoom Mercurial Flyknit Spiridon for a soccer-inspired aesthetic and this upcoming Nike Zoom Spirimic , a new lifestyle take perfect for the Fall/Winter season. \nThe Nike Spirimic is a hybrid silhouette that combines two of the Swoosh’s more popular running models from their late-90s early 2000s catalog in the Nike Zoom Spiridon and the Nike Zoom Seismic. The Seismic’s unique upper combines a lifestyle touch of suede overlays for the lace eyelets and a malleable neoprene and bolstered mesh slip-on combination for a Presto-esque fit. While we’ve seen both Midnight Navy and Metallic Platinum colorways in the past, we finally have word on the latest NSW hybrid’s release date: this Thursday, November 10th for $175 USD. What do you think of the Nike Zoom Spirimic’s strange design? Check out more detaled shots below. \nGrab your pair this Thursday from End Clothing . ",

      "text": "November 8, 2016 4:59 PM Ronaldo signs long-term deal with Nike Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo leaves a press conference after signing a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Monday, Nov. 7, 2016. Real Madrid have extended Ronaldo's contract until June 2021, when the three-time world player of the year will be 36. Financial details were not released, although the star forward is expected to remain the team's top-paid player. Paul White AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story \nNike and Cristiano Ronaldo have extended their long-term sponsorship deal. \nThe Portuguese soccer star has had a contract with Nike since 2003 and wears its Mercurial cleats. In a video released by the Beaverton, Oregon-based apparel maker, he suggested the deal was \"for life,\" although terms weren't released. \nRonaldo said in a statement released Tuesday by the company: \"I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company. We work as a family, too. This is my brand.\" \nRonaldo, a three-time world player of the year, is captain of the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this year. \nOn Monday, the 31-year old signed a new five-year contract with Real Madrid that runs through June 2021.

      "text": "View Comments \nMADRID : A day after signing a bumper fresh contract with Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo has boosted his mind-boggling earnings with a new deal with Nike, the American sports giant said on Tuesday. \nTogether the multimillion mega-deals are expected to cement Ronaldo’s status as the world’s highest-paid sportsman, ahead of great Barcelona rival Lionel Messi. \nAccording to American magazine Forbes, Ronaldo trumped Messi in 2016 with an income of $88 million (80 million euros, £71 million). \nThere are no concrete figures, but Ronaldo’s new five-year contract with Real is expected to net the 31-year-old Portuguese forward in the region of a basic salary of 25 million euros a year. \nHe could also bag up to 40 million euros a year for the Nike deal, according to Marca. \nMarca and AS, the Spanish sports dailies, said the Nike deal is for life, rather like the one between Nike and basketball legend Michael Jordan. \n“I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,” Ronaldo said in a Nike press release announcing a “new, long-term contract”. \n“We work as a family too,” he added. \n“This is my brand.” \nRonaldo on Monday signalled his intention to keep playing for 10 more years after rounding off a “dream year”. \nThe three-time World Player of the Year has enjoyed his most successful year at a collective level, scoring the winning penalty as Madrid won the Champions League for an 11th time in May before captaining Portugal to their first major tournament win at Euro 2016. \n- AFP",

By Brendan Dunne \nThe college basketball season hasn't even gotten underway yet and the Oregon Ducks are already flexing their exclusives. For an exhibition game on Monday, Phil Knight's favorite squad brought out the above pair of Nike KD 9s . \nThe sneakers are draped in Oregon's green and yellow and also feature trees around the back half as a reference to the bosky graphic court at Matthew Knight Arena where they play. \nThis motif has hit Oregon shoes before, with the Nike KD 8 donning a similar look at the top of 2016.",

File Photo: Reuters AFP, Madrid \nA day after signing a bumper fresh contract with Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo has boosted his mind-boggling earnings with a new deal with Nike, the American sports giant said on Tuesday. \nTogether the multimillion mega-deals are expected to cement Ronaldo's status as the world's highest-paid sportsman, ahead of great Barcelona rival Lionel Messi. \nAccording to American magazine Forbes, Ronaldo trumped Messi in 2016 with an income of $88 million (80 million euros, £71 million). \nThere are no concrete figures, but Ronaldo's new five-year contract with Real is expected to net the 31-year-old Portuguese forward in the region of a basic salary of 25 million euros a year. \nHe could also bag up to 40 million euros a year for the Nike deal, according to Marca. \nMarca and AS, the Spanish sports dailies, said the Nike deal is for life, rather like the one between Nike and basketball legend Michael Jordan. \n\"I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,\" Ronaldo said in a Nike press release announcing a \"new, long-term contract\". \n\"We work as a family too,\" he added. \n\"This is my brand.\" \nRonaldo on Monday signalled his intention to keep playing for 10 more years after rounding off a \"dream year\". \nThe three-time World Player of the Year has enjoyed his most successful year at a collective level, scoring the winning penalty as Madrid won the Champions League for an 11th time in May before captaining Portugal to their first major tournament win at Euro 2016.

The look is topped off by TfL’s logo, the Roundel, on the tongue of the shoe.\n(Picture: Nike) The NikeLab x Roundel Zoom Spiridon releases in two colourways on 9 November at a pop-up in Charing Cross station, London, followed by select retailers later this year.\nMORE: Nike just unveiled the perfect trainers for pizza-obsessives \nMORE: Nike’s HyperAdapt 1.0 trainers are the Marty McFly self-lacing shoes you’ve always wanted \nMORE: The Nike Air Force 1 got the FlyKnit treatment and it looks GREAT ",

      "text": "Community Corner Nike's Massive 5-Floor SoHo Store Finally Set to Open The store has been teased for quite awhile, but it finally opens on Nov. 11, according to their site. By Mark Osborne (Patch Staff) - November 9, 2016 12:39 am ET \nSOHO, NY — Even LeBron James would be blown away by the number of shoes in Nike's new SoHo megastore. The store, which opens Friday, Nov. 11, according to its website, is five stories worth of shoes. \nThe store is located at 529 Broadway — a six-story retail building which will be filled almost entirely by Nike. And to honor the opening, Nike has announced they will release a handful of special shoes — in a limited supply only. \nXXL had the details on what the first-come, first-serve shoes will be: LeBron Soldier 10 x John Elliott, AF1 Low NYC, Air Jordan IX Space Jam, Air Jordan IX Kobe and the Air Jordan XII Royal. \nXXL also reports there will be an Air Jordan restock featuring the Air Jordan XI “72-10,” Air Jordan I “Banned,” Air Jordan XXX1 “Banned,” Air Jordan I “Black Toe,” Air Jordan I “Pinnacle,” Air Jordan IV “Cement” and the Air Jordan 1 “Shattered Backboard.” \nThe overhaul of the building has been in the works for literally years. Bowery Boogie wrote about its two-year overrun back in May. Racked reported all the way back in May 2015 that Nike was the likely flagship for the remade landmarked building. \nThe store is scheduled to open on Friday at 10 a.m. and its normal hours will run from Tuesday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. \nThe location is just a block away from rival Adidas' SoHo store. \nPhoto Credit: 529 Broadway in September 2013 via Google Maps Street View Get free real-time news alerts from the SoHo-Little Italy Patch.

In a video released by the Beaverton, Oregon-based apparel maker, he suggested the deal was \"for life,\" although terms weren't released. \nRonaldo said in a statement released Tuesday by the company: \"I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company. We work as a family, too. This is my brand.\" \nRonaldo, a three-time world player of the year, is captain of the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this year. \nOn Monday, the 31-year old signed a new five-year contract with Real Madrid that runs through June 2021. Ronaldo has scored 372 goals in 360 matches for Real Madrid, helping the team to two Champions League titles and the La Liga crown since joining it in 2009.",

      "text": "Ronaldo's new deal with Nike looks to be unlike any other in football By Tony Connelly - 09 November 2016 13:41pm Ronaldo \nCristiano Ronaldo has renewed his partnership with Nike in a highly lucrative deal that mirrors other agreements Nike has with Michael Jordan and LeBron James. \nThe Real Madrid superstar has signed a multi-year agreement with the US sports giant, reportedly worth around €24m ($27m) per year. \n“I have an excellent relationship with this brand, I have great friends here and we work as a family. This is my brand,” Ronaldo said. \nNike said: “He transcends the world of football, as the most famous athlete in the world and the most popular on social networks.” \nThe statement also noted Ronaldo’s “extensive feedback and insights” in helping to design Nike products such as his Mercurial Superfly boots. \n“His commitment to fitness has also informed Nike’s training products, while his style is regularly on display in Nike Sportswear,” Nike added. \nNeil Hopkins, director at M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, said the deal “underlines how valuable he is to the brand as they trade blows with Adidas and their star performer Lionel Messi ”. \nHopkins added: “If, as has been reported, this is a ‘deal for life’ from Nike, then Ronaldo will be the first non-NBA star to receive such a package after Michael Jordan and LeBron James. \n“What is interesting though is that the Nike deal will sit adjacent to the commercial activities that Ronaldo undertakes under his own highly successful CR7 brand. \n“That range now stretches from underwear, through shirts and shoes to fragrances, demonstrating what a commercial phenomenon Ronaldo has become beyond the football sphere.” \nThe Portuguese sportsman's commercial appeal is also, to an extent, playing into the hands of Nike’s rival Adidas, which has a kit deal with Real Madrid. \nAround 40% of the club’s shirt sales can be attributed to Ronaldo and his popularity is helping the Spanish club expand into new regions such as Asia.",

      "text": "Ronaldo Signs Deal With Nike “For Life” November 9, 2016 9:13 AM \nFollow The Fan: Facebook | Twitter BEVERTON, Ore. (AP) – Nike and Cristiano Ronaldo have extended their long-term sponsorship deal. The Portuguese soccer star has had a contract with Nike since 2003 and wears its Mercurial cleats. In a video released by the Beaverton, Oregon-based apparel maker, he suggested the deal was “for life,” although terms weren’t released. Ronaldo said in a statement released Tuesday by the company: “I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company. We work as a family, too. This is my brand.” Ronaldo, a three-time world player of the year, is captain of the Portuguese national team that won the European Championship this year. On Monday, the 31-year old signed a new five-year contract with Real Madrid that runs through June 2021. Ronaldo has scored 372 goals in 360 matches for Real Madrid, helping the team to two Champions League titles and the La Liga crown since joining it in 2009. (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed to a new lifetime contract with sports giant Nike that will earn him an astonishing $1.25 billion.\nOnly a day after putting pen to paper on a new contract with Real Madrid until 2021 that will see him pocket $620,000 a week after tax, Nike have moved swiftly to get their man.\nA spokesperson for Nike told SunSport: “The successful partnership between Nike and Cristiano Ronaldo will continue well into the future with a new, long-term contract.”\n“Ronaldo is having yet another incredible year, for both club and country, and is unquestionably an icon of the game. He transcends football and is the most popular athlete on social media and the most famous athlete in the world.”\nAlthough Nike has refused to confirm the $1.25 billion figure, TMZ reports that it follows similar negotiations to LeBron James’ lifetime contract, worth in excess of $1.25 billion.\nThe Portuguese star’s new deal at the Bernabeu will keep him at the club until 2021, when he will be 36.\nHe is expected to pocket $280 million for the duration. It’s no surprise Forbes listed him as the highest-grossing athlete for 2016 as he collected in $88 million.\nAnd the three-time Ballon d’Or winner insists he still wants to carry on playing after his new contract runs out.\nHe said: “I don’t know the future. I know this is my penultimate contract. After that, I don’t know. I don’t know at what age I’ll stop.”\n\nRonaldo needs six more goals to reach 500 for his career — and admits it is a something he is targeting.\nHowever, he has stressed it’s winning trophies that drives him forward. And one trophy he is nominated for this year is the Ballon d’Or. Ronaldo would become only the second player — after Lionel Messi — to win the prize in consecutive years if he claims the honor this year, as expected.\nThis year, the 31-year-old won the Champions League and Euro 2016, and is favorite to land the award.\nHe already beat Messi to one piece of silverware this season. On Tuesday, he scooped up the Alfredo di Stefano trophy for being the best player in La Liga last season.\n  This article originally appeared on The Sun .\nFiled under cristiano ronaldo ,  nike ,  real madrid ,  soccer ,  sports contracts",

      "text": "Brian Tobin Nike has tapped its archives as the inspiration for its latest sneaker. On Nov. 18, the active sportswear company will introduce the Nike LunarCharge, which incorporates elements of the past with modern styling and comfort features. The shoe uses Neoprene materials borrowed from the Nike Air Flow, circa 1988, and blends it with eye stays from the Air Max 90 (1990). The silhouette is similar to the Air Current, which was also offered in 1990, while the internal bootie construction comes from the Air Presto from 2000. But the laser-siped Lunarlon outsole is the most contemporary feature, drawing from the LunarEpic that was introduced earlier this year. The LunarCharge also features a laser-siped embossed text on the midsole for the first time. And the shoe, which is targeted to the lifestyle market, will be the first Nike style to have LunarEpic cushioning outside of the company’s line of running products. The LunarCharge will retail for $120 and the first colorway, a black-and-white model, will be sold at select boutiques. Earlier this week, rapper Tinie Tempah was spotted wearing the unreleased shoe on the red carpet of the MTV European Music Awards, causing some buzz among sneakerheads.",

      "text": "Nike Presents the LunarCharge Sneakers By Roger Krastz November 9, 2016 10:58 AM Nike \nToday, Nike introduces its newest and latest innovative silhouette, the LunarCharge. Transforming comfort through a sneaker that leverages Nike’s latest running technology, the Lunarlon cushioning system introduces the Nike LunarEpic this year. \nMeshing the likes of the the Nike Air Presto (2000), the Nike Air Max 90 (1990) and the Nike Air Current (1990), Nike Sportswear’s result is the Nike LunarCharge, a shoe that maximizes comfort with the Air Flow’s neoprene, the Air Presto’s bootie construction and the LunarEpic’s laser-siped, cushioned outsole—all with the iconic eye stays of the Air Max 90 and the sleek silhouette of the Air Current. \nTwenty-seven years of design and performance innovation—in addition to pressure point testing, resulting in increased comfort for specific areas of the foot—inform this entirely new model, which has laser-siped, embossed text on the midsole for the first time. It’s also the first Nike shoe to have the LunarEpic cushioning system outside of the Nike Running category. \nThe first colorway of the Nike LunarCharge will be released on Friday, Nov. 18 at select Nike retailers and boutiques and will retail for a suggested price of $120.

      "text": "Already offered in triple black and cargo khaki, the Nike ACG Lupinek Flyknit is rendered in a classic colorway for its latest iteration this Fall/Winter 2016. \nFlaunting a predominantly black finish, the boot/sneaker-inspired design is also covered with a mixture of white tones throughout the knitted portion of its upper. Premium leather across the profile further reinforces its rugged build, while the versatile silhouette is topped off with a crisp white SFB’s Free-inspired sole unit that offers tough, yet flexible cushioning upon every step.\nPriced at $250, you can purchase this standout pair at select Nike retailers worldwide as well as online now. \nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I like the design overall. It emits style and functionality perfectly together. In this colorway, it’s a really appealing option.\n\nThe post The Nike ACG Lupinek Flyknit Receives A Traditional Finish appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Ronaldo celebrates signing $1bn Nike deal with training camp in Portugal Published time: 9 Nov, 2016 15:43 Get short URL © Sergio Perez / Reuters Cristiano Ronaldo has celebrated signing a mega $1 billion deal with sports giants Nike by overseeing a football masterclass at the training center of the club he first signed at as a professional– Sporting Lisbon in Portugal. \nOn Sunday, the man at the summit of the Forbes list of highest-paid athletes penned a dizzying £1 billion (US$1.2 billion) lifetime deal with US-based sportswear company Nike and the Real Madrid icon marked the occasion by holding a football masterclass. \nThe #CR7 live show was shown on the Soccer Am YouTube channel from Academia Sporting, the training ground of Sporting Lisbon located in the Portuguese municipality of Alcochete. Back in Lisbon leading a @nikefootball masterclass with the future of Fast. Watch out for these guys! 👀➡🏆 #Mercurial pic.twitter.com/ru0cajXFc9 — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) November 9, 2016 \nA spokesperson for Nike told SunSport: \"The successful partnership between Nike and Cristiano Ronaldo will continue well into the future with a new, long-term contract. \n\"Ronaldo is having yet another incredible year, for both club and country, and is unquestionably an icon of the game. He transcends football and is the most popular athlete on social media and the most famous athlete in the world.\" Read more Cristiano Ronaldo pens record mega deal to stay at Real Madrid until 2021 \nRonaldo, 31, has enjoyed a glittering 2016 – this summer he won the UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid and the UEFA European Championship with Portugal. \nHis Nike agreement comes just days after he signed a new contract with Spanish giants Real, which will see him earn an astonishing US$280 million over five years. \nThe deal, which will expire in 2021 when the player will be 36, is the biggest in football history and sees Ronaldo set to pocket a reported $545,000 per week and sets his buyout clause at $1.1 billion. It also means Ronaldo overtakes Barcelona rival Lionel Messi in wages. \nAsked about his intentions to play past the expiry of the contract, Ronaldo replied: “I don’t know the future. I know this is my penultimate contract. After that, I don’t know. I don’t know at what age I’ll stop.\" \nAt the training session in Lisbon, the former Manchester United ace was joined by his “great mate,” former Inter Milan and FC Barcelona player Ricardo Quaresma, in coaching a group of footballers through shooting and dribbling exercises. Just found the next generation of Fast in Lisbon! #StrikeSeries 🔎⚽🏃💨 pic.twitter.com/HVtyY4tLt2 — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) November 9, 2016 \nThe session was also in celebration of the launch of the ‘CR7 Chapter 3: Discovery’ by Nike, which features fashion and football and introduces the new Nike Mercurial Superfly Heritage iD football boots. \nThe training drill was followed by a Q and A, and when asked if he was happy with the level of talent on show, Ronaldo replied: “No,” before diplomatically adding, “they should be more relaxed inside the box.” \nRonaldo topped the 2016 list of highest-earning athletes in the world, published annually by Forbes magazine, with earnings of US$88 million. \nThe winger visited MMA fighter Conor McGregor over the summer, when the brash Irishman half-jokingly said he would be the one to take the crown from Ronaldo next year.",

The Nike Air Max Audacity 2016—a relatively low-key sneaker most notably worn by Anthony Davis—was one of those pairs, as it appeared several on the feet of several players during the New Orleans Pelicans vs. Sacramento Kings matchup. Along with Davis, teammates Omer Asik and Dante Cunningham rocked it, as well as DeMarcus Cousins. Out in Memphis, Vince Carter also rocked the AM Audacity ’16 en route to a 20-point effort against the Denver Nuggets. \nAnother Nike Basketball model that saw heavy action last night was the Nike Hyperdunk 2016. All three versions hit the hardwood with the standard Hi model being the most popular on the night. Amongst the players wearing it were Zach Randolph, Nikola Jokic, Karl-Anthony Towns and C.J. McCollum. \nMake sure to peep the rest of Tuesday’s night NBA kicks in our latest recap. Scroll through, above. Tags:",

      "text": "Pin it Share The Air Jordan sneaker is one of Nike’s most popular shoe styles. (Photo: Getty Images) More The news of one teen’s actions to help another student being bullied might just be the heartwarming story you need after the culmination of such a contentious election cycle. A high school student in South Carolina, Tae Moore, noticed one of his fellow classmates, Taylor Bates, was being bullied because of the way he talked and dressed. He decided to surprise Bates with a pair of new Air Jordans to make him “ feel better .” Moore posted a video of their exchange on Facebook, which has already been viewed almost 3 million times. “This kid that goes to our school is named Eazy E. He likes to rap and etc., and said he wants to be a rapper. He is just trying to chase his dream, but kids at school like to bully him and pick on him and talk about the way he dresses and looks. So I went and bought him some Jordans. He was shocked,” he posted alongside the video. In the video, Bates is completely floored by the gesture and asks Moore if he wants payment in return for the shoes, which Moore denies while insisting he try on the new pair of sneakers. Bates posted a photo with Moore on his Instagram page in which he thanked the student for his kindness and recounted the full story to his followers. According to Bates, Moore approached him the day before gifting him the sneakers to ask him what size he wore, also telling him to meet him in the same spot the next day. When he arrived the next day, the teen handed him a new pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro sneakers. He also told Bates to let him know if anyone bothers him in the future. Bates was so moved by Moore’s gesture that he almost cried. He added the hashtag “#thereareawesomepeopleintheworld” to his photo, showing just how much the small act of kindness meant to him.  ",

      "text": "Go! Cristiano Ronaldo And Nike Have Agreed To A Lifetime Deal That Reportedly Has 10 Digits In It Today at 1:02 pm Share Tweet \nReal Madrid and Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo just got a hell of a lot richer, because, per FOX Sports , the 31-year-old just inked a new mega-deal with Nike that will be for the rest of his life. \n\nHere's what a press release from Nike stated: \nIn 2003, a young Cristiano Ronaldo signed with Nike. In the years since, he has worn more than 60 different Nike Mercurial boots, scoring goals, breaking records, and amassing trophies along the way. The successful partnership between Nike and Ronaldo will continue well into the future with a new, long-term contract. \n“I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,” says Ronaldo. “We work as a family too,” he adds. “This is my brand.” \nRonaldo’s extensive feedback and insights have helped Nike’s design team on numerous products, especially the Mercurial Superfly boots that he wears. His commitment to fitness has also informed Nike’s training products, while his style is regularly on display in Nike Sportswear. \nThe news, which comes a few days following a new contract with his club team in Madrid until 2021, is believed to be worth more than $1 billion—which is what another Nike superstar, LeBron James, is believed to have signed with the sports apparel giant this past summer. \nWhile there's no way to know exactly what financial terms are, per TMZ Sports , sources say it's, \"very similar\" to LeBron's deal, so, yeah, CR7 had about the best week of any athlete ever.",

      "text": "Nike+ SNKRS Presents 12 Soles Share Share Image \nBasketball, more so than any other sport, leaves an imprint on popular culture beyond the court. Since Nike’s entry into basketball — with the Bruin and Blazer in 1972 — the brand’s on-court footwear has sparked the imagination of athletes, artists, designers, musicians, skateboarders and many more. \nWith 12 Soles, Nike celebrates its wide-ranging impact on the game through a collection of silhouettes that define the past, present and future of basketball. \nSome of these sneakers are inexorably linked to moments—through transcendent tournament runs or turns on the silver screen; and through collaborative interpretations and championship drives. Others are poised for roles in future memory, equipping today’s hardwood heroes and outfitting a new generation of street style icons. Share Image \nRepresented by the collection are several highlights of Nike’s basketball heritage: the Nike Air Force 1 (through its latest iterations, the SF AF-1 and AF-1 Upstep Warrior), Nike Air Max 2 Uptempo, Nike Uptempo, Nike Uptempo 97 and Nike Air Foamposite Pro. These join some of Nike’s most impactful recent innovations: the Nike Kobe XI Elite Low, Nike Zoom KD 9, Nike Kyrie 2 and Air Jordan XXXI. Rounding out the assortment are three Jordan icons: the Air Jordan IX Retro, Air Jordan XI Retro and Air Jordan XVI Retro. \nThe link between all the designs is an undeniable sport DNA captured from a relentless focus on the needs of the athlete and an uncanny capacity to connect across cultures. \nSneakers within 12 Soles go on display this week at the new Nike Soho store (529 Broadway), which opens on November 11. The shoes will be available beginning December 3 on Nike+ SNKRS, nike.com and at select retailers. Tags",

      "text": "Riccardo Tisci Unveils a New Sneaker Collab with Nike November 9, 2016 1:30 pm Expand Photo: Courtesy of NikeLab \nOver the couple years, Riccardo Tisci has proven himself to be Nike’s most imaginative and dedicated collaborator. He’s reimagined the brand’s iconic Air Force 1s and Dunk sneakers and crafted a collection of performance wear with NikeLab that puts standard gym clothes to shame. Today, he’s unveiling his latest project with Nike, two styles of the Nike Air Zoom Legend sneaker. \n“We chose this shoe because its story is so closely linked to the ‘90s as a symbol of youth culture and street style,” Tisci told Vogue.com via email. “This style was a street icon at the time. Its story revolves around sports, movement, life by the ocean, and the energy that comes from this lifestyle. That freedom and optimism define my state of mind. I had already worked with the world of surfing, so I feel close to this idea. Together with Nike we decided to redesign this shoe when I was working on my NikeLab x RT: Training Redefined collection before the Olympics.” Expand Photo: Courtesy of NikeLab The sneakers come in a jacquard black option with black and white detailing and a mesh black style with a rainbow-hued heel. “The inspiration is very Tisci – it is very much me,” the designer said. “The rubber heel and sole are very Nike but with a new interpretation inspired by a futuristic take on Brazil, waves, and movement. The front side is more classic, a sort of opposite of sports. Chelsea boots are my obsession in the male wardrobe. This is a strong shoe with a dual contrast and an experimental style. And the heel had to be important – in aesthetic has always represented strength since ancient Greece, where Achilles’ heel represented the human male force.”\nThe sneakers will be stocked exclusively at the new NikeLab store at 21 Mercer Street in New York starting on November 11, and will arrive online and at other NikeLab stores later this year. What also might arrive later this year is more Nike collaborations with Tisci—though nothing is confirmed the designer has a longstanding affection for the sportswear giant. “I am open to working with all kinds of Nike pieces,” he wrote. Stay tuned. \n",

      "text": "\nJust hours ago, Nike unveiled its brand new LunarCharge silhouette adorned by New York City-bred BMX rider, Nigel Sylvester. The ultramodern sneaker culls design cues from a plethora of iconic Swoosh models—taking its neoprene upper from the 1988 Air Flow, eye stays from the Air Max 90, an internal bootie from the 2000 Air Presto and the overall design from the 1990 Air Current. Its most innovative feature goes to the l aser-siped Lunarlon outsole which is also found on the 2016 LunarEpic. \nThe LunarCharge will launch in a crisp white/deep black colorway this November 18 online and at select Nike stockists.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "The Christmas vibes are coming early this year as Nike will be releasing this festive colorway of the Nike SB Dunk High later this week.\nCovered in a full Gym Red velvet all throughout the upper, there’s no denying that this colorway of the SB Dunk High reminds us all of Jolly Old St. Nich and his signature red attire. The silky velvet upper is contrasted by hits of White on the rubber midsole and the Nike branding on the tongue. Finishing things off is a Gym Red outsole.\nLook for the Nike SB Dunk High Red Velvet to release on November 11th for $110.\nimages: Titolo \nAuthor’s Take If weren’t able to fit into the Jordan 1 Heiress then here’s another suitable option. I mean it’s not burgundy, but it’s still velvet and we all know that the SB Dunk and Air Jordan 1 are very similar.\n\nThe post An On-Feet Look At The Nike SB Dunk High Red Velvet appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "What you see above is the newest of the new coming out of Nike . Known as the Nike LunarCharge, this is Nike’s take on performance meets style. Versatile in appearance, the Nike LunarCharge grabs inspiration from various different existing Nike models. For starters, the eyestay is derived from the classic AM 90. The neoprene upper is inspired fro the Nike Air Flow, and the bootie construction was borrowed from the Nike Air Presto. The overall shape of the shoe pays homage to the Nike Air Current, while this version of the Lunarlon cushioning is the same one used on the recently released Nike LunarEpic. The colorway you see above comes in Black and White and is set to release on November 18th for $120. What are your initial thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments below.\n \n \n \nh/t: HS \nAuthor’s Take I like it. You’d think with all these features from different models it would be a hybrid nightmare, but I don’t know, man. I think it has potential to be a good versatile shoe. That Lunarlon sole is a big plus.\n\nThe post Our First Look At The Brand New Swoosh Model, The Nike LunarCharge appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo just might be the luckiest guy in the world. He gets to play a game for a living that is fanatically followed by billions around the world. He seems purpose-built for the sport, with speed and strength never before seen in soccer. He dates supermodels by the handful, thanks to his fame, wealth and good looks. \nAnd in a case of the rich getting richer (literally), Ronaldo has had a financial week that would make many small countries jealous. Earlier this week Ronaldo, despite already being past his prime, signed a new 5-year contract with Real Madrid that will maintain his status as the world's highest-paid soccer player. Now, reports have emerged that he has extended his endorsement contract with Nike. \nBipasha Basu\nView the 7 images of this gallery on the original article The 31 year old's new deal with Nike is rumored to total more than $1 BILLION. Yes, that is the correct spelling. Billion, with a B.\nThe new deal is supposedly a lifetime partnership, similar to the recent LeBron James -Nike agreement that will also take around ten figures to keep the superstar tied to the sportswear giant for life. \nWhile enormous, this week's deals could actually be good value for both Real Madrid and Nike. Ronaldo is a huge marketing draw both on and off the field, and if the boost that an athlete like Steph Curry has given to Under Armour is any indication, Ronaldo could easily prove worthy of such head-spinning earnings.\nh/t: FHM ",

      "text": "By Donwill November 9, 2016 2:37 PM Kith Victor Cruz stays winning when it comes to sneakers, and the New York Giant’s wide receiver looks to have just scored again. The Nike Air Trainer Cruz is back in a mellow new colorway that looks to be a solid win for people with a sense of style. It’s a bold model that sits atop the sole of a Cross Trainer and turns it on its head by taking it on a luxurious detour. This colorway is given a metallic silver suede and textile upper with a white outsole shining beneath. A few hits of royal blue bleed through on the outsole, and lace tips as well, to give the shoe a slight pop of color in the end. These are launching on November 10 with a special Nike x Kith Pop Up shop , so if you’re in the tri-state area head on down and grab a pair. \n20 Best Boots of 2015",

On Sunday, Ronaldo re-signed with Real Madrid with a five-year contract through 2021 that will earn him millions. \nWith his new Nike deal , Ronaldo becomes the third athlete to sign a \"lifetime\" endorsement with the company. \nNike also has \"lifetime\" deals with NBA greats Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Details about Ronaldo's deal were not released, but the partnership will remain in effect even after he retires. \nNike has paid Jordan over $473 million since 1993, even though he retired in 2003. \nRelated: LeBron James gets lifetime Nike deal \n\"I look at this new contract [as something] for life,\" Ronaldo said in a video about the deal. \nRonaldo has been sponsored by Nike since 2003, and has worn more than 60 different versions of Nike's Mercurial soccer cleats. \nHe was already ranked #1 on the Forbes 2016 list of the world's highest paid athletes. The new contract with Real Madrid and the lifetime endorsement from Nike will surely help secure his spot at the top.  21 PM ET",

      "text": "It’s been years since I’ve seen a Jordan retro at a Nike outlet store. Ok, that’s not true; we’ve all seen the occasional retro hit the wall whether because they were a online return or a handful of B-grades or even the occasional surprise like the original surprise drop of the Air Jordan 1 Banned (with the “X”). Seeing a retro of some regard is uncommon, but far from inconceivable.\nUsually it is the less popular colorways that make it to the outlet stores and even then the prices aren’t outlet friendly. Sometimes they knock off $10-$20 from the retail price, so when you see something like the Air Jordan 7 Nothing But Net , the price difference is barely enough to justify copping them. Speaking of that pair, that was really the last time I saw a non-Air Jordan 1 retro get prominent shelf time. Until this past weekend when I saw the Air Jordan 10 Charlotte go for $119.99, a whopping $70 off the MSRP of $190. And to top it off I even had a coupon that would have knocked off an additional 30%.\nSo after years of hoping we would see the price of retros come down either by Nike’s volition or through the inability to sell them at full price, I could finally buy a retro for less than $100 even after taxes. Did buy it? Nope. And judging from the stacks that were still on shelves, not a lot of people were biting either.\nIf you had told me back in during the height of retro craziness – which would be around the 2010-2013 range – that high quality (relatively speaking) Air Jordan 10 in the popular Charlotte Hornets colors would sit on shelves and eventually hit outlet stores for $119.99 and languish, I would have called you crazy, but also I would have itching at the prospect of buying those kicks at near impulse buy levels. It’s funny what perspective, reality and “the culture” moving on to other brands and trends will do to your enthusiasm. I might still come back to that store and buy them eventually, but it’s more for intellectual purposes than an overall desire to buy.\nThe post The Moment When You See Jordan Retros On Clearance And People Still Aren’t Biting appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "By Max Resetar \nNike’s past is littered with classic silhouettes that advanced sneakers technologically and also looked beautiful. The Air Flow, Air Max 90, Air Current and Air Presto all have their own significant place in the Swoosh’s history. \nNike recognized this and took aspects from each of those to create the LunarCharge. The neoprene material borrowed from the Air Flow, eye stays from the Air Max 90, shape of the Air Current and internal bootie construction of the Air Presto have all made their way to the LunarCharge. Nike’s also included their Lunarlon technology for a comfortable and responsive ride. \nThe LunarCharge releases on November 18, for $120 at select boutiques. Tags:",

Nike jumped all the way back to the Air Flow style from 1988, resurfacing the neoprene material used that shoe. They also borrowed elements from other shoes through the years including the Air Max 90, Air Current, Air Presto and LunarEpic.

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 7 images from this gallery. \nThe latest in Nike’s series of developments includes a new five-story Soho store , and in adding to that, they’ve just announced the opening of their New York Made: Stanton Street Courts by KAWS . Designed by Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, the new street courts encompass two side-by-side basketball courts measuring 116 by 80 feet.\n“My approach to the courts was very similar to how I would work on canvas. I wanted to create something that was true to my language, but also considerate of this being a court that people are playing on,” said KAWS. “I wanted to find the sweet spot where it works visually and functionally — how its broken up by the game’s lines and works with my images. It will have an intimate effect on the players that use the court.”\nThe new courts are part of a larger “New York Made” campaign, so be sure to stay tuned for more updates regarding the project.\nIf you’re interested in checking out the court in person you can do so at Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Manhattan’s Lower East Side.\n",

      "text": "Nike Air Max Plus Water Pool By Donwill November 9, 2016 5:07 PM Nike Winter is coming, and Nike is not going down without a fight. They’ve tricked out one of their most beloved Air Max models with a theme that will have you craving a summer vacation very badly. The Nike Air Max Plus Water Pool is a model with the feel of the reflective surface of water that almost feels tie dye. This vibrant graphic upper gives way to a relentlessly stark white outsole that even covers the air units. It’s an interesting model that would be great worn sockless on a sunny day with a tank top and some sort of beverage with an umbrella. No word on when exactly these Nike Air Max Plus Water Pool’s will release but sources say they should be at Nike retailers soon. Nike \n20 Best Boots of 2015",

(Photo: Business Wire) Thumbnail November 09, 2016 04:15 PM Eastern Standard Time \nNEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) will open its newest retail experience, Nike Soho, on Friday, Nov. 11: a five-story, multi-sport, 55,000-square-foot digitally connected store located at 529 Broadway at Spring St. in the heart of New York City’s Soho neighborhood. \nThe new Nike Soho is designed to deliver the best of Nike products and personalized services through a series of reimagined spaces. Guided by a large team of highly trained Nike store athletes, Nike Soho offers one-of-a-kind immersive experiences for consumers. \n“We’re leading the transformation of sport retail—offering the best of Nike products, services and experiences under one roof,” said Heidi O’Neill, Nike’s President of Global Direct to Consumer. “With Nike Soho we can realize the promise of personalized performance. Powered by immersive digital trials and in-store experts, this store is about elevating every athlete’s potential. Whether you’re training for a marathon or shooting hoops on our in-store court, or if you love sneakers, Nike Soho will help you raise your game. Because it’s more than a store—it’s a personal sport experience.” \nNike Soho’s one-of-a-kind spaces are the ultimate service destinations and include: interactive digital Nike+ Running and Basketball Trials; the Nike+ Soccer Trial Zone, where consumers can try out the latest soccer cleats; the Nike+ Service Station, a dedicated service space to consult with Nike certified store experts; Nike By NYC, a personalization studio; The Lounge, a women’s boutique within the store with greatly expanded and enhanced fitting rooms and personal styling service; and The Stands, an in-store space where consumers can connect with one another, learn about the latest product drops or hear from a designer in residence. \nNike Soho also features the ultimate scene for sneakerheads, the Nike+ SNKRS experience. The 54-foot wide dual-gender Nike Sportswear footwear wall is the largest in any Nike store worldwide and has the largest in-season collection of the iconic Nike Air Force 1 in the company’s global fleet of stores. NSW products will premiere on the wall, showcasing the company’s best in sport style innovation. \n“It’s great to see the everyday athlete getting the same personalized treatment from Nike that I’ve enjoyed over the years,” said tennis champion Serena Williams. “When you have experts guiding you along the way, it can make all the difference to your game. I’ve been to a lot of Nike stores over the years and Soho’s personal touches and focus on style, service and experiences are unlike any other. I can’t wait to see what New York shoppers think of it.” \nNike Soho offers some of the hottest products – from brand-defining innovation to Nike Soho exclusives to Nike and Jordan Brand restocks including: LeBron Soldier X collaboration with designer John Elliott; Air Force 1 Low NYC HS; iconic Jordan silhouettes; and local designer collaboration tees. \nThe store also has a special display of the last pair of the Nike Mag shoe that will be auctioned on Sat., Nov. 12 to benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The Nike Mag is on display alongside a pair of Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, which will go on sale in early December. For the first time, consumers can also see the collection of Nike’s 12 Soles Collection, a tribute to Nike’s deep roots in basketball with a nod to the future. The first drop of the collection will be available at Nike Soho in early December. \nThe recently released Apple Watch Nike+ is also sold in the store. \nNike+ Member Benefits \nFor Nike+ members, Nike Soho offers premium services that streamline and enhance the shopping and membership experience, including the ability to book a 1:1 appointment, easy returns via their Nike+ profile, 30-day product trials, and access to programming via the Nike+, Nike+ Run Club, Nike+ Training Club and Nike+ SNKRS apps. \nNike Soho also offers seamless commerce—allowing consumers to buy products in store and online from Nike.com in a single transaction from the store, with free delivery of the online product. The store provides scheduled courier delivery of in-store purchases to Manhattan and Brooklyn addresses, including hotels. \nNote to Editors: \nBackground on Nike Soho’s Service & Experience Destinations \nNike+ Trial Zones \nThree immersive Nike+ Trial Zones transport consumers into authentic sport moments, bringing the sights and sounds of the Big Apple into a personal shopping experience unlike anything before. \nIn the Nike+ Running Trial Zones, consumers start by consulting with Nike-certified running athletes on the best choices for footwear. They can then test out shoes on a treadmill surrounded by two cameras capturing data from their run, and video screens comprising a three-sided immersive experience take them on a 90-second run through Central Park or Battery Park, two iconic New York running locations. Consumers’ personal trial experiences are saved to their Nike+ member profile, to enhance future shopping experiences. \nWith 23-foot ceilings and a half-court featuring an adjustable hoop, the Nike+ Basketball Trial Zone simulates the feel of the game. Five sensors, circling the court and powered by a gaming engine, guide consumers as they go through up to six custom drills of varying skill level, all tested in front of video screens totaling 16-feet wide by eight-feet tall that provide real-time on-screen tracking on the trial. The screens immerse players in New York’s famous Dyckman or Brooklyn Bridge Parks, helping them test the traction, lockdown and responsiveness of basketball shoes in a real-world scenario, including the simulation of a game-winning buzzer-beater shot. \nThe Nike+ Soccer Trial Zone is a 400-square-foot cleat trial area, encased in glass walls, with a synthetic turf field and supported by Nike certified trial athletes. Consumers can trial Nike’s best soccer cleats and receive 1:1 guidance on products, features and benefits. \nThe Stands \nThe Stands is the store’s first service destination. Designed to welcome consumers to Nike Soho, it offers a special seating area for live in-store programming, including Nike+ Sessions—intimate discussions with leading athletes, designers, and trendsetters. The Stands also features a video feed of Nike Soho’s upcoming product launches and latest store and company news. \nNike+ Service Station \nAt Nike Soho, experts are at your service. The Nike+ Service Station is home to the Nike+ 1:1 service, a private appointment with an expert who provides Nike+ members with a product gear-up, immersion in the Nike+ ecosystem, a curated takeaway and access to Nike services and events. \nLocated just outside the Nike+ Service Station are digital touchscreens, where consumers can learn more about product drops, in-store events, community events, and additional Nike services. \nThe Lounge \nWith a large boutique space, The Lounge transforms sport retail for women. Guided by Nike-certified store athletes, consumers can test out products in enhanced fitting rooms that are double the size of a standard Nike fitting room. The Lounge offers an array of services, from Nike+ 1:1 personal appointments to bra fitting, pant hemming, and digital checkout. There are adaptive lighting changes in all fitting rooms in Nike Soho—replicating the feel of anything from a yoga studio to a night run. \nNike By NYC: Personalization Studio \nNike By NYC is a one-of-a-kind instant personalization studio that allows consumers to laser engrave and print iconic NYC symbols on products. Powered by a new in-house production process, consumers will be notified via text when their order is ready for pick-up. Swooshes, heel backtabs, shoe tongues, dubrae and lace-tips can all be personalized with in-store laser machines. To celebrate Nike Soho’s opening, three local New York artists—Grotesk, Phil Annand and Jason Polan—are designing NYC inspired t-shirt and footwear logos, with three additional artists debuting their designs monthly through January 2017. \nAbout NIKE, Inc.

      "text": "Nike Adds Dynamic Fit Collar to Mercurial Victory   With this latest Cristiano Ronaldo collection, Nike has added a new model to its Mercurial silo, the Nike Mercurial Victory DF. It is the first Nike Mercurial Victory soccer boot to feature the iconic Dynamic Fit collar first known from the Superfly version and later also added to the Veloce. Nike Mercurial Victory VI DF CR7 - Seaweed / Hasta / White / Volt Based on the outstanding 'Chapter 3' colorway, the first-ever Nike Mercurial Victory Dynamic Fit soccer cleats combine the relatively cheap Mercurial Victory with a Dynamic Fit collar, as known from the much more expensive Veloce and Superfly models. Available from November 10, 2016, the all-new Nike Mercurial Victory Dynamic Fit Cristiano Ronaldo boots retail at a mere $95 (£75). For now, only this specific Cristiano Ronaldo colorway receives a Mercurial Victory with Dynamic Fit collar, but the regular Mercurial will follow with the first 2017 collection. What do you think?

      "title": "Nike Enlists KAWS to Redesign New York City's Stanton Street Courts",
      "text": "\nNike recently ushered in a new campaign with KAWS called New York Made . Working alongside the official New York City Parks and Recreation Department, the Swoosh's new collaborative project sees the Stanton Street Basketball Courts in the Lower East Side completely embellished with the famed Brooklyn artist's signature \"XX\" motif as well as a pair of Elmo-inspired silhouettes. His striking design covers a whopping 116 by 80 feet for both courts and is slated for an unveiling this November 10.\nAll in all, KAWS—who has a longstanding relationship with the athletic brand—wanted to simply bring functional, contemporary art to a community that he once called home and for all to enjoy. HYPEBEAST recently sat down with the artist to discuss his key motivations for designing the Stanton Street Basketball courts. Take a look at the interview below and let us know your thoughts.\nWhy the Stanton Street Courts in particular? \nYou know, that decision wasn’t mine to make. I was approached by Nike to design a court for the New York City Parks department and when I found out the location it definitely piqued my interest. It’s a space that I’m pretty familiar with and I pass on a regular basis.\nDo you play sports, are you a fan of sports? How did this collaboration come about? \nI don't play basketball, but I saw a good opportunity and figured the location is great. Working with Nike again after 10 years … it just seemed like the right time to do something.\n\nWhat were some of the inspirations that you drew upon for the surface of the courts? \nThe design for the courts is consistent with the work that I’m doing now. Whenever I get into a project, the work that comes out definitely ties in with the paintings that are in my studio. I wanted to make a court that held its own graphically, but also very functional for the players so there are no distractions when playing ball. Also, working with the material given … working within the confines that has been given.\nIs it difficult to work on a large space like this? \nNo, not at all. I like to keep it moving. I like new challenges. The show I just opened in Texas at the Fort Worth Modern featured a wall painting that was fifteen by seventy feet. It’s not much of a different approach from doing a wall to designing a court. Except, with this, there was a special paint that had to be used.\nDo you have a particular attachment to the Lower East Side? Do you have history there? \nMy first move from Jersey City to Manhattan was at Stanton and Clinton at the LES. I also lived in Delancey for a few years. I’m very familiar with that neighborhood. I spent most of my life skating downtown Manhattan, anywhere from east to west.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

By Brendan Dunne \nNike continues to tap fashion designers for its sportswear styles, again linking up with Riccardo Tisci for a NikeLab silhouette. The new Chelsea boot-looking shoe, called the Air Zoom Legend according to Vogue , is set to release this week. \nPer the fashion publication's exclusive on this new Tisci model, the sneaker will launch first at NikeLab 21 Mercer in New York City on Nov. 11, with a wider release to follow later this year. \nVogue also alludes to more to come from Tisci and Nike this year, with the designer saying he's open to working with the Swoosh on future projects. \nTisci's previous Nike creations include bold remixes of the Air Force 1 and the Dunk . \nUPDATE 11/9: A Nike press release calls this shoe the Chelsea Chukka by Riccardo Tisci, a name that makes more sense than the Air Zoom Legend (a moniker used by an old Kobe takedown model).

      "text": "Experts urge underwriters to develop climate risk insurance November 9, 2016 tweet Nike Popoola Operators in the insurance industry have been urged to develop products that will reduce the effects of climatic change and enhance the insurance sector’s growth. Experts, who participated at a workshop on “climate risk insurance”, made the suggestion while speaking on how the technical ability of the insurance sector could be enhanced to reduce climate risks. The workshop was organised by the Community Conservation and Development Initiatives in collaboration with the Germany’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Director, Programmes, CCDI, Kofo Adeleke, in a statement on Tuesday, said the programme was designed to examine how insurance-related mechanisms could contribute to climate resilience. According to the director, the programme emphasises how low-income groups can absorb loss and recover from disaster impact. Adeleke was quoted as saying that the organisers of the event stressed the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors in risk reduction and climate insurance. The Commissioner for Insurance, Alhaji Mohammed Kari, who was the key speaker at the event, was quoted to have said that the insurance industry could make a considerable contribution to global efforts in order to reduce the impact of climate change. The Chief Risk Officer, Continental Reinsurance Plc, Mr. Abayomi Judah, while making a presentation on “Principles of sustainable insurance: Continental Re’s journey to date,” said there must be a change in culture, which should be reflected in the attitudes of employees. Participants stressed that the insurance industry needed to be more creative and develop new and unique green products by tapping global experience in green insurance products and services. The statement quoted representatives of the National Insurers Association as suggesting the need for a working group to address the problem of limited awareness in the industry. Copyright PUNCH.

The collection has been put together to pay homage to the past, present and future of basketball, as well as the imprint left by the sport on popular culture. To take us on sentimental journey through the annals of basketball history, Nike are bringing back some of the sport’s most coveted silhouettes, linked to some memorable on-court moments. There’s a healthy number of Jumpman classics and some throwbacks to the golden era. The treats don’t stop there, we’re also getting our first chance to cop some of the newest and freakiest iterations of the Air Force 1 – as well as a mystery release, which we can only imagine will be the talk of the town when it’s revealed. \nThe Nike 12 Soles collection goes on sale December 3 at select stockists. \nMore Nike Basketball:",

Now the pair join forces once more to craft the Nike Air Zoom Legend, a futuristic take on the iconic Chelsea boot. The shoe places a classic high-cut silhouette with elastic sides, atop a technically advanced sole unit. Tisci commented that special attention was placed on the design of the heel which protrudes from the midsole in an angled cap. Details are a little unclear as to all of the technical specs, but are bound to be clarified in the coming weeks. \nThe Riccardo Tisci x Nike Air Zoom Legend will drop in two colourways exclusively at NikeLab’s Soho store on November 11. \nMore Riccardo Tisci x Nike:",
