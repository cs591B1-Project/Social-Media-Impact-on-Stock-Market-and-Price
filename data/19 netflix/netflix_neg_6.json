      "text": "Emily Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel (Picture: Netflix) For Gilmore Girls fans, there has long been an obsession with the final four words of the show – and now the stars of the show have admitted that they were left ‘surprised’ and ‘taken aback’ when they discovered them.\nWATCH: Gilmore Girls are back in first trailer for A Year in the Life Those four words have been hinted at by the show’s creator Amy Sherman-Palladino for years, but after she departed in 2006 the show continued on without her and so fans were never privy to just how the show may have ended.\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk though, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who play Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, admitted that their first reaction was shock.\n‘I was surprised,’ said Lauren.\nAlexis added: ‘I was surprised as well, a bit taken aback really, and then I thought, “of course Amy would do that!”‘\nLauren, Alexis, and Scott Patterson, who plays Luke (Picture: Netflix) Lauren also revealed that Amy refused to put the four words down on paper so they were not in the script, but that Alexis, who played her on-screen daughter Rory, had always known what the four mysterious words were.\n‘I somehow missed the entire train on this,’ revealed Lauren, adding that she ‘had to be told at work, halfway through filming’.\nStill Lauren does have some words of advice for fans who have been building up to this conclusion for nine long years: ‘They are only four words guys, we can only do so much!’\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nLuckily for everyone, we can finally hear those final four words for ourselves when Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life airs on Netflix on November 25.\nMORE: The Gilmore Girls ice cream flavour has been announced and it sounds amazing \nMORE: There’s Gilmore Girls makeup and we want it all \nMORE: Hey, Gilmore Girls! Ryan Gosling was once almost cast in the hit US drama \n ",

      "text": "\"THE IVORY GAME\" — 3 1/2 stars — directed by Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson, executive producer Leonardo DiCaprio; not rated; Netflix\nA dank room comes into view with several people milling about. Spread throughout the entire floor and piled up against the walls are tons upon tons of dirty, fresh elephant tusks. People in a line pass down an individual tusk until it reaches the last person, who carefully stacks it on top of a high pile.\n\"We don't have enough shelf space for all this ivory,\" says the program manager.\nThis is just one of many impactful scenes included in Netflix's new original documentary, \"The Ivory Game,\" that released Friday.\n“The Ivory Game” is not the typical activist documentary using feeble attempts of stirring emotion to sway the audience toward the cause. Rather, the film has a solid foundation of evidence and substantial exploration of the ivory situation to display it as a real crisis. It gives voice to the activists, conservationists and investigative journalists who have dedicated their lives to protecting elephants against poachers.\nDirectors Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson jump back and forth between the elephant poaching in Africa and the ivory black market in China. Filming in Africa concentrates on both wild elephants and greedy poachers. China's side of the story gives insight into a culture where ivory is a status symbol of the wealthy. It also shows how the illegal system of obtaining ivory is safeguarded by shops that legally and publicly sell it.\nAs an executive producer of \"The Ivory Game,\" Leonardo DiCaprio adds to his recent efforts to be a voice for environmentalism.\n“Having people like Jane Goodall and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are very passionate, helps keep us going,\" Davidson said in an interview with \" Entertainment Tonight ,\" \"because this in particular — more than anything that either of us have worked on before — was the most difficult film we’ve ever done.”\nFilming in each continent presents dangerous situations. Between undercover infiltrations with heads of the black market and hunting down poachers responsible for the deaths of thousands of elephants, there is no doubt that filming \"The Ivory Game\" was a risky undertaking.\nThe filmmakers display a vast range of cinematography, including aerial shots over plains and big cities, high-definition close-ups of elephants, undercover cameras infiltrating the black market and night-vision shots chasing down poachers.\nWhile scenes were artfully shot, perhaps even more impactful is the content they were able to capture within the frame. Viewers see Chinese stores piled full of artfully crafted ivory, recently poached elephant carcasses with their tusks ripped away and top tradesmen explaining their heartless ivory sales systems.\nRhinos, however, did not get a share in the documentary, even though they are hunted for their horns and consequently also severely affected by the ivory crisis. Perhaps the filmmakers felt they had enough ground to cover by focusing only on elephants; the documentary surely never felt stretched thin for content. Yet it does fail to mention how the alarmingly quick decline in elephant population is affecting Africa’s ecosystem. The shown effects of poaching end at elephant carcasses.\nAs the number of elephants goes down, the price of ivory climbs higher and higher. For this reason, “traders in ivory actually want the extinction of elephants,” says Craig Millar, a conservationist Quote: d in the film. Alarmingly, even though the Chinese and U.S. governments have begun working to end the ivory trade, poachers kill an elephant every 15 minutes, according to the documentary.\nThis is not a documentary that, once finished, is likely to have viewers thinking to themselves \"that was nice,\" and then going on with their lives. \"The Ivory Game\" and its message stick. It is impactful and will make viewers seriously consider the simple concluding invitation to take action by visiting theivorygame.com .\n\"The Ivory Game\" is not rated but includes disturbing images of animal cruelty and brief strong language; running time: 112 minutes.\nMcKenna Park is an aspiring journalist and a student at BYU studying communications.

      "text": "Lorelai (Lauren Graham), left, and Luke (Scott Patterson) take a walk through Stars Hollow in Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix)\nIt’s not often you get a second chance to make a last impression.\nWell, if you assume this Netflix revival is the last we see of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Nov. 25, *** 1/2 out of four), which these days in general — and with this show in particular — is probably unwise.\nWhen WB's cult hit ended in 2007, after one last, unsatisfying season on CW produced without creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and writer Daniel Palladino, most fans feared they'd seen the last of Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Compounding the agony was a predominant — though hardly universal — feeling that the ending was unsatisfactory, a belief that has hardened with time into immutable truth.\nNow the show is back with four 90-minute episodes, each named for one of the seasons, and all of them written by the Palladinos. You get the same stars (for the most part) and the same rapid-fire, pop-culture-infused dialogue, in a more concise package that actually serves the show well. The pace and the arch theatricality of all that chatter could grow exhausting over 22 hours — a problem clearly lessened when you only have to listen for six.\nBrevity, however, is not the only advantage Girls has this time around. It benefits from having been gone long enough for many of us to miss it. And it returns, in all its dreamy, slightly loopy, generally optimistic lightness, at a time when many of us could use an escape, and TV could undoubtedly use a break from the grim, violent, conspiracy-laden dramas that currently dominate the landscape.\nGilmore Girls (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix)\nOnce again, you’re following the Gilmores and their extended family — led by Lorelai’s on-again/off-again lover Luke (Scott Patterson) and her mother Emily (the always fabulous Kelly Bishop) — as they talk their way around the tourist trap that is Stars Hollow. Time has passed, and relationships have changed, but there’s nothing or no one fans won’t recognize and newcomers won’t be able to figure out.\nNot everyone was able to return, of course: the late Edward Herrmann is much missed, though his character, Richard, remains a heartwarming presence. A few other actors are either under- or overused: You get much less of Melissa McCarthy’s Sookie than most would like, and much more of Sean Gunn’s Kirk than some will like. But overall, the balance feels about right.\nAs always, Gilmore is not without its frustrations, which means that those who always found the constant babble and the flights of fancy unbearably twee will continue to do so. There are plots that just peter out, abruptly change course, or get lost in some eye-roll-inducing diversion. Even the combined gifts of Christian Borle and Sutton Foster can't quite excuse a musical sequence that defies belief and owes far too much to Christopher Guest's parody Waiting for Guffman and Borle’s own Something Rotten .\nYet for every misstep, there’s a moment from Graham or Bledel that makes you laugh or breaks your heart, or that cuts through the cuteness to ring absolutely true. And even at its most exasperating (as with those infamous “final four words”), there is so much talent and charm on display, you’re likely to be in a forgiving mood.\nSo welcome back, Girls . Here's hoping the wait for the next last episode is a shorter one.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Images from 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock November 16, 2016 | 08:09AM PT \nNetflix is in talks to acquire global rights to “ The Outsider ,” an action-crime drama with Jared Leto , Variety has learned. \nThe deal has yet to close, but if it does, it would represent another showy acquisition for the streaming giant as it moves aggressively into the film space. Netflix already turned heads with acclaimed films such as “Beasts of No Nation” and the Ava DuVernay documentary “13th.” It has lined up projects with the likes of Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and David Ayer. Related Netflix Beats Q3 Earnings Forecast, Shares Soar on International Sub Growth \n“The Outsider” follows a U.S. army deserter who joins the Yakuza while living in post-World War II Japan. Leto, who won an Oscar for “Dallas Buyers Club,” is the big draw, but the cast also includes Rory Cochrane (“Black Mass”) and Tadanobu Asano (“Thor”). It is directed by Martin Zandvliet, whose previous film “Land of Mine” world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2015, where it was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics. Andrew Baldwin (“The Take”) wrote the screenplay. Filming is taking place in Tokyo. \nLeto appeared in last summer’s “Suicide Squad” and will next appear in “Blade Runner 2049” opposite Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. \nBloom is handling the sale of “The Outsider” and put the project together. It was sold out of AFM . Filed Under:",

      "text": "Apple Eyes Original Content, But Looks to Avoid Expensive Bidding Wars With Netflix and Amazon Wednesday November 16, 2016 8:27 am PST by Joe Rossignol Apple has shown a willingness to buy projects that can help promote its services, but its interest in acquiring original content remains tepid, according to The Information . The report claims Apple is not interested in getting into billion-dollar bidding wars over projects with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon. Getty Images Apple bought an unscripted TV series based on James Corden's highly popular \"Carpool Karaoke\" segment to promote Apple Music , for example, while it is also planning an original TV series called Vital Signs , described as a dark semi-autobiographical drama starring Beats co-founder and Apple executive Dr. Dre. Meanwhile, Apple reportedly met with representatives for comedian Chris Rock earlier this year about a potential video deal, although the discussions did not lead anywhere and Rock ultimately signed a reported $40 million deal with Netflix to deliver two stand-up specials airing in 2017. Apple's lack of original content is seen as a disadvantage for Apple, potentially hurting its efforts to expand the Apple TV 's market share. Not having a slate of originals hurts Apple’s ability to differentiate its video-streaming offerings against rivals like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon, each of which now make their own shows that get them lots of attention, while also licensing reruns from TV networks. That could stymie Apple’s ability to increase market share for its streaming video device, the Apple TV, and lock more people into the Apple ecosystem. Apple has sent mixed signals to Hollywood about its interest in original programming over the past few years, the report adds. Apple has reportedly met with TV producers and Hollywood studios about developing original TV shows to offer exclusively on iTunes, but services chief Eddy Cue later said Apple is \" not in the business of trying to create TV shows .\" Instead, he said Apple is willing to offer producers suggestions and guidance where possible. Independent of its original content efforts, Apple has reportedly been getting more aggressive at landing movies for iTunes. The company was reportedly in discussions with the producers of the Michael Moore documentary \"TrumpLand\" very early in the process, for example, to secure an iTunes exclusivity window. Apple got the right to offer “TrumpLand” on iTunes earlier than other online video services, in exchange for prominently promoting it on the iTunes homepage, according to a person involved in the discussions. Having Apple’s promotional commitment is significant enough to help get a movie financed, this person said. Key players in Apple's content discussions are said to be Jimmy Iovine, along with Apple Music executives Larry Jackson and Robert Kondrk.",

      "text": "Published:  36am Updated:  36am Alexis Bledel, left, and Lauren Graham star as Rory and Lorelai in the highly anticipated \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" MUST CREDIT: Saeed Adyani, Netflix Saeed Adyani, Netflix Let’s cut right to the chase, “Gilmore Girls” fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters.\nThe bad news: It’s not perfect. It’s actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag – and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won’t care. Because “Gilmore Girls” is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like “Gilmore Girls,” which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn’t reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the “real” ending. Advertisement Continue reading \nAs someone who has re-watched “Gilmore Girls” more times than I care to admit, hitting “play” on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of “Gilmore Girls” is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI’ll be honest – it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or … any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here’s what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n— \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming “Gilmore” world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory – the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent – she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn’t come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (“I heard. You should become a blacksmith,” Lorelai deadpans), although she’s clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist’s office. She’s not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She’s also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren’t all smooth sailing – even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. Advertisement Continue reading \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai’s father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe’s devastated, but still, she’s Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: “Luke.” Luke: “Yes?” Emily: “That was just my way of saying goodbye.”) And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there’s a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since “Gilmore Girls” went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show’slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory’s best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same – and there’s a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n“Body shaming! Trigger warnings!” Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she’s eating tacos before a full dinner. “War on Christmas!” \n— \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch “Gilmore Girls” and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time – and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it’s all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute “Gilmore Girls” episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. Advertisement Continue reading \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don’t necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow’s typically terrible stage productions, there’s enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can’t get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller’s (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane’s band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat’s the one benefit of a “Gilmore Girls” mini-movie – with extended time and producers’ creative freedom, it’s a veritable buffet of every “Gilmore” experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that’s all the fans really care about, anyway. \n— \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix. \ntv-gilmore-review",

      "text": "Netflix is on the rise as it increases its subscriber base. It launched in France on Monday and is soon rolling out in five other European countries, including Germany. France and Germany are two of the world's biggest TV markets, so investors will be keeping an eye on Netflix's success in Europe. Foreign Markets On Wednesday, the dollar reached its highest level since 2003 against a basket of currencies. Expectations of a fiscal stimulus coupled by strong dollar and surging Treasury yields are likely to adversely affect emerging markets. Foreign investors are offloading shares in the emerging markets. Stocks in export-heavy emerging markets like South Korea and Taiwan have shed over 3% in the past few days.E-commerce business in India is facing a slowdown because of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, which account for roughly 85% of the total currency circulation in the world's fastest-growing economy. Car sales are also set to take a hit as people decide against buying expensive items. The Sensex was down 0.2%. Shanghai was down 0.06% as the yuan hit its lowest mark since 2008 on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.19%, while the Nikkei gained 1.10%. European indexes ended the day in the red. Securities mentioned in this article Ticker",

      "text": "Where the Gilmore girls would hang out in the city \nPeople go to Luke's Diner for reassuring takes on classics like grilled cheese, pie, and coffee, not for foodie creations that look and taste unfamiliar. Most of the viewers who dive into Netflix's \"new\" incarnation of \"Gilmore Girls\" are probably operating from a similar impulse: They want their TV comfort food, and they want it now. \nBreathe a sigh of relief: The \"Gilmore Girls\" we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring. \nThe early sections of the first episode dwell heavily on cameos from returning characters and spend a lot of time recapturing the vibe in the small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, where grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) sighs at freeloaders who want his wifi password, and where the sweetly wayward Kirk (Sean Gunn) is excited about yet another preposterous money-making scheme. But for those who want a retreat from reality in order to spend time in this beautiful little Brigadoon of a town, where a scheme to install a new sewer system is one of the most pressing issues on the local agenda, these \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes will feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night. \nAt times, the fan service threatens to take over the storytelling, and there are signs of the drift that afflicts other Netflix series: Sub-plots that would have gotten a scene or two in the WB version of the show receive extensive and sometimes indulgent amounts of room in the four installments of \"A Year in the Life,\" each of which depicts a season in Stars Hollow. It takes a while for various story threads to kick into gear, but \"Gilmore Girls\" was always more interested in spending time with its eccentric array of characters than in powering through various tightly disciplined plot points. \nThe good news is, despite some structural wobbles, its singular combination of screwball patter, self-aware whimsy and barbed WASP drama remains more or less intact, and 16 years after the show debuted on the WB, \"Gilmore Girls\" continues to owe a great deal of its success to Lauren Graham. \nShe slips back into creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's rat-a-tat dialogue without missing a beat, and her nuanced performance as Lorelai Gilmore supplies the show's beating heart. The \"girls\" in this narrative -- Lorelai, Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) -- can sometimes be monstrously selfish or annoyingly oblivious, and it's not always clear that the show is aware of how grating the Gilmores can be at their most narcissistic or even cruel. \nBut Graham and Bishop in particular are masters of imbuing their evasive characters with layers of pain, yearning and compassion, and Graham's chemistry with Bledel remains charming. For this program to work, the love these women have for each other must remain palpable, and it is, certainly in some scenes near the end that are likely to bring a tear to the eye. \nAs was often the case with the earlier incarnation of the show at its most potent, what gives \"A Year in the Life\" its spine is something thorny and painful. The three Gilmore women are mourning the loss of Emily's husband, Richard, and given his importance to the clan, it's entirely appropriate that the show spends this much time on the fallout from that death. The focus on grief is also a tribute to actor Edward Herrmann, who played the preppy Richard with such versatile bonhomie for so many years. \nA death in any family kicks off a reshuffling of relationships and priorities that can be difficult to navigate in the best of circumstances, and given how prickly Emily and Lorelai's relationship was to begin with, their post-Richard year is often an emotional minefield. But Bishop and Graham play their scenes of conflict and commiseration with such verbally dextrous facility that many of them are simply enthralling. There's one Lorelai speech in the final episode -- which is by far the strongest of the four -- that easily matches Graham's most memorable moments from the previous seven seasons. \nLike Graham and Bishop, Patterson knocks his monologues out of the park. The terse Luke gets fewer big moments, but the way he has always lovingly and exasperatedly held his own with Lorelai has always been one of the show's chief draws. Speaking of other men in the orbits of the Gilmore women, \"A Year in the Life\" might serve as something of a referendum among fans: How much Logan (Matt Czuchry) did anyone really want? That particular subplot tends to go in circles without acquiring much in the way of depth or texture. Czuchry's performance is faultless, but the show goes to that well more than it should have. \n\"Gilmore Girls\" was never in the business of supplying gritty realism -- and hooray for that -- but sometimes its so unrealistic that it intrudes on one's enjoyment of the show. Rory is flailing in her early 30s, and her bank account is apparently on life support too, but during much of \"A Year in the Life,\" she goes on long, expensive flights without worrying too much about the cost. There's also a Rory subplot involving a loopy British character that supplies few comic dividends. \nIn its previous seasons, fans got used to putting up with the show's more tiresome excesses because the good stuff was so often worth waiting for, and that's the case here. \"Gilmore Girls\" distracts viewers with fun, silly tangents (and the supporting cast is uniformly good at supplying those kinds of moments). But there is darkness at the heart of all those layers of eccentricity and surreal flights of fancy, and those tougher elements are as necessary as Sam Phillips' lilting music, the hilarious intensity of Paris (Liza Weil) or the withering put-downs of Lorelai's employee, Michel (Yanic Truesdale). \nThe hard kernel at the core of the series is that Lorelai usually feels rejected by Emily, who never understood her spirited daughter and who reacted badly when she became pregnant at 16 all those years ago. The very proper Emily, in turn, projects her fears on to Lorelai, and both women talk past each other in a lifelong battle to gain control of the family narrative. In this go-round, as she has always done, Rory tries to make peace between her elders as she attempts to carve out a place in the world that is not overly dominated by these two women, neither of whom likes coming out from behind her emotional defenses. \nEverything \"Gilmore Girls\" tries to pack in -- the wit, the whimsy, the pop-culture references, the family conflict, the perfectly calibrated insults, the set pieces that go on a bit too long -- can feel pretty pummeling at a 90-minute running time. The show is sometimes too overstuffed for its own good. \nSo here's a recipe for enjoying this new edition of \"Gilmore Girls\": Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It'll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly. \nIn other words, don't binge on this comfort food. In these difficult and uncertain times, why not make it last? NYC, in your inbox.",

      "text": "Netflix is on the rise as it increases its subscriber base. It launched in France on Monday and is soon rolling out in five other European countries, including Germany. France and Germany are two of the world's biggest TV markets, so investors will be keeping an eye on Netflix's success in Europe. Foreign Markets On Wednesday, the dollar reached its highest level since 2003 against a basket of currencies. Expectations of a fiscal stimulus coupled by strong dollar and surging Treasury yields are likely to adversely affect emerging markets. Foreign investors are offloading shares in the emerging markets. Stocks in export-heavy emerging markets like South Korea and Taiwan have shed over 3% in the past few days.E-commerce business in India is facing a slowdown because of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, which account for roughly 85% of the total currency circulation in the world's fastest-growing economy. Car sales are also set to take a hit as people decide against buying expensive items. The Sensex was down 0.2%. Shanghai was down 0.06% as the yuan hit its lowest mark since 2008 on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.19%, while the Nikkei gained 1.10%. European indexes ended the day in the red. Securities mentioned in this article Ticker",

      "text": "  \nFrench comedian Gad Elmaleh is headed to Netflix with two standup specials — one in French and another in English. The streaming network announced today that it’s ordered two specials from Elmaleh. The first, performed mostly in French, is called Gad Gone Wild . Here’s more from the press release: \nIn Gad Gone Wild, Gad uses personal experiences as a Frenchie in the US to highlight cultural differences with his very singular humor between both countries. Built upon the jokes that made him famous when he started to perform overseas, Gad mixes English, French and Arab and entertains the audience with absurd situations he experienced and still is today in his daily life in the US. \nGad Gone Wild will make its Netflix premiere on Tuesday, January 24th, 2017. The English standup special will hit the streaming network sometime later in the year.",

      "text": "By S. Atkinson an hour ago \nSound the horns for the Gilmore Girls revival , because Netflix are spoiling us. While we're almost at the end of the marathon waiting-game that has been whiling away the time before the hotly-anticipated Netflix revival of the cult classic, Netflix has decided this is the best possible time to lift their review embargo. Amongst the other details that have already been revealed by reviewers is the fact that Emily Gilmore has a big moment in \"Fall.\" Under the headline \"Kelly Bishop is a national treasure,\" TVLine states: \"A fact cemented in \"Fall.\" I'm not going to tease what is arguably the revival's most crowd-pleasing moment — you'll know it when it happens.\" \nThis has me all sorts of intrigued: Emily Gilmore is one of the show's prickliest, but also unusually sympathetic, characters, and I'm exhilarated to hear that she'll get a crowd-pleasing moment — not something you'd necessarily associate with the complex character. On November 14, a TVLine interview was published with Lauren Graham (Lorelai), who confirmed that much of the revival with center on Lorelai and Emily's troubled relationship: “The healing that happens between Lorelai and Emily is such a long time coming... and because Richard’s absence is such a big part of our story, it really meant a lot to me to grow their relationship a little bit.” \nArguably, the significant moment in \"Fall\" is going to finally give us the Lorelai/Emily conversation we've always wanted, something implied in the TVLine interview when Graham suggests her dialogue with Luke is fine but her dialogue with Emily is what's really watchable. Both women have historically been extremely emotionally guarded in two very different ways. Lorelai refused to broadcast how abandoned her mother made her feel and hid her feelings behind a rapidfire series of jokes. Emily Gilmore refused to even engage on the topic at all. But we're coming back to a very different family setting: the revival plans to address actor Edward Herrmann's death by mirroring it onscreen. \nRichard Gilmore is dead, and Lorelai and Emily will be in the middle of grieving him. While both older Gilmore women are very comfortable in their ways, it's hard to imagine how a family death of such significance wouldn't cause a change in the way they relate to each other. After all, it stresses that life's short, and any differences in how two women conduct their lives may not be substantial enough reasons to not enjoy the mother-daughter relationship the pair could be having. \nLater in the TVLine interview, Lauren Graham states \"I think Emily gets Lorelai in a way that feels... like our show, but grown up.\" Given this and the fact that TVLine has revealed that Lorelai and Emily are in therapy , I don't think it's a stretch to assume that this important crowd-pleasing moment will center on Lorelai and Emily breaking new ground in their relationship with each other, whether in a therapist's office or while discussing Richard. \nSo, if you've been more preoccupied with whether Lorelai will work things out with Emily than if Rory would work things out with Jess, it looks like \"Fall\" is going to have you covered. Get ready for a moment that's going to give all of us navigating tricky mother-daughter relationships hope. \nImages: Netflix (3) ",

      "text": "\"Luke Cage\" Makes Big Splash With Netflix Ratings November 16, 2016 | 10:15 AM 0 \nNetflix has managed to corner the streaming video market with a strong slate of original programming over the past couple of years, but the network’s alignment with the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been especially fruitful. According to industry insiders, this fall’s Luke Cage was one of Netflix’s biggest hit series of the year. \nIn a report from Observer , the publication noted that multimedia data collection company Symphony Advanced Media released a newsletter this week saying that Marvel’s Luke Cage was one of Netflix’s top streaming shows. \nWhile Netflix doesn’t unveil official viewer numbers to the public, Symphony’s estimation placed the Hip-Hop focused series ahead of the dark and brooding second season of Daredevil. If this is all to be believed, Harlem’s hooded hero will likely make a return to the small screen as there is already a third season for Daredevil in the works. \nSymphony said that Luke Cage had a stronger opening week than Making A Murderer and Netflix’s ode to 80s sci-fi and horror films, Stranger Things — although both of those shows surged after the hype machine caught up with them. Observer also reports that Orange Is The New Black and Fuller House led the Netflix ratings pack in 2016. Symphony gets its data by paying subscribers to grant them access to their mobile phone’s microphones and captures TV sounds, which is how it tabulates its ratings system. \nEssentially speaking, out of the slate of Marvel shows, Luke Cage has performed better than both seasons of Daredevil and the cerebral Jessica Jones series. Marvel’s Iron Fist series makes its debut next March.  ",

      "text": "By jessica rawden 23 minutes ago \nThe Killing ended its run on Netflix a couple of years ago, now, but it's clear that the subscription streaming service liked working with some of the show's cas t. This week, we learned Netflix has signed on a couple of former stars from The Killing to star in an upcoming new drama series. The book-based TV show called Altered Carbon will star Kristin Lehman and Joel Kinnaman , both alums of The Killing . \nNews broke this week that Lehman had joined Altered Carbon , a new sci fi series set in the 25th century. The basic premise of the drama follows an interstellar warrior who has apparently been in jail for 500 years. Apparently, he's then tasked with solving a murder, although Deadlin e says the murder will be trickier than usual, because in the 25th century, murders and even death will almost never occur. Joel Kinnaman is signed on to play the interstellar warrior, Takeshi Kovacs. Kristin Lehman is signed on to play another character named Miriam Bancroft, who only happens to be 250 years of age. \nWith all of these long-living individuals, the future is sounding pretty sweet. Miriam Bancroft will reportedly be married to a dude who is 500 years-old and who be played by The Following 's James Purefoy. Having not read the book, it's unclear how Takeshi and Miriam's stories will intertwine, but I do know three books have been produced in the series so far, so Altered Carbon could have some longevity to its story should Netflix want it. \nI expect the futuristic premise may turn off some viewers, but this cast should not turn anyone away. Quite the opposite in fact. Beyond the two actors from The Killing , Shutter Island producer Laeta Kalogridis is also writing and executive producing the project, which is also pretty exciting and Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik is directing the first episode, so it's pretty clear that Netflix has high hopes for Altered Carbon . Since Netflix doesn't half-ass pick-ups, the project is already going to series and 10 episodes will be produced for Season 1 of the drama. \nNetflix has been putting out all kinds of original programming for more than a year now. Some of these are bigger budget crowd pleasers, but the streaming service has also been championing smaller niche TV projects, too. I'm excited to see how Altered Carbon will pan out and whether or not it will be a winner for Netflix, which is not known for cancelling shows , much less during the first couple of seasons. \nWhile we wait for Altered Carbon to premiere, you can take a look at what is heading to the subscription streaming service in 2017 with our Netflix TV premiere schedule.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena).

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video] Wednesday Nov 16, 2016 at 12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]  30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom.

      "text": "Review Roundup: Netflix's GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE November 16  by TV News Desk \nNetflix's highly anticipated streaming event, GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE premieres Friday, November 25th! The four, 90-minute movies, are bringing your favorite Stars Hollow residents back together - Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), Luke Danes (Scott Patterson), Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and many more. Sutton Foster will also make a guest appearance. Picking up life nine years after the originAl Gilmore Girls signed off the air. Amy Sherman-Palladino is the creator and executive producer. Daniel Palladino is also an executive producer. They are both writing and directing the series. Gilmore Girls (WT) on Netflix is produced byDorothy Parker Drank Here Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Let's see what the critics have to say about the television event thus far: \nMichael Ausiello, TV Line : Save for the aforementioned, somewhat bloated Stars Hollow: The Musicalinterlude in the third chapter, \"Summer,\" series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and executive producer Daniel Palladino have given this grateful, longtime fan the satisfying conclusion he's been waiting nearly a decade for. \nJeff Jensen, EW : Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears - and in one hilarious passage, expresses in the form of an actual musical. It provides a welcome dose of hilarious and humane escapism that satisfies like a nostalgia trip even while subverting it. It tells a story about grief and change, rootlessness and restlessness. The show is basically a reboot about the struggle of rebooting. \nMaureen Ryan, Variety : Everything \"Gilmore Girls\" tries to pack in - the wit, the whimsy, the pop-culture references, THE FAMILY conflict, the perfectly calibrated insults, the set pieces that go on a bit too long - can feel pretty pummeling at a 90-minute running time. The show is sometimes too overstuffed for its own good.",

      "text": "Disney may be getting ready to acquire Netflix, adding to their already expansive multimedia empire. From Collider :\n... Bob Iger is getting ready to retire as Disney CEO in 2018, and a possible candidate could be Netflix’s CEO, Reed Hastings . Netflix and Disney are already in bed together with The Defenders series (a string of original series from Marvel), as well as getting the first run at a TV release for all live-action and animated films from Disney , beginning with this year’s slate. ( Zootopia is already streaming on the platform.)\nNetflix is already the standard-bearer among streaming video services. This deal would widen their lead.\n... one possible scenario could mean the entire Disney library — including shows on Disney Channel and Disney XD — could end up exclusively on Netflix. If that happens, they’d be even harder to beat. These seems like a scary prospect from a competing business’ standpoint.\nBut great for consumers. Added value is never a bad thing.\nIt's amazing to consider how radically content distribution has changed in the past few years. It wasn't that long ago that Netflix streaming was considered a side-benefit to their disc rental subscription. That has completely flipped, and streaming has become a primary distribution method.\nIt's nice to see a player like Disney embrace that and adjust their business model accordingly. Competitors may fear the implications. But that's a good thing. It will drive them to up their game and find their own ways to add value.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/16/is-the-disney-empire-getting-ready-to-take-over-netflix/",

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]   12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "Shares 0 Steven Avery \nEarlier this week, fans of Netflix documentary “Making a Murderer” rejoiced when Judge William Duffin of the Eastern District of Wisconsin ordered that Brendan Dassey, the alleged accomplice in the 1995 murder of Teresa Halbach, be freed from prison . Judge Duffin’s latest order follows his decision in August to overturn Dassey’s conviction , citing the misconduct of the then-teenager’s trial attorney as “indefensible.” Dassey’s legal team hopes he’ll be “home by Thanksgiving, if not sooner.” \nCompletely lost in the media whirlwind surrounding the latest developments in the Dassey case was the fact that almost a decade after he was convicted of first-degree murder, “Making a Murderer” subject Steven Avery made major strides in his attempts to prove his innocence this weekend, thanks to the relentless efforts of his attorney, noted wrongful conviction advocate Kathleen Zellner . \nIn August, Zellner filed a motion to retest key pieces of evidence in Avery’s case using the latest forensic testing available. Here are some additional details from Uproxx : \nIncluded in [Zellner’s] request for new testing was the spare RAV4 jeep key found in Avery’s mobile home, various components of the RAV4 itself including the hood latch that had Avery’s DNA on it, and purple underwear recovered in the Avery scrap yard. All previously collected swabs from the trial are also being asked for. That includes the infamous RAV4 blood that Avery’s lawyers said came from a vial of blood already in law enforcement’s possession. \nGiven this tweet from Zellner, it appears as though she’s finally reached an agreement with the prosecution as to the scope of the testing that will occur on the evidence: Agreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery. #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 12, 2016 \nBut when will the world find what evidence was agreed upon and which forensic methods will be used for its testing? Not quite yet. Zellner’s filing was held up by the decision that Dassey be freed. Here’s a subsequent Tweet from Avery’s lawyer: Our testing order slowed down bc of pending Dassey release but that's okay with us. It will be entered soon. #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 14, 2016 \nNo matter when the order is filed, Zellner is confident that her client is “completely and totally innocent of the murder of Teresa Halbach.” Considering she so firmly believes that her client’s conviction will be thrown out, it’s just a matter of time until she’s able to make that statement affirmatively outside of claims offered in court documents.",

      "text": "Netflix Circling Jared Leto Crime Thriller 'The Outsider' (EXCLUSIVE) Updated: November 16, 2016 — 12:53 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Brent Lang \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Netflix is in talks to acquire global rights to \"The Outsider,\" an action-crime drama with Jared Leto, Variety has learned. \nThe deal has yet to close, but if it does, it would represent another showy acquisition for the streaming giant as it moves aggressively into the film space. Netflix already turned heads with acclaimed films such as \"Beasts of No Nation\" and the Ava DuVernay documentary \"13th.\" It has lined up projects with the likes of Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and David Ayer. \nRelated Netflix Beats Q3 Earnings Forecast, Shares Soar on International Sub Growth \n\"The Outsider\" follows a U.S. army deserter who joins the Yakuza while living in post-World War II Japan. Leto, who won an Oscar for \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" is the big draw, but the cast also includes Rory Cochrane (\"Black Mass\") and Tadanobu Asano (\"Thor\"). It is directed by Martin Zandvliet, whose previous film \"Land of Mine\" world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2015, where it was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics. \"Land of Mine\" is Denmark's submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film \nAndrew Baldwin (\"The Take\") wrote the screenplay for \"The Outsider.\" Filming is taking place in Tokyo. \nLeto appeared in last summer's \"Suicide Squad\" and will next appear in \"Blade Runner 2049\" opposite Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. \nBloom is handling the sale of \"The Outsider\" and put the project together. It was sold out of AFM.

      "text": "Review: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' on Netflix Updated: November 16, 2016 — 11:28 AM EST Share Reuters \nBy Maureen Ryan \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - People go to Luke's Diner for reassuring takes on classics like grilled cheese, pie, and coffee, not for foodie creations that look and taste unfamiliar. Most of the viewers who dive into Netflix's \"new\" incarnation of \"Gilmore Girls\" are probably operating from a similar impulse: They want their TV comfort food, and they want it now. \nBreathe a sigh of relief: The \"Gilmore Girls\" we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring. \nThe early sections of the first episode dwell heavily on cameos from returning characters and spend a lot of time recapturing the vibe in the small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, where grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) sighs at freeloaders who want his wifi password, and where the sweetly wayward Kirk (Sean Gunn) is excited about yet another preposterous money-making scheme. But for those who want a retreat from reality in order to spend time in this beautiful little Brigadoon of a town, where a scheme to install a new sewer system is one of the most pressing issues on the local agenda, these \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes will feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night. \nAt times, the fan service threatens to take over the storytelling, and there are signs of the drift that afflicts other Netflix series: Sub-plots that would have gotten a scene or two in the WB version of the show receive extensive and sometimes indulgent amounts of room in the four installments of \"A Year in the Life,\" each of which depicts a season in Stars Hollow. It takes a while for various story threads to kick into gear, but \"Gilmore Girls\" was always more interested in spending time with its eccentric array of characters than in powering through various tightly disciplined plot points. \nThe good news is, despite some structural wobbles, its singular combination of screwball patter, self-aware whimsy and barbed WASP drama remains more or less intact, and 16 years after the show debuted on the WB, \"Gilmore Girls\" continues to owe a great deal of its success to Lauren Graham. She slips back into creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's rat-a-tat dialog without missing a beat, and her nuanced performance as Lorelai Gilmore supplies the show's beating heart. The \"girls\" in this narrative -- Lorelai, Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) -- can sometimes be monstrously selfish or annoyingly oblivious, and it's not always clear that the show is aware of how grating the Gilmores can be at their most narcissistic or even cruel. \nBut Graham and Bishop in particular are masters of imbuing their evasive characters with layers of pain, yearning and compassion, and Graham's chemistry with Bledel remains charming. For this program to work, the love these women have for each other must remain palpable, and it is, certainly in some scenes near the end that are likely to bring a tear to the eye. \nAs was often the case with the earlier incarnation of the show at its most potent, what gives \"A Year in the Life\" its spine is something thorny and painful. The three Gilmore women are mourning the loss of Emily's husband, Richard, and given his importance to the clan, it's entirely appropriate that the show spends this much time on the fallout from that death. The focus on grief is also a tribute to actor Edward Herrmann, who played the preppy Richard with such versatile bonhomie for so many years. \nA death in any family kicks off a reshuffling of relationships and priorities that can be difficult to navigate in the best of circumstances, and given how prickly Emily and Lorelai's relationship was to begin with, their post-Richard year is often an emotional minefield. But Bishop and Graham play their scenes of conflict and commiseration with such verbally dextrous facility that many of them are simply enthralling. There's one Lorelai speech in the final episode -- which is by far the strongest of the four -- that easily matches Graham's most memorable moments from the previous seven seasons. \nLike Graham and Bishop, Patterson knocks his monologs out of the park. The terse Luke gets fewer big moments, but the way he has always lovingly and exasperatedly held his own with Lorelai has always been one of the show's chief draws. Speaking of other men in the orbits of the Gilmore women, \"A Year in the Life\" might serve as something of a referendum among fans: How much Logan (Matt Czuchry) did anyone really want? That particular subplot tends to go in circles without acquiring much in the way of depth or texture. Czuchry's performance is faultless, but the show goes to that well more than it should have. \n\"Gilmore Girls\" was never in the business of supplying gritty realism -- and hooray for that -- but sometimes its so unrealistic that it intrudes on one's enjoyment of the show. Rory is flailing in her early 30s, and her bank account is apparently on life support too, but during much of \"A Year in the Life,\" she goes on long, expensive flights without worrying too much about the cost. There's also a Rory subplot involving a loopy British character that supplies few comic dividends. \nIn its previous seasons, fans got used to putting up with the show's more tiresome excesses because the good stuff was so often worth waiting for, and that's the case here. \"Gilmore Girls\" distracts viewers with fun, silly tangents (and the supporting cast is uniformly good at supplying those kinds of moments). But there is darkness at the heart of all those layers of eccentricity and surreal flights of fancy, and those tougher elements are as necessary as Sam Phillips' lilting music, the hilarious intensity of Paris (Liza Weil) or the withering put-downs of Lorelai's employee, Michel (Yanic Truesdale). \nThe hard kernel at the core of the series is that Lorelai usually feels rejected by Emily, who never understood her spirited daughter and who reacted badly when she became pregnant at 16 all those years ago. The very proper Emily, in turn, projects her fears on to Lorelai, and both women talk past each other in a lifelong battle to gain control of the family narrative. In this go-round, as she has always done, Rory tries to make peace between her elders as she attempts to carve out a place in the world that is not overly dominated by these two women, neither of whom likes coming out from behind her emotional defenses. \nEverything \"Gilmore Girls\" tries to pack in -- the wit, the whimsy, the pop-culture references, the family conflict, the perfectly calibrated insults, the set pieces that go on a bit too long -- can feel pretty pummeling at a 90-minute running time. The show is sometimes too overstuffed for its own good. \nSo here's a recipe for enjoying this new edition of \"Gilmore Girls\": Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It'll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly. \nIn other words, don't binge on this comfort food. In these difficult and uncertain times, why not make it last?

      "text": "Netflix, NHK Partnership on 'Trial' Updated: November 16, 2016 — 3:51 AM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Mark Schilling \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - TOKYO -- Netflix and Japan's public broadcaster NHK are partnering on a four-part historical drama to be broadcast next month. \nNHK will broadcast \"Tokyo Trials\" about the post-WWII court hearings of Japanese war criminals, on its terrestrial channel, while Netflix will stream it abroad. Then, after the NHK On-Demand VoD service has aired the series for a period, Netflix will also offer it to users in Japan. \nBoth companies contributed to the production costs, with NHK concluding co-production deals with L.A.- and Toronto-based Don Carmody Television and Amsterdam-based FATT Productions. Pieter Verhoeff and Rob King are the drama's co-directors. \nAfter launching in Japan in the fall of 2015, Netflix has made shows with Japanese with broadcaster Fuji TV, talent agency Yoshimoto Kogyo, and ad agency Dentsu. For NHK, however, this sort of production and broadcast arrangement with Netflix is a first.

      "text": "Review: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' on Netflix Updated: November 16, 2016 — 3:02 AM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Maureen Ryan \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - People go to Luke's Diner for reassuring takes on classics like grilled cheese, pie, and coffee, not for foodie creations that look and taste unfamiliar. Most of the viewers who dive into Netflix's \"new\" incarnation of \"Gilmore Girls\" are probably operating from a similar impulse: They want their TV comfort food, and they want it now. \nBreathe a sigh of relief: The \"Gilmore Girls\" we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring. \nThe early sections of the first episode dwell heavily on cameos from returning characters and spend a lot of time recapturing the vibe in the small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, where grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) sighs at freeloaders who want his wifi password, and where the sweetly wayward Kirk (Sean Gunn) is excited about yet another preposterous money-making scheme. But for those who want a retreat from reality in order to spend time in this beautiful little Brigadoon of a town, where a scheme to install a new sewer system is one of the most pressing issues on the local agenda, these \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes will feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night. \nAt times, the fan service threatens to take over the storytelling, and there are signs of the drift that afflicts other Netflix series: Sub-plots that would have gotten a scene or two in the WB version of the show receive extensive and sometimes indulgent amounts of room in the four installments of \"A Year in the Life,\" each of which depicts a season in Stars Hollow. It takes a while for various story threads to kick into gear, but \"Gilmore Girls\" was always more interested in spending time with its eccentric array of characters than in powering through various tightly disciplined plot points. \nThe good news is, despite some structural wobbles, its singular combination of screwball patter, self-aware whimsy and barbed WASP drama remains more or less intact, and 16 years after the show debuted on the WB, \"Gilmore Girls\" continues to owe a great deal of its success to Lauren Graham. She slips back into creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's rat-a-tat dialogue without missing a beat, and her nuanced performance as Lorelai Gilmore supplies the show's beating heart. The \"girls\" in this narrative -- Lorelai, Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) -- can sometimes be monstrously selfish or annoyingly oblivious, and it's not always clear that the show is aware of how grating the Gilmores can be at their most narcissistic or even cruel. \nBut Graham and Bishop in particular are masters of imbuing their evasive characters with layers of pain, yearning and compassion, and Graham's chemistry with Bledel remains charming. For this program to work, the love these women have for each other must remain palpable, and it is, certainly in some scenes near the end that are likely to bring a tear to the eye. \nAs was often the case with the earlier incarnation of the show at its most potent, what gives \"A Year in the Life\" its spine is something thorny and painful. The three Gilmore women are mourning the loss of Emily's husband, Richard, and given his importance to the clan, it's entirely appropriate that the show spends this much time on the fallout from that death. The focus on grief is also a tribute to actor Edward Herrmann, who played the preppy Richard with such versatile bonhomie for so many years. \nA death in any family kicks off a reshuffling of relationships and priorities that can be difficult to navigate in the best of circumstances, and given how prickly Emily and Lorelai's relationship was to begin with, their post-Richard year is often an emotional minefield. But Bishop and Graham play their scenes of conflict and commiseration with such verbally dextrous facility that many of them are simply enthralling. There's one Lorelai speech in the final episode -- which is by far the strongest of the four -- that easily matches Graham's most memorable moments from the previous seven seasons. \nLike Graham and Bishop, Patterson knocks his monologues out of the park. The terse Luke gets fewer big moments, but the way he has always lovingly and exasperatedly held his own with Lorelai has always been one of the show's chief draws. Speaking of other men in the orbits of the Gilmore women, \"A Year in the Life\" might serve as something of a referendum among fans: How much Logan (Matt Czuchry) did anyone really want? That particular subplot tends to go in circles without acquiring much in the way of depth or texture. Czuchry's performance is faultless, but the show goes to that well more than it should have. \n\"Gilmore Girls\" was never in the business of supplying gritty realism -- and hooray for that -- but sometimes its so unrealistic that it intrudes on one's enjoyment of the show. Rory is flailing in her early 30s, and her bank account is apparently on life support too, but during much of \"A Year in the Life,\" she goes on long, expensive flights without worrying too much about the cost. There's also a Rory subplot involving a loopy British character that supplies few comic dividends. \nIn its previous seasons, fans got used to putting up with the show's more tiresome excesses because the good stuff was so often worth waiting for, and that's the case here. \"Gilmore Girls\" distracts viewers with fun, silly tangents (and the supporting cast is uniformly good at supplying those kinds of moments). But there is darkness at the heart of all those layers of eccentricity and surreal flights of fancy, and those tougher elements are as necessary as Sam Phillips' lilting music, the hilarious intensity of Paris (Liza Weil) or the withering put-downs of Lorelai's employee, Michel (Yanic Truesdale). \nThe hard kernel at the core of the series is that Lorelai usually feels rejected by Emily, who never understood her spirited daughter and who reacted badly when she became pregnant at 16 all those years ago. The very proper Emily, in turn, projects her fears on to Lorelai, and both women talk past each other in a lifelong battle to gain control of the family narrative. In this go-round, as she has always done, Rory tries to make peace between her elders as she attempts to carve out a place in the world that is not overly dominated by these two women, neither of whom likes coming out from behind her emotional defenses. \nEverything \"Gilmore Girls\" tries to pack in -- the wit, the whimsy, the pop-culture references, the family conflict, the perfectly calibrated insults, the set pieces that go on a bit too long -- can feel pretty pummeling at a 90-minute running time. The show is sometimes too overstuffed for its own good. \nSo here's a recipe for enjoying this new edition of \"Gilmore Girls\": Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It'll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly. \nIn other words, don't binge on this comfort food. In these difficult and uncertain times, why not make it last?

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]   12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

Dassey is pictured on the left, being led from Wisconsin court on March 3, 2006. He's pictured on the right in his 2006 police interview \nAvery was sentenced to life without parole for killing 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach on October 31, 2005, alongside his nephew Dassey, then 16, who at the time had a mental age of nine, and was interrogated by police without an adult present. \nAt the time of his arrest, Avery was suing Manitowoc County for $36 million over being wrongfully imprisoned after facing 18 years for sexually assaulting Penny Beersten. \nDassey had his original conviction quashed by Judge Duffin in August, who said investigators tricked him into a confession, but that ruling is being appealed by the State. \nAccording to Attwood, supporters have been thinking it's a 'foregone conclusion' that Avery will be set free because his lawyer Kathleen Zellner is demanding the court uses new forensic DNA testing methods, which she says will prove that Avery's blood had been planted in Halbach's Toyota RAV4 car - and is actually older than the vehicle itself. \nHigh profile Chicago-lawyer Zellner has headed up Avery's legal team since Making A Murderer became a global Netflix sensation. \nShe specializes in wrongful convictions and, so far, has a 100 per cent success record, exonerating 18 innocent people. \nShe says that new evidence will not only clear Avery, but promises to reveal the identity of the real killer. \nYet, 47-year-old Attwood says that Wisconsin state prosecutors - led by Attorney General Brad Schimel - will do anything to keep Avery locked up and are armed with tens of millions to fight a 'dirty' legal battle. \nFamily confidant and prison campaigner Shaun Attwood says that prosecutors will 'cling tighter' to Avery's conviction, saying they 'still have their man' even if Dassey was not an accomplice \nAvery, pictured above with an unidentified friend, was sentenced to life without parole for killing 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach on October 31, 2005 \nAttwood has written a book on the case called Un-making A Murderer: The Framing of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey, which gave him access to the Avery and Dassey families, as well as in-depth case details. \nHe says that the State is desperate not to lose face, money, and avoid possible corruption charges. \nHe adds: 'It is bad for Steven because the State will now cling tighter to his conviction on the basis that if Brendan hadn't helped kill Teresa, they still have their man. \n'After Brendan's release, Schimel will pull every dirty trick he knows to keep Steven inside, so that the corruption involved in framing both of them - that goes right to the top of the Wisconsin justice system - will never be exposed. \nTheresa Halbach (pictured) was killed on Halloween 2005, after she visited the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan \n'We're talking tens of millions in taxpayers money prosecuting these guys, it's going to be a dirty battle, that State will fight it tooth and nail. Expect it to take a long time, it could take five years [before Avery is released]. \n'But Zellner has filed the most comprehensive testing motion ever in the state of Wisconsin. Science has advanced since the conviction, so the testing should bring new facts to light such as the date of the blood in the RAV4. \n'Why would the state have to focus resources on keeping him in prison? To prevent the same situation as the first wrongful conviction, i.e. paying out compensation. \n'If the Avery case opens the floodgates, how many more lawsuits could come about from other inmates suing the Wisconsin State for phoney DNA results? It could run into the hundreds of millions. \n'These prosecutors and governors run on being tough on crime and adhering at all costs to saying that these guys are guilty, that's why the resources of the entire state of Wisconsin is stacked up against Steven and Brendan.' \nAttwood says that the plea bargaining between the lawyers and the State will be starting now behind-the-scenes - and could even involve Dassey saying Avery is guilty. \nAtwood, who served six years in prison for dealing ecstasy while making millions on the stock market. He has been around the world advocating for the release of Dassey and Avery \nDassey will not be allowed to contact his co-defendant and uncle Steven Avery (pictured left in a recent jail picture, and on the right in a 1985 mugshot) \nHe says: 'They'd want Brendan to say Steven did it, which the family would be dead set against. If a prosecutor knows that Brendan is going to be let out anyway, then they will just want to sign a deal, which at least keeps one of them in there for as long as possible. \n'This would be a legal agreement where Brendan signs something saying that I'm getting released, but I can't testify on Steven's behalf. This could be enough to keep Steven in.' \nThe news of of the Dassey's release order has been greeted with delight by his supporters, including his aunt Carla Chase, who wrote on Facebook: 'I want to thank everyone personally for all the continued support & fighting with us for months… \n'The support that everyone has given has been awesome & we greatly appreciate everything. We consider you our extended family & we will try to keep you updated with the latest news coming in.' \nHis mother, Barb Tadych, admitted to the Daily Mail that he is a 'little bit of scared of going into the outside world' and the family will be 'starting from zero'. \nThey are desperate for donations as he will be released penniless and with no clothes. \nFamily friend Wendy Davis begged Making a Murderer fans to donate to the GoFundMe page set up by Barb to help her son - and also fund a dream trip to Wrestlemania, which he watched every year while he was in prison. \nShe says: 'He has nothing, he will need clothes, shoes, a bedroom set, toiletries, hopefully some things to keep him busy and much, much more. \n'So if you're able, please consider donating to him so he can have what he wants and needs, he definitely deserves it. \n'He will get to see Wrestlemania, get to spend the holidays with his loved ones, he will finally have the freedom he deserves and that was stolen from him.' \nDassey has written letters to his supporters thanking them for following his story and donating to his cause THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS SIGN PETITIONS FOR BRENDAN DASSEY'S AND STEVEN AVERY'S RELEASE \nPetitions for the release of Brendan Dassey and Steven Avery have over 750,000 signatures \nMaking a Murderer was a global hit in more than 190 countries, and many viewers believe that Avery and Dassey are innocent. \nThere are two main petitions - on change.org and one direct to the White House - that have so far had more than 535,770 and 129,950 signatures respectively, asking for Steven Avery to be pardoned. \nThere's a separate one for Brendan Dassey to be set free, which is now up to more than 93,000 signatures. \nDassey's mother Barbara Tadych has set up her own petition for a new Wisconsin State Law made under her own name, which means that no one will suffer the same fate as Dassey, who was interrogated without any adult present. \nThe petition has garnered the support of more than 11,330 people, as she asks: 'Brendan's case highlights the need for the enactment of legislation which would require that an attorney be present during a custodial interrogation of a minor. \n'Require that an attorney be present during any custodial interrogation of a minor. This should be viewed as a non-waivable right. \n'Require law enforcement to inform a minor before an interrogation begins that he or she could be charged as an adult based on information obtained during an interrogation.' \nBut is it so far fetched that Dassey could turn on his uncle - or, at the very least, fail to testify on his behalf? Family relations between the Averys and Dasseys have been tense for the best part of a decade. \nThere's long been a suspicion that certain family members are just jumping on the publicity bandwagon, with Steven's former fiancé Sandra Greenman calling them 'vultures'. \nGreenman says: 'Lots of vultures in the family. This is what Steve does with his hands [she then rubs her thumb and forefinger], he says: \"They all want this.\" \n'His mom and dad stood by him when he was at the other correctional facility Boscobel, which is a three-hour drive, and I was there all the time. Now they're coming in droves, they all go'. \nAvery admits that he doesn't have anyone on the outside he can trust to look after a release fund for when he gets out of jail. \nAccording to his best friend Curtis Busse, all donations from fans are being directed to his lawyer Kathleen Zellner for her legal costs. \nThe hotshot attorney is otherwise working 'pro bono', which means for free as it's in the public interest. \nBusse adds: 'Donations to Zellner will be for his legal fees, not for a release fund. As of now he has no money for his life outside of prison. \n'This was his request because he can't trust anyone to hold a go fund me page for him, he trusts me but I would never be involved in any of his money due to drama.' \nWhen Making a Murderer was first aired on Netflix in December last year, the family set up the AveryDassey Fund, which accepts PayPal and Bitcoin. \nAt the bottom of the website, it states, vaguely, why the fund is necessary. \nThe site says: 'The amount of investigation and defense it will take to untangle this web of manipulation, beyond comprehension twisting of facts and tainted testimony will be like that never undertaken if we expect fair results and representation.' \nDassey has been in jail since March 2006. He's pictured above being led to the Manitowoc County Courthouse on April 16, 2007 \nBut some supporters have demanded to know where their money has gone if Avery isn't receiving a penny from the fund. \nAmber Schaefer says: 'Where has all the donated money from previous go fund me pages go? I'm glad I didn't donate before because I would be pissed if my hard earned money goes to others to steal. \nTera Bock Hardisty adds: 'I have wondered the same thing, somebody said there was over $30,000, my question is the same. Where is it, did somebody take it from the guys. When will the injustice end for them?' \nAttwood has made his intentions clear when writing his book. \nHe knows the prison system very well after serving six years - two in Maricopa County jail system, in Arizona, which has been dubbed America's most dangerous prison and nicknamed 'Tent City Jail' - for dealing ecstasy while making millions on the stock market. \nHe says reading 1000 books in prison saved his life and now donates books for school children. He says he'll be splitting the proceeds for his new book between this and Steven Avery's legal fees. \nWhen Avery does eventually get released, Attwood believes, he just wants a simple life 'with a good woman'. \nAttwood wrote Un-making A Murderer: The Framing of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey, which gave him unfettered access to the family \nAvery has already gone through two fiancées while in prison, the last being Las Vegas blonde Lynn Hartman, who professed her love on Dr Phil, before being dumped the next day after being branded a 'gold digger'. \nAttwood says it's only Avery's supporters that have stopped him from going 'insane'. \nHe says: 'I served just under six years and I'd been institutionalized, my mom said I was like a puppy dog following her around waiting for orders. \n'Now he's on 27, 28 years of incarceration. If he was on the brink of going insane, the level of worldwide support has pulled him from the brink, and bolstering his spirit right now. \n'What I've seen of Steven, his needs are quite simple - he just wants to be around his family members and have a good woman in his life. \n'It was that about him that made everyone warm to him so much. I think the people who articulate the political aspect will herald him and his particular case, and he will be involved to an extent, but I think the family stuff will be his priority.' \nClose friend Busse - Avery is the godfather to his daughter Jordan - told his followers on the 'Steven Avery Project' Facebook group that the sequel to Making A Murderer 2 promises to be a thriller, with lawyer Zellner sitting on undisclosed evidence which will destroy the prosecution. \nBusse, who regularly visits Avery at Waupun Correctional Institute, Wisconsin, posted: 'Here is some more good news not very often discussed since Kathleen Zellner submitted her brief, she has only provided a handful of evidentiary aspects to this case. \n'Wait until you see the amazing abundance of evidence she really has that proves the whole crime scene was staged. \n'We are really super duper excited for the world to see this abundance of evidence and then in time Zellner will use this case as \"Text Book on What Not To Do\" for publicly elected officials in office and police department. \n'All this evidence will also be in the new MAM2 series everyone is excited to see. By the release of that we would hope both boys are home with their families, enjoying the very freedoms they were both robbed of.' \nHe then added that Avery hasn't even seen the original Making A Murderer, the very show that has made him so famous. WHAT IS 'MAKING A MURDERER'? Brandon Dassey's murder case was explored in the hit Netflix show \nMaking A Murderer was a Netflix crime documentary that aired in December 2015 and transfixed millions \nMaking A Murderer was a Netflix crime documentary that aired in December 2015 and transfixed millions. \nArmchair detectives binge-watched as they followed the fortunes of two convicted killers Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. \nThe show told how one man, Steven Avery, spent 18 years in jail for a rape he did not commit, only to be arrested along with his nephew Brendan Dassey for a still more terrible crime - just weeks after he filed a wrongful imprisonment case against police and prosecutors. \nIn perhaps the most shocking scene, viewers of the show had seen footage of officers pressuring Dassey, who has a mental age of nine, into a making a 'confession'. \nThe boy was also shown being bullied and manipulated by his own defense team. \nAvery was the first to be charged with the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old who was last seen heading to take pictures of a vehicle at Avery's yard for a car magazine. \nThe story is told through police interrogations, recorded prison phone calls, interviews with family and lawyers and courtroom footage. There is no narrator. \nWhile police were convinced that they had the right man - Halbach's burned remains had been found in a fire pit on Avery's property, and her car keys were discovered inside his mobile home - many believed he had, yet again, been framed. \nAvery's blood was found inside Halbach's car, but then a vial of his blood from the previous case was found to have been tampered with. \nThe box in which it had been stored had the taped lid removed and a tiny needle mark was found in the top of the vial, suggesting blood could have been removed via a syringe and 'planted' at the murder scene. \nManitowoc police officers, who at the time were in the middle of being deposed in his wrongful imprisonment lawsuit, had been involved in gathering evidence in the murder case, and defense lawyers insisted they might have planted evidence to frame him. \nIt was, however, the 'confession' by Avery’s then 16-year-old nephew Dassey which proved the most damning. \nThe youngster who was 'deeply impressionable', confessed that he raped Halbach and saw his uncle shoot her dead. \nHe also admitted helping dismember and burn the body. \nDassey immediately recanted his confession, but it was too late. \nHe was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault, and mutilation of a corpse. Avery was tried and convicted separately. \nIn a letter written after his 2007 conviction, Dassey said: 'The investigators tormented me until I said what they wanted me to say. \n'The investigators got into my head saying that if I confessed they would let me go, but when I did they locked me up. They tricked me. I was afraid of them back then.' \nHe called the trial a 'witch hunt' and added: 'The prosecutors don’t care what they do. They just want a conviction.'",

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]   12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "Netflix Really Wants You to Watch the Gilmore Girls Revival With Your Mom Suggests making it a 'date night' By Sami Main November 16, 2016, 1:34 PM EST Television What's better than watching TV with your mom? Netflix The next time you sit down to watch TV, you might want to call your mom and ask her to join you. A new study from Netflix shows that 62 percent of mothers and daughters think watching TV shows together helps them build stronger relationships. The study was released ahead of the upcoming revival of Gilmore Girls, a show about three generations of women and how different their relationships are with one another. Along with the study, Netflix released a new campaign called \"Date Night With Mom,\" which aims to remind people that moms are great, but that watching Gilmore Girls with your mom is even better. Watch below, as a familiar face from Stars Hollow joins in the fun of planning a mother-daughter night in: According to Netflix, which partnered with SurveyMonkey to reach over 10,000 women around the world, about 53 percent of women wished they spoke with their moms more often. Additionally, 59 percent agreed that the postshow discussions are \"the best part of sharing a show together.\" The thinking was that with the release of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life just nine days away, it's the perfect time to start planning a \"date night with mom.\" The survey also found that one-third of women live 30 or more minutes away from their mothers or daughters, but that they'd make a special trip to watch something together, in person. If you're ready to plan that kind of girls' night in, Netflix also has you covered with these GIFs based on the various mother-daughter relationships in the series: Are you and your mom like Lane and Mrs. Kim? Apparently, 31 percent of those surveyed think they're \"polar opposites\" from their moms but ultimately want what's best for one another. How about Lorelai and Emily? Thirty percent of people in the study have complicated relationships but \"can't imagine life without each other.\" Of course, the dream is to be Rory and Lorelai, which is what 39 percent of women in the survey thought their relationships were like—two peas in a pod. The revival episodes will be released on Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving, so start planning those dates now before all the PopTarts are gone from stores.

Check out the video below! \nVariety also spoke to Tony Award winning composer Jeanine Tesori (FUN HOME) about her new original music written for the project. \n\"I got to know Amy and Dan through Sutton. They came on board as producers of \"Violet\" when we moved from City Center to Broadway, and then we were looking for a project to do together,\" explains Tesori. \"There were certain things that didn't work. And then out of the blue I got a call, and Amy said, \"Can I send you some pages? We're doing a musical inside the show,\" and I thought, \"Hell, yeah.\" \nRead the article in full HERE",

      "text": "Cyberattack on Twitter, Netflix, and more may have come from webcams The U.S. government must demand that all internet-connected devices have built-in security, according to experts who warned Congress that the country could soon face a disastrous, lethal cyberattack. The hearing, held Wednesday by members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, examined how millions of infected internet-connected devices took down parts of the internet on October 21. \nThis kind of internet superweapon -- essentially an army of 1.5 million infected gadgets -- could be aimed at hospitals or critical government agencies. And it's possible because manufacturers are making devices that are easy to hack and control remotely. \nExperts blame poor practices by low-end manufacturers making devices like internet-accessible baby monitors, cameras and thermostats. \n\"I fear for the day every hospital system is down,\" Kevin Fu, who teaches computer security at the University of Michigan, told the hearing. \"This will require some kind of governmental mandate.\" \nAsking for regulation is a rare move for cybersecurity experts. They usually want fewer government rules, which tend to stifle innovation. But the panel of experts on Wednesday said this time it's different. \n\"We're not going to be laughing when the lights go out,\" Fu said. \nRelated: 'Preliminary' evidence shows that internet cyberattack not carried out by a government \nAn estimated 6 billion devices are currently connected to the internet. That number is expected to reach 20 billion by 2020. \nBut low-end manufacturers currently have little incentive to spend the extra money to make products secure , experts say. Instead, they're focused on churning out computer code and assembling parts on the cheap. As a result, they're plagued with problems like default passwords that give hackers remote access. \n\"The market can't fix this. The buyer and seller don't care. Government has to get involved... What we need are some good regulations,\" said Bruce Schneier, one of the world's leading computer security experts. \nBruce Schneier, a top cybersecurity expert, warns members of Congress that regulations are needed to make internet-connected devices more secure. \nRelated: Defenseless internet 'paying the price' for ignoring security \nFu suggested a national cybersecurity testing facility, akin to an automotive crash safety testing lab. Schneier suggested a new federal agency that demands secure internet-connected gadgets. \nThey acknowledged that U.S. regulations won't force a Chinese device maker to improve its standards. But they pointed out that companies don't write two versions of computer code, so they're more likely to do it right the first time around in order to access the American market. \nCongresswoman Anna Georges Eshoo, a Democrat from California, said it was unlikely a Trump administration would be willing to act on these ideas. \n\"New agencies? New regulations? They're dead in the water,\" she said. \nSchneier pointed out that the Bush administration created the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of the September 11 attacks. He said the same has to happen for cybersecurity before a crisis occurs and the public wonders why \"1,000 people just died.\" \n\"I'm not a regulatory fan. But this is the world of dangerous things,\" Schneier said. \"The choice is not between government involvement and no government involvement. It's between smart government involvement versus stupid government involvement.\" \n 49 PM ET",

      "text": "“Luke Cage” Ratings Beat “Daredevil” By   10:42 am \nThough Netflix refuses to reveal ratings figures, various data gathering firms have been able to come up with some rough measuring statistics that work fairly well in terms of determining what’s been a hit or not (though Netflix disputes this). \nOne such company is Symphony Advanced Media who reported today “Marvel’s Luke Cage” has been the comic book company’s biggest streaming hit this year, outperforming the second season of “Daredevil”. \nSymphony estimates that in the 32 days following the release of the series, 6.34% of video viewers aged 18-49 were watching “Luke Cage” in an average minute. In comparison, “Daredevil” Season 2 was pulling in a 5.94% audience by the same metric. \n“Luke Cage” reportedly beat out Netflix’s “Making A Murderer” and “Stranger Things” in its first week, but the drop-off was quicker so that by the 32 day mark the other two shows got 9.1% and 9.8% scores respectively. \nThe next Marvel show to stream on Netflix is “Iron Fist” which premieres March 17th.",

      "text": "Where is Lane's dad? Why don't Lorelai and Rory ever pay for their food? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival coming to Netflix. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\nLet’s cut right to the chase, “Gilmore Girls” fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Conn. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters.\nThe bad news: It’s not perfect. It’s actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag — and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating.\nThe best news: Fans won’t care. Because “Gilmore Girls” is back.\n[ ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival: How a TV reboot goes from idea to reality ]\nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like “Gilmore Girls,” which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn’t reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season , which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the “real” ending.\nAs \"Gilmore Girls\" heads to Netflix for a reboot, here are a few things you can expect in the show's return. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) As someone who has re-watched “Gilmore Girls” more times than I care to admit, hitting “play” on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of “Gilmore Girls” is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series?\nI’ll be honest — it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or . . . any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements.\nBut here’s what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right.\n***\nEmily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) with Lorelai and Rory. (Robert Voets/Netflix)\nLuke (Scott Patterson) laying down the law at his diner. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) Viewers get swept back into the all-consuming “Gilmore” world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year.\nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory — the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent — she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign.\nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series, it doesn’t come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (“I heard. You should become a blacksmith,” Lorelai deadpans), although she’s clearly terrified about her future.\n[ ‘Gilmore Girls’ on Netflix: A refresher (and rating) on each season ]\nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist’s office. She’s not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She’s also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren’t all smooth sailing — even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss .\nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai’s father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago . In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years.\nShe's devastated, but still, she’s Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: “Luke.” Luke: “Yes?” Emily: “That was just my way of saying goodbye.”) And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there’s a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016.\nIn the years since “Gilmore Girls” went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show’s lack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory’s best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same — and there’s a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture.\n“Body shaming!

Many young women re-watch “Gilmore Girls” and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time — and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying.\nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter.

Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute “Gilmore Girls” episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting.\nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don’t necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow’s typically terrible stage productions, there’s enough time to stretch it out for much longer.\nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can’t get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller’s (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane’s band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris.\nThat’s the one benefit of a “Gilmore Girls” mini-movie — with extended time and producers’ creative freedom, it’s a veritable buffet of every “Gilmore” experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that’s all the fans really care about, anyway.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (four episodes) begins streaming Friday, Nov. 25, on Netflix.",

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]   11:30 AM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video]   12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "title": "Review Roundup: Netflix’s Gilmore Girls Revival",
      "text": "Your faves are back. Photo: Neil Jacobs/Netflix \nNetflix's seasons-spanning Gilmore Girls revival, A Year in the Life , couldn't be arriving at a better time. Right now, throughout the country, there's an insatiable craving for a feel-good binge — one quick getaway to a small hamlet like Stars Hollow, seemingly untouched by the political dystopia crippling its surroundings. That may not have been the revival's intention, but it's the lens through which it'll now be viewed in the coming weeks and months. But as Vulture's own Jen Chaney notes in her review , reboots, like any past revisited, are \"a warm, inviting, but tricky and slippery thing.\" Is it too much to ask of (probable Hillary voters) Lorelai and Rory Gilmore to give weary fans a respite in their world? Was it equally too much to hope for Netflix and Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino to preserve the original show's charm? \nThe reviews are in and, for as imperfect as the show has turned out to be — tedious subplots, awkward pacing, and the Netflix binge model are especially called into question — the consensus seems to be: Hey, things are plenty worse outside. Consider A Year in the Life your nourishing Thanksgiving meal, if a bit undercooked and tough to chew. Here's what the critics are saying:\n\"There’s a song about Stars Hollow in A Year in the Life that runs through a list of all the terrible things in the world, from “anything by Jeff Koons” to Vladimir Putin. Its lyrics then proceed to conclude that this Connecticut town is one of the globe’s few saving graces. 'What’s there not to love about the town of Stars Hollow?' the song asks, in what is both a sincere question and, perhaps, a swipe at the place’s provincialism. While watching Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , you may find yourself asking the same thing, and you may conclude that there is still plenty to love. But you also may find yourself looking more critically at this Main Street, U.S.A., and more easily spotting some of the flaws that co-exist alongside its charms.\" — Jen Chaney, Vulture \n\"The early sections of the first episode dwell heavily on cameos from returning characters and spend a lot of time recapturing the vibe in the small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, where grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) sighs at freeloaders who want his wifi password, and where the sweetly wayward Kirk (Sean Gunn) is excited about yet another preposterous money-making scheme. But for those who want a retreat from reality in order to spend time in this beautiful little Brigadoon of a town, where a scheme to install a new sewer system is one of the most pressing issues on the local agenda, these Gilmore Girls episodes will feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night.\" — Maureen Ryan, Variety \n\"Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears — and in one hilarious passage, expresses in the form of an actual musical. It provides a welcome dose of hilarious and humane escapism that satisfies like a nostalgia trip even while subverting it. It tells a story about grief and change, rootlessness and restlessness. The show is basically a reboot about the struggle of rebooting.\" — Jeff Jensen, Entertainment Weekly \n\"Although it's plagued with structural problems and a questionable relationship to the passage of time, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is better than the season that fans were previously stuck with and Netflix was wise to send all four installments to critics, because the fourth episode is easily the strongest as Sherman-Palladino is able to dispense with wheel-spinning and steer the series to the emotional landing she always intended.\" — Daniel Fienberg, The Hollywood Reporter \n\"Creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino lamented having too much story for the four-part series—well, there are moments that went on for far too long and felt completely unnecessary, like the Stars Hollow musical and reappearance of a few characters. Not everything is perfect. However, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has come along at just the right time. It's comforting and familiar, with enough resolution to satisfy and enough open-ended questions to make revisiting Stars Hollow absolutely necessary, sooner rather than later.\" — Chris Harnick, E! \n\n\"If it’s a mess, it’s a periodically glorious one, and every time things have ground to too much of a halt so we can find out whatever happened to one of Lorelai’s neighbors, or catch up with Rory’s many terrible ex-boyfriends, the show will suddenly roar to life with a delightful piece of banter, or a tableau that warmly evokes a classic moment from the series, or entire story threads that are so assured and quintessentially Gilmore Girls that they create the illusion that the series has been secretly in production for all these years, and this is simply the first footage in a long while that the Palladinos have allowed us to see.\" — Alan Sepinwall, Uproxx \n\"As always, Gilmore is not without its frustrations, which means that those who always found the constant babble and the flights of fancy unbearably twee will continue to do so. There are plots that just peter out, abruptly change course, or get lost in some eye-roll-inducing diversion. Even the combined gifts of Christian Borle and Sutton Foster can't quite excuse a musical sequence that defies belief and owes far too much to Christopher Guest's parody Waiting for Guffman and Borle’s own Something Rotten . Yet for every misstep, there’s a moment from Graham or Bledel that makes you laugh or breaks your heart, or that cuts through the cuteness to ring absolutely true. And even at its most exasperating (as with those infamous “final four words”), there is so much talent and charm on display, you’re likely to be in a forgiving mood. \" — Robert Blanco, USA Today \n\"This revival isn’t afraid to go dark and get real when it needs to, and that emotional honesty underlines why we love Gilmore Girls in the first place. That said, GG: A Year in the Life is a hell of a lot of fun, too. Nearly every fan-favorite character from the original series reappears to give us an update on their lives. (I’m happy to report that we see plenty of Paris Geller.) And they’re joined by an array of delightful guest stars, who I wouldn’t dream of revealing here. We get to see Stars Hollow again in all its eccentric glory, and even learn things we never knew about the town. (Like, that it has… a secret bar?!) And the tone throughout is patient and laid-back; this revival truly feels like a continuation of the original series, rather than a rehash.\" — Dave Nemetz, TV Line \n\" The bad news: It’s not perfect. It’s actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag — and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating. The best news: Fans won’t care. Because 'Gilmore Girls' is back.\" — Emily Yahr, The Washington Post",

      "text": "Gilmore Girls : Milo Ventimiglia Defends Jess Next Up   \nNetflix's Gilmore Girls revival drops Nov. 25, and early, spoiler-free reviews started rolling in on Wednesday. The four 90-minute episodes reunite creator Amy Sherman-Palladino with her beloved town of Stars Hollow, and are a much more fitting send-off to the series than 2007's Sherman-Palladino-less seventh season. \nThe critical consensus on Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life so far is that it's kind of messy but mostly very good, and the flaws don't overshadow how pleasant it is to have Gilmore Girls back and true to its legacy of quality. \nThere have been an exhausting number of reboots and revivals on television in the last few years, and most of them were superfluous, but all reviewers agree (with relief) that Gilmore Girls feels like it has a reason to exist. \nThe Gilmore Girls revival isn't just for fans of the original series \n\"It's the first reunion project in a long time to not make me regret the existence of it,\" writes Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall , who has problems with A Year In the Life 's timeline, noting that the way time passes on the show is confusing and imprecise. \nThe Hollywood Reporter 's Daniel Fienberg has the same issue, writing: \"Time has passed in the world of the show, but you can tell Sherman-Palladino wishes it hadn't. It's better if you pretend that Rory is still in her mid-20s, that you assume that each and every character dynamic is intact and consistent, that you don't dwell on which pop culture references are current and which have been in Sherman-Palladino's back pocket for years. (And, time-wise, don't get me started on asking viewers to pretend that Paul Anka, the Gilmore dog, is both the same dog-character and the same dog-actor as when we left off. That's probably the nadir of the miniseries' chrono-denying.)\" \nOther critics don't like the third episode's musical number, which USA Today 's Robert Bianco says \"defies belief.\" \nBut, as the Washington Post 's Emily Yahr puts it, none of the flaws should matter much to fans, \"because Gilmore Girls is back.\" \nVariety 's Maureen Ryan writes: \"The Gilmore Girls we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring.\" \nAll critics have praised the revival's writing. \"Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears,\" writes Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen . \nAdds TVLine's Michael Ausiello : \"The quip-per-minute ratio hits an all-time high in the revival. \nIt must be noted that Ausiello is a Gilmore Girls superfan with a cameo in A Year In the Life. His review is glowing, and his only criticism is that the musical is about two minutes too long. He praises Lauren Graham in particular, writing that she \"turns in the performance of her career.\" \nAll in all, it sounds like Gilmore Girls fans can rest assured that settling in to watch the revival will be like sitting down with an old friend over coffee. \nTVGuide.com's review of Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life is coming later this week. \nGilmore Girls: A Year In the Life arrives on Netflix Friday, Nov. 25.",

      "text": "The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is far from perfect, but luckily for Netflix, fans won't care [video] Wednesday Nov 16, 2016 at 12:30 PM Emily Yahr - The Washington Post \nLet's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag - and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nAs great as Netflix’s original live-action series are, they tend to overshadow the streaming giant’s excellent original animated shows. Thankfully that trend is starting to change as the company embraces new and emerging voices in the world of animation. (Hey, you know who also gets overlooked? Australians! Amirite?) So it’s with that in mind that we happily bring you the exclusive first trailer for their new original animated comedy series, Pacific Heat ! \nFrom Santo Cilauro , Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch , the creative and hilarious minds of the award-winning Working Dog team, Pacific Heat follows “an unconventional, covert unit of police investigators fighting crime along the glitzy ‘Gold Coast’ of Australia.” For those of you who are familiar with Archer , Pacific Heat feels like it’s cast in that same mold, providing a Down Under companion to that long-running super spy comedy cartoon. And honestly, who doesn’t love Australian accents? It’s worth a watch for that alone! \nCheck out the first trailer for Pacific Heat below, followed by the show’s official synopsis and some images of the colorful cast of characters: \nPacific Heat is an animated comedy series, based on the exploits of a dynamic unit of undercover police investigators working on the glitzy “Gold Coast” of Australia. This glamorous, sophisticated, and sun-drenched paradise masks a hot-bed of crime; everyone from drug smugglers and biker gangs to eco-terrorists and the person who invented frozen yogurt. In order to tackle this seedy underbelly police authorities established “Pacific Heat.” This covert squad of highly trained operatives technically does not exist (although they do have their own Facebook page), but when criminals strike, “Pacific Heat” will be there; unconventional, uncompromising and unafraid to operate outside the law – provided at least one of them is wearing a fluorescent safety vest. Pacific Heat was created by the award-winning Working Dog team of Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch. \nKeep an eye out for Pacific Heat on Netflix in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. / Ireland starting December 2nd!

      "text": "Gilmore Girls cast refuse to call the Netflix revival ‘an ending’ sparking hope for fans exclusive Rebecca Lewis for Metro.co.uk Wednesday 16 Nov 2016 3:28 pm Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in Gilmore Girls (Picture: Netflix) \nLauren Graham has admitted that the feeling of ‘unfinished business’ made it easier to return to her iconic role as Lorelai Gilmore in the upcoming Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls. Gilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel were left shocked after discovering the show’s biggest secret \nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk during the recent press tour, Lauren revealed: ‘[Gilmore Girls] was some of the best material I have ever had in my life and I missed it and I wanted it again.’ \nGilmore Girls was the hit drama which aired between 2000 and 2007 and followed the trials and tribulations of a mother and daughter in the small town of Stars Hollow. \nKnown for low stakes drama, in a world of TV where every show is about – as Lauren puts it –‘vampire killer policemen fireman’, the return of Gilmore Girls is also a return to TV drama which focuses on the small connections between families and friends and neighbours. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \n‘It’s not a message show, it was never going to hit you over the head,’ says Lauren, who recently called the show ‘sneakily feminist’. \n‘I loved that it wasn’t a show about women taking on the world in an overt way.’ \nGilmore Girls doesn’t fit into the current TV mould but as Lauren adds, ‘one of the reasons we are here is because it doesn’t fit, it didn’t fit back then’. \nShe added: ‘I watched the pilot and I was really struck by the fact that nothing happens for most of it, for a long time it’s just entertaining.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nBoth Lauren and her co-star and on-screen daughter Alexis Bledel refuse to call the conclusion to the revival – which consists of four 90-minute episodes named after each of the four seasons – an ending, although both admit that it is authentic to the show. \n‘To me the conclusion was definitely a surprise,’ said Alexis. \n‘But it’s the sort of conclusion only Amy could design so hopefully fans will love it because it will be authentic.’ A photo posted by Rebecca Lewis (@bexlewis) on Nov 10, 2016 at 5:06am PST \nGilmore Girls: A Year In The Life airs on Netflix on November 25.

France and Germany are two of the world's biggest TV markets, so investors will be keeping an eye on Netflix's success in Europe. Foreign Markets On Wednesday, the dollar reached its highest level since 2003 against a basket of currencies. Expectations of a fiscal stimulus coupled by strong dollar and surging Treasury yields are likely to adversely affect emerging markets. Foreign investors are offloading shares in the emerging markets. Stocks in export-heavy emerging markets like South Korea and Taiwan have shed over 3% in the past few days.E-commerce business in India is facing a slowdown because of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, which account for roughly 85% of the total currency circulation in the world's fastest-growing economy. Car sales are also set to take a hit as people decide against buying expensive items. The Sensex was down 0.2%. Shanghai was down 0.06% as the yuan hit its lowest mark since 2008 on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.19%, while the Nikkei gained 1.10%. European indexes ended the day in the red. Securities mentioned in this article Ticker",

      "text": "View this image ›\nMacey J. Foronda for BuzzFeed\nID: 9990146 The final episode of Netflix’s The Crown includes a chilling nod to Princess Diana’s death. Four cars filled with paparazzi chase Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her betrothed, Captain Peter Townsend (Ben Miles), down a twisty English road. As his driver swerves, a photographer leans out the window, trying desperately to get a clear shot of the princess. Margaret peers from the backseat window, half posing and half alarmed. As the camera’s flashbulb pops, an oncoming car appears over the hill and the paparazzi veer to avoid a collision. “Woo!” the photographer yells excitedly. Margaret settles back into her seat, no longer posing and looking full-on alarmed.\n“[Show creator] Peter Morgan really wanted the prefiguring of Diana — because that’s what Margaret actually was like,” Vanessa Kirby told BuzzFeed News earlier this month, talking fast and tucking a piece of bright blonde hair behind one ear. “Throughout the whole series, she’s the one you see on the front page of the newspaper the most. She was this fashion icon, this leader of women’s inspiration, and she loved the public.”\nView this image ›\nNetflix\nID: 9990494 That was the early 1950s. Fast forward to earlier this month, and Kirby’s star is on its own self-styled rise. She announced that she had signed with talent powerhouse WME the day before The Crown premiered, priming her to become the show’s breakout star. At the start of the interview at BuzzFeed HQ in Los Angeles, Kirby — wearing a perfectly pressed above-the-knee navy blue dress and killer black strappy heels — went right in for a kiss on both cheeks. “Hello, darling. Aren’t you gorgeous?”\nBut just because the 28-year-old Brit was disarmingly charming didn’t mean she was feeling entirely comfortable. After a couple test pictures with the photographer, she scrapped the navy dress. “I don’t want it to be too stuffy. That’s so not me.” Kirby whipped off the killer heels, pulled on some tattered black jeans, and did the shoot barefoot. “This is more me,” she said, gamely hopping up on a stool and bemoaning the state of her exposed feet. She tended toward a serious gaze in front of the camera — by The Crown ’s standards, she was much more Elizabeth than Margaret in that moment. “Someone make her laugh,” the photographer said, and the pout broke into genuine laughter before anyone could even try. “It doesn’t take much!” she tittered, and she was all Margaret again.\nView this image ›\nNetflix\nID: 9990496 The younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II (Claire Foy), Margaret is the historic drama series’ most tragic figure. She’s denied the man she loves and the limelight she craves, and she struggles with her own sense of self in light of her sister’s position. “Next to you,” she tells Elizabeth on the show, “I’ll always be evil.”\nThat toxic mentality was all too easy for Kirby to slip into herself. “Even on set sometimes I was like, ‘Claire, you’re so amazing and wonderful and I’m the shit one!’” she laughed. “It never was about playing the evil sister versus the saintly one, although that’s what Margaret thinks in her head and that’s certainly what I began to think all the time.”\nIn the spotlight, Margaret’s a gorgeous, perfectly manicured peacock — dancing, singing, smoking her cigarette with long, languid hand movements. But the moment she’s alone, that confidence crumbles in on itself; her posture folds, her hands fumble to clutch her lighter, she becomes — as she proclaims to her sister in the final episode — “unhinged.”\nKirby inhabits that frenetic, attention-seeking energy with deft control. She wanted to avoid making Margaret into a caricature, a Bad Royal or Partying Princess — archetypes we’ve become increasingly fascinated by as a culture. “There was a risk of making her sort of arch,” she said. “I never want to make any characters one-dimensional, especially as women can often be portrayed as the dark one or the evil one.”\nView this image ›\nMacey J. Foronda for BuzzFeed\nID: 9990471 It’s easy to imagine how much happier Margaret might have been in the day and age of relatable celebrities and social media. Throughout the series, she pushes to make the Royal Family more relatable and human — something that rings true to our modern, social media–fueled definition of “celebrity.” Margaret tells an aghast Winston Churchill (John Lithgow), “What people want is someone to inhabit [the Crown], not be frightened of it — make it flesh and blood, bring it to life.”\nKirby just can’t get into social media. “I’m really apathetic towards it,” she said. “Celebrities nowadays have Instagram and everything’s available and accessible and digestible for people that want it. People demand it.” Kirby’s own Instagram account currently features only 31 posts, and her Twitter was set up only after people started creating fake accounts under her name. “I feel uncomfortable about it; I’d always much rather be private,” she said. “I think I’d probably be more on the side of Elizabeth in that sense, even though I’m 100% Team Margaret.”\nFor now, Kirby’s used to relative anonymity in Hollywood, having had only small roles in bigger films thus far — About Time , Me Before You , Jupiter Ascending. But via her take as Margaret, she’s now thrust into the public eye more firmly than ever before, whether she realizes it yet or not. “I didn’t think about it like that, actually, weirdly,” she laughed. “When [ The Crown ] came out, my head nearly exploded because I just couldn’t comprehend that anybody other than my mum would see it.”\nView this image ›\nNetflix\nID: 9990500 Prior to The Crown , the majority of Kirby’s acting experience came from the theater world, which is likely why she described working with the tight-knit cast and the dramatic script as what felt like being in a theater troupe. She’s also had a penchant for playing other overshadowed sisters, on London’s stages: In 2012 she completed a turn as Masha in Three Sisters , and just this past summer she played Stella opposite Gillian Anderson’s Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire . “Family relationships are just so fascinating — how they shape you as a person, how you can wound each other, how you’re imprinted in a way by your family and the conditions under which you grow up.”\nThat lack of accessibility and extreme insulation perhaps explains the draw to England’s royal family (and other celebrities who live low-key): We feel compelled to fill in the blanks to our satisfaction. “You don’t really know about their private lives, and yet they became these amazing, mysterious global icons,” Kirby said. “If their lives were all out there, you wouldn’t really want to see another biopic of someone you know everything about anyway — like if the Queen was posting [to social media] what she has for tea. But there’s something unbelievably fascinating about seeing what she and Philip talk about before they go to bed.”\nThat common interest in personal privacy might be what gives Kirby — or any actor — career longevity. That being said, Kirby would still love to get a look at Margaret’s Instagram. “It would be a lot more fun than mine, I’ll tell you that.”\nView this image ›\nMacey J.

      "text": "\nThe downside of bingeing on the new Netflix series The Crown is that it is now just about a year until you can feed your Queen Elizabeth addiction.But season two is already shooting around the United Kingdom, so you can be assured that more episodes are on their way, with the intense Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth, and the smug Matt Smith as the brooding Prince Philip.\nBut don’t get too attached to Foy and Smith, because season two will reportedly be their last in the roles of the queen and the prince, says the Inquisitr . It is understandable that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip will have to age, and Foy and Smith can only be aged so much with make-up and wigs. So far, nobody has been tapped to take over the roles from Foy and Smith, but stay tuned.\nTrunk and disorderly. pic.twitter.com/KcUK2l0JoW \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 16, 2016 \n\nThe first season of The Crown on Netflix spanned eight years over ten episodes, and it started with Princess Elizabeth marrying Philip Mountbatten, and ran through the retirement of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the break-up of Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend. As Netflix has admitted that the series will be wrapped up in six seasons, it is expected that nearly a decade will be covered in each season, give or take a few years.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ And ‘Downton Abbey’ Have A Connection Netflix ‘The Crown’ Is Portraying Prince Philip As A Bit Of A Jerk So, taking a look at history, there are a few things that fans can expect from season two of The Crown, and Queen Elizabeth has a pretty full plate. Winston Churchill might have lasted through more than one royal, but don’t be too optimistic about his successors. Season two will see three of them, Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home.\n“Eden was faring poorly in public opinion polls throughout much of 1956, but the Suez Crisis (more on that below) was the final straw, not to mention Eden’s own poor health. He resigned at the beginning of 1957, and was succeeded by fellow conservative Macmillan, who was in turn succeeded by Douglas-Home seven years later.”\nIt is even possible that in season two, fans might see a fourth in Harold Wilson.\nShowcasing stunning landscapes, new #Netflix series The Crown will make you fall in love with Scotland: https://t.co/dTNtSX2dlc pic.twitter.com/C3vVOdpHw2 \n— Culture Trip (@CultureTrip) November 16, 2016 \n\nAnd Anthony Eden won’t just be retiring calmly in old age like Churchill, he will be the one to take the fall for the debacle that is the Suez Crisis. Great Britain invade Egypt, along with Israel and France with the goal of regaining Western control of the Suez Canal (which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea). The United Nations, along with the United States pressured the forces to retreat, and it was regarded as a huge embarrassment, and led to the resignation of Eden.\nAnother big story for season two which will captivate viewers (especially if the casting is spot on) is the birth of the Beatles, and Beatlemania. The royals were said to be huge Beatles fans, and with Prince Charles being a teenager in season two, he will fall under their spell (as will his aunt, Princess Margaret). In 1963, the Beatles performed for the Queen Mum and Princess Margaret at the Royal Variety Show in London and had a meet-and-greet with the Queen Mum afterwards. John Lennon allegedly called out to the audience during the performance.\n“On this next number I want you all to join in. Would those in the cheap seats clap their hands—the rest of you can rattle your jewelry.”\nNetflix filming The Crown largely in the UK https://t.co/1lszqCa11f pic.twitter.com/R6wdqrt6Uh \n— KFTV.com (@KFTV) November 16, 2016 \n\nSeason two will also bring a government-linked sex scandal and a royal wedding, so drama will never be in short supply.\nAre you hooked on The Crown? What was your favorite part so far?\n[Featured Image by Netflix/Youtube]\nNetflix ‘The Crown’ Season 2 Spoilers And Predictions is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "\nIn what would be another major coup for the online streaming giant, Netflix has entered negotiations to acquire global rights to The Outsider , a post-World War II thriller headlined by Jared Leto.\nWord comes by way of Variety, confirming that talks are already underway between Netflix and the studio. Nothing is set in stone just yet, of course, but The Outsider could be the latest addition to a roster that already boasts Beasts of No Nation and, soon, David Ayer’s Bright and buzzworthy documentary, The 13th .\nSet during the fallout of WWII, The Outsider centers on Leto’s army deserter, who breaks course from US forces to enlist in the Yakuza while hiding out in Japan. Rory Cochrane ( Black Mass ) and Tadanobu Asano ( Thor ) are also attached, with the film’s official logline teeing up a story of PTSD and self-discovery that involves “an imprisoned American soldier who is released with the help of his yakuza cellmate. Now free, he sets out to earn their respect and repay his debt while navigating the dangerous criminal underworld.”\nMartin Zandvliet has been appointed at the helm and will direct from a script penned by Andrew Baldwin. Shooting is already underway in Tokyo, so if Netflix really is to acquire The Outsider , we should catch wind of a global release date sooner rather than later.\nAs for Jared Leto, the Oscar-winner is coming off a fairly divisive turn as the Clown Prince of Crime in this year’s Suicide Squad , and will soon share the screen with Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford for Blade Runner 2049 .\n",

      "text": "Why Netflix Stock Is Tanking By Diane Alter , Contributing Writer   \nNetflix stock has tanked 6.18% over the last five days, even despite a 1% gain to $114.78 this morning (Wednesday). While some investors have freaked out about the swift drop in the Netflix stock price, we aren't hitting the panic button. \nIn fact, we view the decline as a buying opportunity for Netflix stock. \nBefore we get into our bullish outlook for Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX ), here's a look at what has been weighing on the Netflix stock price . Why Netflix Is Down Despite Strong Growth \nSince Republican candidate Donald Trump's presidential victory on Nov. 8, tech stocks have gotten crushed. In the four days following Trump's win, the tech sector endured its worst performance since the start of the current bull market that began roughly seven years ago. \nBefore the election, tech stocks in the S&P 500 Index were up 11% year to date. Since the election, they have shed 1.8%. Tech stocks (the largest group in the S&P 500 Index) dropped 3.1% over those four days. At the same time, the index climbed 4.2%. \nBearish option activity tracking S&P 500 tech stocks has also picked up. The number of puts on the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE Arca: XLF ) that traded Monday was the highest in at least five years, according to Trade Alert data. \nThe key concern among investors is that Trump's contentious trade and immigration policies will mean lower earnings for these multinational tech firms. \nPlus, immigration is a big component in how tech companies attract and hold talent. \nInvestors have also been turning to the infrastructure and financial industries in the wake of the election. That could mean money leaving tech stocks. Trump has pledged to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. And interest rates are expected to rise over the next several months, which will help banks. \nThere are also worries about Trump's opposition to AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE: T ) deal to buy Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX ) and how it will impact the media space. Trump said that mergers like Comcast Corp.'s (Nasdaq: CMCSA ) with NBCUniversal \"destroy democracy.\" \nBut Trump has also criticized regulations that he believes don't result in concrete economic benefits. \nThat could make him receptive to arguments from companies that oppose new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) net neutrality rules. \nAnd that would present a key benefit to internet service providers and Netflix… Netflix Stock Drop Looks Like a Buying Opportunity",

      "text": ". The CW \nWith their season finales set, Frequency and No Tomorrow will become the first two series under the new CW/Netflix deal to head to the streaming network. They will become available on Netflix eight days after their finales air on the CW. So, while neither show’s renewal chances at the CW are great at the moment, if any of them does well on Netflix, that presumably could help it clinch a Season 2 pickup. \nDramedy No Tomorrow was a big priority for the CW, which slotted it behind the network’s top rated series, The Flash , and re-aired the pilot behind the highly rated network premiere of Supergirl . Nevertheless, No Tomorrow has been drawing a 0.3 in adults 18-49 (Live+same day) after a 0.5 for the opener. Similarly, drama Frequency, based on the movie, also has been logging a 0.3 in the demo (L+SD), following a 0.4 for the premiere, with a smaller lead-in from Arrow. \nToday, the CW unveiled its midseason plans. For the schedule and premiere dates, here is our story .",

      "text": "Netflix is on the rise as it increases its subscriber base. It launched in France on Monday and is soon rolling out in five other European countries, including Germany. France and Germany are two of the world's biggest TV markets, so investors will be keeping an eye on Netflix's success in Europe. Foreign Markets On Wednesday, the dollar reached its highest level since 2003 against a basket of currencies. Expectations of a fiscal stimulus coupled by strong dollar and surging Treasury yields are likely to adversely affect emerging markets. Foreign investors are offloading shares in the emerging markets. Stocks in export-heavy emerging markets like South Korea and Taiwan have shed over 3% in the past few days.E-commerce business in India is facing a slowdown because of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, which account for roughly 85% of the total currency circulation in the world's fastest-growing economy. Car sales are also set to take a hit as people decide against buying expensive items. The Sensex was down 0.2%. Shanghai was down 0.06% as the yuan hit its lowest mark since 2008 on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Index dropped 0.19%, while the Nikkei gained 1.10%. European indexes ended the day in the red. Securities mentioned in this article Ticker",

      "text": "\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nWhether you want to play games online or watch Netflix, you need to connect your game system to the Internet. The Xbox One uses Xbox Live, and the PlayStation 4 uses the PlayStation Network to access online services. In both cases, you need to purchase the premium subscription plan (Xbox Live Gold for Xbox Live, PS Plus for PlayStation Network) to play games online. Xbox Live used to require an Xbox Live Gold subscription for media services, but Microsoft has since dropped that requirement and you can now watch Netflix and other streaming media apps without Gold, including television with OneGuide. You can also use any app on the PlayStation 4 without a PS Plus membership, and with the PS4 requiring a premium service for online multiplayer just like the Xbox One, this category comes out to a tie. \nWinner: Tie \nBoth the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 can play Blu-ray movies and access a variety of online services like Netflix and Hulu Plus. The Xbox One goes two extra steps with television integration and Ultra HD Blu-ray playback. An HDMI pass-through lets you run your cable or satellite box through the system, though without a Kinect you'll need a third-party infrared blaster to control it. This incorporates live television through your cable or satellite provider into the Xbox One's menu system. You can also add over-the-air television with a third-party USB tuner. The OneGuide program guide displays both live television and what content is available on services like Hulu Plus and Machinima, giving you total control over what you watch, and you can even enjoy a split screen view of what's on television while you play your favorite game or browse the Web, thanks to the Xbox One's Snap feature. If that isn't enough, the Xbox One S can play Ultra HD Blu-ray discs, which means you can watch 4K HDR movies on physical media. Bizarrely, Sony didn't add this feature to the PS4 Pro. \nWinner: Xbox One S \nThe massive popularity of Let's Plays on YouTube and game streaming on Twitch has brought capturing game footage to the mainstream, so both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 feature built-in capture options. The Kinect let you record clips just by saying \"Xbox, record that,\" and thanks to the latest update you can easily capture what you're playing just by double-tapping the Xbox button on your gamepad and pressing X or Y to save a screenshot or video clip. You can also snap the Game DVR app to the side of the screen to record up to five minutes of footage on demand. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nThe PlayStation 4 goes a step further, however, with a dedicated Share button right on the DualShock 4 controller. At any point you can tap it to save the last 15 minutes of gameplay, grab a screenshot of what you're playing, or start streaming live to PSN or Twitch. The longer capture length and more convenient setup makes the PS4 the better system for recording or streaming your games. \nWinner: PlayStation 4 \nHey, it's a new category! Sony recently launched the Playstation VR , a virtual reality headset designed for both the PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro. We really like it, since it's the least expensive and most comfortable of the big-name tethered VR headsets. The selection of games is also pretty strong for new technology; Rez Infinite is a must-play, revelatory experience in VR (which is amazing when you consider it's an updated version of a 15-year-old game). Rigs: Mechanized Combat League and Battlezone are both very fun, fully developed VR titles where you control big mechanical weapons. And for a standalone expansion that heavily reuses assets, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood is a surprisingly fun and visually stunning horror rail shooter. \nMicrosoft has announced partnerships with several electronics manufacturers to make V R headsets for Windows 10, but it's been silent about VR on the Xbox One. That might change with Scorpio, but for now there are no VR options for the Xbox One. \nWinner: PlayStation 4 \nWhen both consoles first launched, cameras were held up as a major feature, either as a required, included accessory (the Kinect with the Xbox One) or an option (the PlayStation Camera with the PlayStation 4). That didn't pan out, and both Microsoft and Sony have backed off from the idea of using a camera with their systems for gesture and voice control, and integration with certain games. Both the Kinect and PlayStation Camera are nearly forgotten, at least for their original purposes. The PlayStation Camera is necessary if you want to use PlayStation VR, but as a general camera accessory it's as useless as Kinect. \nCategory Retired \nBy the numbers, the Sony PlayStation 4 is our winner. It has a total advantage in virtual reality, and the PS4 Pro means it is a more powerful platform until Microsoft's Scorpio comes out. The Xbox One is still the better system for media features, however, especially with Ultra HD Blu-ray playback on the Xbox One S. \nUltimately, the deciding factors is games. No matter which system is technically the best, make sure it has games you want to play. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com.

The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix. Today's Deals ",

      "text": "Brendan Dassey's case came into the national spotlight in Netflix's popular docuseries \"Making a Murderer.\" Monday a federal judge ordered Dassey... \nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin overturned Dassey’s conviction in August, ruling investigators tricked the then-16-year-old into confessing. Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison then, but said he would stay that request if state attorneys appealed. The state Department of Justice asked the 7th Circuit to restore Dassey’s conviction, a request that’s pending. \nBut Dassey’s attorneys asked Duffin in September to release Dassey from prison while that appeal is weighed. Duffin granted the request Monday, rejecting the state’s arguments that Dassey presents a threat to public safety. The state asked Duffin on Tuesday to reconsider but he refused. In Wednesday’s order, Duffin said the state hasn’t made any new arguments and said that Dassey must be released by 8 p.m. Friday. The state Justice Department filed an emergency motion with the federal appeals court in Chicago, spokesman Johnny Koremenos said. Dassey’s attorney, Steven Drizin, didn’t immediately return a voicemail message Wednesday morning. Dassey was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilating a corpse in connection with Halbach’s death. ",

The Daily Mail has debuted some new snaps from the set of Marvel and Netflix's The Defenders , and while they're not terribly exciting, they do give us a first look at the returning Trish Walker. It was recently announced that Aussie actress Rachael Taylor would reprise the role (along with pretty much every other supporting cast member across all of the Netflix shows), and here we see \"Patsy\" stepping out for coffee with Jessica Jones, who really could do with a new outfit at this stage. Krysten Ritter has featured in all of the set pics we've so far, so it shouldn't be long before we catch a glimpse of some of her super-powered team-mates. Click HERE to see the rest of the pics.",

      "text": "Netflix to nab Jared Leto action-crime drama “The Outsider” November 16, 2016 - 20:44   Netflix is in talks to acquire global rights to “The Outsider” , an action-crime drama with Jared Leto , Variety has learned. \nThe deal has yet to close, but if it does, it would represent another showy acquisition for the streaming giant as it moves aggressively into the film space. Netflix already turned heads with acclaimed films such as “Beasts of No Nation” and the Ava DuVernay documentary “13th.” It has lined up projects with the likes of Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and David Ayer. \n“The Outsider” follows a U.S. army deserter who joins the Yakuza while living in post-World War II Japan. Leto, who won an Oscar for “Dallas Buyers Club,” is the big draw, but the cast also includes Rory Cochrane (“Black Mass”) and Tadanobu Asano (“Thor”). It is directed by Martin Zandvliet, whose previous film “Land of Mine” world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2015, where it was picked up by Sony Pictures Classics. Andrew Baldwin (“The Take”) wrote the screenplay. Filming is taking place in Tokyo. \nLeto appeared in last summer’s “Suicide Squad” and will next appear in “Blade Runner 2049” opposite Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. \nBloom is handling the sale of “The Outsider” and put the project together. It was sold out of AFM. Photo: ABC/ Rick Rowell",

      "text": "Macey J. Foronda for BuzzFeed ID: 9990146 \nThe final episode of Netflix’s The Crown includes a chilling nod to Princess Diana’s death. Four cars filled with paparazzi chase Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) and her betrothed, Captain Peter Townsend (Ben Miles), down a twisty English road. As his driver swerves, a photographer leans out the window, trying desperately to get a clear shot of the princess. Margaret peers from the backseat window, half posing and half alarmed. As the camera’s flashbulb pops, an oncoming car appears over the hill and the paparazzi veer to avoid a collision. “Woo!” the photographer yells excitedly. Margaret settles back into her seat, no longer posing and looking full-on alarmed. \n“[Show creator] Peter Morgan really wanted the prefiguring of Diana — because that’s what Margaret actually was like,” Vanessa Kirby told BuzzFeed News earlier this month, talking fast and tucking a piece of bright blonde hair behind one ear. “Throughout the whole series, she’s the one you see on the front page of the newspaper the most. She was this fashion icon, this leader of women’s inspiration, and she loved the public.” Netflix ID: 9990494 \nThat was the early 1950s. Fast forward to earlier this month, and Kirby’s star is on its own self-styled rise. She announced that she had signed with talent powerhouse WME the day before The Crown premiered, priming her to become the show’s breakout star. At the start of the interview at BuzzFeed HQ in Los Angeles, Kirby — wearing a perfectly pressed above-the-knee navy blue dress and killer black strappy heels — went right in for a kiss on both cheeks. “Hello, darling. Aren’t you gorgeous?” \nBut just because the 28-year-old Brit was disarmingly charming didn’t mean she was feeling entirely comfortable. After a couple test pictures with the photographer, she scrapped the navy dress. “I don’t want it to be too stuffy. That’s so not me.” Kirby whipped off the killer heels, pulled on some tattered black jeans, and did the shoot barefoot. “This is more me,” she said, gamely hopping up on a stool and bemoaning the state of her exposed feet. She tended toward a serious gaze in front of the camera — by The Crown ’s standards, she was much more Elizabeth than Margaret in that moment. “Someone make her laugh,” the photographer said, and the pout broke into genuine laughter before anyone could even try. “It doesn’t take much!” she tittered, and she was all Margaret again. Netflix ID: 9990496 \nThe younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II (Claire Foy), Margaret is the historic drama series’ most tragic figure. She’s denied the man she loves and the limelight she craves, and she struggles with her own sense of self in light of her sister’s position. “Next to you,” she tells Elizabeth on the show, “I’ll always be evil.” \nThat toxic mentality was all too easy for Kirby to slip into herself. “Even on set sometimes I was like, ‘Claire, you’re so amazing and wonderful and I’m the shit one!’” she laughed. “It never was about playing the evil sister versus the saintly one, although that’s what Margaret thinks in her head and that’s certainly what I began to think all the time.” \nIn the spotlight, Margaret’s a gorgeous, perfectly manicured peacock — dancing, singing, smoking her cigarette with long, languid hand movements. But the moment she’s alone, that confidence crumbles in on itself; her posture folds, her hands fumble to clutch her lighter, she becomes — as she proclaims to her sister in the final episode —“unhinged.” \nKirby inhabits that frenetic, attention-seeking energy with deft control. She wanted to avoid making Margaret into a caricature, a Bad Royal or Partying Princess — archetypes we’ve become increasingly fascinated by as a culture. “There was a risk of making her sort of arch,” she said. “I never want to make any characters one-dimensional, especially as women can often be portrayed as the dark one or the evil one.” Macey J. Foronda for BuzzFeed ID: 9990471 \nIt’s easy to imagine how much happier Margaret might have been in the day and age of relatable celebrities and social media. Throughout the series, she pushes to make the Royal Family more relatable and human — something that rings true to our modern, social media–fueled definition of “celebrity.” Margaret tells an aghast Winston Churchill (John Lithgow), “What people want is someone to inhabit [the Crown], not be frightened of it — make it flesh and blood, bring it to life.” \nKirby just can’t get into social media. “I’m really apathetic towards it,” she said. “Celebrities nowadays have Instagram and everything’s available and accessible and digestible for people that want it. People demand it.” Kirby’s own Instagram account currently features only 31 posts, and her Twitter was set up only after people started creating fake accounts under her name. “I feel uncomfortable about it; I’d always much rather be private,” she said. “I think I’d probably be more on the side of Elizabeth in that sense, even though I’m 100% Team Margaret.” \nFor now, Kirby’s used to relative anonymity in Hollywood, having had only small roles in bigger films thus far — About Time , Me Before You , Jupiter Ascending. But via her take as Margaret, she’s now thrust into the public eye more firmly than ever before, whether she realizes it yet or not. “I didn’t think about it like that, actually, weirdly,” she laughed. “When [ The Crown ] came out, my head nearly exploded because I just couldn’t comprehend that anybody other than my mum would see it.” Netflix ID: 9990500 \nPrior to The Crown , the majority of Kirby’s acting experience came from the theater world, which is likely why she described working with the tight-knit cast and the dramatic script as what felt like being in a theater troupe. She’s also had a penchant for playing other overshadowed sisters, on London’s stages: In 2012 she completed a turn as Masha in Three Sisters , and just this past summer she played Stella opposite Gillian Anderson’s Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire . “Family relationships are just so fascinating — how they shape you as a person, how you can wound each other, how you’re imprinted in a way by your family and the conditions under which you grow up.” \nThat lack of accessibility and extreme insulation perhaps explains the draw to England’s royal family (and other celebrities who live low-key): We feel compelled to fill in the blanks to our satisfaction. “You don’t really know about their private lives, and yet they became these amazing, mysterious global icons,” Kirby said. “If their lives were all out there, you wouldn’t really want to see another biopic of someone you know everything about anyway — like if the Queen was posting [to social media] what she has for tea. But there’s something unbelievably fascinating about seeing what she and Philip talk about before they go to bed.” \nThat common interest in personal privacy might be what gives Kirby — or any actor — career longevity. That being said, Kirby would still love to get a look at Margaret’s Instagram. “It would be a lot more fun than mine, I’ll tell you that.” Macey J. Foronda for BuzzFeed ID: 9990462",

      "text": "Email \nGirl breakups are no joke. \nIn an upcoming episode of Netflix’s Chelsea , Sarah Jessica Parker , Julianna Margulies and Chelsea Handler discuss the struggles women have to endure when going through a friendship breakup (yes, there’s such a thing). \n“Why does it feel like females have breakups of friendships where as guys do not,” The Daily Show host Trevor Noah asks the women at the dinner table. \n“I’ve never had that in my entire life,” Parker, 51, reveals. “I don’t understand what that is. I think that’s Bravo, you know, Housewives .” \nAfter Margulies explains that it’s because women run on emotions, Parker explains a scenario in her own home that opened her eyes to the difference in friendships between men and women. \n“My son who is almost 14, I was so impressed I was listening to him to talk to his friends in the kitchen and they were kind of brutal,” the former Sex in the City star says. “I’m like, ‘Wow man! I couldn’t believe what I heard in the kitchen. You guys are tough on each other.’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, but then it’s sort of done and out of the way.’ With the girls, it lands and it lingers and it’s a completely different experience and I don’t know why that is.” \nThe Good Wife star then shares a time when she was going through a hard “breakup.” \n“My husband, he has a brother and I have sisters,” she explains. “Something happened between me and one of my sisters and I just was livid and it was done in a text and I was internalizing it and getting upset. And Keith came home and he was like, ‘Are you okay?’ and I was like, ‘I just can’t believe…’ and I was so emotional about it. He just looked at me and was like, ‘Dear God, guys are so much easier.’ There is a component to emotion that we have.” \nHandler adds: ‘I’ll speak for myself, but I think that you’re more sensitive and there’s so much rejection based on the way you look and how you’re perceived. With girls it’s different. You don’t necessarily fit in all the time.’ \nThe full relationship dinner party streams on Netflix’s Chelsea on Nov. 17. Show Full Article",

      "text": " Netflix\n62% Of Mothers And Daughters Say Sharing TV Shows Helps Build A Stronger Relationship\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. , Nov. 16, With the return of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix is giving mothers and daughters another way to bond. A recent survey revealed more than half of women (53%) wish they spoke to their mother more often. On November 25 , fans all over the world can reconnect through the mother of all TV shows...because even reading this release will make you realize how much you want to call your mom.\nMore than half of mother-daughter duos surveyed (59%) report that post-show discussions are the best part of sharing a show together. In fact, watching together is so important that despite the distance, almost half of moms and daughters (41%) think watching together brings them closer. Even though one third of moms and daughters surveyed live thirty or more minutes apart, over half have gone out of their way to physically watch together on many occasions.\nThe ultimate mother-daughter pair, Rory and Lorelai, know the benefits of sharing show-inspired inside jokes and witty one-liners. Whether you and mom are die-hard fans or looking for your next binge together, Netflix is letting you send an invite for Date Night with Mom .\nNo matter what kind of mother-daughter relationship it is, Gilmore has something for you. The survey found that globally, almost equal portions of mother-daughter relationships fall into the following three groups:\n39% of respondents say they're two peas in a pod, and are BFFs like Rory and Lorelai . 31% say they may be polar opposites like Lane and Mrs. Kim , but they just want what's best for each other. 30% know it can be complicated like Lorelai and Emily , but they can't imagine life without each other.

      "text": "\nGirl breakups are no joke.\nIn an upcoming episode of Netflix’s Chelsea , Sarah Jessica Parker , Julianna Margulies and Chelsea Handler discuss the struggles women have to endure when going through a friendship breakup (yes, there’s such a thing).\n“Why does it feel like females have breakups of friendships where as guys do not,” The Daily Show host Trevor Noah asks the women at the dinner table.\n“I’ve never had that in my entire life,” Parker, 51, reveals. “I don’t understand what that is. I think that’s Bravo, you know, Housewives .”\nAfter Margulies explains that it’s because women run on emotions, Parker explains a scenario in her own home that opened her eyes to the difference in friendships between men and women.\n“My son who is almost 14, I was so impressed I was listening to him to talk to his friends in the kitchen and they were kind of brutal,” the former Sex in the City star says. “I’m like, ‘Wow man! I couldn’t believe what I heard in the kitchen. You guys are tough on each other.’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, but then it’s sort of done and out of the way.’ With the girls, it lands and it lingers and it’s a completely different experience and I don’t know why that is.”\n\nThe Good Wife star then shares a time when she was going through a hard “breakup.”\n“My husband, he has a brother and I have sisters,” she explains. “Something happened between me and one of my sisters and I just was livid and it was done in a text and I was internalizing it and getting upset. And Keith came home and he was like, ‘Are you okay?’ and I was like, ‘I just can’t believe…’ and I was so emotional about it. He just looked at me and was like, ‘Dear God, guys are so much easier.’ There is a component to emotion that we have.”\nHandler adds: ‘I’ll speak for myself, but I think that you’re more sensitive and there’s so much rejection based on the way you look and how you’re perceived. With girls it’s different. You don’t necessarily fit in all the time.’\nHandler will also welcome numerous A-list guests to her dinner party in future episodes, including Jessica Chastain (12/1), Gaby Hoffmann (12/2), Rosie O’Donnell (12/7), the cast of Orange is the New Black (12/8), Jennifer Aniston (12/9), Jennifer Lawrence (12/16) and more.\nThe full relationship dinner party streams on Netflix’s Chelsea on Nov. 17.",

      "text": "Netflix in Talks for Jared Leto Crime Thriller The Outsider By Joe Allen | November 16, 2016 | 12:32pm Share Tweet Text \nIf it wasn’t clear already, Netflix is in the content business. The streaming service has produced dozens of award-winning television shows, and they’ve also acquired the rights to several high-profile films, including Beasts of No Nation and Ava DuVernay’s 13th . Now, Netlfix is in talks to acquire a crime-thriller called The Outsider starring Jared Leto , as reported by Variety . \nThe Outsider follows a U.S. army deserter who joins the Yakuza while living in post-World War II Japan. The Oscar-winning Leto is undoubtedly the film’s biggest draw, but the supporting cast also includes Rory Cochrane ( Black Mass ) and Tadanobu Asano ( Thor ). \nDirected by Martin Zandvliet, The Outsider will be his follow-up to Land of Mine , which debuted at the Toronto Film Festival and was eventually picked up by Sony Picture Classics. Andrew Baldwin wrote the screenplay for the film, which is currently shooting in Tokyo. \nLeto will next appear alongside Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049 , the long-awaited sequel to the 1981 classic. Although the deal with Netflix isn’t final, The Outsider looks to be yet another big acquisition for the studio. Tags",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO: Transit app Moovit has hired Steve Swasey as VP and head of global communications. \nHis first day at the company will be November 28. \nSwasey will be based in Moovit’s San Francisco office, reporting to cofounder and CEO Nir Erez and sitting on the executive committee. He is tasked with strategic positioning and messaging for the company worldwide. \nSwasey will be responsible for editorial media relations, op-ed writing and placement, speaking engagements, Moovit’s conference attendance and exposure, and influencer engagement via paid, owned, and earned channels. He will also focus on internal communications. \nMoovit, which was founded in 2012, has 45 million users largely in Europe and Latin America. Swasey said it was \"instrumental\" in helping Rio de Janeiro manage public transit during the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, but it has not yet made a splash in the U.S. \n\"They created my role and wanted it based in the U.S. because Moovit has done well in other countries,\" said Swasey. \"A lot of my focus is raising the profile of Moovit in the U.S.\" \nSwasey is joining Moovit after a short stint at online lending marketplace Lending Club. He started at the company as SVP of corporate communications in January and left in May at the same time founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche resigned. Laplanche’s resignation followed an internal review that found that his company sold $22 million in loans to an investor, despite the fact that those loans were not up to the investor’s criteria, according to the Los Angeles Times . \n\"My job changed and the goals of the company changed from building an iconic brand to defending the company,\" said Swasey. \"It was not the right job for me, but I had a good exit.\" \nLast year, Swasey left Kabam after nearly four years at the mobile game developer. His exit came a little more than five months after he was promoted to his most recent position as SVP and head of global corporate communications amid a corporate shift to \"fewer, bigger, bolder\" products. \nBefore joining Kabam, Swasey served as Netflix’s VP of corporate communications for seven years and held roles at Oracle's PeopleSoft, Tri-Valley Growers, E&J Gallo Winery, and Ketchum.",

      "text": "Nov 16, 2016 9:35 PM Parallels Share Tweet \nBack in March of 2015, Netflix and Fox Searchlight got together to produce a one-hour sci-fi pilot film called Parallels , about a mysterious building that transports people into alternate universes on a fixed, unrelenting schedule. (It was pretty much the plot of the old Fox show Sliders , except with architecture instead of wormholes, and minus a grumbling John Rhys-Davies .) The film ended on a cliffhanger that more or less demanded continuation, and now it sounds like that’s exactly what it’s going to get. \nDeadline reports that Fox and Neil Gaiman are working together on The Building , a TV extension of Parallels’ initial premise. Gaiman—who’s also currently working on Bryan Fuller’s adaptation of his novel American Gods —will executive produce, along with Albert Kim and Chris Leone, who wrote, and, in the latter’s case, directed, the original short film. There’s no word on whether Fresh Off The Boat ’ s Constance Wu will reprise her role from the original movie as multiverse traveler Polly, meanwhile, or whether Jerry O’Connell will stop by to further remind people that Sliders was once a thing that was on TV. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "'Netflix tax' registration picks up By Jonathan Underhill 4:41 PM Thursday Nov 17, 2016 SHARE: Technology Photo / 123rf \nMore than 80 offshore suppliers of remote services have registered for goods and services tax since the government widened its net to apply GST to cross-border services such as streaming video, e-books, music, and software on Oct. 1, says Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse. \nThe so-called Netflix tax was passed into law in May and captures payments for services such as iTunes downloads and Steam video games. Woodhouse told the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand annual conference today that the tax was in keeping with the nation's broad base, low rate (BBLR) tax policy framework. \nHe outlined the government's tax policy work programme priorities through to the end of 2017, which include developing an exclusion from dividend taxation rules for certain demergers by Australian listed companies. The change is designed to prevent demerged assets being treated as taxable income when no distribution has been made. \n\"I have asked that this item be fast-tracked and officials will consult with stakeholders on the detail of the proposed amendment before its introduction in the tax bill scheduled for introduction early next year,\" he said. \nThat bill will also fix an \"overreach\" issue related to the application of the voting interest test for corporate trustees, an issue that affected professional firms such as accountants acting as independent trustees for their clients' companies, he said. \nIn terms of international tax avoidance, Woodhouse said New Zealand had some work to do in terms of the OECD's BEPS Action Plan recommendations. They included New Zealand's transfer pricing legislation, which was no longer fit for purpose after 21 years. \nHe said New Zealand's thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt foreign-owned firms can have in New Zealand but there was room for improvement. \n\"A small number of foreign-owned firms appear able to take excessively high ihigh-interesttions. For example, the interest rates on some related-party loans appear to be unreasonably high,\" he said. \n\"We are therefore considering measures that would bolster our rules, to ensure that foreign-owned firms cannot shift excessive profits out of New Zealand using debt,\" he said. \nNew Zealand is among 96 countries that are working on a multilateral tax treaty developed by the OECD to tackle tax avoidance strategies used by multinational companies that are known by the acronym for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).",

      "text": "Courtesy of Saeed Adyani/Netflix May 22, 2015 | 07:45AM PT \n“Hey, let’s all promise that in 10 years from today, we’ll meet again, and we’ll see what kind of people we’ve blossomed into.” \nOK, so it’s been more than 10 years since that line was spoken in Michael Showalter and David Wain’s ’80s throwback camp comedy “Wet Hot American Summer,” but that doesn’t mean fans are any less excited for the Netflix prequel series, “Wet Hot Americann Summer: First Day of Camp.” Just in time for Memorial Day, Netflix has released cast photos from the upcoming series that show Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler , Bradley Cooper , Paul Rudd, Christopher Meloni and more embracing their Camp Firewood roots. \n“‘ Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp ’ is a prequel to the original movie,” said Wain. “In real life we’re 15 years older but in the show we’re playing two months younger. The movie took place on the last day of camp in the summer of 1981. The show takes place on the first day.” \nImages of some new cast members like John Slattery are absent from these photos. It’s just as well. They probably taste like burger anyway. \n“Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp” hits Netflix July 31. \nNina Hellman as Nancy, Molly Shannon as Gail and Judah Friedlander as Ron. \nJoe Lo Truglio as Neil and Ken Marino as Victor. \nJaneane Garofalo as Beth.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- On the morning of Oct. 21, Netflix and Twitter were kicked offline by hackers -- annoying binge-watchers and prolific tweeters for several hours.\nBut the hacking of popular websites is a harbinger of what's to come for consumers using devices connected to the internet, and Congress faces a tough question of how to protect consumers and businesses without overregulating the tech industry.\n\"Many consumers do not recognize they need strong protection on everyday devices,\" said Texas Republican Rep. Michael Burgess. Burgess spoke Wednesday at a House hearing to understand how connected devices factored into the Oct. 21 hack and other recent incidents. \"The balance between functionality and security is not going to be solved in the near term. In fact, the most common password is the word 'password.'\"\nIn the past decade, an increasing number of devices are now connected to the internet, including smartphones, cars and talking refrigerators. That leads to an increasing number of entry points for hackers and criminals to disrupt lives in malicious ways.\n\"Everything is a computer. Your phone is a computer that makes calls, your refrigerator's a computer that keeps things cold,\" testified Bruce Schneier, a special adviser to IBM security and a lecturer at Harvard University. \"Attack is easier than defense, complexity is the worst enemy of security, and the internet is the most complex thing ever built.\"\nSchneier argued that the federal government must regulate and set standards for devices connected to the internet like it does for the safety of cars. He wants to create a new government agency and argued that Republicans swiftly created the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11 in response to safety threats.\nBut House Republicans like Burgess, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, are unlikely to support a new regulatory agency that would likely cost billions of dollars.\n\"Regulation needs to be a cop on the beat. People do need to know that they are protected, but there does need to be a light touch,\" Burgess said. \"We ought to be enforcing current law before we write new ones.\"\nDespite the disagreement over creating new regulations, there was agreement by both Democrats and Republicans that cybersecurity hygiene must be improved, at the consumer and corporate level.\nFor every consumer who inputs a weak password into an electronic device, hospitals and public utilities frequently employ outdated security systems to protect valuable medical records and internal infrastructure like keeping the power on.\n\"Windows XP is being used at a water treatment plant in Michigan,\" said Kevin Fu, an associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering at the University of Michigan, who also testified at the hearing. \"Most hospitals have capital equipment costs. This is why you see Windows 95 and Windows 98 machines in hospitals.\"\nFu said a \"kid in a basement\" is capable of hacking such dated systems and causing potential damage to life and property.\nIn addition, a panel of experts told the committee that traditional passwords are largely obsolete, as human-created security systems are susceptible to hacking. Instead, devices should employ technology like fingerprint recognition and two-step authentication to thwart criminals.\n\"There's always been a role for passwords, but in general passwords have outlived their usefulness,\" Schneier said. \"There are many other systems that give us more robust authentication.\"\nBut specifically mandating what types of technology should be regulated to keep people secure could have negative effects because technology changes so fast. The experts testifying to the committee on Wednesday urged Congress to consider regulation that is \"technologically invariant,\" meaning that a new feature on the next iPhone should not cause the rules to be obsolete.\n\"The committee and agency need to be careful to be technology-neutral because things change so fast,\" Burgess said.\nThe October attacks on consumer-facing websites were relatively benign, but increasingly sophisticated criminals trying to hack simple security systems could have far-reaching impacts on daily life for millions.\n\"I like the world where the internet can do whatever it wants whenever it wants,\" Schneier said. \"It's fun, but we don't live in that world anymore.\"\n(c)2016 McClatchy Washington Bureau\nVisit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "\"Luke Cage\" Makes Big Splash With Netflix Ratings November 16, 2016 | 10:15 AM 10 \nNetflix has managed to corner the streaming video market with a strong slate of original programming over the past couple of years, but the network’s alignment with the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been especially fruitful. According to industry insiders, this fall’s Luke Cage was one of Netflix’s biggest hit series of the year. \nIn a report from Observer , the publication noted that multimedia data collection company Symphony Advanced Media released a newsletter this week saying that Marvel’s Luke Cage was one of Netflix’s top streaming shows. \nWhile Netflix doesn’t unveil official viewer numbers to the public, Symphony’s estimation placed the Hip-Hop focused series ahead of the dark and brooding second season of Daredevil. If this is all to be believed, Harlem’s hooded hero will likely make a return to the small screen as there is already a third season for Daredevil in the works. \nSymphony said that Luke Cage had a stronger opening week than Making A Murderer and Netflix’s ode to 80s sci-fi and horror films, Stranger Things — although both of those shows surged after the hype machine caught up with them. Observer also reports that Orange Is The New Black and Fuller House led the Netflix ratings pack in 2016. Symphony gets its data by paying subscribers to grant them access to their mobile phone’s microphones and captures TV sounds, which is how it tabulates its ratings system. \nEssentially speaking, out of the slate of Marvel shows, Luke Cage has performed better than both seasons of Daredevil and the cerebral Jessica Jones series. Marvel’s Iron Fist series makes its debut next March. Sign up for The Daily Drop \nThank you, thank you, thank you,you're far too kind!",

      "text": "17   Netflixs main competitor, Amazon, will start expanding its video streaming globally in December with the launch of The Grand Tour. The show will premiere in the first 5 countries tomorrow, Friday. The Grand Tour in 200 countries Amazon is producing TV series, movies, and now also a car show with Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May as hosts. The show will help bring Amazons streaming ambitions to a global audience starting from December.- The Grand Tour launches in the UK, US, Germany, Austria and Japan this Friday, 18 November. In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon. Fans from around the globe will be able to catch up on all episodes aired to date. New episodes will be released weekly, every Friday, worldwide, says AmazonThe show will launch tomorrow in existing regions and expand to 200 countries or territories in December. There are 196 official countries in the world, if you include Taiwan. An exact date in December was not confirmed.The first season of The Grand Tour has 12 episodes. Amazon has already committed to36 episodes, or three seasons. At BBC, Top Gear was the most watched TV program in the world. It is estimated that BBC on average spent Ł650,000 per episode. Amazon is planning to spend Ł4.5m per episode, according to some estimates. A full streaming catalog? Amazon Video, the streaming service, already has millions of subscribers and is estimated to be second only to Netflix. It is not clear if Amazon wants to bring a comprehensive streaming catalog to a global audience in December or only The Grand Tour initially.Amazon is producing original TV series such as Transparent, The Man in the High Castle and Mozart in the Jungle as well as original films such as Spike Lees Chi-Raq. Some of these productions are available to watch in Ultra HD and HDR quality. The Grand Tour has been shot in 4K Ultra HD.Amazon Video is available through Smart TVs, media streamers (including Amazon FireTV), smartphones, tablets, and PCs. However, it is not available on Apple TV and Chromecast.The news about the global expansion was announced in the video above. Amazon has declined to offer additional details at this point. In the US, Amazon Video is a $9/month streaming service. So. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.",

      "text": "40 shares \nUntil now, Amazon’s streaming video service has mostly been a nice add-on to sweeten the deal on its Prime subscription plan, which grants customers quicker shipping and other benefits for a recurring fee. \nIt looks like it’s going to get a lot bigger next month. In a video shared on Twitter, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, the hosts of the upcoming motoring show The Grand Tour , announced that the series will be available in more than 200 countries in December. A message from the guys. pic.twitter.com/p1IJNRjAnS \n— The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016 \nTo clarify, The Grand Tour will be available exclusively through Amazon, which means that its Prime Video service will expand worldwide. That’ll give the company a chance to take on Netflix, which was already available in 60 countries and expanded to 130 more in January. \nLike its rival, Amazon invests in producing exclusive original content and also licenses shows and movies from global studios and distributors. \nIt’s hard to say who’ll come out on top in the next few years, as both companies are working hard to deliver extensive content catalogs, including regionally relevant franchises and original programming. \nIn India, Amazon has partnered with Bollywood studios and distributors like Dharma Productions and T-Series; it’s also set to popular regional franchises and is reportedly working to secure rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket. \nIt seems like Amazon might be able to leverage competitive pricing to its advantage in the battle against Netflix around the world. For example, while Netflix costs between Rs. 6,000 ($90) and Rs. 9,600 ($143) per year in India, Amazon Prime Video will be bundled with a Prime subscription , which comes in at just Rs. 999 ($15) annually and offers additional benefits. \nThe Grand Tour will kick off on Amazon Prime Video on November 18 in the UK, Germany and Japan at 12:01 AM GMT; that’s 7:01 PM EST / 4:01 PM November 17 in the US, where it will also be available.",

      "text": "By Polly Higgins and Meghan Giannotta November 16, 2016 Advertise here \nChristmastime is all about the movies. \nIf Santa cookies, festive music and holiday parties don't get you in the spirit, Netflix most definitely will. \nHere are eight Christmas movies available to stream now. 'A Very Murray Christmas' If a massive snowstorm ever leaves all of the city without power, watch this 2015 comedy to figure out what to do. Food, booze and attractive people who can belt out Christmas carols that sound as good as the classics is the recipe to a very Murray Christmas. If your party guests are Miley Cyrus, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock, George Clooney and Rashida Jones, you're good to go.

All of Manhattan's holiday notables -- the Thanksgiving Day parade, Macy's and a department store Santa -- are packed into this 1947 classic.

At its center is Jenny (Anna Kendrick), a searching 20-something who kicks up emotional dust when staying with her brother (Swanberg) and his wife (Melanie Lynskey). Indie-cred alert: Lena Dunham plays Jenny's friend.

Watch and you'll be singing the Irving Berlin classic well into the new year.

The huge, A-list cast finds Hugh Grant as a bachelor prime minister, Colin Firth a lonely writer, and Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson a couple past its expiration date. Bill Nighy is at his best as a weathered rocker attempting to chart with a wretched holiday pop song.

Murray takes on the Ebenezer Scrooge role as a wealthy TV exec and horrible boss, a Gordon Gekko for the Hollywood set. Bonus points from a wonderful cast that includes Bobcat Goldthwait, Robert Mitchum and New York Dolls frontman David Johansen as the Ghost of Christmas Past.

      "text": "On Naz & Maalik While scrolling through the LGBT portion of Netflix’s collection, I have found a repeating melody : white, male, and cisgender. A lot of the films lack character and plot development and depth. While the few queer films that center queer people of color are enjoyable, they are too few and too far between. Since joining Netflix in 2013 I find myself occasionally exhausted with the heteronormativity that floods the streaming service. Sure, I enjoy the black comedies or the syfy selections, but I really feel most times as If I, a black and gay man, am an afterthought, or as if I don’t really exist. Where is love story or the epic that I can relate too? Why are there endless useless scenes and subplots of a male lead and female guest character having sex or making out (and the choreo of it is just awful) ? I’m tired. Queue Jay Dockendorf’s Naz & Maalik​ .\nDockendorf really put some #respek on the name of indie films with this one. I suppose that what I truly love is how real, how authentic our protoganists Naz and Maalik, played by the marvelous Kerwin Johnson, Jr. and Curtiss Cook, Jr. respectively, are. I am tired of seeing black characters on screen that are just there. No fried chicken, no sunday dinners, no electric slides, nothing alluding to Black Culture, which is an entire universe of its own really. It’s nice to have people that look like me onscreen, but relating to them, having affinity toward them is also essential. Our guys are two best buds going about their day in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and, though I’m from a different state, I really felt as though they could have been from my hometown.\nCutting up with my best friend all day is what I love to do, and I loved how Naz and Maalik did that. I swear people think that the Black Muslim American experience is something so astonishing, so abstract, but really people just live and breath and wake-up and go to work or school….it’s not that hard to grasp. It’s absolutely wonderful that Dockendorf centered the character’s faith, race, and sexuality as a single item. Naz was muslim, black, and gay at the same damn time. There was no separating it. There’s never any separating it.\nThis is kind of content I love seeing, the kind of story I love hearing. One final thing I’ll add is that I truly appreciate the care that the team took in establishing and showing the intimacy between Naz and Maalik. Too often I find myself not feeling the sex scenes in queer media. The chemistry was extremely evident and it was sweet to see these two friends, damn near boyfriends, explore their sexuality and their love more than once​ ​ . If you’re gonna film a gay sex scene, please go all the way or not all. Let the feelings flow. Naz & Maalik​ means so much to me. I don’t see myself represented or respected enough and it means the world that a film of this kinds was made and released.\nWritten by Jelani A. Price .",

      "text": "Jerry Seinfeld REX/Shutterstock \nFrance’s answer to Jerry Seinfeld , Gad Elmaleh , is getting a double showcase on Netflix . His latest one-man show, Gad Gone Wild , will be available for subscribers globally beginning January 24. That one is mostly in French, and will be followed by an English-language special exclusively for Netflix later in 2017. 'Frequency'&'No Tomorrow' Not Getting Back Orders From the CW As They Look For Lifeline On Netflix \nThe Moroccan-born Elmaleh is a household name in France, known equally for his stand-up and feature film work. His credits include 1998’s Train Of Life ; smash comedy sequel Would I Lie To You? 2 ; Priceless with Audrey Tautou; Francis Veber’s The Valet ; and Coco which he also directed in 2009. U.S. credits include Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures Of Tintin ; Woody Allen’s Midnight In Paris and Adam Sandler’s Jack And Jill . \nHe first met Seinfeld after voicing the actor’s lead character in the French version of Bee Movie . A few years later, the duo teamed up for an episode of Seinfeld’s Crackle shorts Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee . Elmaleh made the U.S. talk show rounds earlier this year including stops on Late Night With Seth Meyers and Conan (see video below). \nIn Gad Gone Wild , Elmaleh uses personal experiences as a Frenchman in the U.S. to highlight cultural differences with his very singular humor. Built upon the jokes that made him famous when he started to perform overseas, Gad mixes English, French and Arab, talking about absurd situations he experiences in his daily life in New York and Los Angeles. \nSays Elmaleh, “For a long time I’ve seen my favorite humorists on Netflix. Today this is a true honor to know that I’ll soon be among them. Netflix’s vision totally fits with mine when it comes to humor and creation crossing borders.” \nHere’s Elmaleh on Conan : ",

The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI'll be honest - it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \n--- \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory - the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent - she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing - even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show'slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same - and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\" \n--- \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time - and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" mini-movie - with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway. \n--- \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "title": "'Lovesick' Season 2 Premiere: Why did Netflix change original 'Scrotal Recall' title?",
      "text": "Today it's difficult to imagine a time before Stranger Things existed on Netflix. But before it, when the streaming service was still mastering how best to put out their original programming, we were given a hilarious and poignant six-episode-long British sitcom with a pretty unfortunate title — Scrotal Recall .\nThe second season of the show, which follows the adventures of Dylan, who was diagnosed with chlamydia in the pilot and spends episode after episode seeking out the women he's slept with to let them know, has been given a name change. It is now known as Lovesick , a play on the show's warmer themes. According to actress Antonia Thomas, who plays Dylan's friend Evie, it is more tonally fitting.\nIn a recent interview with Paste , Thomas commented on the new name:\nThe name change has been the best! I can't tell you what a relief the name change is. It's just so weird to feel proud about everything about the show but not wanting to talk about it because of the name! So yeah, I'm really, really pleased. I mean, technically, the name made sense in a funny way, but actually it completely mis-sold it in terms of the tone and what we were trying to do. The title change was revealed at the Television Critics Association press tour back in J uly , perhaps in response to negative comments about its raunchiness. Nevertheless, with the show premiering its second season today, it seems that there are several people who are not content with change.\nI AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS #SCROTALRECALL IS COMING BACK/I REFUSE TO CALL IT BY ITS NEW NAME @NETFLIX\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwMXIAdWcAA1ie0.jpg:large It will always be called #ScrotalRecall to me @NetflixUK #lovesick but bring on season 2 https://t.co/KLKgcZa5MR\nA lil bitter it's no longer #ScrotalRecall but still stoked for #Lovesick\nugh why did they change #ScrotalRecall to such a generic name like Lovesick @netflix\nAnyone else upset #Netflix changed title of #ScrotalRecall to #Lovesick? Thought the original was funny but I have the maturity of a 6y/o.\nLovesick season two is currently available for streaming on Netflix. You can watch the trailer for the new season below.\nSource: Netflix US & Canada/YouTube",

The basic plot is that an ex-marine sniper living a solitary life gets pulled back and accused of killing the President. \nThe first episode of Shooter aired on USA Network on Tuesday 15th, 2016 and then, like many other shows, releases on a select few Netflix regions the following day exclusively in that region. The UK and Australia/New Zealand regions are both being treated to new weekly episodes. When do new episodes of Shooter come to Netflix? \nHere’s the weekly Netflix release schedule for season 1 of Shooter. This assumes that the series now runs seven weeks in a row without a break. Episode 1 – November 16th",

Co-creator Santo Cilauro addressed the resemblance in an interview last month by saying this: “We just kept looking at different designs and said you know what, this is the quickest way to get [what started as a] radio play into a visual form. We didn’t pay too much attention to who it looked like, what it looked like, whether it was reminiscent of something else … We just said that’s the way we pictured it in our heads.” Judge for yourself when Pacific Heat debuts on Netflix Friday, December 2nd.",

It's almost impossible to pick up a device with a screen that doesn't support them, especially the big two: Netflix and Hulu .\nNetflix got started nearly 20 years ago as a DVD-by-mail service with no late fees that pretty much put movie rental places out of business. In 2007, it started offering streaming content, which has quickly become its core business ( and a major source of Internet traffic ).\nAs of October 2016, Netflix has 86 million members worldwide, 47 million of which are in the US (over 4 million still get DVDs). While movies were once the main reason to watch Netflix, these days it's known for original programming that has inspired many a binge watch.\nHulu is a similar beast, though it's centered more on TV than movies. It launched for public use in 2008, mainly as a syndication engine for owners like NBC Universal, and quickly became the go-to service for finding programs from most of the major television networks (minus CBS and The CW) shortly after they aired.\nHulu is only available in the US (with a knock-off service in Japan; you can't even get it in Canada) and has 12 million subscribers . For a while, it had a limited free tier of service, but that ended this summer . Hulu changes a lot, but mostly it's for the better. In fact, it might soon jump into live TV programming with a service that replaces your cable box.\nIf you're the type of person who will only subscribe to one, how do you pick? We're going to look at each service in turn and pick a winner in each category; from there we'll determine which service is the best.\nPrice Hulu used to have a free tier with limited shows and advertising, but killed it dead a few months ago. Now, the price is a flat $7.99 per month to get all the base content. Hulu used to call this tier \"Hulu Plus,\" but now it's just Hulu.\nHowever, the biggest problem with that base tier is it still shows commercials. If you're okay with that, then enjoy. But for an extra $4 per month, you can go commercial free. (You can thank Twitter for that one .) That's $11.99 per month for a lot of content sans commercials (with a few exceptions that, due to streaming rights, must show commercials before and after a show: they include Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, New Girl , and a handful of others.)\nFor that $11.99 per month you can view Hulu on only one device at a time officially , but typically it'll run on two or three at a time. Hulu asks you to keep your password confidential and not share, even if you call them for help. You only get one profile. You can put a Hulu account on hold for up to 12 weeks if you're going to be traveling and save some money.\nNetflix pricing is a little more complicated. With Netflix, you pay to see it on one screen in standard definition for $7.99 per month, or two screens simultaneously in high definition for $9.99 a month. That HD part is key—two screens are fine and all, but HD is an utter necessity on most TVs these days. You can go to four screens at a time for $11.99 a month—and with that also get support for Ultra HD , which is what you want if you've got a 4K HDTV. That also requires you to have a pretty rock-solid 25 Megabit per second or higher Internet download connection and some specific hardware (supported devices include Xbox One S , Roku 4 , TiVo Bolt , and Dish Hopper 3 , among others.)\n\nAll Netflix tiers are ad-free (beyond it pimping its original content on log-in screens). You get multiple profiles per account, so everyone in the household can have their own \"My List\" of shows. Also, while Netflix likewise states in its terms of service that users shouldn't share their password, the company is on record now saying it doesn't really care about that .\nWINNER : Netflix \nOverall Content Selection The most important criteria when it comes to picking a video-streaming service is what you can watch.\nNetflix used to be all about the movies, going back to its days as a DVD-rental service only. A lot of muck is raked about the state of the Netflix movie catalog. This month, the Streaming Observer site noted that the number of films in the IMDb Top 250 had dwindled to just 31 titles , or 12 percent. But guess what? That's still more titles in the IMDb Top 250 than carried by Hulu. According to an AllFlicks report from earlier this year , Netflix had 4,335 movies and 1,197 TV shows available in the US, down 31.7 percent from 2014.\nIn the last few years, Netflix has become much more TV-oriented, as most of its original content comes in the form of entire seasons of a show, usually about 13 episodes, all of which drop at once for binge viewing. It's a strategy that works well for Netflix, and those shows are critical darlings, from House of Cards and Orange is the New Black to newer fare like Stranger Things and Black Mirror .\n\nHulu , you would think, would be in a little better position since it's essentially owned by the operators of three TV networks, but the individual shows carried by Hulu are not always owned by those networks.\nTake The CW shows, for instance. Hulu had a deal for five years to show all CW shows (like Arrow, The Flash, Supernatural , etc.) the next day after air; but that contract has expired . Now all CW shows will go instead to Netflix—but not until the season ends next year in 2017. (Netflix also has the entire backlog of each season of all CW shows).\nHulu was also the online exclusive carrier of the entire Criterion Collection of 900+ art movies—but as of November 11, they are moving to a brand new streaming service called Filmstruck from Turner Classic Movies. Hulu is also frequently missing lots of back seasons of TV shows. When it does have the whole back catalog—like it does for Family Guy —it makes a big deal out of it. But it's few and far between.\nThat said, if you want to watch next-day airing of network TV shows from ABC, NBC, and Fox for one price, Hulu is a must. And its original shows are only getting better and better, albeit slowly compared to Netflix.\nWINNER : Tie \nAdd-Ons Add-ons, in this case, are when a streaming service provides access to all the content of a whole other service. To be honest, the best at this is Amazon Video , which for $4.99 a month each lets you add Showtime, Starz, Seeso, or few others.\nHulu offers one content add-on at this time: Showtime. For an extra $8.99 a month, the complete Showtime catalog becomes available via any Hulu interface. New shows are available the day after they air. So that includes shows like Dexter, Shameless, Masters of Sex , and many more. It also includes movies and specials that are \"exclusive\" to Showtime. Standalone Showtime online is $10.99 per month, so you save $2 if you were going to subscribe to both anyway.\n\nOne other thing Hulu pegs as an \"add-on\"–it's $4.00 per month commercial free option. (See price, above.)\nOver on Netflix, there aren't any content add-ons; not streaming anyway. You could consider the DVD plans an add-on in this more modern streamy age. Otherwise, it's one price fits all the content on Netflix. Maybe that's because offering up shows one at a time goes against the company's very ethos? Or it just doesn't play well with others? Either way, it's a shame.\nWINNER : Hulu. \nExclusives and Originals Hulu has a couple of impressive exclusive shows that are cultural phenomenon: Seinfeld and South Park . It has exclusivity on a few current shows like past seasons of You're the Worst , Fargo , and a few others. It's got a handful of modestly great original shows as well: The Mindy Project, Chance, The Path, Difficult People , and the service's best show, Casual .\nNetflix has a lot of exclusives, sure. But what Netflix offers in the way of originals it makes itself is on a whole other level. The $5 billion it has invested in original content shows, from movies like Beast of No Nation to original TV shows that are coming out at an increasingly faster clip. The list of Netflix Originals is too large to list, but some have become phenoms already such as House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Marvel's Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Stranger Things , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , and BoJack Horseman. That's just the standouts in a field of an estimated 126 original series and films for 2016 alone.\nOh, and for exclusives that Netflix didn't even make? It has 83 hours of Friends . Nuff said.\nWINNER : Netflix. \n\nDevice Support The Wikipedia page that lists Netflix-compatible devices is ridiculously long, covering set-top boxes, streaming media hubs, gaming consoles, handheld devices and OSes, smart TVs, desktop OSes, and Blu-ray players. Hulu doesn't, apparently, warrant a wiki of its devices, but has a pretty thorough list of its own (albeit outdated—it lists Windows 8, not Windows 10, even though the app works in each).\n\nSeriously, try to find a device or operating system that doesn't support either service. It's hard. The services have outlived some platforms, like the D-Link Boxee and Google TV. One thing Netflix and Hulu do right is making sure they are ubiquitous as hell.\nWINNER : Tie",

The state Justice Department has appealed that ruling. Still, the judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nFILE - In this March 3, 2006 file photo, Brendan Dassey, is escorted out of a Manitowoc County Circuit courtroom in Manitowoc, Wis. Dassey, whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" was ordered released Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, from federal prison while prosecutors appeal. Dassey's supervised release was not immediate and is contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File)\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency motion with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday asking it to block the release, arguing Dassey's confession was voluntary and that the 27-year-old inmate poses a danger to society.\nDassey's attorneys filed a reply brief late Wednesday arguing that Dassey has behaved well in prison and that the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release.\n ",

      "text": "MILWAUKEE — A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer” is pressing a federal appeals court to let him walk free.\nA federal judge in August overturned Brendan Dassey’s conviction in the 2005 death of photographer Teresa Halbach. The state Justice Department has appealed that ruling. Still, the judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency motion with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday asking it to block the release, arguing Dassey’s confession was voluntary and that the 27-year-old inmate poses a danger to society.\nDassey’s attorneys filed a reply brief late Wednesday arguing that Dassey has behaved well in prison and that the state hasn’t identified any harm that might come from his release.",

      "text": "\n-You can now catch up on the latest season of House of Cards while riding in comfort in the back of your Cadillac. By combining existing technologies including an occupant’s smartphone, a Google Chromecast, and in-car 4G LTE Wi-Fi, the CT6 sedan and Escalade SUV now allow for in-car online streaming video from apps like Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube—because physical media like DVDs and Blu-rays are so passé. \n-The setup will be familiar to anyone who uses a Chromecast or Apple TV device at home. The 2017 CT6 sedan and Escalade SUV both offer rear-seat entertainment screens with an HDMI input. With the Chromecast device plugged in to that input and connected to the car’s Wi-Fi network, passengers can connect a smartphone to the Wi-Fi network and use apps to stream video onto the rear screens—and onto the front infotainment screen if the car is in park. In the CT6, each 10.0-inch screen operates independently, and audio can be played through any combination of the car’s sound system or wireless headphones.\n- - Tested: 2016 Cadillac Escalade Platinum - Ford Patents Windshield Entertainment System - Cadillac CT6 Research: Pricing, Reviews, Specs, and More - -Cadillac is including a free Chromecast device with the purchase of any CT6 that has the rear-seat entertainment option (it costs $2700 on the Premium Luxury trim and is standard on the Platinum trim). The Escalade’s entertainment setup, which is priced at $1720 on Luxury models and is standard on Premium Luxury and Platinum trims, only has one 9.0-inch screen but operates similarly. As of now, Escalade customers don’t get the free Chromecast—but, considering the lofty cost of the luxury SUV they’re purchasing, we think they can probably afford to buy one of the $35 gadgets on their own.\n- \n- ",

      "text": "  \nCan you dig it? Blaxploitation films have a new digital home. \nAfrican-American network Bounce TV is jumping into the subscription VOD biz with Brown Sugar , a $3.99-per-month service with mostly ’70s-era blaxploitation films including “Shaft,”“Foxy Brown,”“Super Fly,”“Cleopatra Jones,”“Blacula” and “The Mack.” \nAt launch, Brown Sugar has 111 movie titles. A rep said several hundred additional titles, for which the company has already obtained streaming rights from studios, will be added in the months ahead. \nThe service is “a black explosion of hot chicks, cool cats and cult classics,” according to Bounce TV, which is promoting Brown Sugar with the tagline “like Netflix, only blacker.” The new SVOD offering joins a growing wave of niche-focused streaming services that have emerged over the past few years, designed to cater to fanbases of specific genres. \nBounce TV has enlisted two legends of the genre — Pam Grier (“Foxy Brown,”“Coffy,”“Black Mama/White Mama”) and Fred “The Hammer” Williamson (“Black Caesar,” “Three The Hard Way,”“Hammer”) — as paid spokespeople for Brown Sugar, along with rap artist and producer Rick Ross. \n“These movies are entertaining and fun, but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time,” Grier said in a statement. \nRick Ross commented, “You can see the influence of these movies in every aspect of rap and hip-hop; in the music, the lyrics, the fashion and overall style — the blaxploitation genre is where it all began.” \nMovies on Brown Sugar are all unedited and commercial-free. The lineup includes “The Mack,”“Foxy Brown,”“Shaft,”“Super Fly,”“Dolemite,”“Cotton Comes to Harlem,”“Uptown Saturday Night,”“Cooley High,”“Three The Hard Way,”“Coffy,”“Black Caesar,”“Five on the Black Hand Side,”“Cleopatra Jones,”“Mandingo,”“Willie Dynamite,”“Which Way is Up?”, “Car Wash” and “The Original Gangstas.” \nBrown Sugar is available for smartphones and tablets in Apple’s iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store and on the web at brownsugar.com . The service offers a one-month free trial period for subscribers with a retail price of $3.99 per month thereafter. \nBrown Sugar groups films into themed collections such as War in Harlem (“Cotton Comes to Harlem,”“The Black Godfather,”“Across 110th Street”), Foxy Mamas (“Foxy Brown,”“Coffy,”“Cleopatra Jones,”“Friday Foster,”“Sheba Baby”), Righteous Revenge (“Dolemite,”“Black Caesar,”“Hell Up in Harlem,”“Hammer”), Stickin’ it to The Man (“The Mack,”“Black Gunn,”“Three the Hard Way”) and Jive-Ass Turkeys (“I’m Gonna Git You Sucka,”“Car Wash,”“Uptown Saturday Night”). \nAtlanta-based Bounce TV, a multicast TV network distributed in markets across the U.S., was founded by Martin Luther King III and Georgia politician Andrew Young.
