      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nGeneral Electric CEO Jeff Immelt spoke at length about what may lie ahead for the business community, the U.S. and the global economy following Donald Trump's presidential victory. \n\"What President Trump will learn is that, as he travels the world, trade deals give him power. The ability to use trade as an economic negotiating technique make him more powerful,\" said Immelt. \n\"If the President of the United States travels around the world, and has nothing to offer from a standpoint of economic connection, you lose half of your negotiating power. And this guy is a negotiator; he's a dealmaker,\" said Immelt. \nIn this wide-ranging conversation from the Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, Immelt also discusses: Policies that could help or impact GE and its businesses How President-elect Trump can jump-start the economy Why globalization cannot be reverted The core values that have allowed GE's culture to flourish \nTo watch the broadcast interview in its entirety, you must be a CNBC PRO subscriber .",

      "text": "New technologies are providing opportunities to look at large datasets and predict how well patients will do. \n[Photo: Flickr user ENERGY.GOV ] Christina Farr 11.15.16 10:00 AM \nWould you trust an algorithm to help you with a medical diagnosis? As hospitals seek out new tools to assist them in triaging the patients most in need, technologies driven by machine learning are expected to make a big impact in the medical sector. \nThe latest company to throw its hat into the ring is General Electric, which is investing big in software and is already known for its medical imaging equipment. The manufacturing giant exclusively shared with Fast Company that it is partnering with UC San Francisco for the next three years to develop a set of algorithms to help its radiologists distinguish between a normal result and one that requires further attention. \n\"There’s tremendous opportunity to look at large datasets, like medical images, to predict how patients will do,\" says UC San Francisco’s director of UCSF’s Center for Digital Health Innovation, Michael Blum. \nIt’s early days, but machine learning and deep learning technologies are already making their way into a small number of medical specialties, including primary care, pathology, and radiology. Radiologists are a particularly hot target for technology companies as they already use advanced software, such as computer-aided detection , to help them spot diseases like cancer from patients’ medical images. \nGE is hoping that this partnership is just the beginning. \"The end result will really be a library of machine and deep learning algorithms that can be applied to imaging,\" says Christopher Austin, GE Healthcare’s global director of imaging analytics, in an interview. \nThe partnership will initially focus on two specific applications: The first is to create an algorithm to detect pneumothorax, or unwanted air or gas in the cavity between the lungs and the chest well. The goal for that project is to speed up the turnaround time from interpreting an X-ray to placing a potentially lifesaving chest tube. The second project involves alerting radiologists to patients whose nasogastric tube—a gastric intubation via the nasal passage—has been placed incorrectly. Once the radiologist checks the image to make a confirmation, a care team can step in to rectify the situation. \nIf these projects are successful, Blum is open to exploring further projects. One area he’s particularly interested in is trauma: How do you distinguish the patients that are most at risk for bad outcomes? \nBoth UCSF and GE stressed that these algorithms are not intended to make radiologists redundant. \"There is a lot of concern from the public and from clinicians that we’ll be developing things to replace doctors,\" says Blum. \"These developments will be focused on supporting clinicians and in developing safer workflows.\" Moreover, the regulatory framework in the U.S. is predicated on a human specialist being present to make a diagnosis. \nGE’s Austin says the company will be releasing some research in the coming years to demonstrate the efficacy of its technology. That will be key to convincing the medical community. Technology vendors will need to invest in clinical trials to demonstrate that the technology is improving patient outcomes. \n\"Technology companies are still in process of thinking about how to deploy and commercialize these technologies, and how to bring them to the health care community,\" says Blum.

In the back and forth, GE defended its disclosures as helpful and relevant to investors. \nIn the last of the letters made public, dated Sept. 30, the SEC told GE it had completed its review of GE's filings and didn't suggest any other action. \nWrite to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-15-161645ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Teledyne Controls and GE Aviation Sign Agreement to Enable More Effective Engine Maintenance Operation \nConnecting aircraft systems and engines to Predix data and analytics November 15, 2016 01:30   \nSAN FRANCISCO- Teledyne Controls, the world’s leading provider of wireless data acquisition and management technology*, and GE Aviation have signed a strategic Digital Alliance partnership to transform engine health monitoring by using GE’s Predix platform to apply data and analytics on continuous flight data wirelessly collected by Teledyne’s technology. \nWillie Cecil, director of Business Development, Wireless and Data Automation Solutions at Teledyne Controls says that predictive maintenance for aircraft is being taken to a completely different level for operators: “Until now, health monitoring has been limited because it has been performed using only a few hundred bytes of data sent from the aircraft via ACARS, which is fairly expensive and has limited bandwidth. \n“Using Teledyne’s GroundLink® patented technology, which leverages higher bandwidth and less expensive cellular wireless networks, several megabytes per flight hour of continuous data can be made available for engine analytics.” \nJohn Nelson, data product manager for GE Aviation, notes the flow of richer, continuous data enables insights into asset condition not previously possible: “Applying physics and data science expertise together, on continuous data, is the recipe to create analytics that enable increased detection lead time, reduce maintenance burden and improve asset availability. \n“The partnership between Teledyne Controls and GE will benefit our customers by simplifying the flow of commercial aircraft flight data to GE’s Predix platform, and enrich the data at speeds and scale enabled by industrial internet technologies.” \nThe new partnership was formally announced at the GE Minds and Machines event in San Francisco on 15/16 November. \nGE is connecting data, developers and Predix, the world’s first and only cloud-based operating system built exclusively for industry. Predix is powering innovative Industrial Internet apps that turn operational data into insight for better and faster decision making. \nAbout Teledyne Controls \nHeadquartered in Southern California, Teledyne Controls LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: TDY). Teledyne Controls is a leading manufacturer and innovator of a wide range of data management solutions designed to help aircraft operators collect, analyze and distribute aircraft data more efficiently. Teledyne Controls maintains worldwide facilities and a global network of field representatives to support its many airline, airframe, and military customers.

      "text": "Teledyne Controls and GE Aviation Sign Agreement to Enable More Effective Engine Maintenance Operation \nConnecting aircraft systems and engines to Predix data and analytics November 15, 2016 01:00   \nSAN FRANCISCO- Teledyne Controls, the world’s leading provider of wireless data acquisition and management technology*, and GE Aviation have signed a strategic Digital Alliance partnership to transform engine health monitoring by using GE’s Predix platform to apply data and analytics on continuous flight data wirelessly collected by Teledyne’s technology. \nWillie Cecil, director of Business Development, Wireless and Data Automation Solutions at Teledyne Controls says that predictive maintenance for aircraft is being taken to a completely different level for operators: “Until now, health monitoring has been limited because it has been performed using only a few hundred bytes of data sent from the aircraft via ACARS, which is fairly expensive and has limited bandwidth. \n“Using Teledyne’s GroundLink® patented technology, which leverages higher bandwidth and less expensive cellular wireless networks, several megabytes per flight hour of continuous data can be made available for engine analytics.” \nJohn Nelson, data product manager for GE Aviation, notes the flow of richer, continuous data enables insights into asset condition not previously possible: “Applying physics and data science expertise together, on continuous data, is the recipe to create analytics that enable increased detection lead time, reduce maintenance burden and improve asset availability. \n“The partnership between Teledyne Controls and GE will benefit our customers by simplifying the flow of commercial aircraft flight data to GE’s Predix platform, and enrich the data at speeds and scale enabled by industrial internet technologies.” \nThe new partnership was formally announced at the GE Minds and Machines event in San Francisco on 15/16 November. \nGE is connecting data, developers and Predix, the world’s first and only cloud-based operating system built exclusively for industry. Predix is powering innovative Industrial Internet apps that turn operational data into insight for better and faster decision making. \nHeadquartered in Southern California, Teledyne Controls LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY). Teledyne Controls is a leading manufacturer and innovator of a wide range of data management solutions designed to help aircraft operators collect, analyze and distribute aircraft data more efficiently. Teledyne Controls maintains worldwide facilities and a global network of field representatives to support its many airline, airframe, and military customers. Additional information about Teledyne Controls can be found at http://www.teledynecontrols.com . \nGE is the world’s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive (NYSE:GE). GE is organized around a global exchange of knowledge, the \"GE Store,\" where each business shares and accesses the same technology, markets, structure and intellect. Each invention further fuels innovation and application across our industrial sectors. With people, services, technology and scale, GE delivers better outcomes for customers by speaking the language of industry. www.geaviation.com/digital \n*Teledyne Controls’ systems are installed on more than 50% of current generation Boeing aircraft and 70% of all Airbus aircraft operating in the commercial aviation industry.

      "text": "GE is on an IoT buying spree Also introduced a system for enterprises to spread out IoT tasks to be more effective. More like this   7:51 AM   \nIt turns out GE Digital’s acquisition of ServiceMax on Monday and its Meridium buy in September weren't the company's only recent moves to expand its industrial IoT expertise. \nTwo deals for small startups, completed recently and announced on Tuesday, add interesting technologies that should help the company develop new capabilities and help enterprises meet challenges in industrial IoT. Both were announced at GE Digital’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco and didn’t come with publicly announced price tags. \nIn mid-October, the company bought Wise.io , a startup that GE says can refine machine-learning algorithms through a process like natural selection. \nIn the industrial world where GE Digital operates, recommendations based on machine learning carry higher stakes than they do on e-commerce sites. Instead of spitting out advice that says you should spend a few dollars on a book, industrial IoT software may recommend removing an engine from an airliner at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n“We have to be very low on the false positives and very low on the false negatives,” said Harel Kodesh, CTO of GE Digital and vice president of Predix, the company’s industrial IoT platform. \nThe way it’s done is to run thousands of possible algorithms to figure out which is best for the job. Wise.io specializes in techniques for carrying out that winnowing process quickly and at a relatively low cost, Kodesh said. \nIt’s also developed ways to do this with relatively sparse data sets. That’s useful because industrial systems are highly reliable and don’t generate many examples of how failures happen, he said. That compares with millions of customer histories that an e-commerce site may have to work with to make a product recommendation. \nLast week, GE Digital also bought Bit Stew Systems , a startup that helps to determine what the bits streaming out of an edge device mean. \nWhen devices like sensors start sending data to IoT systems that are supposed to process it, those systems may not know what the bits represent, Kodesh said. In one packet, one set of bits may represent temperature readings, another pressure readings, and so on. \nGE grapples with this problem when it’s developing new products, and it’s often down to trial and error to parse out the data. This can take months. \nBit Stew’s software can do the same thing in half an hour or less, Kodesh said. It does so by using machine learning to generate hypotheses about what different bits represent and then test them out by looking at other bit streams from the same device. GE also plans to use Bit Stew’s machine-learning technology in other ways and take advantage of a lightweight application generation system from the company, he said. \nSeparately, on Tuesday at its Minds + Machines conference, GE Digital introduced a system for enterprises to spread out IoT tasks to be more effective. \nThe new set of capabilities, called Predix Edge System, turns the company’s cloud-based Predix IoT platform into a distributed operating system. With it, organizations can place each of their IoT applications wherever they will run most effectively, including in sensors, controllers, gateways or the cloud. \n“You have to take advantage of all those compute nodes so you can choose the right tradeoff of latency and cost,” said Harel Kodesh, CTO of GE Digital and vice president of Predix, in an interview. For example, the code that shuts down a pipeline in case of a leak should run as close as possible to the leak sensor rather than up in the cloud, where there will be a longer delay before the shutdown command can reach the site. \nPredix has resided overwhelmingly in the cloud so far, though it has included some software that runs on edge devices to stream data into the cloud. With the addition of Predix Edge System, enterprises that buy Predix will also get a variety of new components that can run elsewhere. For example, some applications, such as software that controls a turbine, will be virtualized so they can run in different places. RELATED TOPICS",

      "title": "GE CEO Jeff Immelt on Trump, job creation, and cybersecurity in the age of the 'Internet of Things' (GE)",
      "text": "print General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nSAN FRANCISCO — Back in August, GE CEO Jeff Immelt criticized Donald Trump over his racist comments on Muslims and Mexicans, calling them \" unacceptable .\" \nNow, Immelt tells Business Insider that while he stands by his view of Trump's comments, he reaffirms that he's only ever had positive interactions with the President-elect, and says he \"[looks] forward to working with him.\" \nAnd there's one issue that Immelt and Trump seem to agree on: There's room for growth in the United States' GDP . From Immelt's standpoint, this is a technology problem. \n\"As our productivity has decreased, so has our GDP growth,\" Immelt tells Business Insider. \nHe's not talking about business productivity, the kind you solve with software like Microsoft Office. He's talking about industrial productivity, from the more efficient manufacturing of goods, to smarter ways of shipping them around the world, to maximizing the yield (and minimizing the environmental impact) when drilling for oil and gas. \nThat's where GE comes in, with its fast-growing software and services business, helping industrial companies modernize and revamp their business models for the digital present. With the so-called \"Internet of Things,\" or IoT, comes the \"reinvention of productivity,\" and new ways for companies to takcle the world's biggest problems, Immelt says. \n\"I think what we have is a big idea,\" says Immelt. Recruiting \nWhen it comes to actually finding that talent, Immelt says that GE's grand vision is actually a big plus. \nFirst, the industrial internet presents the Silicon Valley programmer set with a set of interesting challenges that can only be solved with huge machines, Immelt says. Second, those problems can actually have a huge impact on the real world. \nThat goes all the way up to huge problems like global climate change, which Immelt says can be tackled by the Internet of Things — as connected power plants, factories, and buildings can more intelligently manage their power consumption, and companies build massive power batteries, making sure nothing goes to waste. Facebook/Boeing 'The workforce of the future' \nThe flipside of the trend towards more connected, automated machines, as many have noted, is anxiety that these machines will replace humans, destroying industrial jobs. \nThat's not how Immelt sees it. From his point of view, the shift towards that industrial Internet of Things will actually create higher-paying jobs. \nAs factory equipment, jet turbines, and all the other machines of industry become \"more advanced than they ever have been before,\" he says, it creates opportunities for workers skilled in both the science behind the machines, and the art that goes into programming and running them. \nYouTube/iPhone-Fan \n\"That's the workforce of the future,\" Immelt says. \nTo that end, Immelt says, new employees at GE will spend their first several months splitting their time: 4 hours a day at the office, and 4 hours a day at a local university or community college, either learning about machines or about programming, depending on their skill set. The result is a well-rounded employee who can handle the digital side and the industrial side. \n\"That makes them awesome, that makes them valuable,\" Immelt says. The new business plan \nThere are challenges ahead, Immelt says, as the company works to meet the growing challenges of digital industry. \nFor starters, there's cybersecurity — in October, a hack that took advantage of unsecured Internet of Things devices took the Internet down for the better of the day. It was a huge setback for the concept of the IoT, as consumers and enterprise alike suddenly had cause to rethink their reliance on connected devices. \nImmelt calls this \"mammothly important,\" and says that GE is continually working on shoring up not only its own security, but that of all the partner devices and software that plug into the GE ecosystem of products. \nAgence France-Presse/Kirill Kudryavtsev \nAnother challenge is in figuring out how the IoT affects GE's own business model. With the proliferation of connected devices comes the chance to explore new ways of generating revenue . For instance, GE itself is famous for charging not for its jet turbines themselves, but rather billing the airlines per pound of thrust generated. \nImmelt says that the company is still figuring out how that kind of business model interplays with its more traditional business models: Selling equipment, and selling the services required to maintain and monitor it. With the IoT so new, Immelt doesn't want to commit to privileging any one model over the other two. \n\"I think we gotta take this as it goes,\" Immelt says.

      "text": "print General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nSAN FRANCISCO — Back in August, GE CEO Jeff Immelt criticized Donald Trump over his racist comments on Muslims and Mexicans, calling them \" unacceptable .\" \nNow, Immelt tells Business Insider that while he stands by his view of Trump's comments, he reaffirms that he's only ever had positive interactions with the President-elect, and says he \"[looks] forward to working with him.\" \nAnd there's one issue that Immelt and Trump seem to agree on: There's room for growth in the United States' GDP . From Immelt's standpoint, this is a technology problem. \n\"As our productivity has decreased, so has our GDP growth,\" Immelt tells Business Insider. \nHe's not talking about business productivity, the kind you solve with software like Microsoft Office. He's talking about industrial productivity, from the more efficient manufacturing of goods, to smarter ways of shipping them around the world, to maximizing the yield (and minimizing the environmental impact) when drilling for oil and gas. \nThat's where GE comes in, with its fast-growing software and services business, helping industrial companies modernize and revamp their business models for the digital present. With the so-called \"Internet of Things,\" or IoT, comes the \"reinvention of productivity,\" and new ways for companies to takcle the world's biggest problems, Immelt says. \n\"I think what we have is a big idea,\" says Immelt. Recruiting \nWhen it comes to actually finding that talent, Immelt says that GE's grand vision is actually a big plus. \nFirst, the industrial internet presents the Silicon Valley programmer set with a set of interesting challenges that can only be solved with huge machines, Immelt says. Second, those problems can actually have a huge impact on the real world. \nThat goes all the way up to huge problems like global climate change, which Immelt says can be tackled by the Internet of Things — as connected power plants, factories, and buildings can more intelligently manage their power consumption, and companies build massive power batteries, making sure nothing goes to waste. Facebook/Boeing 'The workforce of the future' \nThe flipside of the trend towards more connected, automated machines, as many have noted, is anxiety that these machines will replace humans, destroying industrial jobs. \nThat's not how Immelt sees it. From his point of view, the shift towards that industrial Internet of Things will actually create higher-paying jobs. \nAs factory equipment, jet turbines, and all the other machines of industry become \"more advanced than they ever have been before,\" he says, it creates opportunities for workers skilled in both the science behind the machines, and the art that goes into programming and running them. \nYouTube/iPhone-Fan \n\"That's the workforce of the future,\" Immelt says. \nTo that end, Immelt says, new employees at GE will spend their first several months splitting their time: 4 hours a day at the office, and 4 hours a day at a local university or community college, either learning about machines or about programming, depending on their skill set. The result is a well-rounded employee who can handle the digital side and the industrial side. \n\"That makes them awesome, that makes them valuable,\" Immelt says. The new business plan \nThere are challenges ahead, Immelt says, as the company works to meet the growing challenges of digital industry. \nFor starters, there's cybersecurity — in October, a hack that took advantage of unsecured Internet of Things devices took the Internet down for the better of the day. It was a huge setback for the concept of the IoT, as consumers and enterprise alike suddenly had cause to rethink their reliance on connected devices. \nImmelt calls this \"mammothly important,\" and says that GE is continually working on shoring up not only its own security, but that of all the partner devices and software that plug into the GE ecosystem of products. \nAgence France-Presse/Kirill Kudryavtsev \nAnother challenge is in figuring out how the IoT affects GE's own business model. With the proliferation of connected devices comes the chance to explore new ways of generating revenue . For instance, GE itself is famous for charging not for its jet turbines themselves, but rather billing the airlines per pound of thrust generated. \nImmelt says that the company is still figuring out how that kind of business model interplays with its more traditional business models: Selling equipment, and selling the services required to maintain and monitor it. With the IoT so new, Immelt doesn't want to commit to privileging any one model over the other two. \n\"I think we gotta take this as it goes,\" Immelt says.",

      "text": "Teledyne Controls and GE Aviation Sign Agreement to Enable More Effective Engine Maintenance Operation [November 15, 2016] Tweet \nTeledyne Controls, the world's leading provider of wireless data acquisition and management technology*, and GE Aviation have signed a strategic Digital Alliance partnership to transform engine health monitoring by using GE's Predix platform to apply data and analytics on continuous flight data wirelessly collected by Teledyne's technology. \nWillie Cecil, director of Business Development, Wireless and Data Automation Solutions at Teledyne Controls says that predictive maintenance for aircraft is being taken to a completely different level for operators: \"Until now, health monitoring has been limited because it has been performed using only a few hundred bytes of data sent from the aircraft via ACARS, which is fairly expensive and has limited bandwidth. \n\"Using Teledyne's GroundLink® patented technology, which leverages higher bandwidth and less expensive cellular wireless networks, several megabytes per flight hour of continuous data can be made available for engine analytics.\" \nJohn Nelson, data product manager for GE Aviation, notes the flow of richer, continuous data enables insights into asset condition not previously possible: \"Applying physics and data science expertise together, on continuous data, is the recipe to create analytics that enable increased detection lead time, reduce maintenance burden and improve asset availability. \n\"The partnership between Teledyne Controls and GE will benefit our customer by simplifying the flow of commercial aircraft flight data to GE's Predix platform, and enrich the data at speeds and scale enabled by industrial internet technologies.\" \nThe new partnership was formally announced at the GE Minds and Machines event in San Francisco on 15/16 November. \nGE is connecting data, developers and Predix, the world's first and only cloud-based operating system built exclusively for industry. Predix is powering innovative Industrial Internet apps that turn operational data into insight for better and faster decision making. \nHeadquartered in Southern California, Teledyne Controls LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY). Teledyne Controls is a leading manufacturer and innovator of a wide range of data management solutions designed to help aircraft operators collect, analyze and distribute aircraft data more efficiently. Teledyne Controls maintains worldwide facilities and a global network of field representatives to support its many airline, airframe, and military customers. Additional information about Teledyne Controls can be found at http://www.teledynecontrols.com . \nGE is the world's Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive (NYSE:GE).

      "text": "There’s no greater indication of industrial behemoth General Electric’s desire to morph into a Silicon Valley software company than its annual technology conference.\nDuring the company’s two-day show in San Francisco on Tuesday morning, GE’s CEO Jeff Immelt took the stage and asked the audience “Why not us. . . Why can’t we make ourselves into a digital company?”\nThe company is “all in,” Immelt says, on crafting itself in the image of a tech and computing disruptor, which includes becoming a “top 10” software company by 2020.\nTo achieve this goal, GE is investing heavily in building software and wireless capability to connect machines like wind turbines, trains, and jet engines. But it’s also buying the latest algorithms and machine learning know-how to better monitor and control those machines.\nFor more on GE’s CEO Jeff Immelt on his biggest mistakes watch our video.\nIn true Silicon Valley-style on Tuesday, GE announced that it had acquired two artificial intelligence startups, Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io. The move will enable GE to compete with IBM’s own artificial intelligent Watson product that can help customers make predictions and answer questions.\nGE has acquired about $2 billion worth of tech startups over the last several years, including more recently cloud company ServiceMax and analytics company Meridium .\nTech conferences are de rigueur for the biggest San Francisco area Internet companies like Facebook, Salesforce , Google , and Apple . GE’s has the same bells and whistles including keynotes meant to inspire and slick visual presentations.\nGE’s Immelt focused a lot on the term productivity in his kick-off speech. Essentially the type of technology used is irrelevant, but rather it’s whether GE’s customers like oil giant BP want to buy and use GE’s software to make their operations more productive.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nSome are starting to. Customers like BP are going through their own disruption, as BP’s Ahmed Hashmi said shortly after Immelt’s talk. “Our industry needs a transformation, and digital is our biggest lever,” said Hashmi.\nGE calls its transformation the “industrial Internet,” and it’s a way that it can keep its machines connected, smart, updated and increasingly productive. A major investment to connect these machines is GE’s Predix software , which extracts and crunches data from machines and uses that data to make them more efficiently, saving GE’s customers money, time, and energy.\nOver the last year, GE launched Predix externally to its customers, and before that the company was using it internally. GE also launched an energy efficiency system called Current and is investing in additive manufacturing, commonly called 3D printing.\nGE hopes that its overall annual software sales, which includes sales of Predix, will grow from $5 billion in 2015 to $15 billion by 2020.\nAt the end of the day, using software and wireless connections to make machines more productive is all about combining physics and analytics, said Immelt. “The merger of physics and the digital world will lead the future,” he added.\nFor GE, it’s a huge investment. But it is also somewhat of a risk. This is a “transformation not a task,” and an “all-encompassing change,” said Immelt.",

      "text": "Samsung Buys Auto Tech Firm Harman for $8B \nGE Digital has been building up Predix, a software platform aimed at helping GE’s industrial customers like utilities and airlines gather and analyze data to better manage their equipment and achieve greater efficiencies. Customer orders for GE software solutions are expected to grow more than 25% to more than $7 billion this year, according to the company. \nA day earlier, GE announced it would acquire ServiceMax, which makes apps for service functions like inventory management and workforce scheduling, for $915 million. \nGE Digital CEO Bill Ruh said the acquisitions would provide companies with the “tools they need to embark on their own digital industrial transformations.” \n“The Industrial Internet is profoundly transforming how we operate and our ability to deliver greater productivity for GE and for our customers,” he said in a news release. “Connected machines, coupled with deep machine learning, are more powerful than anything we have seen.” \nBit Stew, which was founded in 2009, applies machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to automate data modeling, mapping and ingestion. It raised $17.2 million last year from investors including GE Ventures. \nMachine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. The customers for Wise.io’s technology include Pinterest, Twilio, and Thumbtack. \nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, GE is aiming to hit $15 billion in software sales by 2020, with roughly half of that revenue coming from sales of Predix applications to the electricity industry \n“GE’s vision of a software-defined future strongly aligns with Bit Stew’s vision and capabilities and we are excited about the pivotal role our technology can play in driving the industrial ecosystem forward,” Bit Stew co-founder Kevin Collins said.

      "text": " Current, powered by GE\nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. Current, powered by GE (NYSE: GE) today introduced a new digital energy management solution for commercial and industrial facilities. The new tool, which is built on Predix*, GE's operating system for the Industrial Internet, is already being used by national customers including McDonald's and Simon Property Group. From lighting to HVAC systems, restaurants, retailers, warehouses and commercial businesses can use the solution to see exactly where and when energy is being used in real time, while powerful software enables not only historic, but also predictive and prescriptive analytics.\n\"This tool is a perfect example of the optimization enabled through the power of the Industrial Internet,\" said Maryrose Sylvester , President & CEO of Current, powered by GE. \"Energy is one of the largest overhead costs to any business, and customers are looking for a holistic, simple way to manage energy smarter. As we integrate sensors and software across systems, businesses can transform the way they see and optimize not only their energy use, but also their operational productivity.\"\nIncreasingly, entities are seeing the benefits of building automation and are seeking out connectivity. Current, which acquired controls provider Daintree Networks earlier this year , is integrating intelligence via infrastructure like LEDs, and its new app harnesses the power of data beyond energy savings.\nCustomers across a variety of industries are already realizing the energy-saving potential of this intelligent app, with pilot installations for customers already underway.\n\"At McDonald's, we aspire to deliver exceptional service for both our internal and external customers. We are always interested in technologies that can improve our capabilities and operational KPIs while enhancing the customer experience,\" said James Floyd , V.P.- U.S. Operations, McDonald's Corporation. \"Current's EMS tool provides actionable analytics around energy use, but also offers insights into additional dimensions that enhance our customers experience. This intelligence provides infinite possibilities that include optimizing labor, reducing operational tension and improving overall efficiencies and effectiveness at the restaurants, all while creating sustainable, profitable growth. By benchmarking 'Best in Class' companies like GE and Current, we generate thinking that leads to new growth and provides us a competitive advantage in the industry.\"\nThe new energy management software is also being piloted with Simon Property Group, a global leader in retail real estate ownership, management and development for shopping malls retail properties across the U.S.\n\"This connected, real-time view of how, when and where energy is being used enables our site managers to take actions to reduce and shift energy away from the grid during peak periods, saving significant monthly costs,\" said Michael Romstad , Executive Vice President of Property Management for Simon Property Group. \"We've already installed efficient solutions such as LEDs at several Simon properties, which are providing significant energy savings and significantly better lighting levels. We estimate the energy management solution will help us reduce consumption across the board at The Westchester mall by about 20 percent.\"\nThe intelligent energy application was introduced during Minds + Machines, GE's premier event for the digital industrial sector.

(Published 5 hours ago) If you have a helicopter, you might be able to park it in Boston one day. The city council has scheduled a public hearing to review a proposal that would construct a helipad or heliport somewhere in the Boston. It's part of a deal struck with General Electric, which has plans to move its headquarters from Connecticut to Boston. Trump Set to Roll Back Policies on Energy, Environment As part of an incentive package, state and city leaders offered GE the space to create a commercial helicopter pad with 24/7 access for the company. \"We need to know more about where they're looking to put it,\" said City Councilor at Large Michael Flaherty. NYC's Trump Place Drops Name After Tenants Petition: Property Manager GE's new offices would go in the Fort Point neighborhood of South Boston, which has resulted in concern from local residents about a helicopter pad going nearby. Councilman Flaherty said while the city wants to work with the company, they also want to ensure flight patters don’t disrupt people on the ground. \"If they're willing to be flexible, I'm sure we can put our heads together and try to find an appropriate location,\" he explained. The public meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.

      "title": "GE unveils new Predix Industrial IoT solutions",
      "text": "At its Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco yesterday, General Electric Corp. unveiled a slew of new services and solutions for its cloud-based Predix Industrial Internet of Things platform, designed to bring “visibility, control and analytic insights to every part of industrial infrastructure and operations.”\nGE said the new solutions can run on a range of operating systems, devices and form factors, including sensors, gateway controllers, server appliances and cloud platforms. At the event, GE also predicted that its Predix platform would be used by 20,000 developers by the end of this year, as it continues to position itself as a provider of next-generation Industrial IoT infrastructure.\nGE’s new Predix systems and solutions for the Industrial IoT include GE Current, a new product designed for digital energy management which is able to analyze and optimize energy usage and efficiency in lighting, HVAC and other systems. The solution is aimed at restaurants, retailers and other commercial businesses that wish to gain insights on how much energy is being used in real-time, GE said. Using the software, customers can perform historical, predictive and prescriptive analytics.\nA related solution is GE Energy Connections’ Digital Substation, which is essentially GE’s Asset Performance Management software redesigned for electricity grids. In its pitch, GE notes that around eight percent of all electricity generated never actually reaches customers due to outages, and says the new solution is aimed at boosting reliability to prevent such incidents from happening.\nOther solutions aimed at boosting efficiency in the energy sector include GE Power’s new Digital Power Plant software for gas, steam and nuclear power stations. GE says the software helps to reduce unplanned downtime by up to five percent, decrease operations and maintenance costs by around 25 percent, and cut false positive alerts by up to 75 percent. Then there’s GE Renewable Energy’s Digital Hydro Plant, which is a suite of applications integrated with GE hardware for customers in the hydroelectric power industry. GE said the solution compliments its Digital Wind Farm, Digital Power Plant for Gas and Digital Power Plant for Steam solutions, and should help companies in these industries to slash maintenance costs by up to 10 percent, increase plant availability by one percent, and revenues by up to three percent.\nLast but not least, GE touted a new Asset Performance Management (APM) solution for the oil and gas sector that enables continuous inspection data and cloud-based analytics of pipeline conditions. The solution can help operators to improve uptime, manage corrosion risks and minimize their total cost of operations, GE said.\n“In just the past year, we’ve seen more than 30 international, state and private power producers and utilities begin their digital journeys with GE,” said Ganesh Bell, chief digital officer, GE Power. “Today’s announcements represent another major step forward in the digitalization of the industry. I believe we will look back on 2016 as a tipping point when digital transformation went mainstream.”\nGE’s product announcements were followed by the news its acquired two more Internet of Things startups – namely Wise.io, which specializes in predictive intelligence, and Bit Stew, which offers a data intelligence platform powered by machine learning that integrates data between industrial connected devices and external systems.\nGE’s Minds + Machines event this week in San Francisco will look at the current state of IoT. SiliconANGLE’s video unit theCUBE is covering the event with exclusive interviews with GE and other executives.",

      "text": "Blog This \nTeledyne Controls, the world’s leading provider of wireless data acquisition and management technology*, and GE Aviation have signed a strategic Digital Alliance partnership to transform engine health monitoring by using GE’s Predix platform to apply data and analytics on continuous flight data wirelessly collected by Teledyne’s technology. \nWillie Cecil, director of Business Development, Wireless and Data Automation Solutions at Teledyne Controls says that predictive maintenance for aircraft is being taken to a completely different level for operators: “Until now, health monitoring has been limited because it has been performed using only a few hundred bytes of data sent from the aircraft via ACARS, which is fairly expensive and has limited bandwidth. \n“Using Teledyne’s GroundLink® patented technology, which leverages higher bandwidth and less expensive cellular wireless networks, several megabytes per flight hour of continuous data can be made available for engine analytics.” \nJohn Nelson, data product manager for GE Aviation, notes the flow of richer, continuous data enables insights into asset condition not previously possible: “Applying physics and data science expertise together, on continuous data, is the recipe to create analytics that enable increased detection lead time, reduce maintenance burden and improve asset availability. \n“The partnership between Teledyne Controls and GE will benefit our customers by simplifying the flow of commercial aircraft flight data to GE’s Predix platform, and enrich the data at speeds and scale enabled by industrial internet technologies.” \nThe new partnership was formally announced at the GE Minds and Machines event in San Francisco on 15/16 November. \nGE is connecting data, developers and Predix, the world’s first and only cloud-based operating system built exclusively for industry. Predix is powering innovative Industrial Internet apps that turn operational data into insight for better and faster decision making. \nAbout Teledyne Controls \nHeadquartered in Southern California, Teledyne Controls LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: TDY). Teledyne Controls is a leading manufacturer and innovator of a wide range of data management solutions designed to help aircraft operators collect, analyze and distribute aircraft data more efficiently.

      "text": "SEATTLE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product.\nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed.\nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world,\" Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview.\nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming.\nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site.\nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "title": "GE, BP Launch 'Fitbit' for Oil, Gas Assets",
      "text": "Tweet \nA new digital technology solution offers oil and gas companies a “Fitbit” for tracking the health of their offshore assets. \nBP plc and General Electric (GE) are testing a new digital platform technology at BP’s Atlantis platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This solution, Plant Operations Advisor (POA), is designed to improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of oil and gas operations by livestreaming more than 20 million digital data points. Following BP’s pilot program in the Gulf of Mexico, POA will be deployed to other BP facilities worldwide in 2017, the companies said in a joint Nov. 15 press statement. \nPOA will help prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability by helping engineering teams respond quickly to issues as they happen in real-time, the companies said in the release. The tool utilizes GE’s Predix and Asset Performance Management (APM) capabilities to quickly integrate operational data from producing oil and gas facilities to deliver notifications and analytical reports to engineers. This will allow engineers to pinpoint operational performance issues before they become significant. \nGE’s POA aims to enhance operations by: Improving operating efficiency by 2 to 4 percent Offering simplified access to a variety of live data feeds and include visualization capabilities, including a real-time facility threat display Incorporating extensive case management capability to support learnings from prior operational issues \nGE plans to offer the technology on both individual pieces of equipment as well as entire production systems, as an APM solution that will be available across the oil and gas industry, GE and BP said in the Nov. 15 release. \n“BP gravitates toward new technologies, especially digital, and that makes working with them particularly exciting,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, GE Oil & Gas president and CEO, in the Nov. 15 release. “We are taking a big step forward together during this time of digital transformation, deploying what we’ve co-created over the past year to drive the kind of productivity improvements that the oil and gas industry needs.” \nThe deployment is expected to be the largest-scale employment of GE’s Predix-powered APM technology to date, Simonelli added. \nPOA, which combines Big Data, cloud hosting, and analytics, was created as part of a development partnership BP and GE announced Jan. 28 of this year. \nSimonelli said in a Jan. 28 press release that “digitization has become not only a competitive differentiator but increasingly, a necessity. We are evolving our business and digital offerings to match the needs of our customers, partnering with them to embrace the transition and help make their businesses stronger long-term.” \nOil and gas companies have been looking at digital technology as a way to derive more value from data and information. \nSpeaking at GE’s Minds + Machines Conference Tuesday in San Francisco, Ahmed Hashmi, BP’s vice president of Upstream Technology, said that digital technologies can allow oil and gas companies to have their cake and eat it too. But oil and gas companies need to make a significant investment in digital technology, and also change their workflows and mindsets. Hashmi said that his role at BP has completely changed; today, most of his group’s investment is going into digital technology. \nBP has had a long history of investing in different types of digital technology. Twenty years ago, the company invested in Big Data for seismic. That was the company’s first big wave of change. This was followed by investment in 2D seismic, then 3D modelling for reservoir simulation, then high performance computing. These investments have established the foundation for digital technology. \n“What you’re seeing now is the transformation of how we run our company, how we operate our assets, conduct maintenance, how we make sense of data,” Hashmi told conference attendees. \nBP is working with GE to gain more insight from its data. Right now, only 5 percent of the data coming off of BP’s platforms yields anything meaningful. Karen Boman has more than 10 years of experience covering the upstream oil and gas sector.

      "text": "An aerial view of the dewatering plant in Fort Edward, as seen in 2009. editor's pick featured Large manufacturer interested in GE dewatering site Fort Edward supervisor says announcement planned in next two weeks Post-Star file photo \nAn aerial view of the dewatering plant in Fort Edward, as seen in 2009. \nFORT EDWARD — A “big” manufacturing business with “a lot” of jobs wants to move into the former General Electric sediment dewatering facility, and the proposal is drawing financial support from the state. \nFort Edward Supervisor Mitch Suprenant met with state officials and company representatives Monday but was sworn to secrecy. \n“I know what product they’re making, the name of the company, but I can’t say,” he said. “It’ll be big. That’s all I can say.” \nThe company will be announced in the next two weeks, he said. He also said state officials promised financial help. But no dollar figures or job estimates have been announced. \n“A lot of jobs. The number hasn’t been confirmed, so I shouldn’t say how many,” Suprenant said. \nHe’s eager to seal the deal. That means solving the longstanding issue of the road that leads to the site. \nThe road was built for the dredging project. It stretches from Kingsbury to Fort Edward, along the canal. The county Board of Supervisors refused to take the road, and the EPA can’t give it to the private company that owns the land on which the dewatering facility was built. EPA must give it to the towns, the county or the state. WCC, LLC would continue to own the land and lease it to the unnamed manufacturing company. \nKingsbury officials have been uninterested in taking their part of the road, but the Fort Edward Town Board would take the part that is in the town, Suprenant said. \nThe only problem is that Fort Edward doesn’t have a truck entrance on its side. Using the Fort Edward side of the road means using East Street, which isn’t suitable for trucks, Suprenant said. So he has been looking for alternatives, including building a railroad crossing near Towpath Lane. \nThe town would have to build a short stretch of road, crossing the railroad and connecting to the existing road to the former dewatering facility. The town would have to get permission from CP Rail for the crossing, which might not be easy. CP Rail has opposed such requests, except when absolutely necessary, Suprenant said. \nIn his scenario, trucks would use McIntyre Street and then cross the railroad to get to the site. \n“We’re going to figure out something,” Suprenant said. “With GE going down, losing those jobs, we certainly need to provide jobs.” \nHe had abandoned the effort to get the county to take over the road after the supervisors voted against it in June. But when he heard about the manufacturing company, he tried again last week. \nHe and other supervisors got into a shouting match over the issue, with Suprenant deeply frustrated because he sees the new development as a crucial need for the town. \n“It’s big, and we need to make it work,” he said. \nYou can reach Kathleen Moore at 742-3247 or .

      "text": "  Download Current Issue \nIndustrial giant GE has announced two strategic acquisitions: Wise.io, a machine learning specialist, and Bit Stew for data ingestion. \nThe company has already made acquisitions worth $2bn and has a strategy to grow its business organically and inorganically. \nGE’s latest acquisitions build on its $915m purchase of field service company ServiceMax and its $496m acquisition of asset performance management company Meridium.   Watch out – artificial intelligence (AI) is going to steal your job! \nAccess the latest thinking in AI and machine learning, and look at how these technologies could help your IT department   \nBuying software and services companies are part of GE’s goal to bolster the company’s flagship digital platform, Predix. \nIn his opening keynote presentation at the Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, GE CEO Jeff Immelt said: “A common platform is very well known by tech companies.” \nBut this is a new concept for industrial companies, which are struggling to improve productivity. GE hopes it can provide the software platform and services, and bring together a partner ecosystem, to help them succeed. \nImmelt said: “We have never seen the power of an industrial-to-industrial world, a network to share ideas for the future. It is a transformation, an all-encompassing change. Our job is to create more productivity through a combination of analytics and physics.” \nSpeaking of his focus on making GE a software firm, Immelt said: “We are in it to win, and we are committed to be successful.” \nIt is all about being a success in industrial software in the emerging world of connected machines, he said. \nGE’s chief digital officer, Bill Ruh, who heads GE Digital, the company’s software arm, said: “The winner figures out how to take an asset and make it more efficient. I don’t think this will be a world led by startups, but by industrial companies, small, medium and large. It is not about being cool; it is about productivity in your business and differentiating your products in a way your competitors can’t.” GE eyes software giants \nThe competition GE has its eyes on are the traditional software giants. IBM is applying deep learning in Watson to understand and predict the behaviour of machines. As Computer Weekly has reported previously, Watson is one of the technologies that French rail operator SNCF is looking at to help it predict train and track maintenance needs. Global ticketing system Amadeus is also looking at using Watson to ensure it can operate 24/7 without downtime. \nEarlier in November at the Gartner Symposium in Barcelona, Gartner fellow Mark Raskino said: “Every industry will be digitally remastered. Every company will compete as part of a business ecosystem.” \nGartner expects many industries to collaborate on building a digital platform that supports a partner ecosystem. Ecosystems are the next evolution of digital, says the analyst firm. Such ecosystems do exist in the software world, driven by de facto standards and open application programming interfaces. \nEarlier this year, GE introduced a partner programme to bolster the Predix ecosystem. Companies exhibiting at Minds + Machines include big industry players such as HPE and Dell, several IT services companies and major consultancy firms, as well as startups, all building businesses on top of GE Predix . \nRuh believes GE has the edge. “We will see industrial companies lead the way in platforms,” he said. \nGE has devised the concept of a “digital twin”, representing a simulation of a real-life industrial asset, such as a turbine or a power station. Rather than IBM’s approach of applying deep learning to understand the data coming out of these machines, Ruh said GE is combining AI and statistics with physics-based modelling. “This is what you do with AI to create value,” he said. Read more aboiut GE Predix Global manufacturer GE has established a partner programme for its Predix platform to drive the value of analytics across the industrial internet. \nThe goal is the same – to predict machine failures before they happen – but GE claims it can simulate the operating environment of real machines. The theory is that if the digital twin develops a fault, so will its real-life counterpart. Ruh said the company is currently running 550,000 digital twins. \nOil company BP is one of GE’s Predix customers. Ahmed Hashmi, global vice-president of upstream technology at BP, said: “Digital is the biggest driver we have. Digital offers you the opportunity to improve the top line, drive efficiency and improve reliability and safety. You have to go big, change workflows and mindset.” \nAddressing delegates at the GE event, Hashmi said BP has always been a pioneer with technology, and digital is its next step. The company began using 2D seismic analysis two decades ago, he said, and then moved to 3D seismic analysis powered by high-performance computing. \nThese techniques were used to identify potential oil and gas reserves, said Hashmi. Now the company is looking at how to operate its assets more efficiently. “Today, only 5% of data coming out of platforms is being used,” he said. Oil platform pilot \nLast week, BP began a pilot project on its Atlantis offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico using Predix Asset Performance Management, with a custom dashboard co-developed with GE. \nThe software, called GE Plant Operations Advisor, works a bit like an IT security dashboard, identifying vulnerabilities via a real-time facility threat display. \nIt shows BP’s oil platform operators potential problems that could lead to a platform going offline or operating less efficiently. \n“We are looking at all the data we gather today for hidden insight and we want to be able to act on it quickly,” said Hashmi. \nBP hopes to roll out the software globally, making it the biggest deployment of GE’s Predix APM tool. Hashmi added: “When fully deployed, these advanced digital technologies will change the way we work and improve the integrity and performance of our assets around the globe.” \nGE Digital is a $6bn business, which makes it a significant player in the software market. Arguably, its platform for internet-connected machines is ahead of its time. The backing from software companies and IT consultancies at Minds + Machines shows than the IT industry is looking closely at its CEO’s next step.  ",

      "text": "GE, UCSF ink deep-learning partnership By AuntMinnie.com staff writers \n  GE Healthcare and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI) are teaming up to develop a library of deep-learning algorithms. \nInitially, the collaboration is focusing on areas of high-volume and high-impact medical imaging to create algorithms that distinguish between what is considered a normal result and what requires follow-up, according to UCSF and GE. For example, one algorithm currently being developed will focus on pneumothorax, teaching machines how to distinguish between normal and abnormal imaging studies so that clinicians can prioritize and move quickly to treat patients with this life-threatening condition. \nOther planned algorithms will offer the potential for tasks such as predicting patient trajectories, automating the triage of routine care, improving process efficiency, and enabling the development of more personalized therapies, UCSF and GE said. The goal is to help providers improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes, as well as enhance clinical workflows and productivity, they said. \n\"Next-generation data science techniques have already transformed the industrial and consumer world,\" UCSF CDHI Director Dr. Michael Blum said in a statement. \"With this collaboration, these technologies will be applied to our clinical data and images to provide clinicians with actionable information in near real-time. Together, we will develop tools and algorithms that will allow clinicians and researchers to identify problems and ask questions that are only achievable with vast computing power and datasets.\" \nThese algorithms can be deployed worldwide via the GE Health Cloud and \"smart\" GE imaging machines to share the research with clinicians around the world, UCSF and GE said. As the partnership progresses, they will integrate data from a variety of imaging technologies and also incorporate clinical datasets from the electronic health record and other sources to enrich the development of algorithms and improve sensitivity.

      "text": "ANSYS Collaborates With GE to Drive Digital Twin Value and Deliver the Promise of the Industrial Internet of Things Collaboration to scale the development and deployment of the model-based digital twin News provided by Nov 16, 2016, 07:10   PITTSBURGH , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ANSYS (NASDAQ: ANSS ) announced today that it will collaborate with GE to create model-based digital twin technology and disruptive commercial business models to deliver on the promise of the Industrial Internet of Things. This builds on an existing relationship between the two companies. ANSYS will demonstrate a variety of industry-specific digital twins at GE 's (NYSE: GE ) Minds + Machines event in San Francisco , dedicated to building the digital industrial ecosystem. Simulation technology is no longer solely used by engineers to design better products and reduce the costs of physical testing. Leading organizations are expanding the use of simulation into operations by creating digital twins – virtual representations of individual operating assets whose performance and productivity can be improved dynamically through simulation technology. Coupling the rich sensor data from increasingly smart industrial equipment with the predictive power of simulation, specific operating conditions can be analyzed and failure points predicted, unlocking billions of dollars in production and maintenance optimization. Digital twins can live with the asset, providing a dynamic self-teaching model used to optimize its performance in conjunction with an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform. This combination of machine learning, coupled with physics-based modeling, enables organizations to see how their products performed in the past and predict the future simultaneously. Using ANSYS to create model-based digital twins will provide a foundation to scaling the benefits of the IIoT. This is no longer a theoretic concept as ANSYS and GE Global Research are already demonstrating actual implementation of digital twins, like the GuardEon Molded Case Circuit Breaker , a powerful low-voltage circuit breaker designed for global industry applications. By using ANSYS software, GE engineers are able to study and test complex physics at a level of detail that was impossible to achieve through physical testing. \"Pairing physics and analytics models via the digital twin is essential to providing our customers with the 360 degree insights they need to create competitive advantage in a rapidly changing world,\" said Eric Bantegnie, ANSYS vice president. \"We are excited to be taking another step forward in our long-standing partnership with GE.\" Through this collaboration, ANSYS will work with GE Digital, GE Global Research and GE's industrial businesses to expand and integrate ANSYS' leading physics-based engineering simulation and embedded software development platform with GE's Predix platform to power digital twin solutions across a wide range of industries. Scaling digital twin solutions from the edge to the cloud will accelerate the value of ANSYS simulation, drive Predix adoption and open new opportunities to explore disruptive business models and commercial relationships. \"We are building the digital industrial ecosystem to drive better outcomes for our customer through the Predix platform,\" said John Magee , Chief Marketing Officer, Predix. \"ANSYS is the market leader in physics-based simulation, and we are pleased to work with them to scale model-based digital twin solutions on Predix to provide our customers with new insights that were not possible before.\" About ANSYS, Inc.

      "text": "16 November 2016 Abstract \nThe lattice thermal conductivity (κ) of hexagonal Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (h-GST) is studied via direct first-principles calculations. We find significant intrinsic anisotropy ( κ a / κ c ~2) of κ in bulk h-GST, with the dominant contribution to κ from optic phonons, ~75%. This is extremely unusual as the acoustic phonon modes are the majority heat carriers in typical semiconductors and insulators. The anisotropy derives from varying bonding along different crystal directions, specifically from weak interlayer bonding along the c- axis, which gives anisotropic phonon dispersions. The phonon spectrum of h-GST has very dispersive optic branches with higher group velocities along the a- axis as compared to flat optic bands along the c- axis. The large optic mode contributions to the thermal conductivity in low-κ h-GST is unusual, and development of fundamental physical understanding of these contributions may be critical to better understanding of thermal conduction in other complex layered materials. Introduction \nPhase change memory devices exploit thermally induced transformations between different phases of phase change materials (PCMs) where thermal and thermoelectric properties of PCMs are of central importance. Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST), a prototypical phase change material, has been widely studied 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 in this context due to its fast switching speed 11 and large changes in electrical and optical properties upon phase transformation. Recently, Lee et al . 5 reported anisotropic thermal conduction of GST thin films with in-plane film values significantly different from cross-plane film values for cubic and hexagonal phases and noted a varying conductivity with annealing time of the samples. They reported that cross-film conduction is favored by up to 54% due to thermal resistance of amorphous regions near grain boundaries 5 . All of the GST phases (cubic, hexagonal and amorphous) exhibit low thermal conductivity, and it has been shown that the thermal properties in thin film samples vary significantly with sample thickness attributed to boundary scattering and microstructure 8 . As thin film samples have varying degrees of extrinsic defects and microstructure, it is not clear whether there is intrinsic thermal conductivity anisotropy in bulk h-GST, anisotropy due solely to the hexagonal structure. In addition, h-GST has been shown to exhibit good thermoelectric properties 12 , 13 , 14 , though thermal conductivity studies particularly in bulk h-GST are limited. \nIdentifying mechanisms for obtaining low thermal conductivity and modification of materials to obtain it, e.g. , by nanostructuring and alloying, is an important part of thermoelectrics research. This typically focusses on scattering of heat carrying acoustic phonons 15 . Optic phonon contributions are often negligible due to their typically low group velocities and short lifetimes 16 , 17 , even in cases where they comprise a large fraction of the total modes in complex crystals. An exception is the nuclear fuel, UO 2 , where the longitudinal optic branch was reported to be important 18 . Recently it has been shown that optic mode contributions can become important in other materials of interest for thermoelectric applications, e.g. , PbTe (22%) and PbSe (25%) 19 , Mg 2 Si (30%) and Mg 2 Sn (18%) 20 . Here we examine the lattice dynamical properties of h-GST from first principles and connect these to its lattice thermal conductivity by direct calculations. We find κ values consistent with measured data. Importantly we find that in h-GST the optic phonons are the dominant heat carriers (~75%) at room temperature, and that these modes significantly affect the behavior of κ for different transport directions. We find significant intrinsic thermal conductivity anisotropy arising from the hexagonal structure and optical phonon contributions. This anisotropy may be of critical importance in phase change devices that contain h-GST in the crystalline phase with preferential orientations for crystallization. Results \nWe compare the calculated phonon density of states (PHDOS) with the measured Raman spectra 21 of polycrystalline hexagonal GST films at 673 K and 773 K in Fig. 1 . Two distinct peaks were measured at 3.2 THz (peak-A) and 5.1 THz (peak-B) and also appear in our calculation. Peak-A, reported to be the vibration of the heteropolar bond in the tetrahedral GeTe 4 and pyramidal SbTe 3 21 , compares well (3.11 THz) with our calculation, however, the frequency of peak-B is underestimated (4.79 THz) by our calculation. A similar underestimation of the peak-B frequency (5.01 THz) was also reported in a previous theoretical work by Sosso et al . 22 Regardless, this demonstrates the relative accuracy of the harmonic force constants in our calculations. We also note that the calculated PHDOS here compares well with the previously reported PHDOS from a first-principles calculation 23 with slightly different acoustic velocities. These small variations likely arise from different DFT approximations employed [LDA 23 vs. GGA (this work)] as LDA (GGA) typically gives shorter (longer) bonds, thus higher (lower) sound velocities. However, our calculated sound speed of the longitudinal acoustic mode 3.7 km/s (3.2 km/s) along a -axis ( c- axis) compares well that measured in experiment (3.3 km/s) 6 . Figure 1: Comparison of phonon density of states (normalized) at Γ along with the measured Raman spectra 21 at 673 K (orange circles) and 773 K (green circles). Full size image \nThe calculated κ as a function of temperature is given in Fig. 2(a) , which clearly shows a strongly anisotropic κ along the two crystal directions: a - and c -axis. This is of potential importance for devices with h-GST (the crystalline phase in devices can be either h-GST or cubic GST) because strain, thermal gradients, directional growth, and interaction with substrates and interfaces can all lead to preferential alignment of the crystal axis, which in combination with the thermal conductivity anisotropy will affect device behavior. Furthermore, if controlled, it may provide another pathway for improving performance. As shown in Fig. 2(a) , κ at 300 K for h-GST along the a- axis (1.67 W/m-K) is nearly twice of that along the c -axis (0.86 W/m-K). This anisotropy ( κ a / κ c ~2) persists throughout the entire temperature-range of this study. The magnitude of the anisotropy is similar to that found for layered Bi 2 Te 3 24 , 25 , 26 and higher than that of manganese silicide (HMS) 27 . While significant bonding anisotropy was held responsible for the anisotropic κ in Bi 2 Te 3 28 with van der Waals gaps in the low κ direction, a low-energy (<10 meV) twisting phonon and anisotropic group velocity of the optic phonons were found responsible for the observed κ anisotropy in HMS 27 . We note that Lee et al . 5 measured an anisotropic κ favoring cross-film conductivity in polycrystalline h-GST thin films. Crystal orientation relative to the film may not be commensurate with a- and c- axis alignment and the anisotropy in experiment is attributed to amorphous regions near columnar grain structures in the films. The anisotropy reported here is due to intrinsic properties of the hexagonal crystal structure, thus direct comparison of these anisotropy mechanisms is not possible. In the following, we elaborate on the origin of the intrinsic anisotropy of κ in h-GST, and on the surprisingly large κ contribution from the optic phonon modes. Figure 2 \n( a ) Lattice thermal conductivity and ( b ) accumulated thermal conductivity with phonon frequency of h-GST along a-axis (red) and c-axis (blue). The contributions from optic and acoustic modes to total κ at 300 K along a- and c-axis are shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). A schematic of the unit cell of h-GST is also shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). Full size image \nFirstly, the calculated κ for both crystal directions in Fig. 2(a) give the typical T −1 behavior, characteristic of Umklapp scattering, up to the highest temperature considered ( T  = 800 K). This is at variance with roughly T independent thermal conductivity measured by Lyeo et al . 6 . Further, the reported thermal conductivity (1.53 W/m-K) 6 of thin film (270 nm) h-GST at 673 K is significantly higher than the calculated κ values given here: 0.75 and 0.39 W/m-K for the a - and c -axis, respectively. This discrepancy is likely due to a significant electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity as h-GST has a relatively small band gap [~0.5 eV] 29 in combination with a low lattice thermal conductivity. Using the Weidemann-Franz law coupled with electrical conductivity measurements, Lyeo, et al . 6 , estimated the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity was ~70% giving an estimated lattice contribution of 0.43 W/m-K at 673 K. Increasing electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity would compensate the decreasing lattice thermal conductivity resulting from enhanced phonon-phonon scattering with increasing temperature, resulting in the T independent thermal conductivity behavior observed for h-GST in experiment. The calculated average κ (0.63 W/m-K) overestimates the measured value likely due to extrinsic scattering, e.g. , grain boundaries and impurities. Further, the thermal conductivity of thin film h-GST is sensitive to sample thickness 8 . For instance, Reifenberg et al . measured a thermal conductivity (electron + phonon) of 350 nm h-GST thin films that was more than twice of that in samples with thickness of 60 nm 8 . Given the thickness of the samples in ref. 6 were 270 nm, this may also explain the overestimated calculated κ as compared to measurement. We estimated the effect of grain boundaries on κ using a simple empirical model for diffuse boundary scattering and found an increase of 11% in κ for a boundary scattering length of 350 nm as compared to that for a scattering length of 60 nm. We note that our calculations do not include the effects of boundary scattering on the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the focus of this study is to understand features of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of h-GST, therefore, extrinsic scattering and the electronic contribution to κ are not considered further. \nThe accumulated thermal conductivity with phonon frequency [ Fig. 2(b) ] for the a- and c- axis demonstrates isotropic κ up to ~0.8 THz with a significant anisotropy in accumulated κ above this. This is precisely where the acoustic and optic phonon branches start to cross and the acoustic branches reach the zone boundary along the c -axis direction. Figure 3 compares the phonon dispersions for the a -axis (Γ → M direction) and c -axis (Γ → A direction) for h-GST. Firstly, we note that the overall acoustic frequency scale is comparable to other thermoelectric materials (lower than PbTe, Mg 2 Si and Mg 2 Sn; similar to Bi 2 Te 3 ), partly due to the large masses of the constituent atoms and partly because of the similarity in bonding to PbTe and Bi 2 Te 3 . This gives lower velocity acoustic phonons and enhanced phonon-phonon scattering. The slopes of the dispersion curves give the phonon velocities, important in determining κ. More importantly, we note that the total κ consists of a dominant contribution from the optic modes for both crystal directions. While the conventional heat carriers, acoustic modes, give 25% (20%) of total κ along the a -axis ( c -axis), 75% (80%) of the total κ is carried by optic modes [inset in Fig. 2(a) ]. This is unconventional as optic mode contributions are not reported to give more than 25% 19 , 20 of the total κ, and are typically much smaller. This warrants further investigations of thermal transport in low-κ materials with many low frequency optic branches. Figure 3: Phonon dispersions of h-GST along the a- axis (red) and the c- axis (blue). Full size image \nThe phonon dispersion of h-GST shows an inherent anisotropy with highly dispersive optic branches (large group velocities) along the a -axis in contrast to flat optic branches along the c -axis. Further, the acoustic braches along the c- axis do not cross the low-lying optic modes apart from the zone boundary, while the acoustic branches along the a -axis undergo multiple crossings. This is largely a consequence of the smaller Brillouin zone along the c -axis. This is similar to GaAs/AlAs superlattices where the constituting n -units of bulk GaAs and AlAs were arranged along the growth axis so that the edge of the Brillouin zone along the growth direction is as far from the zone center as it is along a- and b- axis 30 . This was reported to significantly reduce the group velocities of optic modes along the c -axis. Importantly, the acoustic mode velocities near the zone center have little anisotropy and therefore elastic differences are not the origin of the thermal conductivity anisotropy, as will be discussed in more detail below. \nTo further evaluate the character of the phonon dispersions the projected phonon densities of states for the various atomic species are given in Fig. 4 . The lowest frequency modes are predominantly from vibrations of the heavy Sb and Te atoms, with strong contributions from Ge-Te modes starting at ~2 THz. This leads to two prominent peaks in the density of states, the first of Sb-Te character from ~1–1.5 THz, and the second of Ge-Te character from ~ 2–2.5 THz. The higher optic branches have mixed Ge-Sb-Te character extending all the way to the top of the spectrum. It is striking to note the differences in projected phonon DOS along a- and c- directions. Although in the low frequency region, the vibrational modes (acoustic modes) along these crystal directions are similar, the vibrational modes in the higher frequency region (optic modes) are very different. While the optic modes along the c- axis are mostly stretching and anti-stretching modes consisting of Ge-Te and Sb-Te atoms, the optic modes along a- axis are notably more complex and include torsional and twisting modes in addition to the stretching and anti-stretching modes. This is due to the significantly stronger contribution from Te and Sb atoms along the a- axis at frequencies higher than 2.5 THz ( Fig. 4 ). Figure 4: Phonon density of states projected on individual atoms of h-GST along a-axis and c-axis. Full size image \nWhile acoustic velocities are generally considered to be central to conductivity anisotropy, especially for low-κ systems like h-GST, we find no significant anisotropy in the group velocities. We calculated the average acoustic sound velocity along each direction using: Along the a -axis v avg  = 2.87 km/s compared to 2.75 km/s along the c -axis, failing to explain the noted anisotropy of κ in Fig. 2 . Therefore, it can be anticipated that the higher group velocities of the more dispersive optic bands along the a -axis as compared to the flat bands along the c -axis are responsible for the κ anisotropy in h-GST, especially since these modes govern the thermal transport behavior in this system. \nIn order to support the above statement, we plot the frequency-dependent averages of each component of the group velocity in Fig. 5 . This is similar to the density regression estimates over all branches along the a- and c- axis 27 : Figure 5: Calculated average group velocity components along the a- and c- axes as a function of frequency. \nwhere α sums over all modes, q sums over all lattice vectors in the Brillouin zone, is the group velocity along the μ-direction and g α ( ω ) is phonon density of states. \nAs can be found in Fig. 5 , the average group velocities of the optical modes (>1 THz) are appreciable in both crystal directions, and surprisingly the group velocity of the low lying optic branches surpasses that of the acoustic branches. We note that even the highest frequency optic phonons in the a -direction are significantly dispersive. Often optic modes are not considered as heat carriers because their velocities are small compared to their acoustic counterparts. In fact, we find the opposite is true in h-GST: the optic modes contribute 75% (80%) to κ along the a -axis ( c -axis). Not only that, we also find notable anisotropy in group velocities of optic modes along the two crystal directions. While the group velocities of low lying TO modes along the a -axis dominate over that along the c -axis in the frequency range 1–1.5 THz, the opposite occurs around 2 THz. Moreover, the group velocities of the highest-frequency optic modes (>3.5 THz) along the c -axis are very small compared to that along the a -axis. Given that the anisotropy in the acoustic group velocity is not significant, these may very well explain the noted κ anisotropy provided the anharmonicities (as measured by mode Grüneisen parameters here) associated with these optic modes are not so high as to completely suppress the phonon lifetimes, and thus their contributions to κ. \nWe show the frequency dependent mode Grüneisen parameters derived from third-order anharmonic force constants 28 as implemented in Phono3py 31 in Fig. 6 . We note that mode Grüneisen parameters are independent of crystal direction as well as the scattering rates determined here within the relaxation time approximation. Although the mode Grüneisen parameters vary over a wide range (~−1.0 to 18.0), the average over the whole frequency range is calculated to be 1.46. This is less than the average mode Grüneisen parameter of the acoustic modes of PbTe, PbSe and PbS 32 despite the fact that the total thermal conductivity at 300 K is comparable. We note that the Grüneisen parameters of the high frequency modes are similar to or less than the lower frequency acoustic modes. Therefore, as far as anharmonicity is concerned, contributions to κ from optic modes are expected to be similar to or higher than those of acoustic modes with comparable velocities. Figure 6: Frequency dependent mode Grüneisen parameters and scattering rates derived from third-order anharmonic force constants. Full size image \nThe Grüneisen parameters, however, fail to explain the increase in scattering rates ( Fig. 6 ) and the saturation in the accumulated κ along the a -axis above 3.8 THz ( Fig. 2b ) despite these branches being significantly dispersive. Given the average mode Grüneisen parameters remain nearly constant in this frequency range and they are independent of crystal direction, one would expect similar scattering rates and significant contributions from the dispersive high frequency branches and further κ anisotropy. This can be explained in terms of the phase space available for three phonon scattering processes in this frequency range as shown in the joint density of states 31 in Fig. 7 (see SI for details). The joint density of states is weighted by the Bose-distribution function of the phonon modes involved in the scattering processes at 300 K. The phase space for three-phonon scattering processes increases dramatically for frequencies higher than 3.8 THz, thus the optic phonons in this frequency range have significantly higher scattering rates [ Fig. 6 ], which suppresses their contribution to κ even though the group velocities (and anisotropy) of these modes are significant. Therefore, we conclude that the thermal conductivity anisotropy in h-GST is mainly due to the dispersive optic branches with frequency less than 3.8 THz along the a -axis compared to the flat optic branches with lower group velocities along the c -axis. The differences in optic mode averaged velocities in a material with similar acoustic velocities can be understood in terms of zone folding effects. In particular, the zone folding along the long c -axis leads to more intersections with zone boundaries in this direction. Symmetry requires that non-degenerate modes have zero slopes when touching the boundary, i.e. , zero c -direction velocities, but does not impose constraints on the velocities transverse to the boundary. This zone folding effect leads to a material that exhibits thermal anisotropy even though it is mechanically rather isotropic ( i.e. , the zone center sound velocities are nearly isotropic). Figure 7: Frequency dependent weighted joint density of states. Full size image \nFinally, accumulated κ as a function of phonon mean free path (λ ph ) provides insight into heat conduction in nanostructured materials. Figure 8(a) clearly shows that most of the heat is carried by vibrational modes with λ ph ranging from 1–30  nm in h-GST crystals at 300 K. On the basis of this knowledge, we calculated κ at various temperatures using various grain sizes to examine the nanostructuring effect on κ in this system ( Fig. 8b ). We find that a reduction of κ as much as 54% can be achieved for grain size of 5  nm . Even for a grain size of 15  nm 31% reduction of κ compared to its bulk counterpart can be achieved. The effect of nanostructuring becomes more prominent at lower temperature where intrinsic λ ph values become larger. For example, at 200 K, for a grain size of 15  nm , κ drops 65% along a-axis and 63% along c-axis . Figure 8 \n( a ) Accumulated κ as a function of phonon mean free path. ( b ) κ as a function of temperature for various grain sizes. The green, blue and magenta curves represent κ for grain sizes of 5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm, respectively. The dashed and solid lines are for κ along c-axis and a-axis, respectively. The red lines represent bulk κ. Full size image Discussion \nWe presented phonon dispersions and thermal conductivity calculations for h-GST. Although h-GST is a relatively isotropic material from a sound velocity perspective, it has a significantly anisotropic thermal conductivity. The reason for this is zone folding due to c -axis layering. This can be regarded as similar to a superlattice phonon scattering mechanism and is reflected in the fact that the anisotropy in the accumulation function starts only in the energy range of the optic branches. This effect is important because the low lying high velocity optic modes contribute significantly to thermal conductivity in h-GST, particularly for the in-plane direction. Intrinsic anisotropy in the thermal conductivity is potentially of interest for devices in cases where the crystalline h-GST phase is used, and the importance of optic phonon contributions to thermal transport may have significant impact on thermoelectric efficiency in materials with complicated phonon dispersions. Methods \nCalculations were done with the projector augmented wave (PAW) 33 , 34 method using experimental lattice parameters 35 and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof 36 , 37 as implemented in VASP 38 , 39 . The internal atomic coordinates were determined by total energy minimization. A 12 × 12 × 4 Monkhorst-Pack grid was used for sampling of the Brillouin zone with an energy cutoff of 550 eV. The convergence threshold for the energy was set to 10 −5  eV and 10 −3  eV/Å for its gradient. We employed a finite displacement method using the VASP-phonopy 40 interface to calculate the harmonic force constants with higher convergence thresholds; 10 −8  eV and 10 −8  eV/Å for the energy and its gradient, respectively. Born effective charges were calculated using density functional perturbation theory. The third order anharmonic force constants were calculated using VASP-phono3py 31 with a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell incorporating interactions out to 5 th nearest neighbors. Finally, we calculated thermal conductivity by explicitly solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation using 12 × 12 × 4 integration meshes. A tetrahedron method was employed for the calculation of the imaginary parts of self-energies. We note that the DFT and κ calculations changed little when increasing integration meshes to 12 × 12 × 8 and 12 × 12 × 12. Details of the method can be found elsewhere 31 . \nTwo different crystal structures have been reported for h-GST. We considered the h-GST structures given by Kooi et al . 35 and Matsunaga et al . 41 , 42 , which differ in Ge-Te stacking. Kooi’s structure gives notably lower total energy (0.15 eV) and is therefore likely the correct structure, thus we use this for the κ calculations. We note that while both structures resulted in stable phonon dispersions (no imaginary modes), the lowest order TO(Γ) mode was found to be situated at higher frequency in Matsunaga’s structure [See Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information] compared to Kooi’s structure implying sensitivity of the low frequency TO mode to the positions of Ge and Sb.

      "text": "Port of LA GE \nThe Port of LA is the largest container port by volume in the US. \nThat kind of scale makes it extremely difficult to keep track of how the containers are moving throughout the port. \nAll the different parties involved, such as the supply-chain managers, truckers, and port operators, are given access to data around cargo ships just two days before they hit the port. On top of that, each of the eight terminal operators at the Port of LA uses eight different operating systems, making it almost impossible to gain full visibility into all the transactions. \nThat could change. \nOn Tuesday, GE announced a pilot program with the Port of LA to launch a first-of-its-kind port information portal. The three-month pilot program, set to begin in early 2017, will bring the flow of information into one place, while giving better visibility into all the movements occuring at the port. And with the new portal, all parties involved will get to see cargo data two weeks in advance. \n\"This is groundbreaking. Never before have we had the ability to find and share information like we’re aspiring to do today,\" Gene Seroka, Executive Director of Port of Los Angeles, told Business Insider. \"The rest of the world is very excited to see where this can go. It's very scalable to solve problems in other parts of the world.\" \nThe pilot program will start with one shipping terminal, but if successful it could expand to the entire port. \"Ports are convening points. The vision is to create one common place where there can be data transparency across all parties,\" GE Transportation CEO Jamie Miller told us. The industrial internet \nGE's partnership with the Port of LA is one many projects GE is pursuing as it pivots its business to enable the digital transformation of major industries. \nGE has coined the term \"industrial internet\" as a key part of its strategy to transform eight large industrial sectors, including energy, healthcare and transportation. The company has launched a new division called GE Digital and opened a new office in Silicon Valley that employs 1,700 people. GE CEO Jeff Immelt added GE's spent nearly $2 billion in acquisitions as part of this plan, including ServiceMax, which it bought for $915 million on Monday . \n\"It’s very early, but GE’s clearly been making a very aggressive push in digital,\" Gartner's research director Chet Geschikter said.

      "text": "Summary \nTrump’s presidential win will decrease demand for wind energy in the near future. \nGE’s two recent acquisitions will help to ease the pain seen from a step back in U.S. renewable energy development. \nGE renewables are in a position to benefit from the expansion of domestic production Trump promises, increasing profit margins. Decreased Demand for Wind Energy The focus since Trump's surprise election has been on the likely negative effects on renewable energy. Our new president-elect has made several comments throughout his campaign that indicated a step backward in U.S. renewable energy investment. Among those, he has had frequent criticism of Obama's Clean Power Plan and other regulation-based programs. It has been speculated that he might even seek to end certain tax credits for renewable energy. In September, sources close to the Trump campaign reported that Myron Ebell, an outspoken climate change skeptic, would spearhead Trump's plans for the EPA. Ebell is a polarizing figure in environmental policy compared to members of Obama's team. He is the chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group that \" questions global warming alarmism .\" Given Mr. Ebell's past comments on energy regulation policies and a Republican majority, it is safe to assume further implementation of the CPP will not continue in the next four years. While it was not a direct investment in wind energy, the state-level mandates imposed by the CPP would have been a driving force for wind turbine demand over the next 15 years. A Renewed Industrial America Another common piece of rhetoric utilized by the Trump campaign was the creation of new jobs in America. In many ways, this ended up being the cornerstone of his campaign -- the promise of a renewed industrial America. His comments frequently centered around the expansion of the coal industry. He was quoted in September 2016 as saying , \"America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy - some $50 trillion in shale energy, oil reserves, and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves. It's all upside for this country -- more jobs…\" The coal market saw a big spike with the result of the election, as would be expected. However, there are other markets that could see an expansion of domestic products. In his debates, Trump was very critical of various trade deals, including NAFTA and TPP. While the complete dissolution of these deals seems unlikely, his continued drive for increased domestic production might result in some unlikely heroes. One of those is GE (NYSE: GE ), due to two recent acquisitions. On Nov. 2, 2015, GE purchased the energy activities of Alstom for $10 billion. On Oct. 10, 2016, the company announced plans to purchase LM Wind Power for $1.65 billion. With these two acquisitions, GE is showing their commitment to renewable energy. Perhaps more interesting, in light of the recent election, is that GE will soon own four wind turbine blade manufacturing plants within the U.S. In 2014, GE consolidated all of its domestic production to Pensacola, Fla. The deal with Alstom resulted in a second plant in Amarillo, Texas. If the purchase of LM Wind is completed, plants in Grand Forks, N.D., and Little Rock, Ark., will be added. Analysis Trump has spoken negatively about wind energy in the past, but his comments have been largely inconsistent. In 2012, he was quoted as saying : \"Right now, green energy is way behind the times. You look at the windmills that are destroying shorelines all over the world. Economically, they're not good. It's a very, very poor form of energy.\" Years later during his campaign, he seemed to have changed his mind, commenting in late 2015 that he was in favor of wind production tax credits. That inconsistency makes it difficult to fully analyze the effects of his presidency on the renewable energy segment of GE. Source: GE 10-Q . Digging into the last quarterly report, however, provides some insight into how GE might benefit from his potential policy. Above is the summary of the operating segments pulled directly from GE's report. Due to the acquisition of Alstom energy, the renewable energy segment is the fastest-growing segment within GE. In the three months ended Sept. 30, renewable energy saw a 66% increase in revenue from the year prior. The acquisition of LM wind allows GE to continue growing revenue without the implementation of Obama's CPP. Source: AWEA . The U.S. wind industry supports 88,000 employees across the nation. If the next four years bring an expansion of benefits to domestic production companies, GE is poised to take advantage of it. They have been steadily increasing market share through acquisitions; as seen above, GE has produced 42.5% of the U.S. Wind Power fleet without considering the upcoming acquisition of LM Wind. Source: GE 10-Q. Currently, their profit margin in the renewable energy segment is about 7%. Their profits in this segment have grown significantly slower than the revenue within the last year. As they continue to gain market share and realize the synergies of their recent acquisitions, their profit margin will increase. The Alstom deal is expected to produce $3.6 billion in cost saving synergies over the first five years. Additional tax credits and government subsidy for domestic-produced wind turbines would also increase profit margins substantially, growing their renewable segment into a larger contributor of the company's profits. Conclusions Given the amount of media attention to Trump's negative comments on renewable energy, it follows naturally to be skeptical of wind power during the Trump presidency. While Trump's proposed environmental policies might be detrimental to GE's renewable business, his commitment to creating jobs in America might offset or even overcome these headwinds. Increased revenue due to the acquisition of LM Wind Power in addition to higher profit margins could bolster GE's realized profits from renewable energy. The renewable energy segment is a small part of the larger company, but GE is going through a transformation. They are looking to produce 90% of their revenue within their industrial segments by 2018, and their recent spin-offs and acquisitions have them on track for that goal. The uncertainty of the next four years aside, GE is committed to wind energy and is in a good place to expand their production domestically and abroad.

      "text": "Sean Captain 11.16.16 1:30 PM \nWe are entering the era of talking machines—and it's about more than just asking Amazon's Alexa to turn down the music. General Electric has built a digital assistant into its cloud service for managing power plants, jet engines, locomotives, and the other heavy equipment it builds. Over the internet, an engineer can ask a machine—even one hundreds of miles away—how it's doing and what it needs. Fast Company got an exclusive demonstration of the technology before its debut at GE's Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco. \nVoice controls are built on top of GE's Digital Twin program, which uses sensor readings from machinery to create virtual models in cyberspace. \"That model is constantly getting a stream of data, both operational and environmental,\" says Colin Parris, VP at GE Software Research. \"So it's adapting itself to that type of data.\" The machines live virtual lives online, allowing engineers to see how efficiently each is running and if they are wearing down. \nGE partnered with Microsoft on the interface, using the Bing Speech API (the same tech powering the Cortana digital assistant), with special training on key terms like \"rotor.\" The twin had little trouble understanding the Mandarin Chinese accent of Bo Yu, one of the researchers who built the system; nor did it stumble on Parris's Trinidad accent. Digital Twin will also work with Microsoft's HoloLens mixed reality goggles, allowing someone to step into a 3D image of the equipment. Virtual comparisons \nIt's possible to compare virtual machines. Suppose one diesel or jet engine is running more efficiently than others. Its digital twin might reveal what adjustments, such as fuel mixture, the others can take advantage of, says Parris. Engineers can even run simulations of, say, what might happen to a gas or steam turbine in a fossil fuel plant if it runs months or years at particular speeds and schedules. \nModeling is important as more alternative energy comes on line. \"When there is a lot of wind, you don't need a steam turbine,\" says Parris. \"When there's a little bit of wind, [turbine use] goes back up.\" Turning turbines on and off frequently and changing speeds put a lot more strain on the parts. \"So now it's breaking at four times the rate it would normally break, and it's losing a significant amount of remaining life,\" says Parris. The turbine's digital twin explains how it came up with its maintenance advice. \nThe problem feels more compelling when the machine itself tells you. \"Damage rate has increased by four times in the last six months,\" says a real turbine, running in Southern California, about the state of its rotor. \"If this continues, I will lose 69.9 percent of my useful life.\" My gosh, the machine is dying! \nThe twin also suggests how to fix the problem, by adjusting speeds manually or installing an app that makes changes automatically. The twin came up with recommendations by running 58,965 simulations based on 15 years of data from 125 of the same model turbine. Fortunately, this talking machine is good at making a long story short. Never miss a story. Sign up for the Fast Company newsletter and get the best stories delivered to your inbox daily. Send",

      "text": "Blog This \nPTC (NASDAQ: PTC) and GE Digital today announced from GE’s Minds + Machines 2016 plans to expand their strategic alliance, first established in 2015, to bring integrated solutions to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market. Specifically, the companies will pursue a ‘ThingWorx for Predix’ technology suite that will make it easier for joint customers to use ThingWorx to develop custom applications that run on Predix, GE’s Industrial Internet operating system. Additionally, PTC intends to sell ThingWorx coupled with GE’s Predix technology, and GE intends to sell ‘ThingWorx for Predix’ together with Predix solutions that it offers to new and existing customers. \nThe expansion of the collaboration between PTC and GE Digital is based on a shared vision for the Industrial Internet and defines the respective complementary roles of ThingWorx and Predix. \nPTC’s ThingWorx ® application enablement tools allow for rapid drag-and-drop development of IoT solutions that readily incorporate industrial automation connectivity, machine learning and predictive analytics, remote service, and powerful augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences. GE’s Predix provides an edge to cloud distributed operating system for the Industrial Internet, including edge management and analytics, cloud-based connectivity and asset management. The companies plan to leverage PTC technology as an easier means of development on Predix. \nWorking with GE, PTC plans to develop an optimized version of elements of its ThingWorx technology suite that would integrate tightly with Predix, making it possible for customers to enjoy the full power of ThingWorx with their Predix system. In turn, GE would deploy ‘ThingWorx for Predix’ together with Predix for its own internal manufacturing and service processes. The collaboration will explore making the complete range of ThingWorx capabilities available in ‘ThingWorx for Predix,’ including capabilities from PTC’s ThingWorx, Kepware ® , and Vuforia ® solutions, enabling GE and its customers to accelerate the development and deployment of Predix-based solutions. ‘ThingWorx for Predix’ would leverage the platform capabilities in Predix to store the underlying asset models and run analytics at scale. \nPTC would pursue opportunities to sell joint offerings based on GE Digital’s Brilliant Manufacturing Suite or use cases where ThingWorx is integrated with Predix. GE would sell ‘ThingWorx for Predix’ IoT solutions to new and existing customers, with a focus on smart engineering, manufacturing, operations, and service. \n“GE Digital is one of PTC’s most forward thinking partners, and has been working closely with us to push the boundaries of what’s possible with the convergence of the physical and digital worlds,” said Jim Heppelmann, president and CEO, PTC. “The intended expansion of our collaboration is yet another great example of what our companies are capable of achieving together, and we will work to bring increased value not just to GE and PTC, but to our respective and mutual customers.” \n“Tools from ThingWorx with Predix the platform are two of the most powerful offerings across the entire Industrial IoT landscape. By bringing together their complementary capabilities in ThingWorx for Predix, GE aims to bring new levels of intelligence and efficiency to our internal manufacturing operations, as well as extend those benefits to our ever-growing customer base,” said Jim Fowler, CIO, GE. \nAdditional Resources Harvard Business Review: \"How Smart, Connected Products are Transforming Companies,\" authors PTC CEO Jim Heppelmann and Harvard Professor Michael Porter \nAbout GE Digital GE Digital connects streams of machine data to powerful analytics, providing Industrial companies with valuable insights to manage assets and operations more efficiently.

Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. \nIn initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. \nExelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts. \nChicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. \nExelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. \nGE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. Continued... ",

Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Tue Nov 15, 2016 10:09am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nSEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "SEC Has Completed Review of GE’s Filings Over Non-GAAP Measures Without Taking Action By Michael Rapoport\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has criticized General Electric Co.’s use of tailored, “non-GAAP” financial measures in recent months, but has completed a review of the company’s filings without taking any action, according to documents the agency has made public.\nIn correspondence between the SEC and GE from June through September, the agency contended that the company’s disclosures could be unclear or confusing to investors and that its metrics may have excluded some costs they shouldn’t have.\nIn response, GE has told the SEC it would revise its non-GAAP disclosures to address the commission’s concerns, according to the correspondence recently posted to the agency’s website. In the back and forth, GE defended its disclosures as helpful and relevant to investors.\nOfficials at GE weren’t immediately available for comment.\nIn the last of the letters made public, dated Sept. 30, the SEC told GE it had completed its review of GE’s filings and didn’t suggest any other action.\nWrite to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com",

      "title": "GE’s Immelt sees potential gains from Trump’s public works push",
      "text": "\nBy Richard Clough Bloomberg News November 17, 2016\nBill Brett for The Boston Globe\nChief executive Jeffrey Immelt says General Electric could benefit from federal spending on infrastructure projects.\nNEW YORK — General Electric Co. chief executive Jeffrey Immelt sees his company benefiting if President-elect Donald Trump follows through with a plan to boost spending on public works.\n“The US has really declined immensely in infrastructure, whether it’s grid, ports, roads, I could go down the list,’’ Immelt said Tuesday in an interview in San Francisco. While he cautioned that it’s still too early to know what Trump plans to do, he said “there’s an opportunity for better infrastructure. If some of that goes into grids, GE would be a beneficiary.’’\nAdvertisement\nTrump pledged during his campaign to renew the focus on growth in the US and improve the country’s infrastructure, while questioning the benefits of foreign trade deals. GE, which remains a strong advocate of global economic ties, will stick to its strategy of local manufacturing in markets across the world, Immelt said.\n“When we globalize, it really today is about accessing new markets so that we can grow in those markets,’’ Immelt said. “In the ’80s, we took a gas-range plant and shut it down in Louisville and we moved it to Mexico for the purpose of shipping that product back to the US. That’s not what we do anymore. Most of the things we sell in the US we already make here.’’\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

GE has advanced 4.5 percent since the election, compared with 1.9 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nImmelt said he hasn’t met with anyone from Trump’s team since the election and that he is taking a “wait-and-see’’ approach to possible changes.\nWhile Trump’s promises to revive the coal industry have generated questions about the future of renewable energy — a business GE has been investing heavily in — Immelt said his company also has a strong gas-focused power business and offers technology to improve coal-plant operations.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re bullish in power, and we believe in a diversified portfolio,’’ he said. “Our portfolio matches up with a changing legislative environment. Whatever door opens, we can run through it.”\nGE is focusing on global growth as it reorients operations around markets such as energy and aviation while also building out a complementary digital division. The Boston-based company, which is holding a two-day Minds + Machines conference, announced several software acquisitions this week.\nGE has also announced other transactions in recent weeks, including deals for 3-D printing companies, the purchase of a maker of turbine blades and an agreement to combine its oil division with Baker Hughes Inc. While GE is putting cash toward buybacks and the dividend, Immelt said the company would continue to look for deals to bolster operations.\n“We always like to do different things to grow the company,” he said.",

      "text": "GE continues 3D printing deep dive Bowdeya Tweh , btweh@enquirer.com 5:50   A fuel nozzle on the CFM International Leap engine. (Photo: Provided/GE) \nExpect Greater Cincinnati to play a feature role in General Electric Co.'s plans to expand the role of 3D printing in its manufacturing processes. \nBoston-based GE is working as both an investor and end user of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, technology as part of its push to become what it calls a digital industrial company. Since 2010, GE has spent about $1.5 billion to expand its manufacturing and additive technology capabilities at several locations, including in West Chester Township. \nOpened in 2015, the Additive Technology Center in West Chester supports GE Aviation’s additive design, application engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Other centers are located in Niskayuna, New York, Pittsburgh and Cameri, Italy. \nThe company's investments in additive machines, materials and software now involve six different GE businesses, including its Evendale-based GE Aviation. David Joyce, president and CEO of GE Aviation, recently was named to oversee GE's additive manufacturing activities. \n“These technologies will be bolstered by a growing global network of GE centers focused on additive research and technology,” said Mohammad Ehteshami, vice president of GE Additive, in a news release. “As GE develops its additive engineering and manufacturing capabilities, it further positions us to be better providers of the equipment.” GE Aviation plans $500M in HQ investments through 2020 \nAdditive manufacturing, or 3D printing, involves taking digital designs from software and laying horizontal cross-sections to manufacture the part. The components are typically lighter and more durable than traditionally manufactured parts because they require less welding and machining. \nWithin the last month, GE Aviation completed tests on a demonstrator engine that had 35 percent of its parts produced via additive manufacturing. The tests supported the development of a new Advanced Turboprop engine, which will power the Cessna Denali single-engine turboprop aircraft. The additive components reduce the engine's weight by 5 percent while contributing a 1 percent improvement in specific fuel consumption, the company said. \nParts produced via additive manufacturing also holds the potential to lower costs in addition to making the engine lighter. The Advanced Turboprop engine features 12 parts produced via additive manufacturing. Under convention manufacturing methods, the engine would have required 855 separate parts, instead of 12. The engine will include more printed components than any production engine in aviation history, the company said. \nFour months ago, GE Aviation introduced its first additive jet engine component – complex fuel nozzle interiors – into airline service on the CFM International Leap engine. West Chester-based CFM is a joint venture between GE and Safran of France. \nAdditive components for a demonstrator engine called the \"a-CT7\" and the Advanced Turboprop engine are built in West Chester. \nWithin the last couple months, GE reached agreements to buy two European companies in an attempt to be a top industry provider in the 3D printing space. \nGE reached a deal in late October to buy a 75 percent stake in Concept Laser GmbH for $599 million with an opportunity take full ownership in the firm over several years. Based in Lichtenfels, Germany, Concept Laser designs and manufactures laser additive machines. \nOn Monday, GE agreed to buy a controlling interest in Swedish firm Arcam AB following the conclusion of an extended public tender offer. Arcam invented electron beam melting machines for metal-based additive manufacturing and produces advanced metal powders. CONNECT  //cin.ci/2fy1SQ4 TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Collaboration to scale the development and deployment of the model-based digital twin \nPITTSBURGH, November, 16, 2016 - ANSYS (NASDAQ: ANSS) announced today that it will collaborate with GE to create model-based digital twin technology and disruptive commercial business models to deliver on the promise of the Industrial Internet of Things. This builds on an existing relationship between the two companies. ANSYS will demonstrate a variety of industry-specific digital twins at GE ’s (NYSE: GE) Minds + Machines event in San Francisco, dedicated to building the digital industrial ecosystem. \nSimulation technology is no longer solely used by engineers to design better products and reduce the costs of physical testing. Leading organizations are expanding the use of simulation into operations by creating digital twins – virtual representations of individual operating assets whose performance and productivity can be improved dynamically through simulation technology. Coupling the rich sensor data from increasingly smart industrial equipment with the predictive power of simulation, specific operating conditions can be analyzed and failure points predicted, unlocking billions of dollars in production and maintenance optimization. \nDigital twins can live with the asset, providing a dynamic self-teaching model used to optimize its performance in conjunction with an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform. This combination of machine learning, coupled with physics-based modeling, enables organizations to see how their products performed in the past and predict the future simultaneously. Using ANSYS to create model-based digital twins will provide a foundation to scaling the benefits of the IIoT. This is no longer a theoretic concept as ANSYS and GE Global Research are already demonstrating actual implementation of digital twins, like the GuardEon Molded Case Circuit Breaker , a powerful low-voltage circuit breaker designed for global industry applications. By using ANSYS software, GE engineers are able to study and test complex physics at a level of detail that was impossible to achieve through physical testing. \n“ Pairing physics and analytics models via the digital twin is essential to providing our customers with the 360 degree insights they need to create competitive advantage in a rapidly changing world, ” said Eric Bantegnie, ANSYS vice president. “We are excited to be taking another step forward in our long-standing partnership with GE.” \nThrough this collaboration, ANSYS will work with GE Digital, GE Global Research and GE’s industrial businesses to expand and integrate ANSYS’ leading physics-based engineering simulation and embedded software development platform with GE’s Predix platform to power digital twin solutions across a wide range of industries. Scaling digital twin solutions from the edge to the cloud will accelerate the value of ANSYS simulation, drive Predix adoption and open new opportunities to explore disruptive business models and commercial relationships. \n“We are building the digital industrial ecosystem to drive better outcomes for our customer through the Predix platform,” said John Magee, Chief Marketing Officer, Predix. “ANSYS is the market leader in physics-based simulation, and we are pleased to work with them to scale model-based digital twin solutions on Predix to provide our customers with new insights that were not possible before.” \nAbout ANSYS, Inc. \nANSYS is the global leader in engineering simulation.

      "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. GE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed.\nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview.\nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming.\nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site.\nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "text": "| License Photo Sign up for our Energy newsletter SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- A new data-driven drilling program could increase the productivity of operations for Danish company Maersk, a marine division of GE announced.\nGE said it was working with Maersk Drilling on a pilot program that uses advanced algorithms and sensor data to potentially increase productivity as well as cut maintenance costs by up to 20 percent. The program would create a so-called digital twin of the drilling operation and use advanced programming to help spot potential inefficiencies or failures ahead of time.\n\"With the fast-paced changes of globally connected economies and shifting regional opportunities, marine operators need to transform themselves to be efficient, predictable and nimble,\" Tim Schweikert, the president and CEO of GE's Marine Solutions said in a statement. \"Drawing critical insights from operational data is a crucial first step.\"\nThe collaboration with Maersk comes less than a month after the oil and gas division of GE acquired a 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes.\nWith both sides looking for signs of recovery in a market where some companies are reluctant to spend on the type of services Baker Hughes supplies, the combination gave both sides a win. For Baker Hughes, it's touting itself as a \"new\" company, while GE avoids the costs of a full acquisition.\nGE's oil and gas business has built up its position through acquisitions so that it's now one of the stronger divisions within the parent company.\nThe pilot program with Maersk will be carried out over the next calendar year.\n\"Currently, the project has reached its first milestone, with data collected from the rig currently being processed and analyzed online,\" GE said.\n Maersk Oil hires Lloyd's Register for guidance Maersk splits in two GE Oil & Gas grabs hold of Baker Hughes",

      "text": "GE Healthcare and UC San Francisco have teamed up to build a library of deep learning algorithms. The partners plan to stock the library with algorithms that cut the time it takes for users of GE’s cloud and imaging machines to diagnose conditions.\nDeep learning algorithms learn to spot patterns in images and other data. By pairing such algorithms with powerful computers and growing repositories of medical images and data, GE and rivals such as IBM think they can give clinicians the information they need to quickly diagnose patients and choose the most appropriate intervention.\nPartnering with UCSF’s Center for Digital Health Innovation gives GE access to expertise to move it toward the realization of this vision.\n“With this collaboration, these technologies will be applied to our clinical data and images to provide clinicians with actionable information in near real-time,” Dr. Michael Blum, associate vice chancellor for informatics at UCSF, said in a statement. “Together, we will develop tools and algorithms that will allow clinicians and researchers to identify problems and ask questions that are only achievable with vast computing power and datasets.”\nThe partners’ first goal is to create algorithms to support “high-volume, high-impact” imaging. These algorithms are expected to help healthcare professionals differentiate between normal results and those that need further investigation or treatment. GE cites an algorithm designed to spot collapsed lungs as an early example. If the algorithm can teach machines to identify collapsed lungs, physicians can act sooner, potentially improving health outcomes.\nOver time, GE and UCSF plan to branch out beyond this initial area of focus. Electronic health records will join imaging technologies on the list of data sources used by the partners. This broadening of the data pool is intended to enrich algorithm development and boost sensitivity.\nLong term, GE sees algorithms supporting everything from the automation of triage in routine care to the development of personalized therapies. For now, the approach has a lot to prove. By teaming up with UCSF, GE has positioned itself to find out whether deep learning algorithms can live up to the hype in healthcare.",

      "text": "| License Photo Sign up for our Energy newsletter \nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- A new data-driven drilling program could increase the productivity of operations for Danish company Maersk, a marine division of GE announced. \nGE said it was working with Maersk Drilling on a pilot program that uses advanced algorithms and sensor data to potentially increase productivity as well as cut maintenance costs by up to 20 percent. The program would create a so-called digital twin of the drilling operation and use advanced programming to help spot potential inefficiencies or failures ahead of time. \n\"With the fast-paced changes of globally connected economies and shifting regional opportunities, marine operators need to transform themselves to be efficient, predictable and nimble,\" Tim Schweikert, the president and CEO of GE's Marine Solutions said in a statement. \"Drawing critical insights from operational data is a crucial first step.\" \nThe collaboration with Maersk comes less than a month after the oil and gas division of GE acquired a 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes. \nWith both sides looking for signs of recovery in a market where some companies are reluctant to spend on the type of services Baker Hughes supplies, the combination gave both sides a win. For Baker Hughes, it's touting itself as a \"new\" company, while GE avoids the costs of a full acquisition. \nGE's oil and gas business has built up its position through acquisitions so that it's now one of the stronger divisions within the parent company. \nThe pilot program with Maersk will be carried out over the next calendar year. \n\"Currently, the project has reached its first milestone, with data collected from the rig currently being processed and analyzed online,\" GE said.",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.17.16. Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World’s AI Talent GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \nGeneral Electric builds jet engines and wind turbines and medical gear. But the 124-year-old industrial giant is also transforming itself for the digital age. It’s fashioning software that pulls data from all this hardware, hoping to gain an insight into industrial operations that was never possible in the past. The problem is that analyzing all this data is difficult, and the talent needed to make it happen is scarce. So GE is going shopping. \nThe company just paid an undisclosed amount to acquire a Berkeley-based machine learning startup called Wise.io. “There’s thirty of them,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt says gleefully of the Wise.io team, which is heavy with astrophysicists. “You match them with aviation data, and they’re killer.” \nThat’s great for GE and Immelt—and for their customers. But what if you’re a small software company trying to inject some AI into your operation? Wise.io was on a mission to “democratize AI” —to creating tools anyone could use to build machine learning services—but it’s now disappearing into GE. And at a time when machine learning is the prime way of staying competitive in the software world, that’s a notable thing. In the battle for scarce AI talent, companies like GE have an overwhelming advantage. The cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. \nNot everyone can go out and grab thirty AI-happy astrophysicists. And if you can’t do that, the talent pool becomes very small very quickly, since these machine learning techniques are so new and so different from standard software development. Even the big players talk about the tiny talent pool: Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. \nOver the past few years, other heavyweights have snapped up so many other AI startups you’ve never heard of. Twitter bought Mad Bits, Whet Labs, and Magic Pony. Apple bagged Turi and Tuplejump. Salesforce acquired MetaMind and Prediction I/O. Intel acquired Nervana. And that’s just a partial list. And it’s not just software and Internet companies doing the buying. It’s also giants like Samsung and GE that are incorporating AI into physical things. As soon as startups spring up to meet the AI need, they get sucked up into the maws of the hungriest, richest corporations. \n“These big companies are establishing their advantage,” says Chris Nicholson, the founder of Skymind, a still-independent deep learning startup. “Technology is always a battlefield, and they’re tilting it with these acquisitions.” A Shrinking Pool \nNicole Shanahan is seeing this firsthand. Her startup, ClearAccessIP, is building software that seeks to automatically analyze patent portfolios. The company uses the latest in machine learning techniques to mine relevant information for patent litigation. That means Shanahan needs data scientists, people with experience in deep neural networks and software like Google’s open source TensorFlow engine that drives this increasingly important form of AI. She’s trying to hire four data scientists who specialize in machine learning, and she can’t land even one. Last week, she put an offer out to a candidate in Canada, but he declined, saying he couldn’t make the move to the States. “It really slows us down,” Shanahan says. “We may end up hiring him as a contractor and letting him work from there.” \nCan’t she just hire ordinary coders? Not really. Building this machine learning technology is quite different from standard software engineering. Itxs less about coding and more about coaxing results from vast pools of data. \nThe irony is that Shanahan’s domestic partner happens to be Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, one of the main companies soaking up so much of the available deep learning talent. In 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, nabbing one of the primary forces behind this technology’s recent rise: University of Toronto professor Geoff Hinton. Then it snapped up DeepMind, the company that recently shocked the AI world by building system that could crack the ancient game of Go. These acquisitions were the start of the industry’s buying spree. Related Stories ",

Post to Facebook GE tests industry's future: Drones, goggles, connected overalls Device and engine maker sees potential in $225 billion industrial Internet of Things economy.  //usat.ly/2fzOZ7U   Join the Nation's Conversation   GE tests industry's future: Drones, goggles, connected overalls Marco della Cava , USA TODAY 9:21 a.m. EST November 17, 2016 A visit to GE's Minds + Machines event tries out a Web-connected platform that offers real time operational status updates on wind farm turbines.

Sensors sewn into his overalls have cut the flow of electricity to the box. He can now work without the risk of electrocution. \n\"This is just one way technology can help workers do their jobs better and more safely,\" says Stephane Sireau of GE Digital, whose prototype suit was one of many demos at General Electric's Minds + Machines conference, which wrapped up Wednesday. \n\"Our mission is to integrate the worker into a digital industrial context,\" says Sireau, showing how the suit's sensors also provide vital sign data. That information, in turn, can help emergency responders and anticipate worker health problems. \nYou have probably heard of the Internet of Things, or IoT, which refers to the growing number of Web-connected gadgets being pitched to consumers, from thermostats to door locks. Feds offer ways to make Internet of Things more secure \nBut a less familiar acronym is IIoT, or the Industrial Internet of Things, which leverages Internet connectivity and cloud-based data crunching to, ideally, streamline the worker experience, drive efficiencies into manufacturing logistics and optimize energy resources. \nLong known primarily for making big-ticket hardware devices such as MRI machines and jet engines, General Electric is doubling down on software and IIoT. \nGE's chief digital officer Bill Ruh has said that the company's digital business, including software and its open source Predix operating system, which debuted in February, will account for $7 billion in revenue this year and $15 billion by 2020, up from an earlier prediction of $10 billion. \nStephane Sireau of GE Digital demostrates who a workers suit laced with sensors can cause a potentially lethal electricity junction box to cut power before the worker approaches. (Photo: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY) \nBy the end of this year, some 20,000 industrial app builders will be developing for Predix. By 2020, GE officials say the IIoT economy will hit $225 billion as businesses look to technology to boost their bottom line. \nSuch sunny talk immediately raises two dark specters: potential job loss and catastrophic hacking incidents. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of job creation that took tech companies such as Apple to task for outsourcing its manufacturing. Voters in counties where manufacturing dominates overwhelmingly supported him against rival Hillary Clinton. Some said technology did more harm than good , automating blue-collar jobs humans once did. \nAnd just three weeks ago, a massive attack on unsecured IoT devices downed the websites of Amazon and Twitter on the East Coast. \nBoth topics have GE execs brooding. \n\"If you're saying you want the job you have to last forever, that's difficult,\" says Colin Parris, GE's vice president of software research. \"But our feeling is that something like Predix can leverage technology to democratize the workplace.\" \nParris gives the example of a factory worker who has an idea on how to solve a problem, but doesn't have computer coding skills. \"They could use a speech interface to dictate a request to a computer that could then take on the task of writing the code,\" he says. Tech's gilded glory didn't mean much to Trump's supporters \nAs for the vulnerability of the IIoT, Parris says the only solution to hacking threats is \"hard work.\" He says one way to help safeguard industrial devices is to run repeated threat scenarios that use a machines \"basic physics\" as a baseline. \nFor example, if a large steam engine operating at peak efficiency is supposed to throw up a very specific set of numbers, any deviation from that norm could indicate a hack and human and computer overseers could respond accordingly. \n\"We're always attacking ourselves with bots and encouraging others to do the same, and to share that information,\" says Parris. \nMuch of what was on display at Minds + Machines was still largely futuristic in scope, with GE hosting potential industrial customers to both gauge their interest in a particular product or service and to get their thoughts on real-world deployment. \nGE Digital's Peter Hardwick wears Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality device that GE can use to help workers fix gear by study a hologram representation of the problem ahead of time. (Photo: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY) \nAt one booth, GE featured a chair facing three large screens that allowed a worker to monitor data from a range of wind farm turbines. At another, representatives displayed a DJI quadcopter next to a video that showed how the drone could be deployed in advance of a human team to check for issues on a cracked turbine. \nA few feet away, visitors tried on Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality goggles, which projected a holographic image of a large mechanical device that was essentially a digital twin of its real-life counterpart. \n\"If you walk up closer to the hologram, you can look into the device and even see the wiring hidden inside its panels, all of which would help you trouble shoot a problem before going to work on the real thing,\" says Peter Hardwick, GE Digital senior staff architect. Internet of things: hyped but here to stay \nBut not everyone is instantly sold on the IIoT's digital solutions for what have long been hands-on fixes to industrial problems. \nHardwick says so far visitors to his display have had questions about the durability of HoloLens, a $3,000 all-in-one device that at present is only available to developers and some enterprise customers. Others question whether their employees will welcome putting on a large wearable computer. \n\"It's still early days,\" says Hardwick. \"Right now, our job is to get feedback, and go from there.\" \nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.

      "text": "Recently, BP plc ( BP - Free Report ) and General Electric ( GE - Free Report ) jointly launched a digital solution – Plant Operations Advisor (“POA”).\nThe latest digital solution is likely to boost the efficiency, reliability and safety of BP's oil and gas production operations by forecasting equipment breakdowns prior to their occurrence. This will help in preventing unplanned downtime and aid engineers in responding quickly to issues as they take place in real time. POA is already being used by BP to manage the performance of one of its platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBP intends to install this new digital solution in all its facilities around the world by next year, subject to a successful pilot. The company believes that the usage of POA would result in annual savings of over $200 million upon its installation in about 33 platforms worldwide.\nPOA, which is built on GE's proprietary Predix software, was designed as part of a development partnership the two companies announced in January to enhance oilfield efficiency products. The digital solution collects data from various pieces of equipment on offshore platforms to inform engineers whenever a part requires maintenance or repair works. The system offers easy access to various live data feeds and includes visualization capabilities, such as a real-time facility threat display. It also combines a widespread case management capability to help refer to prior operational issues.\nPer BP, the usage of GE software program is likely to enhance its efficiency by 2–4%. However, neither of the involved parties divulged details regarding the terms of the deal.\nBP PLC Price\nBP PLC Price | BP PLC Quote:\nBP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Under the partnership, both the companies provide industrial IoT solutions to customers in oil & gas, fertiliser, power, healthcare, telecom and other industries. The agreement was signed in the presence of GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt and RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani.According to Gartner, there exists a market opportunity of over $25 billion by 2022 for IIoT solutions across the four key industries of oil & gas, power, healthcare and transportation.“GE will provide its Predix cloud offering, industrial internet applications and data science expertise. RIL will develop solutions on Predix as an independent software vendor (ISV), and also offer nationwide connectivity infrastructure to customers through a 4G network powered by Jio. GE would offer the security, availability and monitoring aspects of the platform to RIL and its customers. The potential for other revenue streams includes telecom, healthcare and agriculture,” a release said.“The partnership with Reliance Industries will shape the future of the Industrial Internet not just in India, but globally. The possibilities that it opens to develop solutions on our Predix platform for the industrial sector are endless,” GE’s Jeff Immelt said.“India needs to rapidly move to the next level of smart manufacturing which leverages big data, algorithms, and sensor technology. The presence of ubiquitous high bandwidth connectivity and cloud services enabled by Jio will be a key enabler for the rapid growth of IIoT within India,” Ambani said.",

      "text": "Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and US-based GE on Thursday signed a global partnership agreement in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) space to work together to build applications for GE’s Predix platform. \nPredix is a cloud-based platform that helps firms develop apps and connect people with industrial businesses. Industrial IoT essentially uses the connected-devices technologies in manufacturing. \nThe partnership between RIL and GE will provide industrial IoT solutions to customers in industries such as oil and gas, fertilizers, power, healthcare and telecom.\n“GE will provide its Predix cloud offering, industrial internet applications and data science expertise. RIL will develop solutions on Predix as an independent software vendor (ISV), bringing to bear its over 30 years of data, process and operational expertise,” RIL said in a press statement, adding that while it will offer nationwide 4G connectivity infrastructure to customers through its telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm, GE will offer the security and monitoring aspects of the platform to RIL and its customers. \n“The potential for other revenue streams includes telecom, healthcare and agriculture,” RIL said. \n“India needs to rapidly move to the next level of smart manufacturing which leverages big data, algorithms, and sensor technology. The presence of ubiquitous high bandwidth connectivity and cloud services enabled by Jio will be a key enabler for the rapid growth of industrial IoT within India,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, RIL. \nThe benefits include driving operational efficiencies, profitability and new revenue streams by making use of data and analytics. “A 1% productivity gain for companies creates $250 billion value over 15 years, across these key energy and infrastructure industries,” said the statement. \n“The partnership with Reliance Industries will shape the future of the industrial internet not just in India but globally. The possibilities that it opens to develop solutions on our Predix platform for the industrial sector are endless,” said Jeff Immelt, chairman and chief executive of GE.",

      "title": "Drawing developers to new heights in GE’s shift toward software | #GEMM16",
      "text": "With data gathering and management finding new avenues for usage in a wide variety of products and industries, building the software and architecture for handling that data is opening up its own paths for growth by broadening pre-existing tech fields.\nAt the GE Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, CA, Lothar Schubert , director of Developer Relations at GE Digital, met with Jeff Frick ( @JeffFrick ), co-host of theCUBE*, from the SiliconANGLE Media team, to talk about GE’s shift toward more emphasis on software, the role of open-source in that shift and the importance of developers.\nFinding new strengths Schubert began the discussion by pointing out how now was a great time for developers, whether focused on software, architecture or data science, due to the high demands being generated by so many recent tech advances. He noted that there was someone responsible for every digital asset and that finding the right people to generate those assets was currently one of GE Digital’s main drives.\nSchubert also shared that while GE was working with many interesting technologies, including UX technologies and data science, what had him most excited and what had drawn him to the company was the opportunity to have an “impact on the world.”\nAnd to that end, he said GE was making the shift from being solely an industrial company to an industrial and software company. According to Schubert, “Every industrial company needs to also become a digital company” in order to stay competitive, but finding the right developers was another important key to that success.\nSpeed and investment In such a fast-moving market, there were few “standard applications that you can just buy from one of the traditional software houses,” Schubert said. Instead, those applications needed to be built and integrated to the specific environments, which called for developers suited to building in those environments.\nTo reach these skilled developers, “GE is very much invested in open-source, sort of consuming lots of open-source, but also working with the communities, to invest and commit to open-source,” Schubert said. As data management continues growing in importance, thanks to an increase in sensors and improved means of handling the data, it is finding that more than the usual is needed, with physics in particular being a previously-undervalued skill in the field that’s now finding its time to shine.\nAnd with an emphasis on growing the “cloud-to-edge and edge-to-cloud continuum,” along with driving data and reduced operations management each way along that continuum, GE Digital has no intention of slowing down on those investments and engagements anytime soon, Schubert concluded.\nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE and theCUBE’s coverage of GE Minds + Machines .\n*Disclosure: GE and other companies sponsor some GE Minds + Machines segments on SiliconANGLE Media’s theCUBE.

      "text": "Engine: 2x Caterpillar D17000* Length: 33ft 5in* Each locomotive used two diesel engines. Most used the D17000 but three other engines were also used: Hercules DFXD (9 locomotives), Buda 6DH1742 (10 locomotives) and Caterpillar D342 (4 locomotives.) Each engine powered a pair of electric traction motors on one truck. \nPrototype History \nThe diesel electric locomotive offered many cost-saving opportunities to the railroads. Although not necessary as fast or strong as the steam locomotives they were replacing, they were much more efficient. Diesels could run longer without refueling or maintenance which meant they were in service more hours each month. \nEven when out of service, repairs were normally less extensive, expensive and labor intensive. \ncontinue reading below our video 7 Steps to Organize Your Craft Room All of this meant tremendous cost savings in locomotive shops and labor. \nThere was a third and very obvious potential labor savings with the diesels as well - the fireman. For 100 years, locomotives needed a dedicated person to tend to the fire, maintain steam pressure and handle a myriad of other things that came up during a typical run. While some of the early passenger diesels still had a small boiler to generate steam for the passenger equipment heating, for the most part the fireman's job had been replaced by technology. (Even these steam generator boilers were oil fired and required very little attention.) \nThe writing was clearly on the wall for one of railroading's time-honored occupations. And while the railroads were eager to reap the savings, doing so meant potential unemployment to tens of thousands of dedicated employees. \nLabor unions could see the inevitable too. And a strong fight was waged against the elimination of the fireman position from the beginning. Ultimately, the positions wouldn't be abolished until the 1960s on most railroads. And even then it was accomplished through promotion to engineer of all the current employees without rehiring firemen and reworking the training and promotion structures. \nSadly, by the time the position was finally abolished, it had become an easy scapegoat as an example of \"featherbedding.\" The once-noble position, and the still-dedicated workers who filled it, had become the subject of much political rancor for anybody who wanted to make an anti-union argument. \nLong before those days however, an agreement was reached in 1937 which specified that a fireman would be required on all railroad locomotives weighing 90,000 pounds (45 tons) or more. Industrial and military railroads were exempt from this regulation. This weight restriction generally ruled out any locomotive a railroad would consider for service on the mainlines. \nGiven the potential labor savings involved however, even the largest railroads in the United States were more than willing to consider the possibilities for locomotives weighing less than 45 tons and the \"44 tonner\" was born. \nSeveral builders offered locomotives of this weight or less, but the General Electric 44 Ton model was by far the most popular with railroads and industrial users alike. The small center-cab locomotives had a pair of small diesel engines, one under each low hood. These engines powered a pair of traction motors on each of the trucks. The raised cab in the center offered good visibility in either direction for the engineer. A second seat was provided in the cab for the brakeman. \nThese compact locomotives were perfect for use as shop switchers and could be seen in both steam and diesel repair shops . But railroads also weren't afraid to send them out on the road. 44 ton diesels could be found working small branchlines were the local freight was rarely more than a few cars long. While the loss of an employee on these runs was no doubt disturbing to some, without these cost savings there is no doubt that most of those routes would have been abandoned all together much earlier without the cost savings of the diesels. Some short line railroads like the Arcade and Attica completely dieselized with the GE 44 Tonner. \nThese locomotives were also popular in industrial areas where not only their size but their increased crew visibility and decreased smoke made them popular with railroad, crew and city alike. \nIn addition to the common version, GE built lower-cab and narrow gauge models for military and export use. The 44 tonner has been used in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, France, India, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Trinidad and Uraguay. \nThe GE 44 tonner has developed a reputation as an unstoppable workhorse. Many are still in service as they near or pass their 70th anniversaries. Tracking their ownership is also a challenge. It is not at all uncommon for some of today's survivors to have worked for four or more previous owners. \nOperating Railroads \nThe 44 Ton locomotives ran on an amazing variety of railroads. For a complete list of the original owners, see this roster . Many of these locomotives went on to serve other customers as well through mergers and sales. \nSome of the owners were household names like the Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsylvania, Santa Fe and Union Pacific. Then there were the smaller shortlines like the Coudersport and Port Allegheny, Lowville and Beaver River, and Tidewater Southern. Common too were industrial companies from steel mills to railroad car manufacturers and military bases. \nModels \nThe 44 Tonner has been produced in many of the common scales. Just like the prototype, these are perfect for a wide variety of model layouts and uses. \nHO Scale: Bachmann Spectrum, Keystone Locomotive Works (kit), Samhongsa (brass) S Scale: River Raisin Models O Scale: Rich Yoder (2 and 3 rail), Sunset (brass - 2 rail) O Gauge: Williams (Bachmann), Lionel (out of production) - although labeled a 44 Tonner, these models are closer in proportion to a GE 75 ton centercab.

The company has created a software system that allows customers to speak to the digital twin and ask it questions about potential parts breakdowns, financial forecasts and the best way to fix problems. \nThe digital twins are loaded with data they can crunch to provide the best advice — which is given in real language not unlike Siri on the iPhone. \n\"This is happening now,\" Parris, who works in Niskayuna, said after he talked to a digital twin of a steam turbine at a customer site in Southern California. \"What you saw was an example of the human mind working with the mind of a machine.\" \nThe digital twin can run thousands of simulations at a time using environmental and operational data to predict breakdowns or other events. \nAnd when a machine needs to be fixed, GE and its customers can use augmented reality to look inside those machines without having to actually touch them. \nParris put on a Microsoft HoloLens — an augmented reality headset — to superimpose the digital twin over a picture of the actual steam turbine. The HoloLens allowed him to open up the turbine and look at the parts — and see exactly which part may need replacing. \nParris said GE has been partnering with Microsoft on augmented reality technology. He says that AR as it is also called can help GE executives redesign a factory floor by moving parts around in augmented reality. \nIt can also help with training and production, helping to teach workers how to assemble parts even before they ever step on a factory floor. \n\"It's virtual reality,\" Parris said. \n• 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison",

      "text": "The Hidden Upside In The Coming Mexican Crisis (HPQ, GE, GSK) While the peso falls, these stocks should rise on stronger earnings power By , Street Authority | Nov 18, 2016, 9:30 am EST View All Posts \nIf there is one certainty during a Trump presidency it’s that America’s relationship with its southern neighbor will be changing. \nPresident-elect Trump has not only promised to reassess America’s trade agreements, most of all the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but to also reinforce the nation’s border with Mexico. \nMost investors took these policy commitments as a negative sign for the Mexican economy. Accordingly, the peso has acted as a barometer on Trump’s popularity since the primaries, depreciating against the dollar when he rose in the polls and rising after his stumbles. \nNow that Trump is set to change his address to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, investors are bracing for the potential of a full-blown crisis as Mexico stands to lose some of the $250+ billion it books as exports to the United States every year. \nAs usual, the market has failed to see the potential upside in the headline news. Focusing on the bigger picture, investors have missed a trade that could pay off big time over the next several quarters. \nIs A Mexican Crisis Imminent? \nThe Mexican peso plunged 10% in overnight trading on November 8. This represented a huge change for currencies — which rarely move more than a few percent on any given day. The depreciation against the dollar to nearly 21.0 pesos to $1 was the final drop in a roller-coaster that had been whipsawing markets since February. \nWith the writing on the wall of what a Trump presidency could mean to the Mexican economy, the peso had been at the mercy of Trump’s popularity nearly all year. The Best Investments for 2017 \nNote in the chart below that higher value is a depreciation in the peso versus the dollar. \nTrump has promised to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, putting in jeopardy the $259 billion in Mexican exports that benefited from the agreement last year. Trump has also said he would secure the border and deport all the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, many of whom send money back to family in Mexico. \nNot only has the peso sold off but the iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF ( EWW ) is lower by 19% over the last year, falling 8.5% when trading resumed on the 9th of November. \nNAFTA article 2205 does allow any country to withdraw from the agreement six months after written notice. Trump will have no loss of talking points in his negotiations with the Mexican government or other stakeholders. Politifact estimated earlier this year that the United States has lost more than 850,000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico since the 1994 agreement and another study found that 4.5 million manufacturing jobs have gone to other countries as a result of trade agreements. \nManufacturing In Mexico Just Got Cheaper \nBut the investors are missing two very important points that could mean short-term upside for companies with production in Mexico. \nThere’s reason to believe that the new administration may not be so quick to follow through on campaign rhetoric. The United States hasn’t withdrawn from a trade agreement since 1866. Starting a trade war with Mexico could also have far-reaching consequences that wouldn’t be popular with consumers. New tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States could cause prices to surge — and the country is America’s second largest market, buying $214 billion in U.S. goods last year. \nThe plunge in the peso has also made production cheaper for companies with factories in Mexico. The Mexican peso is now trading at the lowest it’s been for more than two decades. Even during the 2009 global financial crisis the peso only reached 14.04 per USD. The peso has lost 23% against the dollar and the euro over the last year. \nThat makes production in Mexico much cheaper in dollar terms and could boost the bottom line for companies producing goods in the country for sale in the United States. \nIn particular, let’s look at three that may see the benefits fall to investors…",

      "text": "By The VAR Guy\nGeneral Electric might officially fall into the category of “diversified industrial company,” but it’s making huge plays to transform into a leader in the tech sector.\nThis week, GE agreed to buy ServiceMax, a cloud-based service company, for $915 million. The investment will enhance its digital operations capabilities and further modernize equipment maintenance, as well as adding heft to its tech business unit.\nGE sees the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as key to its transformation from a diversified industrial company to a digital industrial company that provides connected equipment to automate processes, provide “smart” capabilities and increase productivity. Investments, both in-house and through acquisitions, in cloud and software are critical to that effort.\n“It’s no secret our services revenue is the bulk of our earnings and is a key part of what makes us successful,” Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “We’re moving away from where it’s all on paper to where it’s all becoming fully automated. Services are becoming a key part of the digital economy.”\nRuh’s business unit is on track to become a $15 billion business by 2020, GE says, helped in no small part by its proprietary operating system Predix, which is designed to help industrial equipment be more efficient in a digital world. The OS gives users data analysis capabilities for IoT sensors embedded in industrial equipment. That product will go a long way toward GE cementing its place at the top of the industrial servicing food chain. Ruh says that sector could grow to be a $1 trillion global market over the next 10 years, and digitization of those services will be a huge chunk of that revenue.\nGE Digital also announced an expansion of its channel program this week. Its goal is to help a growing number of independent software vendors (ISVs) use Predix as the foundation for applications to enhance its IIoT capabilities.\n“The ISV program enables GE and its partners to make industrial apps more accessible to a wider range of companies, while helping them increase productivity through the use of the Predix platform,” said Denzil Samuels, global head of channels and alliances at GE Digital. “GE is creating a robust marketplace by collaborating with companies that share GE’s vision for digital transformation and bridge the gap between the industrial and IT worlds to drive successful business outcomes.”\nPartners, it isn’t just big companies from outside industries benefiting from the opening of the tech industry gates. The digital transformation provides new, huge opportunities for the channel, too.\nThis article originally appeared here at The VAR Guy. ",
