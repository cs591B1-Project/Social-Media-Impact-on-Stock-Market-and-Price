British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million ... more Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK 1 / 1 Back to Gallery LONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden , chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals ' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Today's Deals",

British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday, Dec. 7, ... 2016 for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) ( The Associated Press ) \nLONDON – British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nContinue Reading Below \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. ",

      "text": "Investors committing the “free dividends fallacy”?      23 Hours Ago | 04:59 ‹ 04:59 Investors committing the “free dividends fallacy”?      23 Hours Ago 03:44 Time to buy protection?      23 Hours Ago › Health-care stocks sat out the Trump rally Wednesday, but one technician says a rebound could be on the horizon for one of the biggest names in the sector: Pfizer. \nPfizer was one of many biotech and health-care stocks that dropped after Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" piece on Donald Trump quoted the president-elect's vow to cut drug prices. This, along with a $107 million fine from the U.K.'s top antitrust regulator, pulled Pfizer down more than 1 percent during Wednesday trading and took the stock back to early November levels. \nBut Andrew Keene of AlphaShark says that from a technical standpoint, Pfizer looks like it's going to recover. On a chart of Pfizer, Keene says that the stock has fallen back to what he has deemed \"massive support\" at $30, last seen pre-election. Since the $30 acts as support, Keene believes that Pfizer can rise from there to hit another key technical marker. \n\"I think it can spike up to that 150-week moving average, which is known as a smoothing mechanism level of resistance at $34,\" Keene said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \nIn other words, the trader sees Pfizer up about 9 percent in the next few months and returning to its levels in early October. Since hitting a year-to-date high in August, the pharma giant has plunged more than 16 percent. \n\n\nKeene is predicting that the 9 percent rally he sees coming for Pfizer will materialize in March. As a result, he is looking to buy the March 33-strike calls and sell the May 34-strike calls to make a \"bull call spread\" for 20 cents debit, or $20 per options spread. \nFor Keene to break even on the trade, Pfizer would have to close at $33.20 on March expiration. If Pfizer closes below that level on the expiration date, Keene would lose the $20 he paid to make the trade. But if Pfizer were to close above the $34 that the trader believes it can reach, he would see a big reward. \n\"I could quintuple my money on this trade — it can go to $1,\" explained Keene. \"I think it's a great trade [with] a great reward-to-risk setup.\" \nPfizer is still up 2 percent in the past month, but the summer breakdown in biotech stocks has made it so that the pharma company is more than 3 percent lower year to date. \nTrader Takeaway: Andrew Keene sees Pfizer rallying 9 percent to $34 in March, so he's buying the March 33/34 bull call spared for $0.20, or $20 per options spread.",

Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. \n ",

      "title": "U.K. watchdog smacks Pfizer with record fine, citing a 2,600% price hike",
      "text": "The U.K. government slapped Pfizer with a record fine for an epilepsy drug licensing deal that triggered a 2,600% price increase.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority says Pfizer dodged price controls by licensing out an unprofitable drug, then marketed under the brand name Epanutin, to a U.K. distributor that “debranded” the med and jacked up the price. The agency fined Pfizer £85 million, or about $108 million.\nThe company said it “refutes the findings” and plans to appeal. “Pfizer believes the CMA's findings are wrong in fact and law and will be appealing all aspects of the decision,” the company said in a statement posted on its U.K. website.\nAccording to the CMA, the branded drug Epanutin had been subject to price restrictions. As an unbranded med, phenytoin sodium was not. Previously sold to the National Health Service for £2.83 per pack, the drug went up to £67.50 after Flynn Pharma bought the marketing rights, the CMA said in a Wednesday statement. The price decreased to £54 two years later.\nThough Flynn marketed phenytoin sodium, Pfizer manufactured it under a supply deal. The prices Flynn paid to Pfizer for the drug were “significantly higher” than those Pfizer had been able to charge the NHS for the brand under government price controls. “[B]etween 780% and 1,600% higher than Pfizer’s previous prices,” the agency said.\nThe companies “deliberately exploited” the debranding mechanism to raise the drug’s price, said Philip Marsden, who headed up the investigation at the CMA. In addition to Pfizer’s £85 million fine, the agency levied an additional £5.2 million fine on Flynn Pharma. The companies have been under investigation in this case for more than a year, and the CMA says it has several other pharma probes underway.\nThe enormous price increase on an older drug echoes U.S. hikes that put a slate of smaller pharmas under fire. Turing, Valeant, Horizon, Condordia and others have been castigated—and investigated—for buying older products and hiking prices dramatically. In Turing’s case, which started a public outcry last year, it was a 1,600% hike on the long-off-patent toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim.\nThe U.S. pricing debate has surged with each new revelation of an out-of-the-ordinary price increase, tarring the industry’s reputation with a public that has historically been skeptical in any case, despite pharma’s big spending on research and new treatments it produces. Pharma and biotech industry leaders have tried to fight back with marketing campaigns that highlight biopharma’s lifesaving treatments and the cost savings drugs can offer.\nTwo companies—Allergan, and now, Novo Nordisk—have gone so far as to promise to limit their own price increases to single-digit margins annually. Pfizer itself rolled out an image campaign that focuses on the long scientific journey each new drug makes from idea to market.\nPfizer said its arrangement with Flynn was a chance to “secure ongoing supply” of an important medicine, and maintain “continuity of manufacture.” It had been selling the drug at a loss. After licensing the drug, Flynn set a price 25% to 40% less than the price of an equivalent medicine from another supplier, “which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health,” Pfizer said in its statement.\nThe CMA says the health service was stuck using phenytoin sodium rather than an alternate drug because of the risks posed by moving stable patients onto a different med, including another manufacturer’s version of the product. “As a result, the NHS had no alternative to paying the increased prices for the drug,” the CMA said.\nThe U.S. FDA has said that epilepsy patients can be particularly sensitive to medication switches, from brand to generic, or from one manufacturer’s generic to another.\nWarwick Smith, director general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, called Pfizer’s deal with Flynn “cynical.” It disrupts the “virtuous circle” between the companies that spend billions to develop new drugs and the generics makers that sell cheap versions after patents expire, “massively” reducing costs to the healthcare system.\n“When originators put their resources into artificially increasing the commercial value of their older products by extending their monopoly, they not only cost the NHS more money, but fail to live up to their promise to society to deliver much needed new medicines,” Smith said in an emailed statement.\nIn its own broad view of the situation, Pfizer said the CMA’s ruling highights “real policy and legal issues” about the respective roles of the Department of Health and the CMA in regulating U.K. drug prices. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process,” the company said.",

PHOTOS: PFIZER Published Chia Yan Min Economics Correspondent \nAmerican drug giant Pfizer has officially opened a Manufacturing Technology Development Centre here to develop new high-tech manufacturing technologies. \nThe firm declined to reveal how much it invested but said the centre on Jurong Island will bump up its staff strength here by hiring chemical engineers, chemists and analysts. The centre will collaborate with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, universities and other research institutes. \nIt will provide engineering and chemistry solutions to support operations at Pfizer's Tuas manufacturing facility and throughout its global network. \nThe launch \"demonstrates our continued focus on innovating to bring therapies that significantly improve patients' lives as well as manufacturing excellence\", said Mr George Routhier, the managing director and site leader of Pfizer Asia Pacific. \nThe Economic Development Board's director of biomedical sciences, Ms Ho Weng Si, noted that the move is \"testament to Singapore's capabilities as a global pharmaceutical hub, and is aligned with our continued focus on positioning Singapore as a choice location for companies to develop manufacturing technologies that will drive the production of current and future pipeline products\". \nPfizer is best known for drugs such as Lipitor, used to lower blood cholesterol, and Viagra, for erectile dysfunction. The company has had a presence in Singapore since 1964, when it started out with 10 employees. It now has more than 600 staff here - about 500 at its Tuas manufacturing site and 100 in its corporate office.   'Pfizer opens manufacturing development centre'.  ",

British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016 for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Tags",

      "text": "Pfizer, Flynn fined over drug price increase Published December 07. 2016 4:06PM By Patrick Gower, Bloomberg \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma were fined a record amount for abusing their dominant position in the U.K. by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority fined Pfizer 84.2 million pounds, or $106 million, and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds after they increased prices by as much as 2,600 percent in September 2012, the regulator said Wednesday. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” said Philip Marsden, chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA’s investigation. “These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.’’ \nBritain’s National Health Service spent about 50 million pounds on the anti-epilepsy capsules in 2013 and 40 million pounds in 2014, the CMA said in its August 2015 complaint. The amount the NHS was charged for 100-milligram packs of the drug “rocketed” from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 pounds, before dropping to 54 pounds starting in May 2014, the CMA said Wednesday. \nPfizer said that it “refutes” the findings of the regulator. Both companies said they will appeal. \n“Phenytoin capsules were a loss-making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture,” the company said in a statement. “When Flynn launched its product, the company set a price that was between 25 and 40 percent less than the price of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health.” \nA Flynn spokesman said the CMA had “ignored or misunderstood” important aspects of its investigation, including the fact that alternative epilepsy drugs were more expensive than phenytoin. \n“Phenytoin sodium capsules are already less expensive than the alternative equivalent drugs in the U.K. market,” a Flynn spokesman said. “It beggars belief that the CMA seeks to punish Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules at a significant discount to phenytoin tablets.” \nSteep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. bearing the brunt of the public outrage. President-elect Donald Trump, who had been cited as a boon to free-market health care, also declared himself an opponent of high drug prices in an interview with Time magazine. His comments weighed down biotech stocks in the U.S. on Wednesday. \n“Illegal excessive pricing is usually very difficult to prove — how do you identify the ‘right’ price and how much extra margin is ‘excessive?’” said Duncan Liddell, a competition partner at law firm Ashurst. “Here the CMA has clearly decided to make a point with a record U.K. fine.” \nPrior to September 2012, prices were regulated when Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin, the CMA said. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the distribution rights for Epanutin to Flynn Pharma, which de-branded the drug, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n“Although Pfizer has claimed that Epanutin was loss-making before it was de-branded, the CMA has calculated that, according to Pfizer’s figures, all such losses would have been recovered within 2 months of the price rises,” the regulator said. \nPhenytoin sodium, sold as Dilantin in the U.S., is used to prevent and control seizures by reducing the spread of seizure activity in the brain. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” the CMA’s Marsden said.",

Shire ( LON:SHP ) was down 1.28% to 4,502p, while GlaxoSmithKline ( LON:GSK ) added 0.14% to stand at 1,462p. \nIt's been a while since we've heard the term \"bird flu\" muttered but it's back...and just in time for Christmas. \nThere have been multiple reports of the disease causing wild bird deaths in mainland Europe and now there are big warning winging across the UK. \nBird keepers, including those with just a few chickens - are legally obliged to take all practicable steps to ensure poultry and other captive birds are kept separate from wild birds. \nThe Scottish government has ordered that birds must be kept indoors for 30 days. \nAvian flu, also known as bird flu is a virus can affect humans - causing symptoms ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and even death.",

      "text": "Pfizer fined $106M for 2600% price hike on epilepsy drug Kevin McCoy , USA TODAY , KHOU 5:31 PM. CST December 07, 2016 \nA British regulator on Wednesday hit U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer with a record $106 million fine for imposing a 2600% price hike on an anti-epilepsy medication, the latest episode in widening public controversy over prescription drug prices. \nNew York-based Pfizer broke a competition law by \"charging excessive and unfair prices\" in the United Kingdom for phenytoin sodiumcapsules in Sept. 2012, after the drug was deliberately de-branded, said the Competition and Markets Authority , Britain's top regulator. \nPfizer ( PFE ) denied the allegation and said it would appeal the ruling. The company's shares were down 2.1% at $30.89 in morning trading after the announcement. \nThe regulator said the cost of the anti-epilepsy drug used by an estimated 48,000 U.K. patients to prevent and control medical seizures jumped from $3.57 for 100-milligram packages of the medication to $85.06. The price was ultimately reduced to $68.05 in May 2014, the CMA said. \nAs a result, Britain's National Health Service annual spending for the drug rose from roughly $2.5 million in 2012 to approximately $63 million the following year, the CMA said. \nEpilepsy patients who have already been using phenytoin sodium capsules usually should not switch to alternative medications, so the health service was forced to pay the higher prices, the regulator said. \n\"Businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit but those holding a dominant position should not abuse this situation and set prices that are excessive and unfair,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement issued with the announcement. \nThe regulator also imposed a $6.5 million fine on British drug distributor Flynn Pharma over separate price increases of the anti-epilepsy medication. \nFlynn and Pfizer have held a dominant position in their respective U.K. markets for the manufacture and supply of the drug, the CMA said. \nThe companies were ordered given 30 working days to four months to cut their prices for the drug. The regulator also said the firms would be allowed to charge prices that are profitable but not excessive. \n\"Pfizer refutes the findings set out in the Competition and Markets Authority decision. In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" the company said in a formal statement. \nThe medication was \"a loss making product\" for the company, the Pfizer said. The fine and ruling \"highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.\", Pfizer added, saying it will seek clarity on the issues as part of its appeal. \nFlynn also said it would appeal, characterizing the CMA ruling as \"based on a wholly flawed understanding of the U.K. pharmaceutical market.\" \nThe British fines come amid U.S. complaints and investigations of other pharmaceutical companies for similar price hikes on widely used prescription drugs. \nMylan drew criticism this year after the cost of EpiPen, a life-saving anti-allergy injection, rose to about $600 for a two-pack, up from about $100 in 2009. The company agreed to a $465 million settlement with regulators over the way the medication was classified for reimbursement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . ",

Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \nREAD MORE: Australian students make $2 version of malaria drug price-hiked by Martin Shkreli \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. Story continues below \nWATCH ABOVE: Sydney Grammar school students have produced a crucial malaria drug ingredient in Sydney University’s chemistry lab for a fraction of the price that “pharma-bro” Martin Shkreli hiked from $13.50 to $750 in 2015. The university launched the Open Source Malaria project in 2015, following Shkreli’s notorious price increase. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer’s name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \nREAD MORE: Company behind 5,000% drug price hike being investigated by US Senate \n“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 per cent to 40 per cent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n“The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,” the company said. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.” \nREAD MORE: Martin Shkreli raffles off chance to punch him in the face \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 per cent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. © 2016 The Canadian Press ",

Show Caption Previous Next LONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.
