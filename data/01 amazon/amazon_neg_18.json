      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAmazon is launching family plans for its Music Unlimited service today, something that the company promised it would do when it launched the music-streaming service last month . Pricing will be $14.99 per month or $149 per year for Prime members, while non-Prime members will only have the option to use the monthly pricing. \nThe new plans are only available in the United States right now, as the service only launched in the UK earlier this week . Family plans in the country are listed as coming soon, but when they are available, they will cost £14.99 per month or £149 per year. \nThe app will offer personalized service and recommendations to each of the up to six members of the account. Here is the full list of plans: \n$7.99/month, $79/year for Prime members \n$9.99/month for non-Prime customers \n$3.99/month on a single Echo, Echo Dot or Amazon Tap \n$14.99/month for Prime and non-Prime customers or $149/year Family plan for Prime members \nThe new plans are live now, and you can sign up for them here . If you haven't tried out Amazon Music Unlimited, you're entitled to a 30-day free trial, which can be useful if you have an Alexa-powered device to use voice commands with. Tags",

      "text": "  Amazon ad may be first to feature a Muslim cleric The television ad will air in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany Post to Facebook Amazon ad may be first to feature a Muslim cleric The television ad will air in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany  //usat.ly/2fYGimi   Amazon ad may be first to feature a Muslim cleric Elizabeth Weise , USATODAY 10:16   An ad for Amazon Prime released on Nov. 15, 2016. Advertising researchers believe it may be the first aired in the United States to feature a Muslim cleric as a main character. (Photo: Amazon Prime) \nSAN FRANCISCO – The most surprising thing about Amazon’s latest ad for its Prime service is that it appears to be the first time a Muslim cleric has been featured in a television ad shown in the United States. \n“I can’t think of one. There are plenty of religious figures in televisions, especially sitcoms and police procedurals. But no ads with imams,” said Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of advertising at Boston University. \nAmazon has done several wordless ads for Prime featuring people buying what it terms charming solutions for everyday problems. They include a father buying a lion’s mane for the family dog so the new baby isn’t scared of it, a dog with a broken leg getting a lift in a baby carrier and a grandfather using a leaf blower to power his granddaughter’s swing. \nThe new ad, which begins airing in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany on Wednesday, would be no different were the subject matter not so rare. \nSet in England, the commercial begins with an Episcopal priest opening the door for his good friend a Muslim imam. The two older men talk, laugh and share a cup of tea, both wincing at their creaky knees as they sit and stand. \nAfter they part, both pull out their phones, tap the Prime app and order something. \nNext we see them getting a delivery at their respective homes and it’s clear they’ve each bought the other identical knee pads. \nThe end of the 120-second ad features both men in their respective houses of worship, kneeling in prayer. \nAmazon didn’t set out to make any kind of political statement and the subject had nothing to do with the recently concluded U.S. presidential election, the company was quick to say. Work on the ad had already begun in June, said Simon Morris, Amazon’s European Union director of advertising. \nHowever it’s clear that the topic is of concern, as Amazon does not generally reach out to the press in advance about its television ads but did with this one. \nRespectful \nThe producers worked with several religious groups Including the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Churches and the Islamic Circle of North America to insure the ad was respectful, said Morris. \nThe lead characters in the commercial are played by actual religious leaders. They are Gary Bradley, vicar at St Mary's and Paddington Green in London and Zubier Mohammad, principal of the Muslim School Oadby in Leicester, Morris said. The advertisement was filmed at two churches, St. Dunstan and All Saints Stepney Church in London and at the East London Mosque. \nWhile Muslims are a small minority in the United States, making up just under 1% of the U.S. population, there are 3.3 million of them and there have been Muslim communities in the country for decades. \nDespite that, advertising professors and historians had to think hard about whether an Islamic religious leader had ever been depicted in an ad. \n“We certainly have used priests, nuns, ministers, rabbi's and many other clerical types, but I have no memory of a Muslim Cleric ever being used,” said John Verret, who worked in advertising for 40 years and now faculty advisor to the Boston University AdLab, a student-run advertising agency. \nThat could be because advertisers have faced backlash in the past. \nIn 2011 Lowe’s pulled ads from a TLC reality series, All-American Muslim, because of pressure from a Florida conservative group that objected to the fact that the show depicted Muslims as “ ordinary folks while excluding many Islamic believers whose agenda poses a clear and present danger to liberties and traditional values that the majority of Americans cherish.” The show was later cancelled. \nIn England, where Muslims make up 5% of the population, the ad follows the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. The so-called Brexit referendum stemmed in part with dissatisfaction with a surge in immigration and set off a wave of attacks on Poles and Muslims in late June. \nWhile holiday ads are just ads in the United States, they have a whole different cultural connotation in the United Kingdom. There, the annual arrival of “Christmas adverts” in awaited with the same anticipation that is reserved for Super Bowl ads in the United States. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "print \nJeremy Clarkson AP \nOn Friday, Amazon is giving a 20% discount off its wildly popular Prime service, which gives free two-day shipping, as well as access to a library of video and music. \nPrime usually costs $99 dollars per year, but on Friday starting at 12:00 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT, it will cost $79 for the year for new members. \nThe promotion coincides with the release of \"The Grand Tour,\" Amazon's new blockbuster Jeremy Clarkson show, which even got a nod from competitor Netflix in its latest earnings report. \nHere's a quick summary of some of the best Prime perks: Free two-day shipping. Access to Prime Video, which houses \"t housands of movies and TV shows.\" These include both licensed titles and Amazon's original series like \"Transparent,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" and so on. Access to Prime Music, which lets you stream \"more than two million\" songs. Photo storage via Prime Photos. Access to a library of ebooks via Prime Reading. \nWhile many people love Prime for the two-day shipping, Amazon has recently made a big commitment to supercharging its video offerings. \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nIt's also shelling out a whopping $160 million for a new mafia drama starring Robert De Niro, who is snagging $850,000 per episode, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Amazon Begins Cracking Down on Product Counterfeiters Online by Bryan M. Wolfe November 16, 2016 \nThis week, Amazon.com filed two lawsuits against sellers who allegedly have been listing counterfeit goods on its site. The move comes just as the largest online retailer in the world gears up for the all-important holiday buying season, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nTo fuel its growth, Amazon has increasingly relied on third-party sellers. Today, half of Amazon’s sales have been generated by outside merchants. This process has led to a rise of counterfeit goods in the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon program. \nAmazon’s lawsuits, which were filed in Washington State, pertain to fake versions of the Forearm Forklift, a strap system that allows users to lift heavy items, and TRX Suspension Trainer workout bands and products. \nThe suits note: \nWhen customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon’s brand and causing irreparable reputational harm. Apple \nLast month, Apple said that fake power adapters were rampant on Amazon. As Patently Apple noted at the time: \n… Apple filed a trademark infringement cases against Mobile Star LLC for selling counterfeit power products such as power adapters and charging cables through Amazon.com. Apple believes these counterfeit products could lead to fires and are therefore a risk to the public. \nAs a long-time Amazon buyer, I’m thrilled by this news. Hopefully, we’ll see more crackdowns in the future. \nIn the meantime, you can protect yourself by only buying products on Amazon that say “ Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.” View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC.

(WTOP/Kelley Vlahos) \nWASHINGTON — Amazon has expanded its Prime Now two-hour delivery to several D.C. neighborhoods, three months after promoting the service in some Northern Virginia neighborhoods. \nThe two-hour delivery is free for Amazon Prime members. \nWashington-area neighborhoods now covered by the service include Capitol Hill, Georgetown, Friendship Heights, Springfield, Arlington and Alexandria. See if your ZIP code is included in the delivery area , and Amazon says if it is not, you can request it. \nThe Prime Now delivery service includes what Amazon calls tens of thousands of daily essentials, from staples, such as paper towels, milk or ice cream, and electronics, including laptops and Amazon Kindle devices. \nIn the Washington region, Prime Now two-hour delivery is available from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week. \nWhat do Prime members in Washington need right now? The list isn’t what you’d think. \nAmazon says since launching in the suburbs in August, top items purchased for superfast delivery through the service include bananas, water, organic baby carrots and Haribo gummy bears.",

      "text": "share Amazon isn’t just starting Black Friday early this year, it’s extending it far beyond Thanksgiving weekend until December 22nd. The company claims that you’ll be able to “find new deals as often as every five minutes” on Amazon’s website for the next 35 days until the holidays. To that end, Amazon has released some of the deals and discounts it intends to offer during this apparently endless cycle of commercial consumption. All the sales will be offered at some point between now and December 22nd, with many of the deals coming in what Amazon is calling the “Turkey 5” — the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday — although no exact scheduling or timing has been announced yet. Most of the announced deals so far are primarily focused on Amazon hardware products, with a couple other sales also having been announced. But if you want to make sure you’re catching the best deals when they happen, you’ll want to check Amazon’s Black Friday hub page frequently. That said, here’s the best from Amazon so far:",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 at 09:00 AM EST Onestop Internet Survey Proves Amazon is the Threat Apparel Brands Never Saw Coming this Holiday Season \nLOS ANGELES, CA --(Marketwired - November 16, 2016) - Onestop Internet, a leading full-spectrum eCommerce and Omni-channel solutions provider, today released survey results validating the very real threat that Amazon brings to apparel brands banking on online sales this holiday season. \nOf the 57 percent of respondents saying they plan to purchase apparel online this holiday season, 64 percent said they intend to buy apparel from Amazon. This puts significant pressure on brands already facing constant challenges in today's competitive retail climate. \n\"We always hear about Amazon being a threat to retailers like Wal-Mart, but we rarely discuss the web giant as a viable competitor to individual fashion brands,\" said Michael Wang, President and CEO of Onestop. \"We are advising our portfolio of premium apparel brands to take note and adjust their holiday strategies accordingly.\" \nPer the survey results, social media should play a key role in apparel brands' digital strategies heading into holiday. 55 percent of respondents who plan to purchase apparel online this holiday season said they would be much more likely to purchase apparel if they saw a discount promoted on social media. \nOnline shopping will play a key role in retail sales, in large part because of the transparency it provides shoppers. 44 percent of shoppers who prefer to buy apparel online value the ability to compare prices. Brands need to make sure their online inventory is priced competitively and that value is clearly communicated to drive direct sales. \nTo view complete results from the Onestop survey please click here. For more information on Onestop and its services please visit www.onestop.com. \nMethodology Details \nOnestop partnered with Survata to conduct a study to learn about consumer online shopping habits for apparel. Survata interviewed 501 online respondents ages 18 and older between October 14, 2016 and October 17, 2016. The margin of error for this study at a 95% confidence level is 4.4%. Survata is an independent consumer research firm that reaches consumers through a network of online publishers. Respondents do not receive cash or any other \"collectible\" incentive (miles, points, credits, etc.) Read more at survata.com/methodology. \nAbout Onestop Internet \nFounded in 2003, Los Angeles-based Onestop Internet is a full-spectrum eCommerce partner backed by blue-chip investors Bessemer Ventures and Fung Capital USA (Li & Fung.)

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited Gets $14.99 Family Plan  36 PST \nAmazon recently launched a new standalone music streaming service called Amazon Music Unlimited . It’s now offering a plan to subscribers that many of its rivals like Spotify and Apple Music already do. The company has introduced a $14.99 Family Plan for Amazon Music Unlimited.   the plan enables members of a family to enjoy full access to the streaming service for one set subscription charge per month. \nThe Family Plan for Amazon Music Unlimited is actually quite similar to the one that Apple Music and Spotify offer. For $14.99 per month, the Family Plan allows up to six people to share an account. Users in the United States can now sign up for this plan. \nAmazon Music Unlimited is the company’s standalone music streaming service. Like most of its rivals it’s also priced at $9.99 per month. However, there’s an added incentive for Amazon Prime members, they can subscribe to this service for $7.99 per month. \nPricing for the Family Plan remains the same at $14.99 for all users whether or not they subscribe to Amazon Prime or not. It may not have made sense to Amazon because an argument can be made here that the company could have provided an extra incentive to Prime members in a bid to boost its overall subscriptions for the annual program. \nFiled in Audio .

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited Launches $15 Per Month Family Plan Wednesday November 16, 2016 7:42 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Amazon today has expanded its Music Unlimited streaming service with a new subscription tier: $14.99 per month for a \" Family Plan .\" The option supports up to six family members (at least 13-years-old) for simultaneous listening and personal recommendations. There's also an alternative payment option to pay $149 upfront for an entire year of the Family Plan, cutting the subscription down to about $12 per month (via TechCrunch ). The plan works by creating an Amazon account for each family member, but there is no unified family account; as Amazon said, \"the only thing that's shared is the payment.\" On the plan, one family member uses a \"shared payment method\" to pay for the subscription, which is a debit or credit card that Amazon uses to charge each month for the service. Each member can make purchases on Amazon and Amazon Music Unlimited with the shared payment method, and the subscriber of the plan will get notifications of all the activity going through the group. Despite the group connectivity, each member will have \"the same functionality as the Individual Plan subscription,\" with personalized music, library, playlists, and recommendations. The Individual Plan launched in October and marked Amazon's entry into the on-demand music streaming category, along with Apple Music and Spotify. Amazon's Family Plan directly sits alongside Apple Music's $14.99 per month Family Membership , which grants the full Apple Music experience for up to six people. Read up on more information about Amazon Music Unlimited's new Family Plan here .",

      "text": "November 15, 2016 – /PressAdvantage/ – DenadaDance, a business in Minden, NV, has charged itself with developing foot care products for everyday people in an effort to increase their comfort and quality of life. They have recently released their new DenadaDance bunion relief set on Amazon UK and this product has been very positively received. In fact, they have received more than 25 positive reviews in the short time since launching the product, quickly turning it into a best selling item.\nDenadaDance’s Elena Vera was Quote: d: “We are so happy to hear that people have found relief using our bunion relief set . Bunions are very common, particularly in this time of year, as people start to wear constrictive shoes again, to the detriment of their feet. This product ensures that nobody has to be in pain or uncomfortable, and we’re very happy to see that people like our new product so much.”\nThe bunion relief set comes with two toe separators and two bunion protectors. Both have been made using a comfortable, stretchy, gel material, allowing it to fit on most foot sizes. The toe spacers are important in the prevention of bunions, by ensuring proper and natural toe alignment. This is very important for people who wear shoes with tight toes, for instance. The bunion protector, meanwhile, has been designed to ensure the sensitive skin on the bunion is protected while it heals. Put together, the two elements can significantly increase someone’s overall foot comfort, and thereby their quality of life.\n“We often take our feet for granted,” adds Elena Vera. “We don’t look after them properly and definitely don’t give them the care and attention they deserve for carrying us around all day, while put away inside tight shoes. It is no surprise, therefore, that things sometimes go wrong, leading to the development of bunions, corns, hammer toes, and so on. Our product helps to prevent all of that.”\nBunion relief is often hard to find. In fact, many people seek surgical interventions in order to make sur they find relief. Yet, thanks to the line of DenadaDance products, people may just be able to avoid this in the future.\n###\nContact DenadaDance:\nElena Vera\n1 858 869 1665\npress@denadadance.com\n2220 Meridian Blvd\nSuite # W8026\nMinden, NV 89423\nReleaseID: 60013158\n ",

      "text": "When Amazon launched its free two-hour delivery service, known as Prime Now , in Northern Virginia, we celebrated the fact that Prime members whose zip code fell into the delivery zone could order so many late night snacks via the delivery window that’s open 8 AM through midnight seven days a week.\nApparently Northern Virginians were actually excited about the snack foods, as according to an Amazon representative, Haribo gummy bears were one of the top-ten most ordered items via Prime Now in Northern Virginia and Southern Maryland. The others were bananas, water, and organic baby carrots. Huh. Double huh on the water.\nNow, DC residents who are Amazon Prime members can join in on the super-fast delivery service, ordering all the emergency milk, toilet paper, gummy bears, or you know, water, that they need, to be delivered within two hours of ordering. Check the Prime Now site see if the service is available in your zip code, then go ahead and order away .\n \n\" Finally!

Time\nAmazon is adding lots of fulfillment centers in order to deliver packages faster. (Photo: The Motley Fool)\nCorrections & clarifications: A prior version of the story originally said the below deals would be available over the next 35 days. The story has been updated to reflect that they will be available between November 18 and Black Friday\nAmazon, the sleeping giant as other retailers unveiled their Black Friday plans, is back with a vengeance, rolling out a slew of rock-bottom deals on television sets.\nWhile not every deal has been detailed, the company has put out a list of some items customers can expect to see discounted at various points between November 18 and Black Friday. Among the notable are a variety of cheap TV deals:\nA 32-inch 720p LED TV for $69.99. A 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $199. A 32-inch TCL 720p Smart TV, Amazon’s Choice, for $125. A 55-inch LG 4K Smart TV for $398. USA TODAY\nTips for getting deals for the Black Friday weekend\nOther deals include a Denon Heos 1 speaker for $99.99 and Sennheiser's HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphones for $99.95, both roughly $100 off.\nHyundai is how owners can now use Amazon's Echo home connectivity system in conjunction with their cars (Photo: Hyundai)\nAs has already been seen at other retailers, Amazon will be giving its own devices some hefty discounts. The Echo smart speaker will be $139.99, and the portable Tap Bluetooth smart speaker will be $89.99.\nThe Echo Dot speaker accessory will be $39.99, a $10 discount. The Fire TV streaming stick will see a similar discount and drop to $29.99. Various Kindle eBooks and Fire tablets will also see discounts ranging from $20 to $30.\nEarlier this month, the online giant announced it would begin offering deals from Nov. 1 in the build-up to the shopping holiday. Early Wednesday morning the company further explained what it'd be doing for the major holiday shopping weekend, providing details for its plans in the days leading up to, during and after Black Friday.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon's Black Friday deals start today\nAmazon will begin offering discounts as early as November 18 and run until December 22. The company promises that new deals will be available as often as every five minutes, and is advising shoppers to keep an eye on the \"Turkey 5,\" or the five days of shopping starting Thanksgiving Thursday and running through Cyber Monday, for the best deals.\nBeyond electronics, Amazon will be offering up to a 60% discount on \"Disney favorites\" including toys and apparel as well as up to 50% off on \"select toys from Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price.\" A Blu-ray gift set of season 6 of the The Walking Dead will be $50 off and the complete series of the Game of Thrones books will get a 20% cut.\nSimilar to Prime Day and other recent sales, Amazon is employing its intelligent digital assistant, Alexa, to help drive purchases through special \"Alexa exclusive\" deals. Simply asking the digital assistant “Alexa, what are your deals?” will reveal specials of the day.\nAmazon is promising over 70 deals through this method including a brand unknown 40-inch 1080p LED TV for $125 and the TP-Link Smart Plug, which can allow you to control traditional appliances through Alexa, for $17.95, or $12 off.\nAlexa is just the latest Amazon service to be deployed for the shopping holiday, though the best deals and values remain to subscribers of the company's premium Prime service. In addition to giving subscribers a 30-minute head start on the company's \"Lightning Deals\" and free two-day shipping, Amazon has expanded the service to now offering free one-day shipping on over 1 million items in 29 cities.\nUSA TODAY\nBest Buy storms Black Friday with deep discounts on TVs\nIf you're in an area that has access to the company's Prime Now same-day delivery service you'll be able to shop on \"more than a hundred\" Black Friday deals and have them delivered in one to two hours.\nAmazon's Black Friday plans cap what is expected to be a busy season for holiday shoppers. According to the National Retail Federation, the average American consumer is expected to spend $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, with 56.5% of shopping being done online.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal ​​\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nBLACK FRIDAY AND CYBER MONDAY The best Black Friday deals for Apple products | 0:46 The best Black Friday deals for Apple products at Target, Walmart, and Best Buy.

      "text": "A month ago, Amazon generated some buzz when it rolled out a new music streaming service with an unusual pricing model. Regular customers could get Amazon Music Unlimited for $10 a month (comparable to Spotify and Apple Music), Prime members could have access for $8 a month, and anyone could sign up for $4 a month but the service would be restricted to one Echo device.\nNow, Amazon is introducing one more option for customers who want access to Music Unlimited’s catalog of “tens of millions” of songs.\nStarting today, customers can sign up for Amazon’s family plan, which grants up to six family members access to Music Unlimited on all of their devices. The service costs $180 per year ($15 a month) for non-Prime customers and $150 per year for Prime members.\nMusic Unlimited is a late arrival to the crowded music streaming party but Amazon is hoping its competitive prices and deep integration with Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers the Echo devices, can distinguish the service.",

      "text": "Amazon will see Newegg , Best Buy or T-Mobile’s extended Black… Weeks, and raise them 35 days of Black Friday Shopping. That’s right, the e-commerce giant is promising “new deals as often as every five minutes – now through December 22.”\nThe goal of this super-prolonged sales event? To help customers “shop anywhere, any time, and any way, especially during the five super popular days for online shopping running from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday”, according to company bigwig Steve Shure.\nSo, yeah, the best and most deals will still go down in the “Turkey 5” days between Thursday, November 24, and Monday the 28th. But it’s probably wise to keep your eyes peeled for a multitude of deeply discounted items, ranging from electronics to toys to fashion items, getting their markdowns on “various dates and times” over the next 35 days.\nCase in point, the Fire HD 6 tablet is already up for grabs at $50, not $70 or $100, with coupon code “FireHD6.” A number of other homebrewed Amazon gadgets are due instant rebates soon enough, including the Fire Kids Edition slate (to be priced at $75 instead of $100), Kindle and Kindle Voyage e-readers ($50 and $170 respectively after $30 cuts), the Fire TV media streamer ($75 from $90), and Tap smart speaker ($90 from $130). Pretty exciting stuff, don’t you think?\nThe post Amazon previews even more in-house gear holiday deals, stretching Black Friday shopping to 35 days appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

But one price tier was consipciously missing: a family plan \nThat’s now available. As with other major streaming services, up to six people can access the family plan for $14.99 per month. Alternatively, you can save yourself 30 bucks by signing up for a full year for $149. Watch Live \nAll family members get their own set of tailored suggestions so you don’t screw up your sister’s music recommendations, and there’s no limit to simultaneous playback across accounts. \nAnd no, you don’t actually have to be family.

      "text": "Reddit \nTucked in Amazon’s big Black Friday news this morning was the announcement of a handy Package X-Ray feature for its iPhone shopping app . The app can now leverage your iPhone’s camera to reveal the contents of an Amazon delivery without having to actually open up the package or hunt down tracking numbers. \nDuring the holiday season while you’re likely receiving multiple Amazon packages fairly regularly, this new feature will allow you to quickly sift through boxes so you can decide which ones need to be opened right away and which can wait. It’ll also allow you to keep presents concealed before you’re ready to start wrapping. No doubt this will add a bit of convenience to your Black Friday shopping this year … and it’s just cool technology. \nIt will only work on packages tied to your Amazon account so you don’t have to worry about your kids or spouse ruining any surprises (as long as you don’t share an account, that is). \nBlack Friday officially kicked off today at Amazon and is set to last longer than a month . \nAmazon released a short promo video showing how Package X-Ray works: Guides",

Amazon prepares for The Grand Tour with a discount on Prime 0 Share: \nA car \"crashed\" into the ground at a promotional event for the new show in Berlin. Photo by Getty Images \nThis Friday, November 18th, the old \"Top Gear\" team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May reunite to the delight of gearheads everywhere in a new series from Amazon called \"The Grand Tour.\" To celebrate the occasion, Amazon's introducing a new skill for Alexa and offering its Prime service at a discount. \nAmazon Prime normally costs $100 a year. Starting at 12 am ET this Friday, you'll be able to sign up for a year of Prime for $80 if you're a first time user. The promotion lasts until 11:59 pm PT. Prime gives you access to lots of streaming video content, as well as music and free shipping. \nThe automated assistant built into popular devices like the Amazon Echo , Alexa's excited about The Grand Tour too. You can enable the Alexa skill via the app, then your Echo will provide teasers on Thursdays before the weekly Grand Tour episode, and offer a chance to play trivia about the episode on Saturdays. You can win a gift card if you play, and unlock extra video content if you get the questions right. \nEven if you're not a car person, the $20 discount makes this as good of a time as any to jump into Prime if you haven't -- though I'm bummed the discount doesn't apply to current customers.",

      "text": "Nov 16, 2016 7:00 AM (Photo: Amazon) Share Tweet \nSyfy is working on a television version of Stranger In A Strange Land , according to Deadline . We should note that the new project is based on Robert Heinlein’s seminal work of science fiction, rather than the rather poorly-received episode of Lost . The book follows Valentine Michael Smith and is famous for introducing the term “grok” —defined as to “understand profoundly and intuitively”—into the lexicon. Curiously, Heinlein’s 1961 novel about a man’s experiences on Earth after growing up on Mars has never previously been adapted. But the forthcoming series already boasts powerhouse producer Scott Rudin among its backers. He’s not the only Heinlein fan, as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman Bonnie Hammer tells Deadline “The story is timeless and resonates more than ever in today’s world. As a fan, I can’t wait to see it come to life as a world-class television event.” There’s no word on when the series will begin production. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "News \nThere are multiple layers to Amazon's Prime subscription model, from full access to video to just Kindle. All of these pricing tiers offer a lot of choice on how you get your media from Amazon's ecosystem, which is pretty great. Music Unlimited was added to this list a month ago, offering what Prime Music did already, but with a whole lot more content. An additional family plan was available to those interested, allowing up to six people to access the vast selection of music. Well, now that new plan is available in the US. \nIt comes in at $14.99/month for both Prime and non-Prime customers, or $149/year for the former. New users of the music service will get a 30-day trial. This makes it the fourth Tier, joining Prime, non-Prime, and single Echo pricing. So if you're a Music Unlimited subscriber, this is neat and in league with Google Play Music's family plan (same price, too). Below is further information for those interested. Press Release \nWe are excited to share that the Amazon Music Unlimited Family subscription plan , allowing up to six family members access to Amazon Music Unlimited for only $14.99/month for both Prime and non-Prime customers or $149/year for Prime members, is now available in the U.S . All family members can stream as much music as they want, anytime, anywhere and at the same time. Additionally, each account member gets personalized recommendations from tens of millions of songs, and thousands of playlists and stations available on Music Unlimited. \nWith this news, customers can now choose from four Amazon Music Unlimited subscription options and begin their free 30-day-trial today: \no $7.99/month, $79/year for Prime members \no $9.99/month for non-Prime customers \no $3.99/month on a single Echo, Echo Dot or Amazon Tap \no *NOW AVAILABLE* $14.99/month for Prime and non-Prime customers or $149/year Family plan for Prime members \nAmazon Music Unlimited launched just over a month ago in the U.S. ( October 12 ), and is an on-demand, full catalog streaming service with tens of millions of songs and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalized stations available on all Amazon Music compatible devices including Amazon Echo, Fire devices, iPads, iPhones, Android devices, Sonos players and more. \nAmazon Music Unlimited is the only destination to stream music from the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history and recent CMA Entertainer of the Year award-winner, Garth Brooks—customers can listen to Garth’s Diamond-selling album, The Ultimate Hits and the two-time Diamond-selling album, Double Live now, with more music from Garth coming later this year. Additionally, listeners can find a range of rock, country, pop, hip hop and more within the catalog and in thousands of hand-curated playlists including Brand New Music , which is updated every Friday with new releases and Introducing , which features songs only from emerging artists, among others as well as in thousands of personalized stations. \nAmazon Music Unlimited also boasts innovative voice controls through Alexa that make the listening experience more conversational and personalized than ever before—no searching or browsing required. Listeners can just ask Alexa to find a song by lyrics, create a playlist based on mood or genre, and more: \no Can’t remember the name of a song from Garth, but know the lyrics? Just ask, “Alexa, play the song that goes ‘I’m not big on social graces” and Alexa will play “Friends in Low Places” \no Want to be surprised? Just ask, “Alexa, play the Song of the Day” to hear a song picked daily by Amazon Music editors. Song of the Day also features a DJ intro with fun facts about the song and an outro with suggestions for further listening \no Looking for music that’s appropriate for your kids? “Alexa, play fun children’s music” and she will choose age appropriate songs for the whole family to enjoy. \no Curious about the kind of music Alexa herself is into?

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 16th, 2016 \nWhile most flagship phones are doing away with the microSD card reader, for people who loves to carry around their books, movies, and music they’re indispensable. Amazon is offering a great deal on Samsung EVO microSD cards for today only, should you find yourself in need of expandable storage. \nDon’t forget with the holiday season coming up, these make great accessory gifts to give alongside a phone or tablet. I personally use Samsung EVO cards in all of my devices and I’ve never had a problem with them, which is something I can’t say for other popular brands like SanDisk.",

      "title": "Amazon Will Drop the Price of Prime for One Day Only",
      "text": "If you’ve been thinking about signing up for Amazon’s popular Prime service, Friday might be your chance to strike.\nOn Friday, Amazon will offer a 20% discount for Prime, cutting the price from $99 a year to $79 for new members, Business Insider reported . The sale will last just a little longer than 24 hours, from 12 a.m. ET to 11:59 p.m. PT.\nPrime members receive a number of perks, including free two-day shipping, photo storage through Prime Photos, and access to Prime Music’s library of more than two million songs. Your Prime subscription will also give you access to Prime Video, which features thousands of movies and TV shows, including original Amazon series like Transparent , Mozart in the Jungle , and Good Girls Revolt. \nPrime has been a big win for Amazon : At the end of 2015, subscriptions of the service had spiked by 43% from the previous year, and studies have shown that Prime members’ annual spending on Amazon more than doubles that of customers who don’t belong to the service. Even better news for the online retailer: A report published this spring found that 70% of American households earning more than $112,000 are Prime subscribers — meaning that the company has carved out a sizable niche among customers with disposable income.\n",

      "text": "The Great Plains lost 3,686,960 acres that year; in contrast, the Brazilian Amazon lost 1.4 million, as the World Wildlife Fund points out .\nThe WWF calculates that an area the size of Kansas has been converted to row crops since 2009. That puts monarch butterflies — along with many other species of birds, plants, and insects — at risk.\n“America’s Great Plains are being plowed under at an alarming rate,” said WWF’s Martha Kauffman in a statement. “Centuries old, critical prairie habitat that’s home to amazing wildlife and strong ranching and tribal communities is rapidly being converted to cropland and most people don’t even realize it.”\nUltimately, there are just two ways to stop conversion of land to agriculture: Reduce demand (i.e. eat less meat , use less biofuel), or grow more food in less space. More here .\nThis story was originally published by Grist with the headline We plowed up more wild habitat in the Great Plains than in the Brazilian Amazon in 2014. on Nov 16, 2016.",

Auto Show USA TODAY 12:26 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 The Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet will make its debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show this week. (Photo: Daimler AG - Global Communication/Mercedes) The Los Angeles Auto Show wowed us with stunning new vehicles that don't mess around. Take a look at what we've seen this week. Honda amps up the power in the new Civic Si \nWhen it comes to performance, the Honda Civic Si introduced this week ahead of the auto show finds itself somewhere in a middle zone. It's hotter than a standard Civic, but not as hot, or as pricey, as the new Type R. Arriving next spring as either a coupe or sedan, the new Si will have more horsepower than the standard Civic using the same engine — a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder powerplant.",

      "text": "A car \"crashed\" into the ground at a promotional event for the new show in Berlin.\nPhoto by Getty Images The old \"Top Gear\" team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May reunite this Friday to the delight of gearheads everywhere in a new auto-focused series from Amazon called \"The Grand Tour.\" To celebrate the occasion, Amazon's introducing a new skill for Alexa and offering its Prime service at a discount.\nAmazon Prime normally costs $100 a year. Starting at 12 a.m. ET Friday, you'll be able to sign up for a year of Prime for $80 if you're a first-time user. (In the UK that's a discount from £79 to £59.) The promotion lasts all day Friday until 11:59 p.m. PT. Prime gives you access to lots of streaming video content, as well as music and free shipping.\nAlexa, the automated assistant built into popular devices like the Amazon Echo , is excited about \"The Grand Tour\" too. When you enable the Alexa skill via the app, your Echo will provide teasers on Thursdays before the weekly \"Grand Tour\" episode and offer a chance to play trivia about the episode on Saturdays. You can win a gift card if you play, and unlock extra video content if you get the questions right. \nEven if you're not a car person, the $20 discount makes this as good of a time as any to jump into Prime if you haven't already -- though I'm bummed the discount doesn't apply to current customers.",

      "text": "Amazon Music Unlimited Launches $14.99 Per Month Family Plan for up to 6 Users Posted by Evan Selleck   \nLast month, Amazon officially launched Music Unlimited to take on the likes of Apple, Spotify, and other established music streaming services. \nIt recently expanded into the European Union, and now Amazon is back with another key feature for paid subscribers: A family plan. Amazon has officially rolled out support for a brand new family plan for its Unlimited Music service, which supports up to six individual users. It costs $14.99 per month, or $149 per year. \nThe family plan is available for both Prime subscribers, and to those who haven’t subscribed to that particular service. It’s worth noting, though, that for Prime members the Music Unlimited pricing drops down to $7.99 per month, or $79 per year. \nAmazon also recently rolled out its Unlimited Music service to the Echo speakers , for only $4 per month, for those that simply want a service that can stream through Amazon’s smart speakers.",

      "text": "Amazon’s long-awaited Top Gear ‘spin-off,’ The Grand Tour, debuts on November 18, and Amazon is knocking $20 off its annual Prime membership for a 24-hour period to encourage folks to sign up.\nAdditionally, Amazon is also launching a new Alexa skill specifically for The Grand Tour, meaning those with an Echo or other Alexa-enabled device can unlock exclusive video content when prompted by the voices of Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond.\nTo recap, Top Gear is a long-running TV show from U.K. broadcaster the BBC, and the series rose to international acclaim off the back of the zany, offbeat styles of Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond. However, the show came to a halt in early 2015 after Clarkson was accused of hitting a producer on the show — Clarkson was subsequently fired, and his two amigos walked away. While Top Gear continues with a bunch of new presenters, Amazon managed to sign-up the aforementioned presenters and apparently beat some big-name competitors, including Netflix, to the punch. It’s thought that The Grand Tour is one of Amazon’s biggest original programming investments, reportedly costing around $250 million , and it’s now being used as leverage to encourage people to sign-up to Amazon Prime — it’s the only way you’ll be able to watch the show for now.\nAmazon has offered short-term discounts on its Prime membership in the past, but it’s telling that it has chosen to do so again ahead of The Grand Tour, an investment some have called a major gamble .\nAt any rate, from November 18 at 00:00 (ET) all the way through to 23:59 that same day, you’ll be able to sign up to Amazon Prime for $79. And every Thursday thereafter, those with Alexa-enabled devices can receive a clue about something to watch out for in the upcoming new episode, with questions asked through Alexa the day after each episode airs. If viewers answer the questions correctly, they may gain access to additional video clips.\n",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nMorrison's signs delivery deal with Amazon\nEuropean stocks were clinging to a small gain Wednesday, with some help from the telecom sector, but losses within the chemical and energy sectors kept overall gains for the market in check.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.1% at 339.358, as technology, telecom and utility shares advanced. But basic materials, consumer goods and industrial shares struggled. The benchmark on Tuesday rose 0.3%, aided by gains for oil and gas stocks.\nOil and gas shares on Wednesday started to sag as oil prices pushed lower.\nMovers and shakers: The basic materials sector was lower, with shares of Bayer AG (BAYN.XE) down 5% after the German pharmaceutical and chemicals heavyweight placed 4 billion euros (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bayer-shares-skid-after-monsanto-deal-move-2016-11-16) ($4.28 billion) in convertible bonds as a way to pay for its purchase of Monsanto Co. (MON) .\nIn the telecoms group, shares of Bouygues SA (EN.FR) tacked on 3.6% after the French conglomerate posted better-than-expected net profit (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bouygues-profit-beats-views-on-telecom-unit-boost-2016-11-16) for the first nine months of the year, lifted by the telecom unit it tried to sell earlier in 2016.\nIliad SA (ILD.FR) shares rose 2.2% after the French telecommunications company posted a 6.5% rise in third-quarter revenue. The company has signed up hundreds of thousands of new mobile service subscribers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/iliad-revenue-rises-on-increase-in-subscribers-2016-11-16) as it carries out an aggressive price war with rivals.\nFrom the retail front, shares of Ocado PLC (OCDO.LN) dropped 5%. On Wednesday, Wm. Morrison Supermarkets PLC (MRW.LN) said it has formed a rpartnership with Amazon.com Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/morrisons-taps-amazon-for-1-hour-deliveries-2016-11-16). (AMZN) to offer one-hour deliveries from its stores in London and Hertfordshire, U.K. Morrison shares, however, were up 0.5%.\nABN Amro Group NV (ABN.AE) shares fell 2.4% after the Dutch bank said it's shedding another 1,500 jobs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abn-amro-to-cut-1500-more-jobs-net-profit-rises-2016-11-16) in the coming years as it accelerates its restructuring efforts.\nIndexes: In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 fell 0.3% to 10,702.72. France's CAC 40 index lost 0.3% to 4,523.52.\nItaly's FTSE MIB picked up 0.3% at 16,739.54. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gave up 0.2% at 6,777.35.\nThe euro was trading at $1.0723 compared with $1.0731 late Tuesday.\n 16, 2016 05:07 ET (10:07 ",

Post to Facebook Amazon offers one day, $20 off sale on Prime Just in time for the holidays.  //usat.ly/2fxt1T6   Join the Nation's Conversation   Amazon offers one day, $20 off sale on Prime Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 12:56 p.m.   Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos. (Photo: 2012 photo by Joe Klamar, AFP/Getty Images) \nAmazon Prime has long been considered one of the better deals in tech, and on Friday it'll get even better. \nTo celebrate the launch of its new Prime-only TV show, The Grand Tour, Amazon will be cutting the price of Prime membership from $99 for a year to $79 on Friday, November 18. \nThe one day sale will run from 12:00 a.m. ET until 11:59 p.m. PT and is only available for new members. \nRegardless of whether you are interested in the adventure show, the $20 discount on Prime membership is worth noting, particularly with the holiday shopping season already upon us. \nFor $99 per year, subscribers get free two-day shipping, access to TV shows and movies on Prime Video, music streaming through Prime Music and the ability to read books and magazines through Prime Reading. \nFor holiday shoppers, Prime is even more valuable as Amazon gives Prime members a 30-minute headstart on it's Black Friday \"Lightning Deals.\" \nThe announcement of the Prime sale comes as Amazon prepares for a major rush of holiday shoppers. On Wednesday morning, the company unveiled the first of its Black Friday deals including a slew of big discounts on TVs. \nAttracting Prime members is a crucial part of Amazon's retail strategy. While the online retail giant does not disclose how many Prime members it has, Chicago-based Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that at the end of the September 2016 quarter there were 65 million U.S. members. \nThe firm estimates that 52% of Amazon U.S. customers are Prime members.",

New episodes will be released weekly for 12 weeks. \nIn a video posted on the show’s YouTube channel and Facebook page Wednesday, the hosts revealed that in December, the show would also be made available in 200 countries around the world, exclusively on Amazon. Fans will be able to catch up on all episodes aired to date, and new episodes will be released weekly, every Friday, worldwide. \nAs a stunt to help promote the new show, crashed Toyota Prius hybrid cars — a vehicle hated by the show’s hosts — with a “The Grand Tour” logo on their sides were positioned in various cities, including London, Paris and Berlin this week.

      "text": "Morrisons expands Amazon deal offering delivery in an hour Shares in Ocado plunge nearly 10% after announcement of new service for Prime Now members \nMorrisons has extended its relationship with Amazon, enabling customers to order their weekly grocery shop for delivery within an hour in London and Hertfordshire. \nThe announcement of the new service for Amazon’s Prime Now members sent shares in Ocado, the online grocery specialist which supports Morrisons’ website, down by 8.5% at the end of the day. \nMorrisons began supplying goods from its central warehouse to Amazon in June and already offers thousands of products via the US company’s Fresh grocery delivery service, which currently only operates in London. \nUnder the Prime Now service, which will be called Morrisons at Amazon, orders will be picked at a local Morrisons store by the supermarket’s staff then collected and delivered by Amazon either within one hour for £6.99 or in a two-hour slot for free in selected areas of London and Hertfordshire. \nMariangela Marseglia, the director of Prime Now EU, said the deal would add 10,000 items to its ultra-fast delivery service. \nRelated: Amazon and Morrisons tie-up: a customer's guide \nDavid Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: “As foodmaker and shopkeeper, we have unique skills to help build a broader new Morrisons through capital-light growth. Morrisons at Amazon is another exciting joint opportunity and makes Morrisons’ good quality, great value-for-money products available to even more customers.” \nHe said the Amazon deal would contribute towards Morrisons’ target of generating £50m to £100m in additional profits from online, wholesaling, manufacturing and services. \nMorrisons shares closed down 1.5% on Wednesday, but improved trading since the arrival of Potts in March last year and canny wholesale deals with Amazon and petrol forecourts operator Motor Fuel Group have helped drive a 50% rise in the supermarket’s share price this year. \nEarlier this month, the Bradford-based chain reported a 1.6% rise in sales, excluding fuel, at established stores for the 13 weeks to 30 October – well ahead of bigger rivals Sainsbury’s and Asda. \nOcado has handled the distribution network and IT behind Morrison’s website since it launched in 2014 . It delivers in north London and most of the rest of England but not East Anglia, the north-east or Scotland. \nThis year the two companies agreed to jointly develop a new distribution centre in Erith, south London, and a new IT system to allow the supermarket to serve online shoppers from its stores . Both arrangements are intended to help Morrisons extend its delivery network as it tries to tap into the fast growing online market as shoppers switch away from traditional supermarkets. But the new Ocado warehouse will not open until 2018 and the store-picking system will not start being tested until next year. \nThe agreement with Amazon gives Morrisons a headstart on delivering groceries from its stores, potentially boosting sales. \nWhile only available in limited locations initially, Amazon has a history of rolling out successful services relatively quickly. Prime Now launched in London in June 2015 and is now available Surrey, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Portsmouth, South Yorkshire and Glasgow as well as parts of London and Hertfordshire. \nBruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “It’s unclear at this stage what the deal means for the prospect of in-store picking with Ocado, but it will certainly give Morrisons much better negotiation power in the discussions. It should also improve the bargaining position for any other retailer looking to sign a deal with Ocado.” \nOcado said it was making good progress with developing its new distribution centre in Erith and store pick model for Morrisons. “Although we are not aware of the details, we have been assured by Morrisons that they acknowledge and respect the exclusivity provisions in our agreement, which oblige Morrisons to operate their online grocery business only through the Ocado arrangements,” a spokesperson for Ocado said. \nClive Black, at Morrisons’ broker Shore Capital, said: “We believe this announcement suggests that Morrisons’ initial experiences with Amazon (and vice versa) have been encouraging, whilst the store-based retailer’s broader ambitions and capabilities online appear to be extending … If successful, it could also catapult Morrison’s access to the convenience market where it has no physical presence.” \nHowever, Monteyne said Morrisons would only be supplying Amazon via an extension of its wholesale agreement so the US company would be able to set prices. “Without being able to control pricing this puts a material risk on the Morrisons brand and the risk of Amazon undercutting Morrisons’ offer,” he said.",

      "text": "By Timi Cantisano News Reporter Neowin LLC @timicantisano · 1 minute ago with 1 comment \nAmazon's new motoring show, The Grand Tour, is set to arrive and reintroduce the world to the trio of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May of Top Gear fame. In order to celebrate, the company will offer a discount on its Prime membership starting on November 18. \nFor a limited time, those who sign up for a new Prime membership starting at 12AM ET on November 18 will be able to take advantage of a 20% discount. The membership is traditionally priced at $99, but will be available for $79 until 11:59PM PT of the same day. \nIf unfamiliar, Prime membership grants access to free two-day expedited shipping, Amazon's music and video streaming services and much more. The discount won't be exclusive to the US, as the UK will also have access to this promotional discount where the price of Prime will be reduced from £79 to £59. \nThe Grand Tour will be exclusive series to Amazon which will air a new episode each week over the next 12 weeks. \nSource: Amazon via CNet | image via Amazon Tags",

      "text": "UPDATE 2-Britain's Morrisons extends Amazon deal with same-day service Updated: November 16, 2016 — 7:49 AM EST Share \n* Morrisons, Amazon build on February deal \n* Prime customers in and around London offered same-day delivery \n* Online food sales expanding rapidly in Britain \n* Shares in Morrisons' online partner Ocado fall 5 pct (Adds comment from Ocado, updates shares) \nBy James Davey \nLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has launched a new service offering Amazon customers same-day deliveries of goods from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two firms but hitting shares in online grocer Ocado. \nOcado has its own distribution agreement with Morrisons and its shares fell 5 percent on concerns the extension of the Amazon partnership will mean it faces more competition. \nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service, launched on Wednesday, will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via the Prime Now app. \nIt builds on a deal Morrisons struck with Amazon in February that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. Morrisons said that arrangement had started well and been extended to thousands of products. \nThe new service, which remains part of the wholesale agreement, will see orders from Amazon Prime subscribers picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds or within a two-hour slot for free. \nAs with the existing wholesale deal, Amazon is able to charge its own prices. The new service will launch in selected districts in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. \nIt will run alongside the supermarket chain's existing online retail operation. Products ordered on the Morrisons.com website have been distributed by Ocado from its fulfillment centers around the country since 2014. \nOCADO RESPONDS \nOcado said it was looking into the implications of the latest Morrisons-Amazon agreement. \n\"Although we are not aware of the details, we have been assured by Morrisons that they acknowledge and respect the exclusivity provisions in our agreement, which oblige Morrisons to operate their online grocery business only through the Ocado arrangements,\" said a spokeswoman for Ocado. \nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" presented by former Top Gear front man Jeremy Clarkson. \nShares in Morrisons, up 50 percent this year as a turnaround under new boss David Potts gains pace, were little changed. \nMorrisons is the smallest of Britain's \"big four\" supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. \nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD. \nMorrisons said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted. \n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialing,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a \"market perform\" rating on Morrisons. \nMorrisons renegotiated its deal with Ocado in August to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrisons has said it will commence that service next year.

This week marks the 20th anniversary of the first online sale. Since that sale - a copy of an album by the artist Sting - online retailing has grown to such an extent that it is now claimed that 95 percent of the UK population has shopped online and close to one in four deciding to shop online each week. (Photo Illustration by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Matt Cardy Previous Next \nNeed a little extra money for your holiday shopping? Amazon is willing to give you instant credit for items that you either don't want or need anymore! \nThe Amazon Trade-In program has been around for awhile, but it no longer requires shoppers to wait 10 days to receive credit for the items they want to trade in. This is awesome news for those looking for some fast money. Amazon accepts trade-ins on phones, video games and consoles, books, DVDs, cameras, CDs, wearables (like watches) and other electronics. Of course, the newer an item is, the higher the trade-in value. How much money can I get for an Amazon Trade-In? \nIt depends on the item and its condition. A quick look at the trade-in site shows the following values: Apple Watch Sport, Space Grey: up to $54.17 How does the Amazon Trade-In Program Work? \nIn literally just a few clicks, you could have some Amazon credit waiting for you thanks to the easy trade-in process. Here's a brief overview of how it works: \n1. Find items eligible for trade-in. 2. Visit the Amazon Trade-In Program webpage and find out the value of your item. \n3. Amazon will then walk you through a series of questions about the item's condition, function and financing (do you own the item or are you still making payments). Be honest about this, because you will need to send the item to Amazon—don't worry they provide a printable free shipping label on the website. \n4. Amazon will give you an instant trade-in value to accept, and you will be asked to decide what to do if Amazon decides your item is of lesser quality than you had specified (they will return it for free or you can accept the lower price). \nWhat happens once you accept the trade-in offer? Poof! Your Amazon account gets credited immediately with the company's offer, and you can shop right away! You send the item to Amazon with the pre-paid shipping label and the deal is done. \nYou must have a credit card on file with Amazon, just in case your item comes in at a lower trade-in value upon inspection or is rejected. If either of those things happen, Amazon will charge your card either the difference in value for the item or return the item and charge you the full trade-in value. Amazon provides a full description on their item acceptance and rejection policies to review before you complete a trade-in.  ",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nMorrison's signs delivery deal with Amazon\nEuropean stocks were clinging to a small gain Wednesday, with some help from the telecom sector, but losses within the chemical and energy sectors kept overall gains for the market in check.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.1% at 339.358, as technology, telecom and utility shares advanced.

      "text": "It seems that any company can just up and start a streaming music service with a lot of deal-making and the right licenses . But turning all that around to consumers takes a little more trouble when your businesses are a little more diversified.\nAmazon Music Unlimited has been around for a short while and it has been able to layer plan offerings down from the individual level (at $7.99 per month or $79 a year) to its own smart speaker devices such has the Echo, Echo Dot or Tap ($3.99 per month).\nOf course, the gaping omission here is the family plan, something that Spotify and Apple Music have. And Amazon Music Unlimited now has it, at least in the US, for $14.99 per month for all or $149 per year (two months free) for Prime users. Up to six family members can be on a single account.\nAmazon is introducing the plan with a 30-day free trial, accessible at the source link.\nThe post Amazon Music Unlimited for families has annual option for $150 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Amazon strikes India streaming deal with T-Series for Bollywood remake of Jon Favreau’s ‘Chef’ Amazon strikes India streaming deal with T-Series for Bollywood remake of Jon Favreau’s ‘Chef’ Amazon has inked a licensing deal with Bollywood banner T-Series for its upcoming films, which include the Bollywood remake of Jon Favreau's Chef. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 16, 2016 3:09 AM “For the first time in three years, Amazon has been declared as the most attractive Internet brand (96th rank overall)…,” said the study carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA). (Reuters) \nAmazon has inked a licensing deal with Bollywood banner T-Series for its upcoming films, which include the Bollywood remake of Jon Favreau’s Chef. \nThis is the second such deal with a major Indian banner announced in recent days by the streaming giant as it builds up its local content library ahead of the launch of its Prime Video service in India. It previously reached an agreement with Bollywood producer Dharma Productions for some of its catalog and upcoming titles.While Amazon and T-Series did not detail financial terms or specify if the deal covered countries outside of India, they said that the “long-term content licensing partnership will make Prime Video India the exclusive subscription streaming home” for the company’s new releases. The films will stream on Prime Video before their television premiere in the country, “all within a few weeks of their theatrical release,” added Amazon Video India director and country head Nitesh Kripalani.The company’s 17 titles under production include romantic drama sequels Tum Bin 2 and Yaarian 2 in addition to Raabta, Simran, Noor and Hindi Medium, which stars Irrfan Khan (Inferno). As reported earlier, the Bollywood remake of Chef stars Saif Ali Khan and is directed by Raja Krishna Menon. The project is backed by Abundantia Entertainment, Eros International and Alumbra Entertainment. After the project was first announced last October, T-Series boarded the project as a co-producer.While Amazon has not confirmed a launch date for its Prime Video service, a report by the Economic Times on Wednesday suggested it may bow around the Diwali festival, which is on Oct. 30. The report also suggested that Amazon is in the process of securing more content deals with other leading banners, such as the iconic Yash Raj Films, veteran producer Mukesh Bhatt’s Vishesh Films and Bollywood star Salman Khan ’s banner.

      "title": "America’s Great Plains Lost More Habitat in 2014 than the Brazilian Amazon: WWF Report",
      "text": "In 2014 the Great Plains lost more acres of grasslands than the Brazilian Amazon lost to deforestation, according to a new report from World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Fifty three million acres of America’s Great Plains have been lost each year since, threatening important and iconic species like grasslands songbirds, the monarch butterfly, and native bumble bees.\n“America’s Great Plains are being plowed under at an alarming rate,” said Martha Kauffman, WWF’s managing director of the Northern Great Plains program. “Centuries old, critical prairie habitat that’s home to amazing wildlife and strong ranching and tribal communities is rapidly being converted to cropland and most people don’t even realize it.”\nThe staggering rate of conversion also jeopardizes the ecological services the Great Plains provide, like filtering trillions of gallons of water, recharging our groundwater supplies and storing climate-changing carbon dioxide. According to the report, 3.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions were released into the atmosphere due to plowing of grasslands between 2009 and 2015— the equivalent of 670 million extra cars on the road.\nThe 2016 Plowprint Report is the first-of-its-kind annual analysis tracking losses of the grasslands forming the ecological foundation of America’s Great Plains. In 2015 alone, 3.7 million acres of the Great Plains were converted to cropland.\nGrassland loss is also contributing to declines of pollinators like bees and monarch butterflies. In fact, the report cites that one of every four species of North American bumble bee is at risk of extinction, with some species declining as much as 87 percent in the past 15 years alone.\nGrassland birds are also disappearing as a result of dramatic habitat loss. Four key species—McCown’s Longspur, Chestnut-collared Longspur, Lark Bunting, and Sprague’s Pipit— have declined as much as 80 percent since the 1960s.\n“With a growing population, the demands on the planet to produce food are increasing substantially. Meeting those demands will require a host of solutions like climate smart agriculture, the reduction of food waste, and improved technology. But the answer isn’t and can’t just be to plow up more land,” added Kauffman. “Today we’re growing crops on the richest agricultural lands and have been for decades. A high percentage of what we’re plowing up now are poor soils in landscapes that regularly experience drought. So we’re losing these valuable grasslands and the unique ecological services they provide, while getting little in return.”\nKauffman states that part of the solution could be more grassland friendly provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill. WWF calls for expanding conservation-smart programs like Sodsaver and improving the way we manage crop insurance. WWF is also working with ranchers and other stakeholders in the region to co-develop programs that maximize the economic value of intact grasslands.\n##\n",
