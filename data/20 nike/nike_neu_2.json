By Brandon Richard \nThe future of the Nike KD 9 includes this stealthy new make-up expected to land at stores in the coming months. \nObsidian and black share the upper on this pair, which is flanked by iridescent purple Swoosh branding. A lighter shade of blue lines the interior and fills the rear KD logo, while teal adds a little pop along the Zoom cushioning unit. The shoe rides atop a blue-tinted translucent outsole. \nTake a closer look at this upcoming drop and keep it locked for a confirmed release date . \nNike KD 9",

      "text": "Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Update: Self-lacing sneakers' release Dec.1; Price reduced to $720 [How to Order] By Harsh Soni Nov 20, 2016 10:30 AM EST Advertisement \nPhoto: Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 \nThe news about Nike's self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes expecting to come with a gigantic $1000 price tag now has turned out to be false. The fresh and confirmed news from Nike says that the Nike shoes will get released in December 1 with a price tag of $720. Advertisement \nThe renowned YouTuber and sneaker enthusiast Jacques Slade confirmed and announced the $720 price and Dec. 1 release date for the most popular HyperAdapt 1.0 by spreading the word via Twitter. \nTo put two and two together, it's pretty much a reliable deal that the self-lacing sneakers will come right on proposed time before the holidays kick in full gear and the good news is it is going to be slightly cheaper than previously reported. \nThe highly innovative Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 was initially unveiled in March and it is the first to feature Nike's new self-lacing technology. In this the wearer will hit the sensor with their heel and then the sneakers' laces will tighten up automatically. \nThe high end shoes with have two buttons on the side that will help the wearer loosen or tighten their fit. So, comfort won't be an issue at all. \nFor those looking to grab the HyperAdapt 1.0, the sneakers will be powered by lithium-ion batteries that's touted to last two weeks and the shoes will have LEDs on the heel and sole to display battery life. \nThe blue means the battery is still going strong and the yellow is an indication that it is no draining and the red light is a sign that it needs to be recharged as soon as possible, reports TechTimes . \nNike $720 HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available to Nike+ members in Black, White and Blue Lagoon colours at the Nike Soho store and Nike Clubhouse in New York City starting December 1. Also a small number of Nike+ members will get to check the shoes on November 28. Those lucky customers will be informed about the opportunity through the Nike+ app's \"Reserved for you\" system. \nIf you are interested to know more about booking appointments and making a purchase you can check Nike.com or the Nike+ app. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "title": "Should You Buy Nike Inc (NKE) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons",
      "text": "View All Posts \nShares of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) just haven’t done it in 2016. Nike stock has dropped from $62 at the start of the year to just $51 now. Nike stock sits near new 52-week lows. And short-selling interest has spiked, with short positions up 150% recently against NKE stock. Source: Kristian Olsen Via Unsplash \nThe company’s woes are apparent. Margins are dropping. Stephen Curry’s success has hit the basketball franchise. And the company simply hasn’t grown fast enough to back up its formerly premium valuation. But with Nike stock down 17% this year, it looks more interesting. Has NKE stock fallen far enough to justify a purchase now? \nWith that as a backdrop, here are three pros and three cons to Nike stock. Nike Stock Pros \nDominant Player : For all the talk of competition this year, NKE still rules its industry. The company controls 23% of the global athletic footwear market as of 2015. No other player even topped 10%. Adidas AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: ADDYY ) comes in second place, but with only 9% of the market. Nike’s size allows it great economies of scale. It has the best athlete endorsements, the most sporting teams partnerships and ideal placement at the Olympics. \nEven with 2016’s road bumps, NKE is targeting $50 billion in revenues by the year 2020. The company is currently on a $33 billion run-rate, suggesting that the company sees the potential for 50% top-line growth over the next four years. That’s tremendous. The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now \nBig Dividend Hike : Few people buy Nike stock for its dividend. Even with the company’s newly announced 12% dividend hike, NKE stock still yields a pedestrian 1.4%. However, we should look past the present yield. \nOver the last five years, Nike has grown its dividend at a 16% annualized rate. Anyone who bought Nike stock five years ago is now receiving a dividend of greater than 2.5% on their purchase price. Like many great growth companies, Nike’s current dividend seems minuscule, but for long-term stock owners, it will build up quickly. Additionally, the company currently operates at just a 22% dividend payout ratio. This means that it has plenty of room within its earnings to keep growing the dividend at double-digit rates. \nDiscounted Valuation : Nike’s price-to-earnings ratio is down to 23 now. This is the lowest it has consistently traded at since 2013. This now leaves NKE as cheap or cheaper on an earnings basis than its immediate competition. Adidas trades at 28x earnings. Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA ) is at nearly 70x earnings. And Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport (OTCMKTS: PMMAF ) trades around 55x. \nIn recent quarters, Nike stock has generally traded above 25x earnings; it now sits at a discount to both its own history and its competitors. \nThis gap comes since many of NKE’s competitors have had a strong 2016. Under Armour made a huge move snapping up Curry and other young talents out from under Nike’s nose. And Adidas is scoring with trendier styles that are making in-roads with the teen consumer segment. However, NKE’s longer-term dominance is unquestioned, and at a discounted valuation, it looks like a good fit compared to its competitors. Nike Stock Cons \nBasketball Franchise Under Fire : Nike has long ruled the basketball shoe market. It has been many years now since Michael Jordan retired. But that hasn’t dimmed his marketing power. Jordan shoes remain the dominant brand, and NKE stock holders have cashed in. \nBut that hegemony is now challenged. Under Armour grew shoe revenues as much as 58% year-over-year earlier this year, powered by Curry’s dominant performance. Steph Curry appears likely to be at or near the top spot for shoe sales by active NBA players going forward. On the plus side for Nike, Curry’s latest shoe, the Low Chef, appears to be underperforming. \nUnder Armour stock has sold back off, as Curry sales have slowed down. But regardless of what happens with Curry, Nike needs to make sure it doesn’t miss signing more game changing stars in the future. \nMargins Down : The competition has hit Nike in one important area: profit margins. Its Q3 2016 operating margin fell to 45.5%, down 2 full percentage points from last year’s same-quarter figure. The company is struggling not just with its industry opponents. It also has to overcome an ever-strengthening U.S. Dollar. In recent years, NKE has relied on international sales for an increasing portion of its growth agenda. That has come under fire as the U.S. dollar surges, hurting the company’s competitive position and also devaluing the revenues earned in foreign currencies.",

Its futuristic, Air Max 90-inspired good looks have charmed the likes of Tinie Tempah , the creatives of London , and the future sport stars of Paris . It’s being touted as one of the Swoosh’s best in a while, and therefore we’re about to see a whole heap of new colorways — starting with this “Triple Black” ninja number.\nThe shoe features an all-black-everything color scheme, while maintaining all the design elements of the previous release. That means it keeps the Air Flow-inspired neoprene construction, the eyestays of the Air Max 90, the Presto-like bootie, Air Current detailing, and a Lunarlon sole unit.\nThe Nike LunarCharge “Triple Black” is set for release on December 9 over at Nike.com .\nWhile we wait, see two London voices paint an abstract portrait of fast urban living while sporting the new LunarCharge below.\n\nIn other sneaker news, adidas has introduced its new Tubular Shadow .\n",

The the second Anti-Clog pack brings the revolutionary traction system to the brand-new Nike Dark Lightning boots after the first 2016-2017 Nike Anti-Clog Traction cleats collection brought Nike's Anti-Clog traction system to the Hypervenom, Magista and Tiempo Spark Brilliance boots. Nike 2016-2017 Anti-Clog Dark Lightning Boot Collection Here are the three boots available as Anti-Clog version. Boasting the design of the Nike Dark Lightning cleat collection , the second Nike 16-17 Hypervenom, Magista and Tiempo Anti-Clog boots are made to prevent mud from clogging the plate of football boots by featuring a special outsole and studs. However, there is unfortunately again no Anti-Clog edition of the Nike Mercurial Superfly 5. The Nike 2016-17 Anti-Clog Dark Lightning pack boots retail at a significantly higher price than the regular FG versions of the black collection.

      "title": "Nike’s exit from the golf equipment business: How will it impact the college game?",
      "text": "E-mail \nBack in early August, Nike threw the golfing world for a loop by announcing its exit from the golf equipment business. After years of disappointing sales and growth, the company revealed that it will “transition out of equipment — including clubs, balls, and bags.” \nOnce the news broke, a wave of questions arose as many in the industry were left with uncertain futures. Much of the initial focus converged on the company’s existing professional endorsement contracts. Nike’s PGA Tour players, ranging from up-and-comers like Patrick Rodgers and Abraham Ancer to big name stars like Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, now had to carefully consider their next step. \nThe decision not only affected the professional ranks, but anyone associated with Nike Golf. Retailers, distributors, employees, sales representatives and teaching professionals all were left searching for answers. Nike’s sports marketing reach also extends to collegiate athletics; as such, the sponsorships of many college golf programs was suddenly up in the air. \nOver the years, Nike has supported a large contingent of college golf’s top programs, and by extension many elite collegiate players. This past season, Nike schools took top honors in both the men’s and women’s NCAA golf championships with the respective victories of Oregon and Washington. Further, the Nike Collegiate Invitational, held at historic Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth back in October, brought together a strong field (10 of the top-20 ranked men’s teams) in a Nike-only affair. \nMeanwhile, coaches at these schools have spent much of the fall season formulating a post-fallout strategy. If they haven’t already, these programs must now switch sponsors and begin the process of implementing significant changes in their equipment. \nAs with the tour players, many of whom were “shocked” by the news, Nike’s decision caught everybody in the college ranks off guard. Casey Martin, the men’s golf head coach at Oregon, noted that he was “definitely surprised,” a sentiment shared by his colleague at Stanford, Conrad Ray. This reaction included the players as well. Maverick McNealy, the current No. 1 ranked amateur in the world and a senior on the Stanford team, got the news from his brother and “thought he was playing some sort of joke.” The lack of advanced notice, however, can be explained by Nike’s status as a publicly traded company. Thus, they were required to withhold any classified information related to the company as a going concern. Maverick McNealy, a senior at Stanford, is the No. 1-ranked amateur golfer in the world. \nWhile Nike’s departure from the equipment business has been swift, it was also predictable to a certain degree. “Looking back, I could see a few signs,” Martin said. For the last two years, annual sales in golf (including footwear and apparel) were either flat or down. Nike also held only a fraction of the market share in club sales. In addition, a few days before making the big announcement, the company dropped prices substantially on its 2016 line of clubs. Coach Ray said the decision “makes sense when learning about the economics and business side.” Still, for those impacted by the decision, there remains a trace of disappointment. \n“I was really excited about how good the equipment was getting,” McNealy said. “I had just put the last few pieces (of equipment) in play.” \nRay was also impressed with the newer line of products, saying Nike was “making good headway with R&D.” But with Nike’s departure and the fall season winding down, the next few months will serve as a great opportunity for players to begin switching equipment. \nMcNealy, who played Nike equipment exclusively beforehand, said that the only thing he’s switched back was his golf ball, “because to me everything should be fitted around the golf ball that I play.” He also revealed plans to use this upcoming offseason to continue implementing equipment changes. Coach Martin recognized that there will definitely be an adjustment period for his players, but agreed that “now is a great time to adjust.” He believes most of the challenges will come with getting the proper fit for the driver. \nOregon recently signed with Parsons Xtreme Golf (PXG), an up-and-coming equipment manufacturer. Martin mentioned that a few of his players already put some of PXG’s clubs into play when they competed at the East Lake Cup in Atlanta. In the search for a new sponsor, Martin said he was “looking for a quality product that would serve the guys.” He said he feels fortunate to have built a relationship with PXG, which is one of many equipment companies that stand to benefit greatly from Nike’s departure. Indeed, Bob Philion, president and CEO of Cobra Puma Golf, humorously said that his company is “poised to pounce” on the newfound opportunities. \nOn the other hand, the Stanford men’s golf program will align with Callaway, another likely beneficiary of the shake-up in the industry. Ray said that the decision was “based on service and support for the program” and identified Callaway’s proven track record and its full product line as key factors. \nWhile a good number of players are already experimenting with new equipment, Coach Ray emphasized the importance of “being methodical in testing,” as it can be “dangerous to make a full-scale switch.” He advised changing one thing at a time, which is exactly the approach that his star player McNealy is planning to follow. \n“I want to go piece-by-piece instead of a wholesale change,” McNealy said, “so that I can really eliminate variables…and have a comparable testing through the bag.” \nCertainly these next few months will provide some much-needed time for players to hone the different feel of their new equipment. \nDespite dropping its underperforming golf equipment business, Nike vows that it will remain in the golf business. “We’re committed to being the undisputed leader in footwear and apparel” said Trevor Edwards, Nike Brand president. Certainly, this evolved strategy represents a step in the right direction. Ray believes that Nike “needed to re-trench and focus on their apparel and shoe business,” and stressed that the company will “not be pulling back budget-wise.” Indeed, there are indications that Nike will look to expand its athlete roster, as the announcement disclosed plans to “partner with more of the world’s best golfers.” \nBoth Ray and Martin are confident that their programs will maintain a strong relationship with Nike. Martin pointed to the deep ties that Oregon and Nike have developed over the years, and said that he continues to “keep in touch with the reps on a weekly basis.” Both schools will continue to be outfitted in Nike apparel and shoes. \nAs college teams continue to work out their short-term response during this time of change, the lasting impact remains uncertain. The golf equipment industry will continue to evolve and deliver innovative products, and Nike appears to be taking a more practical approach to its investment in golf. \nStill, many ball and club R&D employees have been laid off, and certain Nike Golf facilities, such as The Oven and The Clubhouse, are likely to be shut down. Even among college golf programs, the enduring effects are hard to grasp at this time. Coach Ray suspects that the changes “won’t leave a huge mark” on the Stanford program, but also recognized that it “depends on the perspective you take.” Coach Martin acknowledged that the news came as “a pretty big hit” due to his school’s fondness for Nik e. \nSpeaking in the immediate aftermath of the news release, one Nike staff player told Golf Digest : “I really love their equipment, but I’ll tell you this: In all the pro-ams I’ve played, I’ve never once seen one of my partners using a Nike club.” Ultimately, the real problem for Nike was as simple as that. Now, in the wake of their departure, the golfing world is obliged to fill in the void, for better or for worse. Your Reaction?",

      "text": "Crowds in front of the new Nike store opening in Soho. Photo: Pete Davies \nThis Nike store just doesn’t ‘do it’ for its neighbors. \nSoho residents are fed-up with the hordes of unruly crowds flocking to the 55,000-square-foot superstore that opened in their neighborhood last week. \n“I was sitting in my [home] office with the windows closed when all of a sudden I heard all this crazy screaming,” said Pete Davies, 63, who’s lived in Soho for 35 years. Outside of Nike’s new store in Soho. Photo: Helayne Seidman \n“It looked like a nightclub, not a store. There were big guys like bouncers out front yelling and pushing people,” Davies said of the crowd that formed around 11:30 a.m. on opening day. \nNike’s newest store opened its doors Nov. 18 at Broadway and Spring Street, drawing hundreds of noisy sneaker enthusiasts to an already clogged shopping area. \nThe mob crowded sidewalks and blocked the entrance to a building across the street, a doorman at 532 Broadway said. \nNike had assured neighbors in an email that they had a “crowd control” plan in place, but locals saw no such measures. \n“It was a ridiculous mess. One of the most disruptive events of this type I’ve ever seen,” Davies added. \nLocals are also worried that Nike’s weekly “Swoosh Saturdays” — which include athletic events and celebrity talks — will bring more chaos. \n“The ‘Swoosh’ events are meant to bring large crowds and it’s an enormous concern. They make these plans and don’t care what anyone thinks,” said Susan Wittenberg, 64, a filmmaker and longtime Soho resident. \nThe five-story Nike Soho outlet attracted throngs of footwear fanatics drawn by the store’s exclusive Air Force 1 designs as well as a one-of-a kind digital interactive basketball court. \nSoho residents have resisted the store since Nike began construction two years ago. They believe developers exploited a zoning loophole by calling the project an “alteration” instead of a new building. Photo: Helayne Seidman \nTheir frustration culminated in a protest Nov. 9 at Buildings Department headquarters. \n“We’ve completely lost faith in the Department of Buildings. They’re a fantasy. There is no Department of Buildings,” said Michele Varian, 48, who also owns a boutique in the neighborhood. \nThe M1-5 zoning law says new retailers must not exceed 10,000 square feet. The Nike store was exempted because city officials considered it a building alteration. \n“Stores aren’t supposed to be bigger than that for a reason,” said Varian. \n“The huge increase in crowds has an enormously negative affect on the neighborhood.” \nThe project was reviewed “numerous times” by the DOB, which “determined that it complied with the NYC Construction Codes,” said spokesman Joseph Soldevere. \nResidents fear the historic area is being monopolized by brand names and department stores. \n“The old New York we all love is being trampled on and Soho is on the brink to be the second Times Square,” said Varian.

What you see abovs is the Nike KD 9 Christmas The Sauce to help you get in the holiday spirit. Let’s get our first look at the shoe.\nThe Nike KD 9 Christmas The Sauce is comes in a tonal Deep Burdundy upper done in a Primeknit construction. The same hues can be found on the top portion of the midsole, Nike Swoosh and pull tabs. Attempting to break up the tonal look is the Metallic Red Bronze hits placed throughout. Hits of White on the tongue and heel branding add a nice pop to the shoe. Red lining and the icy outsole complete the look. Releasing on December 15th for $150, is this a holiday must-have for you?\n \nvia: Nike\nAuthor’ Take It’s nice. I like the color used on the upper and I like the fact that it’s not extra-Christmassy, which makes it easier to wear all year long.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post Official Images Of The Nike KD 9 Christmas The Sauce appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "If you liked the special red and black Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10s that were worn yesterday by the Ohio State Buckeyes against Michigan, don’t worry because Nike has you covered.\nSelect retailers have began to release the non-cleat version of the Zoom Soldier 10 which features a black upper with red detailing on the toe, outsole, and the branding. Did you catch the Ohio State vs. Michigan game yesterday? It was definitely a great one to watch if you’re a college football fan.\nYou can find this LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 at select retailers now for $140.\nvia: YCMC \nAuthor’s Take Decent colorway, but there’s lots of other pairs that I prefer over these. It’s crazy to see Nike continue to release new colorways of the Zoom Soldier 10 though.\n\nThe post The Non-Cleat Version Of The Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Ohio State Is Available Now appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Let's Look At Under Armour Athlete Endorsements Nov.28.16 Send Message Summary \nNike has the best portfolio of athletes. Adidas owns soccer. Under Armour has some big names, but lacks depth. \nAdidas basketball > Under Armour basketball. \nUnder Armour has had to either pay up or sign its top talent after Nike elected not to re-sign them. I'm sick of hearing about Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) sponsorships as a reason to be long the stock, as if its competitors don't endorse anybody. Having athlete endorsements are great, but it doesn't guarantee relevancy - you still need to execute on selling quality products that consumers want to buy. Other companies with strong athlete sponsorships have faded or died. Let's take a look at the sponsorship landscape. Here is a lot of the top 100 highest paid athlete endorsers of 2016. I decided to show which company has which athlete and put their dollar rating next to their name. Nike/Jordan (NYSE: NKE ): Roger Federer (1), Lebron James (2), Tiger Woods (4), Kevin Durant (5), Rory McIlroy (6), Rafael Nadal (8), Cristiano Ronaldo (11), Kobe Bryant (14), Neymar (15), Maria Sharapova (16), Serena Williams (17), Peyton Manning (20), Drew Brees (23), Kyrie Irving (27), Russell Wilson (29), Russell Westbrook (30), Chris Paul (33), Blake Griffin (34), Carmelo Anthony (35), Eli Manning (37), Paul George (40), Wayne Rooney (45), Eden Hazard (46), Kevin Love (49), Chris Bosh (53), Manny Pacquiao (55), Albert Pujols (57), Lamarcus Aldridge (58), Joe Johnson (65), Luke Kuechly (67), Joe Mauer (69), Jacoby Ellsbury (72), Matt Kemp (76), Mark Teixeira (77), Dez Bryant (78), David Price (79), Prince Fielder (80), Felix Hernandez (81), AJ Green (82), Joe Flacco (83), Adrian Gonzalez (86), Carl Crawford (87), Troy Tulowitzki (88), Sam Bradford (89). Adidas/Reebok ( OTCQX:ADDYY ): Novak Djokovic (7), Kei Nishikori (12), Lionel Messi (13), James Harden (18), Derek Rose (21), Gareth Bale (28), Jason Day (32), James Rodriguez (39), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (41), Luis Suarez (44), Conor McGregor (48), Bastian Schweinsteiger (52), Angel Di Maria (60), Jayson Werth (90), Zach Ertz (93), Julie Johnston (94), Cameron Heyward (95), Justin Houston (96), Cameron Jordan (97), Trent Williams (100). Under Armour: Jordan Spieth (9), Andy Murray (19), Steph Curry (22), Cam Newton (26), Tom Brady (36), Buster Posey (51), Canelo Alvarez (59), Demaryius Thomas (62), Julio Jones (63), Clayton Kershaw (70), Justin Verlander (75), Olivier Vernon (92), Marcell Dareus (99). Wilson: Roger Federer (1), Kei Nishikori (12), Serena Williams (17), Russell Wilson (29), David Ortiz (42), Miguel Cabrera (56), Clayton Kershaw (70) New Balance: Robinson Canó (54), Yoenis Cespedes (73), Ryan Howard (74), Cole Hamels (91) Puma: Usain Bolt (11), Sergio Aguero (38) Li-Ning: Dwayne Wade (24) Peak Sports: Dwight Howard (47) Mizuno: Masahiro Tanaka (66) We typically don't get data on how much companies paid to sign players, and obviously, there are flaws and omissions in this list. This is an estimate of dollars paid, whereas a better list would include dollars brought in also. Some of these players might \"sign\" and be in a commercial or two with the logo in the background, while others might have their own shoe line. Peyton Manning is (retired) and #20 partially because the guy endorses everything, and Derek Rose is #21 because of a huge deal (that isn't currently worth it), while Steph Curry reportedly signed a cheap $4 million deal with equity that was a huge bargain. Michael Jordan reportedly earned $110 million in 2015 , with $100 million from Nike, which would easily put him at #1. If I had to handicap that list, Nike is obviously #1 overall covering all the bases, Adidas owns soccer, and Under Armour has some good talent. Since that list came out, Adidas signed 5 of the top 7 NBA draft picks, while Nike still got the #1 pick Ben Simmons. Adidas has been on the uptrend, and fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Edwin Kye has been all over it with his articles . Personally, I think the endorsements matter most for basketball and golf. Basketball is full of shoe heads and shoe culture. Basketball shoes are about style, and teens shooting hoops in their driveway want to wear the jersey and shoe of their favorite player. I still remember what the Penny Hardaways look like, the Shaq pump shoes, Grant Hill Filas and obviously the craziness over Jordans in the early '90s. You can't really say the same about baseball or football. I played football in college, and there was never a craze on any pro athlete's cleats - the hottest thing was the ultra-light Foamposites. Tom Brady and Steph Curry are two of Under Armour's prized endorsers, and both were with Nike, but Nike decided NOT to renew their contracts. Both got lured to Under Armour not only with cash, but equity in the growing company. Under Armour also paid big bucks for Cam Newton - a deal believed to be the largest rookie contract ever . Cam might be the one football player who really makes an impact with his signature cleats. My point is that Under Armour so far has really taken Nike and Adidas leftovers OR it had to pay top dollar and get creative with its deals. Jordan Spieth is obviously an exception, but the company signed him to a long-term deal before he was legally allowed to drink and before he made it big. Have to give Under Armour credit where it is due, hitting the lottery with a few big names and a limited budget. Speaking of Jordan (Spieth), a lot of people will want to compare Curry to Michael Jordan. Jordan signed with Nike as a rookie. He wanted to sign with Adidas (the dominant sportswear company), but the company was going through a death of ownership. Adidas wasn't interested in Jordan, and the company thought taller players would be better for sponsorships (it had Kareem Abdul Jabbar). Converse, which had Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, was a dominant basketball shoe brand and was in the running to land Jordan as well as a company OJ Simpson worked for called Spot-Bilt. The young upstart, Nike, loved Jordan and offered a 5-year $2.5 million deal - which was unheard of. Its prior top deal was an 8-year $150K per year deal with James Worthy. There were a few option clauses to the 5-year deal - Jordan had to win Rookie of the year or become an All-Star or average 20 points per game in his first 3 years, or Nike could void the last two years of the deal. In return, Jordan could stay on contract by year 3 without hitting his performance metrics if he sold $4 million in sneakers. Jordan even went back to Adidas to see if the company would match the offer, and it didn't - the rest is history. Jordans sold at an unprecedented $65 price and he sold over $100 million in 1985, crushing all estimates. Nike put on a full court press to lure Jordan. He never actually wore the company's shoes until he signed. Jordan always preferred Adidas and how they were lower to the ground. Nike said it would tailor the shoes to his liking if he signed. In the past, the athletes basically got what the company gave them, so give Nike credit. Was not resigning Curry for $4 million a blunder for Nike? Sure, you can say what you want about being dissed, but his dad felt like he'd always be second tier at Nike behind Kobe, Lebron and Durant. In that respect, there will always be people who want to go a different direction and make something their own as opposed to being part of a big club. Under Armour doesn't have much depth behind a few frontline guys, Curry, Cam and Spieth. A lot of people hate the Patriots and 39-year old Brady. Ditto for Cam Newton, who got kicked out of college and complains about the refs too much. Let's look at Under Armour basketball behind Curry - you have 8 players: Brandon Jennings is a guy who averages 7 points per game on a bad team, Will Barton a 12 PPG role player, Kent Bazemore an 11 PPG role player, Patty Mills a backup point guard, couple foreign guys out of the league, and Emmanuel Mudiay, who shows promise. That's it. The only guy who could maybe sell a shoe in mass besides Curry is Mudiay. Nike basketball is obviously the best, but let's look at Adidas basketball as a whole compared to Under Armour. Here are a few highlighted players (Adidas has more not listed): Damian Lillard",

James flourished in his pair as he ended the night with a triple-double in leading the Cavs to a victory over the Sixers . Over in Dallas, Anthony Davis went for 36 and 13 in a nearly all-red colorway of his Nike Air Max Audacity 2016, while fellow big man Dwight Howard dropped 19 points in the red version of his Peak DH2 in the Hawks game against the Lakers. Last but not least, James Harden had another monstrous outing in the “Home” colorway of adidas Harden Vol.1 as he helped the Rockets dispatch the Blazers 130-114 finishing the night with 38 points and 10 dimes.",

Arriving mid-December is a \"The Sauce\" Nike KD 9 colorway, which was officially unveiled by Nike on Wednesday via its 12 Soles collection . \nThere's not much explanation about the colorway—Nike gives the nickname and mentions nothing beyond that—but more of the story is sure to come as the model's release draws closer. \nWatch for \"The Sauce\" Nike KD 9s to release on Dec. 15. \nOther Christmastime releases from Nike Basketball include a \"Ghost of Christmas Past\" Kobe and \"What The?\" Kyrie 2s . \nNike KD 9 \"The Sauce\" Release Date: 12/15/16 Color: Deep Burgundy/Metallic Red Bronze Style #: 852409-696 \nUPDATE 11/28: Detailed images of the KD 9 \"The Sauce\" colorway from Nike China. The shoe is listed there as a Dec. 5 release, although it hasn't popped up on Nike's U.S. sneaker release date calendars just yet. Image via Nike",

      "text": "Shoppers finally got their hands on Nike 's self-lacing, \"Back to the Future Part II\"-inspired sneakers after it went on sale in the U.S. Monday.\nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe, which will retail at $720, is Nike's \"first step into the future of adaptive performance,\" the brand claims. In real language, that means the hi-top sneaker can sense how snugly it should be laced, without the wearer having to tighten and loosen it manually.\nThe 'original' shoe was featured in the film where Marty McFly, played by Michael J Fox, puts on the trainers whose Nike logo lights up as they lace themselves. A video showing Nike's new product has been watched more than 4 million times.\nIt's not the first time movies have inspired products that then went on to be created in real life, though it may be one of the longest waits fans have had for such items – \"Back to the Future Part II\" was released in the U.S. on 22 November 1989, just over 27 years ago.\nThese are our picks of the products inspired by the big screen.\nThe Wonka Bar Spencer Platt | Getty Images Roald Dahl's 1964 novel, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was made into a film in 1971 and both featured the \"perfect candy bar,\" the Wonka Bar, named after its maker Willy Wonka. It was inevitable that a real chocolate bar of the same name would be launched, with Quaker Oats (which is said to have financed the film) initially planning to produce the sweet treats. Nestle now lists Wonka as a brand that \"opened its doors in 1983\" and following the 2005 movie, it made golden ticket bars, however Wonka-branded products now appear to be unavailable. \n\nSex Panther cologne \"Sixty percent of the time, it works every time,\" goes the strapline for Sex Panther cologne , a men's fragrance that was first featured in the 2004 movie \" Anchorman ,\" which character Brian Fantana states is \"illegal in nine countries.\" Tru Fragrance (which also makes men's products with names like Chancellor, Steel Spur and Stud) now sells the aftershave for $40 a go, but be warned: The carton actually growls when opened.\n\nQuidditch Carlos Osorio | Toronto Star | Getty Images The flying game made famous by the Harry Potter franchise now has its own governing body, overseeing 500 teams in 26 countries. The International Quidditch Association was founded in 2010, after two Vermont students started organizing intercollegiate matches three years earlier. There are some obvious differences between games, although broom (sticks), seekers and chasers (goal scorers) are involved in both. The IQA website makes clear that it is not associated with author JK Rowling or producer Warner Bros, and is a nonprofit business.\n\nBubba Gump Shrimp Company Raymond Boyd | Michael Ochs Archives | Getty Images The 1994 movie \"Forrest Gump\" featured Tom Hanks (playing the eponymous hero) eventually going into the shrimp business with Benjamin Buford Blue, nicknamed \"Bubba\". Just two years later, the first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co opened in Monterey, California, a partnership between film rights owner Paramount Pictures and Rusty Pelican Restaurants Inc. Its website currently lists 43 restaurants in the U.S., Japan, Mexico, Malaysia and U.K.\n\nPersonalized billboards Fox Movies' 2002 \"Minority Report\" features ads for Lexus and Guinness targeting Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton, by name as he walks through a mall. His eyes are scanned and he's also recognized by American Express and is shown an ad as one of its customers. So far, so much product placement. With brands already using artificial intelligence to personalize campaigns to people, this kind of marketing could soon become a reality. \n\nBut it doesn't have to be creepy: in 2012, charity Plan UK used facial-recognition technology for its out-of-home advertising, showing ads using the line \"I can see you looking at me,\" serving up different content depending on the sex of the viewer, to highlight the importance of girls' education in developing countries. \nThe one that got away: The tablet computer The 1988 Tom Hanks movie \"Big\" arguably invented the tablet computer. No manufacturer picked up on it, probably because the internet was barely in existence by then. In one scene, Hanks pitches it as a kids' toy, saying: \"There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...\" \n\n\"Like if he's going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons. ... See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. That's the point.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "By Amir Ismael \nNike has a rich history in footwear and after being in business for more than 50 years, the brand has accrued quiet the archive of sneakers. Originally named Blue Ribbon Sports, Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight's company has remained deeply rooted in running for wear, even after the name change to Nike in 1971. In an exclusive inside look, Coveteur gained access to Nike's vault to unveil what's really inside. \nLocated at Nike Headquarters in Portland, Oregon, the Department of Nike Archives is tucked away in a super secret warehouse and houses a thorough collection of sneakers representing the lineage since its beginning days. The DNA includes Bill Bowerman's original waffle trainer , Nike's latest adaptive power lacing technology found on the HyperAdapt 1.0 , and literally everything Swoosh-related in between. \nFor a full look inside of Nike's top secret sneaker vault, head over to Coveteur .",

      "text": "\nWhere can I find the Nike+ Sport Band look for my Apple Watch? iMore's got you covered!\n\nWhen the Apple Watch Series 2 launched, eager users were treated to a ton of fun features: Water resistance, new apps, and modern new colors all made a big splash with the wearable community — especially when it came to runners and exercise buffs. But those groups weren't just limited to the normal Series 2 casings; Apple made a special design just for the fitness crowd.\nEnter the Apple Watch Nike+.\nThe perfect running partner – on your wrist.\nWhile the case design of the Nike+ is nigh-identical to the other Series 2 watches, the Sport band is unique in its wacky, octopus-y perforated design, and unlike any other band Apple has on the market. It also can't be purchased separately — it only ships with the Apple Watch Nike+ case.\nBut don't despair! If you desperately need that sleek, futuristic strap on your wrist but don't have the money for an entirely new Apple Watch, keep on reading: We've got a few ways you can get the Apple Watch Nike+ Sport Band look without breaking the bank!\nKOBWA Replacement Nike Band Senter soft silicone replacement Series 2 iMiWell Soft silicone quick release strap \nKOBWA Replacement Nike Band \nDesigned to fit both the Apple Watch Series 1 and 2, this KOBWA Replacement Nike Band is a perfect copy of the original – but for only $14.24!\nMade from a lightweight, high-quality silicone, adjusting and tightening your Apple Watch is easy as ever thanks to the band's multi-hole design. The soft flexible material makes it easy to wear your Apple Watch comfortably throughout the day, on a run, or at the gym.\nThe other awesome part about the KOBWA replacement band? Its colors! You can pick from green and black, black and yellow, black and gray, dark blue and mint green, red and black, pink and mint green, and so much more!\nSee at Amazon \n\nSenter soft silicone replacement Series 2 \nHighly-rated, comfortable, and darn near close to the real thing, this Senter soft silicone replacement for the Apple Watch Series 2 is another great option to keep in mind if you're looking for that Nike+ style.\nI like wearing these kind of bands to the gym. They feel a lot lighter and have more holes your skin can breathe from while you sweat. It's a big plus that they look good, but I've said that already! (Amazon user @Margie)\nThe Senter can be easily adjusted depending on your wrist size, just like the Nike+ band; unlike the Nike+ band, however, you have a ton of vibrant, bright colors to pick from! For just $15.26, you can pick up your futuristic accessory in azure/navy, black/grey, black/green, black/yellow, grey/green, grey/white, navy/white, pink/azure, purple/green, and red/black.\nSee at Amazon \n\niMiWell Soft silicone quick release strap \nMade from a durable, comfortable silicone, the iMiWell Soft silicone strap is ready to help you work out and sweat in Nike+ style! Coupled with an easy-adjust closure and straps, the iMiWell Soft silicone band is the third of our inexpensive alternatives to the Nike+ band, though a little pricier than our other two options at $18.99.\nLike the other bands on this list, the iMiWell comes in a plethora of colors, including navy and pale green, gray and white, black and gray, and so much more!\nSee at Amazon \nWhat's your pick? Is there a third-party Apple Watch band you've found that fills the Nike+ band-shaped hole in your heart? Let us know in the comments below, and we'll be sure to check it out!\n",

      "text": "Innovative Design How Nike's New Concept Store in SoHo Could Ultimately Change Retail Forever The Oregon-based apparel company has added several new types of retail experience for its customers to test their products in real sports environments Text by Facebook A look inside Nike's innovative new SoHo retail space. \nWith its new store in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood, Nike shows that the right technology can help make shopping feel a lot more personal. The five-story, 55,000-square-foot “retail experience,” as Nike describes it, allows shoppers to test products in real sports environments, with an eye toward maximizing performance. The Nike+ Basketball Trial Zone, for example, lets hoopsters try potential new shoes as massive displays virtually transport them to iconic NYC playgrounds and Kinect sensors capture personal performance data. Runners can hit the treadmills, while screens replicate a jog through Central Park as well as provide real-time feedback. The Nike+ Soccer Trial Zone allows visitors to test their favorite new footwear on a 400-square-foot synthetic turf field while receiving one-on-one guidance from in-store professionals. Those customers who are uber-competitive can even save training results for their next visit. Facebook \nA customer tests a pair of Nike running shoes alongside a group of digital runners in New York's Central Park. \nFor shoppers more focused on looking good, the Nike By NYC studio offers custom laser engraving and printing on Nike products, and the location will feature store exclusives and collaborations with local designers. On-site touch screens allow customers to call an associate for help or make an on-the-spot purchase. And if shoppers can’t find the exact color and style they want, they can buy the product(s) in-store and have them shipped home. The Nike+ app offers an additional level of integration for purchases, adding to the retail-plus-digital theme. In a press release Nike claims the store “creates a seamless link between Nike’s digital and physical platforms.” Shopping to reach your athletic potential has never been so easy. Explore ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. You Can Finally Buy Nike’s ‘Back to the Future’ Sneakers \nThe light up, self-lacing sneakers Marty McFly wore in Back to the Future II are finally in stores. \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes, as they’re formally known, officially went on sale on Monday, CNBC reports. Nike nke describes the sneakers as the “first step into the future of adaptive performance.” A pair of these futuristic sneakers retails for $720. \nThe shoes use cables and pressure sensors to sense how tightly they need to be laced without the wearer having to tighten or loosen them themselves, though there are buttons that allow you to adjust the fit. LED lights on the soles don’t just mimic the look Marty McFly sported in the movie, but they also serve as battery level indicators. \n\nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes are based off of the once-fictional invention imagined in the 1989 movie Back to the Future II . Michael J. Fox, who played Marty McFly, was the first to get a pair. Nike presented them to the actor on Oct. 21, 2015—the date that his character traveled to in the movie. ",

      "text": "RSS \nSince Tiger Woods last played 16 months ago, Nike stopped making golf clubs. So that brand’s biggest ambassador over the past two decades needed to find some new tools while making sure his body was healthy enough to endure the rigors of playing competitively again. \nSwitching putters was the easy part. Woods has gone back to the same Scotty Cameron stick that he used to win 13 of this 14 major championships. \n“Charlie (Woods’ son) knows there are two putters that he can’t touch,” Woods said. “There’s that black one I won with the trillium insert, I won the Masters in ’97, and this one. They sit next to each other. Touch any other putter, do anything you want with any other putter. These putters are off limits.” Hero World Challenge: Articles, photos and videos \nWoods will play the Bridgestone B330S ball, says he will continue to use Nike irons and has used a TaylorMade M2 driver so far this week in his practice sessions. \n“As far as equipment, that’s a very complicated one because this is the first time that I have ever used adjustable equipment,” Woods said. \n“I'm trying to learn the new terminology, meanwhile trying to implement some of my old feels and some of the things that has made me successful at the same time, you know, throughout the years. And hopefully I can have some kind of amalgamation of all of that together and put together a nice little run here.” Article Tags:",

      "title": "Is $720 Too Much for Nike's Auto-Lacing Sneakers?",
      "text": "0 Image via Nike Nike’s newest sneaker, the HyperAdapt 1.0 , comes with an auto-lacing system, a light-up midsole, and a $720 price tag. This is the first time that the sportswear brand has produced a commercially available shoe that laces on its own, the concept first being introduced on the Nike Mag in 1989’s Back to the Future Part II . Nike made the Mag and its power-lacing a reality, just like in the film, for the first time ever earlier this year. The only catch was Nike only made 89 pairs, and they were only available through raffles or auctions. The HyperAdapt 1.0 is being sold to the public starting tomorrow, Dec. 1, but is the price too high? First things first: Auto-lacing sneakers are nothing short of revolutionary in the footwear industry. Not only do they allow athletes a more customized degree of fit, but they can also improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, like Michael J. Fox -- t he man who wore the sneakers in Back to the Future and debuted the Nike Mags -- who suffers from Parkinson’s disease. Nike’s also created a “FlyEase” sneaker, which is a no-lacing system inspired by Matthew Walzer, a teenager with special needs . No one’s discrediting the fact that Tiffany Beers, Nike’s Senior Innovator, has created one of the most groundbreaking sneaker technologies ever. The price, however, is making people cringe a bit. The HyperAdapt isn’t the most expensive sneaker ever sold by Nike. The brand had two pairs of handmade Air Force 1s–done in anaconda and crocodile skins, respectively–in 2007 that retailed for $1,000 a piece. There was also the Nike Hyperdunk and Lunar Trainer 1 from 2012 that were priced up to $250 because of the advanced Nike+ training system that was built into the sneakers. The latter is the most comparable to the HyperAdapt, not only because they were performance sneakers, but that they came with some added bells and whistles that helped Nike justify raising its price. It wasn’t marketed at sneakerheads who simply wanted the coolest shoes on the market, but to tech nerds who wanted the most futuristic sneakers on the market. The HyperAdapt and its $720 retail price would appeal more to Doug Funny’s next-door neighbor Mr. Dink, who would buy the most technologically advanced items and describe them as “very expensive.” But is $720 really all that out of reach in the grander scheme of the sneaker market? According to Forbes, the average price of a men’s athletic sneaker was $72 in 2013. The average weekly income in America, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is $827. People, however, are already trained to to shell out major bucks when it comes to highly sought-after sneakers. The recently released A Bathing Ape x Adidas NMD resells for an average of $1,222, according to StockX , while the Just Don x Air Jordan II goes for around the same pric e. So why are people against a sneaker that retails for over $700 on a genuinely innovative shoe when they spend even more cash on shoes with technology that’s 30+ years old or were designed for lifestyle purposes? Well, it comes down to perception. The reason a lot of people are talking about the HyperAdapt isn’t just because it laces itself up, but because it costs $720. (The sneakers were even falsely reported to be $1,000.) If so, that’s genius marketing on Nike’s end. The HyperAdapt 1.0 wasn’t created with sneakerheads -- the ones who line up for Yeezys or trade shoes just to get newer and more-hyped ones -- in mind. They’re for people who geek out over Tesla cars, spend $400 on a new Apple watch, or swap out their smartphones every five months. Nike didn’t reveal the HyperAdapt story within an interview with Tiffany Beers, Vice President of Design Tinker Hatfield, and CEO Mark Parker on a sneaker blog or with a sports publication, but via a cover story with tech magazine Wired . Not only sneaker enthusiasts are complaining about the price of the sneaker, though. Al Roker joked on the set of the Today show yesterday , “$720? You might as well hire someone to tie your shoes.” My dad made a near identical joke to me two weeks ago, too. It’s interesting that Nike’s following through with such a high entry point with the auto-lacing technology. The brand recently lowered the prices on its signature basketball sneakers after complaints from Foot Locker that people weren’t willing to spend more than $200 on a pair of LeBron James shoes. The HyperAdapt is over three times more expensive than the LeBron’s latest sneakers. It’s natural for sneakers to get more expensive over the years. The New Balance 990 turned heads when it was sold for $100 in 1982, but the company now sells premium versions of retro sneakers for $340. Maybe sneakers will cost $720 on average at some point, or at least people won’t bat their eye at that sticker price. But the HyperAdapt represents much more than a bar being raised in the retail world, it truly embodies the direction that athletic footwear is headed in. When Marty McFly was transported to a fictional 2015 in 1989, people could only imagine that sneakers would light up and lace by themselves. It’s only a year past that vision of the future, and auto-lacing sneakers are here. The only thing we couldn’t fathom is how much they’d cost to own.",

The presentation isn’t as tricked out as the Nike MAG shoe box, but still comes with a few important nuts and bolts like an AC adapter, two charging pucks, and even an instruction manual. In addition to a glimpse at the packaging, we also get some macro shots of the shoe’s upper, showing a Flyknit-like texture.\nIf you didn’t manage to secure an appointment this time around, subsequent drops are taking place at NikeTown NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco on December 20, when “Black/White-Blue Lagoon” and “Metallic Silver/Black-White” colorways will become available in-store and through the NIKE+ App.\nSee the shoe in action below via actor Michael B. Jordan.\n\nWhile you wait, browse through some recent sneaker drops on Highsnobiety ‘s curated shopping channel What Drops Now .\nSubscribe to Highsnobiety’s sneaker chatbot on Facebook to receive lightning quick updates on release dates, sneaker street style, shopping tips and more. \n",

      "text": "nike hyperadapt go on sale sneakers boxed More Nike\nIf you hate tying laces, and slip-on shoes just aren’t exciting enough for your multifarious foot-based exploits, then how about a pair of “power-lacing” sneakers for your feet?\nThey’ve been a long time coming , but Nike’s much-anticipated HyperAdapt 1.0 footwear – inspired by the snazzy self-lacing MAG shoes worn by Marty McFly in Back to the Future II – are finally hitting stores today. Well, two stores, to be precise. Both in New York City.\nCosting a cool $720 a pop, the specially designed footwear features automatic “adaptive fit” technology powered by a so-called “lacing engine” located at the base of the shoe. As you slip your foot inside, it triggers a sensor in the heel that causes the shoe to gently tighten. Two buttons on the outside of the sneaker allow for smaller adjustments to give you the absolute snuggest of fits.\nhyperadapt-1-0 More Nike\nNike released an image of the packaging on Thursday. It shows not only the main attraction, but also a Quick Start guide, charging pucks that magnetically attach to the bottom of each sneaker, and an AC adapter. The sportswear giant says that with average use the incorporated battery should keep the tech functioning for up to two weeks on a single charge. The shoe’s built-in lights glow three different colors to let you know the state of the battery. A full charge takes about three hours.\nMore: These smart, customizable e-sneakers have real sole\nThe HyperAdapt shoe was co-designed by Tinker Hatfield and Tiffany Beers. Speaking earlier this year, Hatfield said he believes adaptive lacing could be a hit with athletes as the system provides a “tailored-to-the-moment” custom fit.\n“It’s amazing to consider a shoe that senses what the body needs in real-time,” Hatfield said, adding that the unique design “eliminates a multitude of distractions, including mental attrition, and thus truly benefits performance.”\nSo where exactly can you grab a pair of these flashy, high-tech sneakers? Why, at Nike stores, of course. Both are in Manhattan – Nike Soho on the corner of Broadway and Spring Street, and the Nike+ ClubHouse at 45 Grand – which means most of the world’s sneaker fans won’t have the chance to slip their feet inside a pair. However, Nike does say on its website that the new shoes will be landing in additional select stores later this month. Presumably outside of Manhattan.\nAwesome tech you can’t buy yet: Custom LED sneakers, invisible drums, and more Nike’s ‘self-lacing’ HyperAdapt shoes will cost you $720 Watch Reebok’s robots make a pair of distinctive ‘Liquid Factory’ sneakers Those self-lacing ‘Back to the Future’ sneakers just auctioned for $100,000 How to get your own pair of Nike’s ‘Back to the Future’ shoes",

      "text": "ESPN.com's sports business reporter since 2012; previously at ESPN from 2000-06 Appears on SportsCenter, ESPN Radio, ESPN.com and with ABC News Formerly worked as analyst at CNBC comment \nOne year into her tenure working inside Nike's Innovation Kitchen, where the company's designers dream up the future, Tiffany Beers was given an assignment: Figure out how to make a real, working prototype of the shoe the company created for Michael J. Fox in \"Back to the Future Part II.\" \nThe project at the time seemed a little off the beaten path. \nNike's lead designer, Tinker Hatfield, had come up with the shoe, which featured a self-lacing system and lights, for the 1988 movie and had even filed for a design patent that covered the structure. But why spend time actually producing the futuristic shoe that might have no practical applications to Nike's future business? \n\"It was a lot like the movie prop process itself,\" Hatfield recalled. \"We could have done a lot less with it, but we dreamed as big as we could. In this case, I knew we wanted to work on it a bit and that we wouldn't be able to run it up the flagpole unless we had a working prototype.\" \nOn Thursday, roughly 11 years after Beers was initially given the assignment, the first self-lacing shoes will reach the mass marketplace. The HyperAdapt 1.0 will be awarded via a random lottery, with winners selected from a list of those who signed up through Nike's app. Quantities are not being disclosed, but the company isn't expected to have any issue completely liquidating supply at a cost of $720 a pair. It is being called the most ambitious project in shoe-making history, and given what it took to get here, there are few who contest that claim. \nThis is the story of that journey. Paging Marty McFly \nHatfield is Nike's legendary designer. Sneakerheads know him as the guy who took over the Jordan franchise in the third year and gets much of the credit -- outside of Michael Jordan himself -- for turning the brand into a $3 billion empire. \nWhen Hatfield designed the futuristic shoe for \"Back to the Future Part II,\" the working model wasn't really working. In order to light the footwear, Michael J. Fox was wearing a huge battery pack. Those cool self-lacing shoes? Holes were made in the stage floor and people pulled the laces on cue. \nAs time went on, Hatfield, in public appearances, was always asked about one of two things: Michael Jordan, or those shoes Marty McFly wore. As the Internet proliferated, the noise got louder. Fans of the movie and the shoes started adding their names to petitions. \n\"When I saw 30,000 names on those petitions, I just knew we had to figure some way to actually make this shoe one day,\" Hatfield said. \nSo he gave the assignment to a young up-and-comer, the 25-year-old Beers, a plastics engineer who had recently come over from Rubbermaid, where she was tasked with taking things typically made out of metal and building them with plastic. \nFor three years, Beers spent half her time building the actual shoe dubbed the Nike MAG. By 2007, she had a working prototype with lights, but it had to be constantly plugged into the wall to work. \n\"And then technology stalled,\" Beers said. \"We had to wait if we wanted to make a shoe like this truly functional.\" \nA couple years later, Beers picked up the project again to deliver what the masses wanted: A \"Back to the Future\" shoe they could touch and wear. Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers, left, speaks onstage next to Nike designer Tinker Hatfield. To the far left sits the 2016 version of the Nike MAG shoes, which were unveiled in 2011. Jamie McCarthy/MJF2016/Getty Images \nIn 2011, the Nike MAG -- with lights but not automatic lacing -- was unveiled. Nike auctioned off 1,500 pairs at an average price of $3,797 a pair, with all the proceeds going to the Michael J. Fox Foundation to raise money for Parkinson's disease research. \nIt could have all ended there. But it didn't. The shoes take shape -- literally \n\"We were leaving the launch event in a car and [Nike CEO] Mark [Parker] says to me, 'That was great. How long is it going to take to make them with auto-laces?'\" Beers recalled. \nAt this point, Parker wasn't just talking about the MAG, he was talking about building a real auto-lacing shoe that could be worn every day -- just like all the company's other shoes. \nIn Year 7 of Beers' assignment, the practical nature of the project started to take shape. She understood she was now being asked to put auto-laces in something beyond a movie prop. \n\"We've been looking at the feet of an athlete for a long time,\" Hatfield said. \"There are so many whose feet just look like misshaped blobs that barely work anymore. Some of that has to do with the foot being tight in a dark place. We thought, 'What happens if as we're building this auto-lacing movie shoe we also build a parallel shoe in order to advance Nike performance innovation?'\" \nLacing systems hadn't really evolved much over the past couple centuries. Puma is credited with being the first company to put Velcro on shoes in 1968. Puma again innovated in 1991, when it took away the laces in place of a disc that would allow a consumer to close a shoe. Reebok, of course, had the Reebok Pump, which debuted in 1989, but the filling of the air bladders around the foot didn't substitute for lacing. \nBeers took inventory of what she needed to break new ground in the industry with a shoe whose laces you didn't have to tie. \nThere had to be a sensor that recognized when the foot was in the shoe and where the foot was in relation to the laces, so that the fit would be right when the shoe was tied. There also had to be a motor so that the laces would tighten and loosen. \nThere were a lot of problems to solve -- one involved where to put the motor. \nBeers said she was comforted by the development of a plate in the foot built by the designers of the Jordan XX8, which created a perfect pocket between the sole of the foot and the sole of the shoe. In that space, the battery could be put under the foot without hurting the battery or compromising the comfort of the wearer, she said. \nAs time went on, it became apparent that the quest to make the self-lacing shoe wasn't happening in isolation. It wasn't just some crazy side project that would result in sneakerheads and movie lovers getting the shoe they dreamed of, and Nike going on its way having satisfied a niche market. \n\"While we were trying to make this futuristic shoe, we started to see practical applications elsewhere,\" Beers said. \"We used the foam exterior for a Jordan shoe. Our learning about batteries had allowed us to build snowboard boots that lit up in 2013, and heated boots that we gave to our athletes for the Winter Olympics in 2014 in Vancouver.\" A sketch from 2014 of Nike's future auto-lacing shoes. Nike A sketch from 2015 showing the progression of the HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike \nThe conversation that Beers and Parker had in the car in 2011 wasn't public. No one knew Nike was going to go through with actually making a self-lacing sneaker. \nThat all changed in February 2014, when Hatfield disclosed at a Jordan event during the NBA's All-Star Weekend that the self-lacing shoe would hit the market in 2015. \nSneakerheads rejoiced. \nBeers was blindsided. She was never told that 2015 was the timeline, even though it made practical sense. It was the year that \"Back to the Future Part II\" flashed forward to -- a year in which, ridiculously, the Cubs would win the World Series. \n\"Mark Parker said to me, 'Oh man, you really stuck your neck out on that one,'\" Hatfield said. \"And I did. I added more urgency and put pressure on the team. If I don't do that, I don't think a shoe comes out in 2015, and the shoe that is coming out now doesn't come out in 2016.\" \nWith the secret out, Beers was now free to outsource the work. She hired the best electrical and mechanical engineer she could find. The investigation into specific motors got more serious. \nNike found an on-the-shelf small motor it could adapt to make it work within the shoe. \nAnd then it stalled again. \nBeers said the company that made the motor, which Nike is not disclosing, was not convinced of how Nike had rigged it. Although it worked, it wasn't being used in a way the company had dreamed of. While getting the call from Nike was obviously an honor, the undisclosed company needed to protect itself. \nWith some convincing, the blessing was given. On Oct. 21, 2015 -- the future date Marty McFly traveled to in the 1988 sequel -- a working pair of Nike MAGs were given to Michael J. Fox. Fox, in an office with Parker and Beers, shared how the shoes functioned on social media. \n\"I never said how many we were going to have,\" Hatfield said. \"We made at least one.\" \nSneakerheads had to wait a year later to get their hands on the self-lacing Nike MAGs. Nike held a lottery, backed by $6.75 million in purchased raffle tickets, for fans to win one of 85 pairs of the shoes. Four others would be sold via auction around the world, with the last pair going for $200,000 at the annual Michael J. Fox Foundation event in New York on Nov. 12. Nike wasn't done \nThe true prize wasn't the self-lacing MAG shoes, it was a regular, everyday shoe that laced itself. \nParker hinted this was coming in October 2015, the same day Fox's video hit social media. \n\"We started creating something for fiction and we turned it into a fact, inventing a new technology that will benefit all athletes,\" Parker said. \nIt was shortly after that car ride that Beers had built a prototype running shoe that would auto-lace and could be manually adjusted by the user pushing a \"tighten\" or \"loosen\" button. \n\"I would make the laces tighter when I was running up hills and loosen them going down hills, and I noticed I was able to provide the changing support I needed while keeping pace,\" Beers said. \"It made us realize how this could help athletes -- guys who tie their shoe tight to start a game, but need adjustments as their feet swell as they play.\" \nEventually, Beers reasoned, a shoe would be built that would automatically make these types of adjustments. But with the first shoe, it was important to give the consumer the option of manual adjustment. \nThere was a new focus on practicality. Sure, the Nike MAG had been implemented and was a functioning shoe, but there were only 89 pairs in the marketplace and no one was wearing them every day. \nWith a self-contained auto-lacing shoe that could be worn on an everyday basis, battery life became a greater focus, as did the sound of the motors. \n\"The initial prototype we had with working motors sounded like a cat getting hit with a chainsaw,\" Beers said. \"No one wants to hear that every day.\" \nBeers said the sense was that the consumer didn't want to have the inconvenience of always charging the battery. So Nike built one that would last for a week if a person wore it every day and constantly adjusted it. With normal use, it can easily last two weeks without going on the magnetic pucks Nike provides that stick to the shoe soles. Outside chargers also work, so a Mophie charge could keep the shoe functioning for months. \nIn March 2016, Nike announced the concept, the HyperAdapt 1.0, with E.A.R.L., which stands for Electro Reactive Adaptive Laces. The abbreviation, which is on the shoe's tongue, comes from Hatfield's love of robotic life -- further evident in his admiration of the 2008 Pixar movie WALL-E. Nike's lead designer, Tinker Hatfield, left, and Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers pose with the HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike \nAs Nike announced the innovation near New York City's Madison Square Garden that day, no shoes had been made for the market. It meant that the first offering was going to be limited, but it was also going to be special. Whatever happened, it had to go right. Preparing for the future \nSoon after the announcement, a team went to Nike's Development Center in Taiwan to figure out how to build the shoes step-by-step. Once determined, the process was moved to Vietnam, where the actual production began. \nNike does not openly talk about its pricing and margins, but ultimately the $720 price point was agreed upon -- an outrageous sum, but nothing out of the ordinary to sneakerhead collectors who frequently spend that amount on a pair of shoes on the resale market. \nKnowing it is changing convention, Nike wants to make sure everything goes right. That means for the first time in the company's history, Nike is creating a special hotline for registered owners of the HyperAdapt 1.0 to call in with questions at any time. Beers said it's set up so that she eventually gets all the feedback in written form. \n— Kyrie Irving (@KyrieIrving) November 28, 2016 \nOn the bottom of the shoe, where the charger indicator goes (it changes from green to yellow to red), is printed \"MT2,\" which stands for Mark (Parker), Tinker and Tiffany. It's a nice tribute to those who have worked for so long on this project. The bottom of the new shoe reads \"MT2,\" a tribute to Mark Parker, Tinker Hatfield and Tiffany Beers, who have been working on the project for over a decade. Nike \nFor Hatfield, the bigger tribute might be a longer lasting legacy. \n\"I'm closer to the end of my career than the beginning, and I want to go out with a bang,\" said Hatfield, who started at Nike in 1981 and started designing shoes in 1985. \"I think this is going to become a big deal. I think in the future, shoes are going to do the work for you. They're going to adapt to your feet, they're going to adjust, they're going to have smart technology -- just like cars and vacuum cleaners. \n\"I think in 10 years, 50 percent of all Nike shoes will be power laces.\" \nSounds crazy. But that's not the first time Hatfield has been called crazy. One of the reasons the shoe is coming out Thursday is because Hatfield -- and Nike -- didn't listen to those people.",

      "text": "One year into her tenure working inside Nike's Innovation Kitchen, where the company's designers dream up the future, Tiffany Beers was given an assignment: Figure out how to make a real, working prototype of the shoe the company created for Michael J. Fox in \"Back to the Future Part II.\"\nThe project at the time seemed a little off the beaten path.\nNike's lead designer, Tinker Hatfield, had come up with the shoe, which featured a self-lacing system and lights, for the 1988 movie and had even filed for a design patent that covered the structure. But why spend time actually producing the futuristic shoe that might have no practical applications to Nike's future business?\n\"It was a lot like the movie prop process itself,\" Hatfield recalled. \"We could have done a lot less with it, but we dreamed as big as we could. In this case, I knew we wanted to work on it a bit and that we wouldn't be able to run it up the flagpole unless we had a working prototype.\"\nOn Thursday, roughly 11 years after Beers was initially given the assignment, the first self-lacing shoes will reach the mass marketplace. The HyperAdapt 1.0 will be awarded via a random lottery, with winners selected from a list of those who signed up through Nike's app. Quantities are not being disclosed, but the company isn't expected to have any issue completely liquidating supply at a cost of $720 a pair. It is being called the most ambitious project in shoe-making history, and given what it took to get here, there are few who contest that claim.\nThis is the story of that journey.\nPaging Marty McFly Hatfield is Nike's legendary designer. Sneakerheads know him as the guy who took over the Jordan franchise in the third year and gets much of the credit -- outside of Michael Jordan himself -- for turning the brand into a $3 billion empire.\nWhen Hatfield designed the futuristic shoe for \"Back to the Future Part II,\" the working model wasn't really working. In order to light the footwear, Michael J. Fox was wearing a huge battery pack. Those cool self-lacing shoes? Holes were made in the stage floor and people pulled the laces on cue.\nAs time went on, Hatfield, in public appearances, was always asked about one of two things: Michael Jordan, or those shoes Marty McFly wore. As the Internet proliferated, the noise got louder. Fans of the movie and the shoes started adding their names to petitions.\n\"When I saw 30,000 names on those petitions, I just knew we had to figure some way to actually make this shoe one day,\" Hatfield said.\nSo he gave the assignment to a young up-and-comer, the 25-year-old Beers, a plastics engineer who had recently come over from Rubbermaid, where she was tasked with taking things typically made out of metal and building them with plastic.\nFor three years, Beers spent half her time building the actual shoe dubbed the Nike MAG. By 2007, she had a working prototype with lights, but it had to be constantly plugged into the wall to work.\n\"And then technology stalled,\" Beers said. \"We had to wait if we wanted to make a shoe like this truly functional.\"\nA couple years later, Beers picked up the project again to deliver what the masses wanted: A \"Back to the Future\" shoe they could touch and wear.\nIn 2011, the Nike MAG -- with lights but not automatic lacing -- was unveiled. Nike auctioned off 1,500 pairs at an average price of $3,797 a pair, with all the proceeds going to the Michael J. Fox Foundation to raise money for Parkinson's disease research.\nIt could have all ended there. But it didn't.\nThe shoes take shape -- literally \"We were leaving the launch event in a car and [Nike CEO] Mark [Parker] says to me, 'That was great. How long is it going to take to make them with auto-laces?'\" Beers recalled.\nAt this point, Parker wasn't just talking about the MAG, he was talking about building a real auto-lacing shoe that could be worn every day -- just like all the company's other shoes.\nIn Year 7 of Beers' assignment, the practical nature of the project started to take shape. She understood she was now being asked to put auto-laces in something beyond a movie prop.\n\"We've been looking at the feet of an athlete for a long time,\" Hatfield said. \"There are so many whose feet just look like misshaped blobs that barely work anymore. Some of that has to do with the foot being tight in a dark place. We thought, 'What happens if as we're building this auto-lacing movie shoe we also build a parallel shoe in order to advance Nike performance innovation?'\"\nLacing systems hadn't really evolved much over the past couple centuries. Puma is credited with being the first company to put Velcro on shoes in 1968. Puma again innovated in 1991, when it took away the laces in place of a disc that would allow a consumer to close a shoe. Reebok, of course, had the Reebok Pump, which debuted in 1989, but the filling of the air bladders around the foot didn't substitute for lacing.\nBeers took inventory of what she needed to break new ground in the industry with a shoe whose laces you didn't have to tie.\nThere had to be a sensor that recognized when the foot was in the shoe and where the foot was in relation to the laces, so that the fit would be right when the shoe was tied. There also had to be a motor so that the laces would tighten and loosen.\nThere were a lot of problems to solve -- one involved where to put the motor.\nBeers said she was comforted by the development of a plate in the foot built by the designers of the Jordan XX8, which created a perfect pocket between the sole of the foot and the sole of the shoe. In that space, the battery could be put under the foot without hurting the battery or compromising the comfort of the wearer, she said.\nAs time went on, it became apparent that the quest to make the self-lacing shoe wasn't happening in isolation. It wasn't just some crazy side project that would result in sneakerheads and movie lovers getting the shoe they dreamed of, and Nike going on its way having satisfied a niche market.\n\"While we were trying to make this futuristic shoe, we started to see practical applications elsewhere,\" Beers said. \"We used the foam exterior for a Jordan shoe. Our learning about batteries had allowed us to build snowboard boots that lit up in 2013, and heated boots that we gave to our athletes for the Winter Olympics in 2014 in Vancouver.\"\nThe conversation that Beers and Parker had in the car in 2011 wasn't public. No one knew Nike was going to go through with actually making a self-lacing sneaker.\nThat all changed in February 2014, when Hatfield disclosed at a Jordan event during the NBA's All-Star Weekend that the self-lacing shoe would hit the market in 2015.\nSneakerheads rejoiced.\nBeers was blindsided. She was never told that 2015 was the timeline, even though it made practical sense. It was the year that \"Back to the Future Part II\" flashed forward to -- a year in which, ridiculously, the Cubs would win the World Series.\n\"Mark Parker said to me, 'Oh man, you really stuck your neck out on that one,'\" Hatfield said. \"And I did. I added more urgency and put pressure on the team. If I don't do that, I don't think a shoe comes out in 2015, and the shoe that is coming out now doesn't come out in 2016.\"\nWith the secret out, Beers was now free to outsource the work. She hired the best electrical and mechanical engineer she could find. The investigation into specific motors got more serious.\nNike found an on-the-shelf small motor it could adapt to make it work within the shoe.\nAnd then it stalled again.\nBeers said the company that made the motor, which Nike is not disclosing, was not convinced of how Nike had rigged it. Although it worked, it wasn't being used in a way the company had dreamed of. While getting the call from Nike was obviously an honor, the undisclosed company needed to protect itself.\nWith some convincing, the blessing was given. On Oct. 21, 2015 -- the future date Marty McFly traveled to in the 1988 sequel -- a working pair of Nike MAGs were given to Michael J. Fox. Fox, in an office with Parker and Beers, shared how the shoes functioned on social media.\n\"I never said how many we were going to have,\" Hatfield said. \"We made at least one.\"\nSneakerheads had to wait a year later to get their hands on the self-lacing Nike MAGs. Nike held a lottery, backed by $6.75 million in purchased raffle tickets, for fans to win one of 85 pairs of the shoes. Four others would be sold via auction around the world, with the last pair going for $200,000 at the annual Michael J. Fox Foundation event in New York on Nov. 12.\nNike wasn't done The true prize wasn't the self-lacing MAG shoes, it was a regular, everyday shoe that laced itself.\nParker hinted this was coming in October 2015, the same day Fox's video hit social media.\n\"We started creating something for fiction and we turned it into a fact, inventing a new technology that will benefit all athletes,\" Parker said.\nIt was shortly after that car ride that Beers had built a prototype running shoe that would auto-lace and could be manually adjusted by the user pushing a \"tighten\" or \"loosen\" button.\n\"I would make the laces tighter when I was running up hills and loosen them going down hills, and I noticed I was able to provide the changing support I needed while keeping pace,\" Beers said. \"It made us realize how this could help athletes -- guys who tie their shoe tight to start a game, but need adjustments as their feet swell as they play.\"\nEventually, Beers reasoned, a shoe would be built that would automatically make these types of adjustments. But with the first shoe, it was important to give the consumer the option of manual adjustment.\nThere was a new focus on practicality. Sure, the Nike MAG had been implemented and was a functioning shoe, but there were only 89 pairs in the marketplace and no one was wearing them every day.\nWith a self-contained auto-lacing shoe that could be worn on an everyday basis, battery life became a greater focus, as did the sound of the motors.?\n\"The initial prototype we had with working motors sounded like a cat getting hit with a chainsaw,\" Beers said. \"No one wants to hear that every day.\"\nBeers said the sense was that the consumer didn't want to have the inconvenience of always charging the battery. So Nike built one that would last for a week if a person wore it every day and constantly adjusted it. With normal use, it can easily last two weeks without going on the magnetic pucks Nike provides that stick to the shoe soles. Outside chargers also work, so a Mophie charge could keep the shoe functioning for months.\nIn March 2016, Nike announced the concept, the HyperAdapt 1.0, with E.A.R.L., which stands for Electro Reactive Adaptive Laces. The abbreviation, which is on the shoe's tongue, comes from Hatfield's love of robotic life -- further evident in his admiration of the 2008 Pixar movie WALL-E.?\nAs Nike announced the innovation near New York City's Madison Square Garden that day, no shoes had been made for the market. It meant that the first offering was going to be limited, but it was also going to be special. Whatever happened, it had to go right.\nPreparing for the future Soon after the announcement, a team went to Nike's Development Center in Taiwan to figure out how to build the shoes step-by-step. Once determined, the process was moved to Vietnam, where the actual production began.\nNike does not openly talk about its pricing and margins, but ultimately the $720 price point was agreed upon -- an outrageous sum, but nothing out of the ordinary to sneakerhead collectors who frequently spend that amount on a pair of shoes on the resale market.\nKnowing it is changing convention, Nike wants to make sure everything goes right. That means for the first time in the company's history, Nike is creating a special hotline for registered owners of the HyperAdapt 1.0 to call in with questions at any time. Beers said it's set up so that she eventually gets all the feedback in written form.\nOn the bottom of the shoe, where the charger indicator goes (it changes from green to yellow to red), is printed \"MT2,\" which stands for Mark (Parker), Tinker and Tiffany . It's a nice tribute to those who have worked for so long on this project.?\nFor Hatfield, the bigger tribute might be a longer lasting legacy.\n\"I'm closer to the end of my career than the beginning, and I want to go out with a bang,\" said Hatfield, who started at Nike in 1981 and started designing shoes in 1985. \"I think this is going to become a big deal. I think in the future, shoes are going to do the work for you. They're going to adapt to your feet, they're going to adjust, they're going to have smart technology -- just like cars and vacuum cleaners.\n\"I think in 10 years, 50 percent of all Nike shoes will be power laces.\"\nSounds crazy. But that's not the first time Hatfield has been called crazy. One of the reasons the shoe is coming out Thursday is because Hatfield -- and Nike -- didn't listen to those people.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \"\nThe story behind Nike's self-lacing, 'Back to the Future'-inspired shoes \"\nMike Zimmer has emergency eye surgery, won't coach Thursday \"\nTilman Fertitta calls Big 12's expansion vetting process 'a sham' \"\nLeBron James chosen Sportsperson of Year by Sports Illustrated Pirates active in search of Andrew McCutchen trade Are Warriors the best offense the NBA has ever seen? \"\nESPN's NFL MVP Poll: Derek Carr takes top spot \"\nUnlike a year ago, Tiger Woods has reason for optimism \"\nTiger Woods on pro-am round: 'Felt good with pretty much everything' Seahawks' Richard Sherman: Refs don't even know rules half the time \"\nArmed Man in Custody After Hostage Situation at Florida Bank \"\nDeadly Twisters Confirmed in South, 2 States Assess Damages \"\n7 Dead, at Least 53 Injured in Tennessee Wildfire \"\nSuspect Dead After Police Standoff in Tacoma Lawyers: Trump Has to Sell DC Hotel Before Taking Office \"\nBuzz Aldrin Medically Evacuated From South Pole After 'Condition Deteriorated'",

      "text": "It's go time for one of Nike's most innovative sneakers ever and time to say goodbye to tripping over your shoelaces. Nike first showed off its Hyperadapt sneakers in March. The sneakers feature what Nike calls \"adaptive lacing\" technology, which can automatically tweak the snugness of the shoe. There are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen the laces. They obviously have to be charged, which is done via a wireless charging puck. A blue light on the sole of the shoe indicates a full charge, a yellow light warns a user the battery is dying and red is basically panic mode for sneakerheads. Slowing sales growth for Nike has been fueled by sluggish demand for its basketball sneakers in the face of greater competition from the Under Armour Stephen Curry basketball brand and new fashion offerings from Adidas Video provided by TheStreet",

      "text": "Fashion 2 hours ago \nAfter a decade of development and a reveal back in March , Nike’s first-ever self-lacing sneakers made for general release, the HyperAdapt 1.0, hit the mass market today. Sort of. \nIt’s the first time the average consumer will be able to walk into a Nike store and buy sneakers with Nike’s innovative battery-powered lacing engine, though for now, Nike says the shoes will only be available at two of its New York stores: the experiential new flagship in Soho, and the Nike+ Clubhouse a few blocks away. Later this month the sneaker will also go on sale through the Nike+ app and select Nike stores in the US. The HyperAdapt also carries a very sizable pricetag of $720, keeping them out of reach of many shoppers. \nGiven that limited availability, their sales won’t move the needle for the world’s biggest sportswear company, which sold about 400 million pairs of sneakers last year, but that’s not entirely the point. The release of the HyperAdapt 1.0 is a milestone for Nike, and a signpost of where the company sees its future and the future of sport. The future is high-tech \nNike didn’t spend years working on this technology so that only a handful of people could ever buy it. The company has made clear that it believes this can be a mainstream product, and one that athletes will want. Nike’s ultimate vision is a sneaker that can tighten or loosen automatically in response to the changes an athlete’s foot experiences during a race or a game. That isn’t yet the case with the HyperAdapt—note the “1.0” designation—but for now it lets the wearer make those changes quickly, without having to manually retie laces. \n“It’s a platform, something that helps envision a world in which product changes as the athlete changes,” Tiffany Beers, the lead engineer on the project, said via the press release for the initial announcement of the HyperAdapt. \nWhether that benefit is worth the heavy premium Nike is charging is questionable. The price—and probably the weight of the sneaker, which has a mechanical engine and battery embedded in it—will have to come down. (Along with the sneakers, you also get the equipment needed to charge it.) A screen capture from a Nike video showing the HyperAdapt and what comes with it. (Nike) \nBut much of Nike’s brand value lies in its ability to innovate. Technology is rapidly advancing, and the HyperAdapt, like Nike’s 2012 release of its Flyknit sneakers , which are machine-woven out of durable polyester yarns rather than sewn together like traditional sneakers, shows Nike looking to create products that put new tech to use so that their next big sneaker is more than an update of what came before. It will likely keep incorporating more technology, and in fact just applied for patents on an energy-harvesting device and an augmented-reality system. (The HyperAdapt, incidentally, only became possible because batteries and motors have continued to shrink, finally becoming small enough that they could be used in a sneaker). Direct-to-consumer sales are key \nIt’s notable that Nike is releasing the HyperAdapt exclusively through its stores, and at least for the time being, not through retailers such as Foot Locker. Much like its big new Soho store, it’s another step toward Nike getting customers to buy directly (paywall) through its own channels, which provide better margins and let it fully control the way its products are presented and sold. \nNike even recently made a change in the way it reports futures orders —a tally of goods it has committed to deliver to retailers in the next six months—which investors have long looked to as an indicator of the company’s health. Some saw it as a red flag that Nike might be trying to conceal bad news, but Nike says the growth of its direct-to-consumer sales, which now make up 22% of its sales and counting, mean futures no longer offer a full picture of its business. Prices may be rising \nThe price of $720 is far in excess of what most sneakers cost, and many consumers just won’t pay that. But it does help Nike solidify its status as a premium brand , which helps it to charge more for its products generally. \nAs Yahoo reported , after the HyperAdapt was announced in March an equity analyst at Brean Capital wrote in a note to investors that innovative product releases like the HyperAdapt enhance Nike’s credibility and help “to support average sales prices.” \nIt’s an important point at the moment. Like other parts of retail these days, sneaker shoppers tend to be willing to shell out money for high-end goods, or otherwise seek out the cheapest option for basic products. Nike has already placed itself on the high end of this spectrum. The HyperAdapt suggests they aren’t changing course, and that for their most innovative products they will be asking high prices. (Not that it has factored into Nike’s calculus, but US president-elect Donald Trump’s proposed policies would likely raise prices of Nike sneakers for US shoppers, too, so inflating price tags may be in Nike’s future whether it wants them or not.)

      "title": "Adidas, Nike, Jordan or Puma: What Brand Is Your Choice?",
      "text": "15 hours 43 minutes ago 8 View Comments Adidas, Nike, Jordan or Puma \nThe world of sports is naturally very competitive, but lately we’ve been witnessing a different kind of competition – the one between sports brands \nAdidas, Nike, and Puma are the three leaders of the sportswear and footwear market, and with each brand having its own history, advantages and disadvantages, and signature style, making the choice of the best one quite a difficult task. So, which brand lands on top? \nAdidas \nAdidas is one of the oldest one among iconic sports brands, with the first pair of shoes being produced by Adidas long before the Second World War. Since then, Adidas has continued to move forward, and despite different setbacks, legal and financial problems, and the occasional crisis of creativity, the brand has become the trendsetter of the sportswear industry. \nOne of the things that helped Adidas remain popular and successful was their habit of collaborating with the biggest stars of the moment. The history of Adidas is full of renowned footwear models created together with various celebrities, from the All Star sneakers of the 1980s to the Adidas Yeezy Boost of 2016. Recently, Adidas has once again reinvented their philosophy and has masterfully blended athletics and lifestyle, which is something no other brand has managed to achieve. Adidas fans happily wear their sports clothes and shoes in everyday life. \nNike \nNike is an all-American company that is significantly younger than Adidas, but the age difference didn’t prevent Nike from becoming the most financially successful sportswear brand to date. Nike’s strategy over the years heavily relied on endorsements from the top sports stars, and one of the most famous Nike footwear models, the Air Jordan, was created together with Michael Jordan, the most famous basketball player in the history. \nNike’s journey to success wasn’t completely spotless: in fact, the brand has been involved in a number of controversies over the year, most importantly, regarding their sweatshops and use of child labour. Nike has managed to leave the controversies behind, remaining the best selling athletic brand. Today Nike releases one memorable collection after another, so you will never have to look too hard for your new favourite Nike sneakers, gym clothes, or trendy sports accessories. \nPuma \nPuma is another athletic brand that comes from Germany and was created by the brother of Adidas founder. If you look at Puma’s variety of clothes and footwear for sale, you will see that while sneakers and other sports shoes make up a large part of Puma’s range, their true power is the athletic wear, which includes much more than basic gym clothes. Their wide range of styles, as well as the versatility of Puma’s clothing and shoes lines, made the brand as popular as it is nowadays. \nLike most renowned sports brands, Puma owes much of its success to collaborations with famous people. However, unlike Adidas and Nike, Puma mainly focuses on signing deals with sports celebrities and whole sports teams. Still, occasionally Puma releases collections like Puma x Fenty, created together with Rihanna. Puma is especially popular among the youth thanks to being a trendsetter among the athletic brands of the world.",

      "title": "The Secret to Why Pharrell, KAWS & UNDERCOVER Work with Uniqlo Despite It Being a Retail Chain",
      "text": "\n“Just Do It,” the three words that changed Nike’s brand direction forever. The mastermind behind perhaps the most powerful slogan in history is the same man that is now overseeing the creative operations at Uniqlo’s parent company. As Fast Retailing’s president of global creative, John C Jay is bringing the same uncompromising realness and creative instincts that helped redefine the Swoosh, but this time on a full-time basis at the Japanese retail giant. What began as a sporadic business partnership in 1997 through Wieden +Kennedy is now turning out to be a match made in heaven; one that is pushing the boundaries of what a retail giant is and should be capable of. Just before the turn of the century, the company’s ambitious mission of bringing the highest possible quality to the greatest number of people was starting to catch on at home in Japan but only in recent years have people abroad began to understand and embrace the company’s ethos, a trend that has only been accelerated by Mr. Jay’s arrival. \nWith over 1,300 stores across 15 countries now, it’s safe to say that founder Tadashi Yanai’s global vision is closer to becoming a reality and though his relentless pursuit of perfection will likely only draw more customers through its doors, Uniqlo’s strengths shouldn’t solely be based on being able to churn out premium quality clothing at an affordable price point. The company’s ability to stay connected with some of the most influential individuals pertaining to our culture is perhaps a greater accomplishment given the creative community’s hesitancy to, for lack of a better word, “sell out.” No other giant retailer even comes close to matching Uniqlo’s ever-growing list of collaborators which already includes KAWS , NIGO , Pharrell , UNDERCOVER, and the late Jean-Michel Basquiat’s estate. Why is it that those from niche circles and subcultures want to associate themselves with a mass producer of clothing? The answer is quite simple: real relationships and mutual respect. \nJohn is a massive preacher of both. As a creative person first, and business person second, he understands the importance of bringing an artist's authenticity to the table but also how to elevate their game to a much bigger platform. To gain a better understanding of how the company was looking to redefine the global retail landscape, we attended the launch of Uniqlo's new LifeWear campaign in Tokyo. After being treated to a remarkable presentation of the latest products, we were given the opportunity to pick the brain of the company's creative driving force himself. Read below to see what John had to say on Uniqlo's rapid global expansion, cultural relevancy and much more below.\n\nCould you briefly outline your journey to Uniqlo ? \nWhat’s so interesting about me being here now is that I met Mr. Yanai in 1997 or 1998. There were no stores in Tokyo and I was flying two hours every Monday to go to Yamaguchi prefecture to visit him. I was very fortunate to be one of the creators of their first brand campaign called the “Fleece Campaign,” which was so important to the history of this brand. I opened the Wieden +Kennedy office in Tokyo and I was extremely disappointed to find out that a lot of the Western-owned creative agencies really didn’t have Japanese clients. They were basically here to deal with international global clients. I just felt that was kind of being disrespectful, it wasn’t being a very good citizen of the country. At that point, I didn’t know Mr. Yanai , I wasn't familiar with Uniqlo . Over time we started discussing things and he even flew over to Portland, Oregon to check out what this Wieden +Kennedy thing was, and lo and behold he became my very first client in Japan in 1998. Fast forward to 18 months ago, who would’ve guessed I would be sitting in my sofa here and working with Mr. Yanai again, this time on his terms. I work for him now.\nHow has Uniqlo’s approach to marketing changed since the first campaign you worked on together? \nI think all brands evolve. First we were trying to tell Japan what’s unique about this company, which is its ethos of democracy. It’s not just about the clothing but it’s also about how the company works. However from a clothing standpoint, at that time, casual apparel was still not universally accepted by all ages and all demographics. It was cargos, chinos and all of that was still for young people. Mr. Yanai was asking, “Why is it only for young people? All people should enjoy this.” The democracy for clothing was a strong part. How did we express that? We shared it viscerally on TV. The common wisdom here is that 15-second spots are more economical. You can do your sales promotion and message, and because it’s only half, you can run it twice. That’s flawed logic to me. What Mr. Yanai did was to give me the freedom to give everyday people with the same values 30 seconds of air time to talk about their life. That [commercial] was huge risk-taking. Maybe Mr. Yanai didn’t know that at that time but he’s a very smart man and he’s been a risk-taker all along. I would say even today the most recent campaign on LifeWear is daring to be intelligent or thoughtful on TV. I think this company always bets big, which isn’t always very Japanese.\nYou cannot comprise on authenticity \nHow was Uniqlo able to expand at such an exponential rate over the past five years? \nIt happened before we even had a word for it. And that’s LifeWear . The principles of what we make always existed, we just didn’t have that name for it. In the early days we would use words like “Made for all,” which is true, and it’s one of the foundations of LifeWear , but it didn’t truly or fully express what LifeWear was. When you think about LifeWear it’s about respecting everyone. We don’t start by trying to get to the influencers and hope that it will trickle down to the common folk of the masses. We start by respecting everyone. The early commercials were radical because they respected the consumer number one, they didn’t talk down to the consumer. That sense of respect for the consumer was very important. The other thing is that we are working with something that we didn’t invent called casual clothing. Casual clothing was invented in the West, in America for the most part. We’ve added our Japanese DNA to it, our spin. It’s not about who does it first, it’s about who does it best. So that principle follows in every country we go. Part of the LifeWear success is that the innovation and constant improvement, which is very Japanese, that we’re striving for also includes the price. Sometimes the innovation is very obvious, but sometimes the innovation is in the sourcing, the manufacturing, and therefore we can lower the price on cashmere so that we can get closer to our goal: to bring the highest possible quality to the greatest number of people in the world. That’s why it’s been successful. We’re not done yet, we’ve got a long ways to go. Our product has to keep improving and it’s a never-ending game to stay relevant.\nMore and more fast fashion retailers are bringing forth specialized lines to the market. Is this something that you foresee continuing in the future? \nJapan has been on the forefront of technology and textiles. They were the first to use synthetics and high-technology and fabrication in fashion. Technology and textiles are a core strength of this country. The technology [for our Heat Tech and Airism lines] is very important but we don’t want it for a select few, we want it for everyone.\nJapanese goods have always been viewed as somewhat artisanal and difficult to get, also due to the sheer distance. How did Uniqlo manage to break down that perception and showcase it in a manner that it was accessible for everybody? \nThe artisanal part and the craftsmanship is directly related to our quality of our goods. We’re uncompromising of the quality even if we’re trying to lower the price. Artisanal also sometimes means select-shop, a bit intellectual, a bit removed. That’s not us. We don’t exclude, we proudly accept people. It is against our ways to exclude so we try to make things that appeal to everyone, including to those people who love select shops and including to people who are minimalist and highly sophisticated. I think style is not our enemy here, it’s fashion with a capital “F,” that elusive elitism, that purposely takes joy in exclusion. That’s not us.\n\nThe company focuses \"not only on campaigns, but connections.\" How has Uniqlo managed to attract some of the most influential individuals within our culture, while also maintaining a grassroots presence at the same time? \nIn a couple of ways. We work very hard to collaborate with local artists and crafts people. We dig deep into each city before we concept ideas. Before you put pen to paper and start thinking about ideas in terms of campaigns, just learn. Just get in there and be humble. What’s unique about this place? Where is the heart? Where is the brain? What makes this place tick and who are the people making it tick? We purposely seek to work with artists from subcultures. To a certain extent we apply the same technique to our bigger collaborations. When I first met Mr. Yanai after it became official we were going to work together, I came with a typical ad agency question about target audience. “Who’s our target audience?” I asked. He said “Oh, that’s easy. It’s everybody.” I went home and had a nervous breakdown. That’s what attracts KAWS , that’s what attracts NIGO , that’s what attracts everybody. They want the ability to touch and effect everyone. Not to those who are already converted, that’s easy. But to spread their creative concept or artwork have an affect on everyone. What creative person doesn’t want to do that? That’s the secret sauce that’s not so secret anymore.\nThe company connects with the general consumer, athletes, as well as creative types. Having established a diverse reach already, how else are you looking to expand your audience base? \nContinuing to make better products. For example for Uniqlo Sport, our starting point is very big. We start with a huge closet because we’re already relevant to all of these different people. We didn’t start a typical way of an athlete, we started with everyone so we can draw from a very big well on how to create a new kind of active line that isn’t born simply out of straight sports. There are many areas like that. One of my favorite areas is the home area. It doesn’t sound like a very innovative category but the clothes that people used to wear to just lay around the house weren’t all that stylish or designed with high quality. Suddenly we are improving life by catering to the time that you spend alone, where no one sees you perhaps, a margin perhaps ignored by other brands. We have to keep in tune with that and how lives are changing. There is no shortage of innovation that we still need to do.\nYou choose those partners and they choose you because they know you’re going to respect who they are and what they do \nUniqlo , despite its size, has managed to balance collaborations both mainstream and niche. How do you ensure that you can maintain a middle ground with each output? \nYou cannot comprise on authenticity. You choose those partners and they choose you because they know you’re going to respect who they are and what they do. We’re not here to change anyone. We are able to open up a bigger world and maybe give them a better opportunity. As a creative person I’m always thinking, “What can I do to help that perhaps no one else can?” “What do I have that I could bring to the table to advance their art and creativity?” In my past when I worked with a lot of graffiti artists and street artists they would say, “John, my paintings appear two-dimensionally on the wall. I sure would love to see them move through time and space one day.” That’s what I did. I’m not here to change you into something I need, I’m here to help you elevate your game. That’s how I work. It’s about authenticity and preserving that trust that you will absolutely respect them in who they are and what they do.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

Maybe I’m just biased towards the colorway, but, this should be sought after.\n\nThe post The Nike KD 9 Sauce Debuts In A Few Days appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

Here’s a first look at the hybrid Nike Benassi SLP.\nThe Nike Benassi SLP is essentially a sneaker version of the Benassi slide. It comes in a slip-on construction to make it easier to slip on, just like the sandal. It still has the strap, it just not comes with much more material added to the upper. It’s made out suede (overlays) and mesh (bootie). It also comes with an extended heel. Above you will find three different colorways to choose from, Dark Mushroom, Cargo Khaki and Wolf Grey options. No word yet on when these arrive stateside, but you find them at select international retailers today.\nvia: atmos \nAuthor’s Take I have a couple pairs of the Benassi slide, but these, I don’t know man.

Competitor Performance Is Eating Nike’s Lunch Despite the headwinds and competition, Nike still has wind in its sails December 02, 2016 | About: NKE +0% UA +0% XTER:ADS +0% \nNike’s ( NYSE:NKE ) shares are now trading very close to its 52-week low of $49.01. Considering the direction in which Nike’s sales and future orders have gone in North America, it is clear the stock may continue the downward trend that started in November last year. Nike has lost more than 22% of its valuation since then, but recovery seems to elude the world’s largest sports footwear maker as competitors keep nipping at its heels. \nNike has now missed future orders estimates more than three times in a row. Future orders is a key metric that shows the demand for a product in the market. It counts the number of orders the company received from buyers in advance of actual consignments being shipped out. \nTo make matters worse, Nike has now stopped issuing future orders numbers, leading investors to believe that something is going on behind the scenes. \n“ The move to stop issuing future orders seems 'very suspect' at a time when North America and other markets have slowed down.” - Reuters Peter Lynch Chart of NKE \nMake no mistake, Nike is still on the growth path. Revenues have grown from $23.33 billion in 2012 to $32.38 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Nike posted 8% sales growth and 10% growth on a currency-neutral basis. But the biggest threat to Nike’s growth perception is the growth of of its competitors. Under Armour ( NYSE:UA ) has been getting bigger and bigger every year and Adidas ( XTER:ADS ) has done extremely well in 2016, increasing competition and eating away at Nike's market share. \n\"Adidas brand continued its robust momentum with revenues up 20 percent on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by double-digit sales increases in the Sport Performance, Adidas Originals and Adidas Neo lines. The brand marked double-digit growth in every geography, with the exception of the Russia/CIS zone, where revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, the company said.\" - Footwear News \nIn the first nine months of the current fiscal year, Adidas posted 15% growth in revenues, from 12.748 million euros ($13.6 million) last year to 14.604 billion euros this year, while Nike’s revenues grew 8%, 6% and 8% in the last three quarters. On a comparative basis, Adidas was way ahead of Nike, which has exerted a lot of pressure on Nike’s stock. \nThough the slowdown in future order numbers is indeed cause for concern, Nike is visibly still on the growth track. Considering the size and scale of the company, it will be difficult for its competitors to dislodge it from the top spot. But competition has indeed intensified. A growth rate of less than 10% is definitely not going to make investors happy when the company has openly set an ambitious goal of reaching $50 billion in sales by 2020, which requires the company to hit double-digit growth rates quarter after quarter. \nAlthough most of the apparent sluggishness in sales growth can be attributed to negative currency impact, Nike must fight against the tide and address the near-term Adidas threat, as well as the impending threat from Under Armour. Things have become a bit tight due to the performance of the competition, but investors must realize that Nike did not get to the top of the footwear market and stay there without facing competition. If the stock breaks its 52-week low, it will be a great time to add this company to your portfolio because it will stay at the top of the footwear market for many years to come. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Cromwell senior Kristian Sapp is 5 feet 9 and 165 pounds.\nWearing a Nike jacket and black Adidas athletic pants before football practice Thursday, Sapp could just as easily be confused for a runner on the school's track team. But for the last four years as a running back, he's been a symbol of determination for the co-op of Cromwell and Portland.\n\"I hear 'you're tiny' and 'you're small,' but it just gives me a boost,\" Sapp said. \"You can say all you want, but it is how you play. The past four years I've been very hungry to get my hands on the ball and get into the end zone.\"\nSapp and his teammates will play the role of underdogs again on Monday when they travel to face second-seeded Ansonia in the Class S semifinals with a chance to play for a state title on the line.\nIn the Class S quarterfinals against third-seeded Bloomfield, the sixth-seeded Panthers (10-1) snapped the Warhawks' 23-game win streak with a 28-14 victory. On Monday, they'll try to pull off another upset and deny the Chargers a trip to their 30th state final. Ansonia defeated Stafford/East Windsor/Somers team, 48-0, in their quarterfinal. The game starts at 6:30 p.m. at Jarvis Stadium in Ansonia.\nKristian Sapp On What Cromwell Needs To Do Vs. Ansonia Cromwell/Portland senior running back Kristian Sapp discussing what his team needs to do in the Class S semifinal to have success against Ansonia.\nCromwell/Portland senior running back Kristian Sapp discussing what his team needs to do in the Class S semifinal to have success against Ansonia.\nSee more videos \"I think we've shown that it doesn't matter how big the offensive line or defensive line is going to be because Bloomfield was much bigger than us,\" Cromwell coach Chris Eckert said. \"Our guys are going to battle. Our guys are going to fight.\"\nAnsonia (11-0) is looking to win the program's 20th title since 1976. Cromwell, which added Portland last season to become a co-op, is looking to make its fifth final and first since 2011.\nThe underdog title is nothing new for the team, which plays in the Pequot Conference and has been undersized and undermanned for the last few years.\n\"I think the height and weight disadvantage is something these guys battle every single year and every single game,\" Eckert said. \"It just seems like we're smaller than everybody else. I don't know what is in the water in Cromwell. But we're just smaller, but the old saying back in the day is: it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog. And these guys are ferocious.\"\nSapp, a cousin of NFL Hall of Famer Warren Sapp, has never let his small frame keep him out of the end zone. Since freshman year, he's used his size to his advantage, cutting inside defenses and keeping them constantly on their heels.\n\"To me it seems like he breaks so many arm tackles. He runs through the first guy there to make the tackle,\" Eckert said. \"He's got great vision, he's got exceptional speed through the line of scrimmage and he kind of sees the next cut before it happens.\"\nSapp, who is below average in size for a No. 1 back compared to other top running backs in the state, has run for 2,037 yards and 29 touchdowns. He's averaging 10.8 yards a carry.\nIn the quarterfinal Tuesday, Sapp ran for 265 yards and three touchdowns, including a 67-yard score to send his team onto the semifinals.\n\"The one thing you need to know about [Sapp] is that he comes out and he comes out to play,\" senior Ethan Roy said. \"When he comes out on that field, it is just football. It is just business. He will run his hardest there. He will be focused there. That's his home.\"\nSapp has gotten inspiration from his family. His grandmother, Sheila Sapp, died in 2013 from colon cancer when he was 13. He's also gotten advice from his cousin, the former defensive tackle for Tampa Bay and Oakland, who won Super Bowl with the Buccaneers in 2002. At a family reunion in Florida before Sapp's freshman year, the older Sapp implored him to work hard in the offseason. And he has.\nSapp has learned to be elusive, too. He estimated on Thursday that the average high school running back is 5-11 and 20 pounds heavier.\n\"I use my size with my cuts, I can cut in and make better cuts,\" he said. \"Following my blockers, I can follow them easier than a thicker running back.\"\nHis teammates have mastered similiar skills. They've also been well-conditioned and follow the old adage in football: the low man wins.\n\"We just have to fight a little harder,\" senior Jon Siena said. \"Every kid that is bigger than us will just think they're going to run us over, but like coach says 'hit them low.'\"\nWhen Sapp isn't working a defense side-to-side and giving them headaches, the team is able to utilize the rest of its options, including Siena and Alex Hinkle, who have combined to run for 823 yards and eight touchdowns. Junior Kittrell Lauray also has 304 yards rushing and four touchdowns.\n\"We say: 'You're bigger than us, but can you fight harder than us?'\" Roy said.\nIn the quarterfinal, the Panthers started quarterback Liam Coleman. It was his second start of the season. He'll start against Ansonia, too.\n\"What it shows is that it is an 11-man offense,\" Eckert said. \"We've got other dudes around him.\"\nColeman hasn't been the only player to step into a new role this year. The team has constantly shuffled their line-up. But the team has responded every time Eckert and his coaching has asked for something new or different.\n\"I just want us to be remembered as the team that doesn't give up even though we have a lot of doubters,\" Sapp said.\nCaption High School Football Semifinal Preview With a rainy round of quarterfinals behind us, we look ahead to Monday's high school football semifinals, which will feature several area contenders.\nWith a rainy round of quarterfinals behind us, we look ahead to Monday's high school football semifinals, which will feature several area contenders.\nCaption High School Football Semifinal Preview With a rainy round of quarterfinals behind us, we look ahead to Monday's high school football semifinals, which will feature several area contenders.\nWith a rainy round of quarterfinals behind us, we look ahead to Monday's high school football semifinals, which will feature several area contenders.\nCaption SMSA Senior Using Rugby To Give Back Kaylea Mazzamurro is a senior at SMSA who is doing her senior project by organizing a wheelchair rugby tournament for Gaylord Hospital athletes and others at SMSA this weekend.

      "text": "Adidas \nSports retail is descending on Manhattan like never before. Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour are showing just how important the Big Apple is to their business, opening stores and inking deals for unprecedented amounts of retail space.\nOn Thursday Adidas opened its new 45,000-square-foot global flagship store near Times Square in New York City . It is now the company's biggest store in the world, and it was greeted with fanfare and lines out the door. Adidas already maintains a boutique-style store for the Originals lifestyle collection in Soho, and a larger store focused on performance just north of that. \nSimilarly, on November 17, Nike pulled the sheet off its new 55,000-square-foot tech-fueled store down in Soho , likely one of the largest stores by square footage in that neighborhood. The company also has outposts like the gigantic 95,000-square-foot Niketown near 5th Avenue and 57th Street, and a few much smaller Nike Running stores — one on the Upper East Side near 67th Street and another in Flatiron closer to 20th Street. Rounding out the portfolio is the Nikelab, which has a boutique-like feel.\nCiting unnamed sources, the New York Post reported  that the swoosh also inked a lease on 5th Avenue just a few blocks from Niketown, which would add another 70,000 square feet of retail space.\nAdidas \nFor its part, Under Armour inked a lease earlier this year for the 53,000-square-foot store formerly occupied by FAO Schwartz on 5th Avenue and 58th Street, right near Apple's famous cube store. It is projected to open in 2018. Under Armour also has two other stores in Manhattan (called Brand Houses): one in Soho, and the other in the new Westfield World Trade Center mall.\nAn increasing emphasis by retailers on bypassing third-party retail stores and going direct to consumer is likely a big motivation behind the big retail push this year. The company-owned stores give the brands a chance to interact with customers one-on-one, have more direct messaging with the consumer, and increase profit margins.\n\"We see experiences as super important,\" Heidi O'Neil, Nike's head of direct-to-consumer business, told Business Insider in reference to the new Soho store's tech-enabled areas, where shoppers can test out performance sneakers. \"They embody the brand.\"\nAdidas \nNew York specifically makes sense as the go-to battleground, as it is by far the most important regional market in North America. 25% of the Nike basketball sneakers sold in the US are bought in the New York area, according to retail analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group . Trends often start in New York before they go elsewhere. As the old saying goes, \"If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.\"\nIt's also a hot spot for destination shopping for both international and domestic tourists.\nThe third-party sports retailer industry is also shrinking, as  City Sports went bankrupt in 2015 and Sports Authority liquidated in 2016 . This means it's more important than ever for sportswear makers to go directly to consumers.\nNOW WATCH: Cristiano Ronaldo just signed a lifetime deal with Nike reportedly worth $1 billion — here's how he makes and spends his money \n",

The LunarCharge combines elements of Nike classics, including the Air Flow, Air Current, Air Max 90 and Air Presto, with the modern midsole and outsole of the LunarEpic Flyknit for a new silhouette engineered for unmatched comfort. The new color options include Light Bone, Iced Lilac, Triple Black, Medium Olive, and Violet Dust. There will be two different versions releasing, a premium for $140 and an Essential for $110. Which will you be going after? Take a look at the official images above and let us know.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I was already a fan of the silhouette and I’m hoping to get my hands on at least one pair.

      "text": "Tomorrow we’ll see the release of the Nike KD 9 in the “The Sauce” colorway inspired by the holiday season. But looking even further ahead, here is a first glimpse at another pair of KD 9 s that is expected to hit retailers sooner rather than later.\nCovered in Cargo Green throughout the majority of the Flyknit upper, this colorway of the KD 9 is then given some Fall lifestyle vibes courtesy of Olive detailing on the Swoosh and midsole. Multicolor laces wrap things up on this KD that does not have a name or story behind the colorway just yet. Stay tuned to Kicks On Fire for more images and release updates.\nvia: Eastbay\nAuthor’s Take If the entire shoe was done in olive I think more people would have liked it. We all know how popular olive is at this time of the year.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6MC-qorrGU&feature=youtu.be\nThe post Olive Accents Land On The Nike KD 9 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "More \nBy KIM GAMEL | STARS AND STRIPES Published: December 5, 2016 SEOUL, South Korea — The U.S. ambassador’s plea on social media for help finding a missing cat has generated a furry furor in South Korea’s media, which has taken up the effort to find the feline. Ambassador Mark Lippert posted a picture of a cat named Nike on Facebook and Twitter, saying it had befriended his dog Grigsby and needs to be safely returned. The owners are offering a million won (about $855) reward for the cat, which went missing on Yongsan Garrison several weeks ago. “Grigsby’s favorite US Embassy cat friend is missing!” the post says. “Please find Nike and return Grigsby’s best cat friend to him!” South Korean media and online communities quickly took up the cause, publishing numerous stories and pictures of the flier. The 15-year-old cat disappeared Oct. 23 from a residence on the embassy compound at Yongsan. Lippert decided to take the case public this week after other efforts to find the cat failed. David Gossack, who owns the cat, said Nike is originally from Bangkok, and South Korea is the fourth country in which he’s lived. “We have been looking extensively [at Yongsan] and in surrounding neighborhoods but have not found him yet,” he said in an email. “People on base have been terrific in keeping their eyes open for Nike and helping the search.” The fliers describe Nike as a white shorthair cat with blue eyes and grey markings on his face, ears and tail. Broadcast network YTN reported that someone had posted photos of a cat that looked like Nike and got along with dogs, but there was no confirmation about the spotting. Gossack said they were trying to contact the person who posted them. Anyone with information about Nike’s whereabouts can contact Gossack at 010-9153-1873 or Angela at 010-4084-1953 or email nikeyongsan@gmail.com. Stars and Stripes staffer Yoo Kyong Chang contributed to this report. Mark Lippert, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has issued a plea on social media for help finding Nike, a cat that went missing at Yongsan Garrison several weeks ago.

      "text": "For the retro basketball enthusiast looking to add something fresh to their collection, Nike has you covered. The athletic brand has a pair of basketball classics scheduled to release stateside — with a third releasing abroad — executed in a simple black and white color palette.\nThe Nike Air Max Uptempo and the Nike Air Max Uptempo 97 from the brand’s “Black Pack” arrive tomorrow in the U.S. via SNKRS with retail prices of $150 and $160, respectively. Also spotted on the websites of several European retailers — as well as the European SNKRS feed — is the Nike Air Max2 Uptempo from the “Black Pack,” which will retail for €140 ($150.88 at today’s conversion rate.)

All three looks from the collection boast top-notch materials to offer a premium look, and feature black uppers paired with a white midsole and outsole.\nNike Air Max Uptempo 97 “Black Pack.” Courtesy of Nike.

The Air Max Uptempo — which debuted in 1995 — was the first basketball model from the brand to feature a full-length visible Air unit. Two years later, Nike delivered the Air Max Uptempo 97, which featured the most Air cushioning for a basketball shoe at the time of its release. And the Air Max2 Uptempo, according to Nike, was one of the first basketball models to use the brand’s Air Max2 technology, which allows for varying levels of air pressure in each Air unit.\nNike Air Max2 Uptempo “Black Pack.” Courtesy of Nike.
