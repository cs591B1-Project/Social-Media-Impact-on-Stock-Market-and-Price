In addition to a tight race for the White House, there are 165 propositions on the ballot in 35 states, affecting more than 200 million people in the US, according to Google . \nSo the web giant on Sunday launched what is apparently the first in a series of doodles intended to remind you that Election Day is almost at hand. While cute, the doodle also links to information about the measures and candidates on your specific ballot, where you can vote and even how to vote in English and Spanish. \nWhen the polls close on Tuesday, Google will integrate real-time US election results into your Google search results in more than 30 languages. \nSo whether you are voting for a specific candidate -- or as W.C. Fields said -- against one, be sure to get out to vote on Tuesday.",

      "text": "Mobile Google’s New Hardware Strategy: Actually Make Money The Pixel phone is the tech giant’s attempt to sell high-end, highly profitable gadgets and monetize its AI investments. by Elizabeth Woyke November 7, 2016 \nTechnology companies like to cite computer scientist Alan Kay’s famous quote that “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.” \nThese days, Google’s motto could be, “People who are really serious about AI should make their own hardware—and sell it at a premium.” \nThat appears to be the strategy behind the Pixel, the first Google-designed smartphone , which was released on October 20 . Prior to the Pixel, Google offered a series of Nexus-branded smartphones that it developed with smartphone makers and sold online, at prices that essentially covered its costs. But while the Nexus phones supported the company’s primary business of online advertising by getting more people to use Google services, the Pixel seems to be geared toward monetizing Google’s AI initiatives, specifically its efforts to build a virtual assistant that will act as a user’s “own personal Google” and provide a consistent experience across an entire line of Google-designed gadgets. Google’s new Pixel phone represents an evolution of the company’s business model. \nThe move prepares Google for a world of conversational interfaces in which consumers will acquire information by speaking to virtual assistants embedded in a range of electronic devices. As such, the Pixel is a test of Google’s technological bets on these interfaces and the AI that powers them, as well as the company’s ability to deeply integrate its services into hardware, create a family of gadgets that will form a complementary ecosystem, and make money off something other than online ads. Its outcome will show whether Google can evolve and continue its domination in search. \nIn the hypercompetitive smartphone market, the only way to reap significant profits is to create a premium phone and sell it at a premium price. So Google selected top-of-the-line parts for the Pixel and is selling the device for $649, the same starting price as Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. (A 5.5-inch version of the Pixel, called the Pixel XL, costs $769, which is the same as the iPhone 7 Plus.) \nThird-party analyses indicate that Google is making a generous margin on the phone. IHS Markit, a London-based market research firm, estimates that the Pixel XL’s material and manufacturing cost is $285.75, based on an examination of its internal components. Chipworks, a division of the technical analysis firm TechInsights, gives an estimate of around $220, but it didn’t include as many components or manufacturing costs in its evaluation as IHS did, according to analyst Dick James. Analysts have estimated the phone's manufacturing cost by opening it up and identifying its internal components. \nThese figures are speculative and don’t reflect major expenses such as R&D, patent licensing, and marketing. But they are the most accurate data available in the absence of official information from Google. And they suggest that the Pixel has a gross profit margin only slightly smaller than that of the iPhone 7, which is the world’s most profitable smartphone (along with the iPhone 7 Plus). \nAnother way to gauge how much Google is making off the Pixel is to compare the phone—and its retail price—to a phone with similar hardware. James, the Chipworks analyst, has identified at least twelve common components between the Pixel XL and the Mi 5s from the Chinese startup Xiaomi , ranging from their Qualcomm processor to their primary camera (a 12 megapixel model from Sony). Yet the international version of the Mi 5s costs $250 less than the Pixel XL. \nThe Pixel's profit margin is a big jump up from what Google made on its Nexus phones and will help the company pursue high-end hardware seriously, which is the only sustainable business model in this tough market, says IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam. Google is differentiating the Pixel with its virtual helper and virtual reality software, which require significant investments in AI and machine learning. \nIndeed, burgeoning consumer interest in virtual assistants and VR is one reason why Google is revamping its smartphone strategy. The maturation of the smartphone industry is another. Microsoft and BlackBerry’s slumping smartphone businesses have pitted Google and Apple against each other for market dominance. As a result, Google believes it needs a single Android phone that can truly take on the iPhone, and matching the Pixel’s price with the iPhone’s is the company’s way of telling consumers the devices are comparable. \nThe other relevant change in the smartphone market is that Samsung is the only company that currently manages to make money selling premium Android phones (in spite of its Galaxy Note 7 debacle ). Several years ago, Google would have hesitated to release a pricy smartphone under its own brand for fear of alienating its many Android partners. But Samsung’s control of the high-end Android phone market has concerned Google for some time and it likely hopes that the Pixel will diminish this dominance. \nSo far, the Pixel is selling more briskly than Google expected . It’s too early to gauge whether it will be a success, but it does show how Google intends to compete in an AI-first world .",

      "text": "Google Play Store Gets Net Banking as a Payment Option in India Google Play apps, movies, music etc. can be purchased via net banking 38 banks are already available on the platform You can set netbanking as the default payment option \nGoogle has started rolling out net banking as a payment option for apps, music, movies, books, etc. on the Google Play marketplace in India. This is the fourth payment method that Google has added for the platform, after credit cards, debit cards, and gift cards. \nThe net banking payment option on Google Play comes soon after Google released a report saying that Indians are among the likeliest groups to pay for digital content and apps. The service is rolling out slowly, and appears to be enabled by a server side update. \nMany of the smartphones we tried this new feature did not have net banking payment option on Google Play. These included smartphones running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Android 7.0 Nougat , while models running on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop had the option. Therefore, it is likely that the new payment feature is being added irrespective of the version of Android or the Google Play app. To see if your Google Play account has net banking as a payment option, slide out the menu from the hamburger icon on the left of the screen, and go to Accounts. Here, choose Payment Methods and tap on the + button at the bottom right. If you have Add Netbanking as an option, click on it and see if your bank is listed. Google has tied up with 38 banks so far to let users pay on Google Play via online banking.\nOnce you select a bank, you can go to any paid app or content listing and make it your default payment option. In order to do so, look for the current default option (as shown in the screenshot below) and tap on the downward arrow icon. This will open up new payment options; just select the bank option you want and then add the net banking details when prompted. The net banking account will be your default payment option then onwards.",

      "text": "How to set up and use Google Home by Jimmy Westenberg 1 minute ago \nThe Amazon Echo has basically been the most popular smart speaker throughout the past couple years, but now there’s finally a new player in town. Google Home is the search giant’s new connected speaker, and it’s taking aim right at the Echo. Powered by the all-new Google Assistant , Google Home can control your lights, answer queries, play music, take notes, and a lot more. \nIf you pre-ordered Google Home from the Google Store, you should be receiving your device any day now. Multiple retailers have put the device up for sale, too, if you’d rather pick one up from a brick-and-mortar store. So if you’ve just received your Google Home and are wondering how to set it up, we’ve got you covered. Here’s our full guide on how to set up and use Google Home. Related: Which apps are supported by Google Home? 4 weeks ago How to set up Google Home \nFirst thing’s first – since Google Home doesn’t have a screen, you’ll need to set up the device using your smartphone. To do so, you’ll need the Google Home app , which you can download from the Google Play Store at the link below. Get it from the Play Store \nOnce you’ve downloaded the app, plug the included power adapter into a power outlet, and plug the other end into the input on the bottom of the speaker. Your Google Home should start booting up and display a colorful array of lights. \nNext, move to your smartphone. Open the Home app, and tap the devices icon on the top-right of your screen. Find the Google Home entry on the Devices screen, then tap Set up , then Continue . \nYour smartphone will now switch to a temporary Wi-Fi network on your Google Home. Once you’re connected, you’ll need to ensure you’re connected to the correct Google Home device. Tap the Play test sound button. If you hear a sound from your Home, tap I heard it . \nNext, we’re going to name your new device. You can choose from a variety of different room options, depending on where you want to keep the device. If you don’t see your room listed or want to use a different name, select Other , then type in your desired name. Once you’ve named your device, tap Continue . \nNow it’s time to connect your Google Home to a Wi-Fi network. Choose the network you’d like, then type in your Wi-Fi password. You can also choose to have the app automatically fill in your Wi-Fi password from your phone rather than typing it in. If you’d like to use the saved network password, tap OK . Once your device has successfully connected to a Wi-Fi network, tap Continue . \nAt this point, the device will automatically download and install an update. \nOnce the update is complete, tap the Sign in button to add a Google account to your Home. On the next screen, select your desired Google account, then tap the blue Continue button. \nOf course, Google Assistant will be much more helpful if it knows your personal information, such as calendar events and flights. If you’d like to give Home access to this information, tap Allow . In order to get more accurate weather, traffic and local business information, you can also enter your address. After entering your address, tap Set location . \nThe next screen will give you the option to receive email notifications about new features, apps, offers and more. If you’d like to receive notifications, toggle the notification button on, then tap Continue . \nAs of right now, Google Assistant only works with a handful of music services which include Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify and Pandora. Tap the music service you’d like to set as your default, then press Continue . \nThe setup process is now complete. Tap Continue , and get ready to learn how to use Google Home. The Google Home Tutorial will give you some examples of voice commands you can use with your new device. If you’d like to continue with the tutorial, tap Continue . If not, tap Skip . \nCongratulations! Your Google Home is now set up. How to use Google Home \nNow that your Google Home is all set up, you’re probably wondering how to use it. The following guides will teach you how to control volume, reboot, factory reset, mute and enable Guest Mode on your Google Home. How to control volume on Google Home \nFun fact: the top panel on Google Home is actually a touch pad. You can use it to increase and decrease volume, play and pause music, and more. \nIf you’re near your Google Home and need to adjust the volume, press your finger down on the top panel, then simply move your finger in a clockwise direction to increase the volume. To decrease the volume, move your finger in a counterclockwise direction. \nAlternatively, you can say “Hey Google, increase volume” or “Hey Google, increase volume to maximum” if you’d like to make the volume louder. Of course, you can also say “Hey Google, decrease volume” or “Hey Google, decrease volume to minimum” if you need to lower the volume. How to mute Google Home \nIf you don’t want your Google Home to make any noise whatsoever, there’s a quick and easy way to mute the device. On the back of the device, you’ll see a microphone button towards the top. Press that once, and you’ll hear your Google Assistant say “microphone off.” This means your Google Home won’t be able to answer any queries, play music, or basically do anything else until you unmute it. \nTo unmute your Google Home, just tap the microphone button again. You’ll then hear Google Assistant say “microphone on.” \nAlternatively, you can say “Hey Google, mute your microphone.” Your Google Home microphone will then be muted, though you’ll need to tap the microphone button to turn it back on again. How to reboot Google Home \nIs your device not working properly? Perhaps a soft reset will do the trick. Here’s how to reboot your Google Home. \nTo reboot your device, open the Google Home app on your smartphone, then tap the Devices button on the top-right of your screen. Find your Google Home device, then tap the overflow menu button (three vertical dots), then choose Reboot . You’ll then be prompted to reboot your Google Home. Tap OK , and your device will reboot. How to factory reset Google Home \nIf you need to factory reset your Google Home, there’s a quick and easy way to do so. You won’t be able to use your voice or Home app to factory reset your device, but the process is very simple. \nWarning: This will clear all data from your Google Home. This process cannot be undone. You will have to set up your Google Home device and relink any previously linked home control smart devices (thermostats, lights, etc) again. \nOn the back of the device, locate the microphone button. Press and hold the button for about 15 seconds. You’ll hear Google Assistant confirm that it’s resetting your device, and you should see a series of lights fill up a circle on the top of the device. Once that circle is filled up, your connected speaker will be reset to factory settings. How to enable Guest Mode on Google Home \nIf you’re hosting a social gathering and want to give others access to your Google Home, there’s an easy way to do so. Enabling Guest Mode on your device lets you keep your password private and allows guests to cast from their Android or iOS devices as long as they’re in the same room as the Home device. \nIf you’d like to enable Guest Mode on your Google Home, just follow these steps: \nOpen your Google Home app, then tap the Devices button on the top-right of your screen. Find your Home device, then tap the overflow menu button (three vertical dots), then choose Settings . Scroll down and select Guest Mode . Turn the Guest Mode toggle on, and the app should generate a four-digit PIN for your device. This is the PIN you’ll share with your guests. \nFrom there, casting to the device as a guest is easy. Just open up any Google Cast-enabled app, then tap the cast icon . Tap Nearby device , then follow the prompts to connect. If you’re having trouble with audio pairing, ask your host for the four-digit PIN. You can find the PIN on the Devices screen of the Google Home app. \nCongrats – you can now use your friend’s Google Home device, even if you’re not on the same Wi-Fi network. \nIf you’re having trouble with any of these steps or have any questions for us, be sure to leave a comment below. We look forward to hearing what you have to say!",

      "text": "It’s been a while since we’ve seen a new Android One smartphone announced. Google had actually removed the Android One section from the official Android website (now the old URL simply redirects to the homepage of Android.com), so many were wondering what the future held for Google’s experimental Android project.\nSome thought that it would be abandoned like we saw with the Google Play Edition phones, while others were holding onto hope that we would see more Android One products launched.\nAndroid One had a goal of letting smartphone OEMs focus solely on the hardware so Google could take full control of the software. To accomplish this though, Google had strict guidelines as to what type of hardware would be allowed in the phone, as well as how much the smartphone OEM could charge for it. Sadly, this vision was not as successful as some had wanted and it forced Google to be more open with their rules and guidelines of the hardware and its pricing.\nGeneral Mobile has just announced the latest Android One smartphone and it is called the GM 5. The device will be available in Gold, Black and Space Gray colors and it will be the first Android One smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 Nougat. The General Mobile GM 5 has a 5″ 720p display with Gorilla Glass 4 protection, a Snapdragon 410 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, microSD card slot, 5MP front-facing camer, a 13MP rear camera, the option of 1 or 2 SIM slots, and a 2,500mAh capacity battery.\nThe General Mobile GM 5 will be marketed for the internal market and will be sold in countries including Azerbaijan, Albania, Afghanistan, Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Iraq, Kenya, Luxembourg, Moldova, Netherlands, Pakistan, Serbia, Tunisia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. Pricing has yet to be revealed, but we will learn more when it is made available for purchase later this month.\nSource: General Mobile \n",

      "text": "A new Android version has arrived, and that means we can start watching paint dry. Per Google’s Platform Versions page, the latest and greatest version of the company’s mobile operating system took more than two months to hit a whopping 0.3 percent adoption.\nGoogle started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices in August . To be fair, the company’s new Pixel phones , which ship with Android 7.1, haven’t been on sale for a month yet. Still, the latest major version of Android typically takes more than a year to become the most-used release, and Nougat’s story will likely be no different.\n\nHere are the changes between October and November:\nAndroid 7.0/7.1 Nougat (August 2016): Up 0.3 points to 0.3 percent Android 6.0 Marshmallow (October 2015): Up 5.3 points to 24.0 percent Android 5.0/5.1 Lollipop (November 2014, March 2015): Down 0.9 points to 34.1 percent Android 4.4 KitKat (October 2013): Down 2.5 points to 25.2 percent Android 4.1/4.2/4.3 Jelly Bean (July 2012, November 2012, and July 2013): Down 1.9 points to 13.7 percent Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (December 2011): Down 0.1 points to 1.3 percent Android 2.3 Gingerbread (February 2011): Down 0.2 points to 1.3 percent Android 2.2 Froyo (May 2010): Flat at 0.1 percent The Platform Versions tool uses data gathered from the Google Play Store app, which requires Android 2.2 and above. This means devices running older versions are not included, nor are devices that don’t have Google Play installed (such as many Android phones and tablets in China, Amazon’s Fire line, and so on). Also, Android versions that have less than 0.1 percent adoption, such as Android 3.0 Honeycomb, are not listed.\nFor the sake of comparison, here’s the Android adoption chart for October:\n\nThe Android adoption order now stands as: Lollipop in first place, KitKat in second, Marshmallow in third, Jelly Bean in fourth, Gingerbread and ICS tied for fifth, and Froyo in last. Marshmallow will move up to second place this year, but the gold medal spot will elude it until sometime in 2017. Nougat will meanwhile barely make it to 1 percent.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": " Google+\nChris Keane/REUTERS\nDonald Trump’s only viable path to victory involves off-the-mark polling and surprise wins along the eastern seaboard and into the Midwest.\nBy Evan Horowitz Globe Staff November 07, 2016\nThere are only two ways for Donald Trump to win Tuesday’s election: either the polls have to be wrong, or they have to be very wrong. Otherwise, Hillary Clinton will become our next president.\nAs we follow the fast-unfolding results Tuesday night, then, that’s the thing to watch for: signs that the polls we’ve been obsessively watching were actually inaccurate.\nAdvertisement\nIt shouldn’t take long to find out either. Trump’s only viable path to victory involves off-the-mark polling and surprise wins along the eastern seaboard and into the Midwest — all places that report results relatively early, beginning around 7 p.m.\nSo here’s a proposal for your election-watching evening. Eat an early dinner, prepare appropriate libations for triumph or defeat, and settle in front of the TV to watch for the unanticipated. To capture the Oval Office, Trump needs either a few substantial upsets, or a legion of little ones.\nGet Political Happy Hour Now, some prognosticators still give Trump decent odds. Notably, Nate Silver’s time-tested team at fivethirtyeight.com suggests he has a roughly one-in-three shot of winning the presidency. But that’s not because they think his numbers look particularly good; it’s because polls have proved wrong in the past — underestimating President Obama’s strength in 2012 — and they’re worried about the possibility that they may be misleading again this time .\nBut here’s why the race is still Clinton’s to lose: When you count up all the states where Clinton holds a clear polling advantage, that total already gives her 268 electoral votes — just two shy of the 270 she needs to win. And being that close to victory means she can cross the finish line by capturing any of the harder-fought states: Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio, Nevada, or North Carolina.\nFlip that around, and you can see Trump’s problem. Whereas Clinton has to win just one of those states, Trump basically needs to win all of them. Or, if he fails to do that, he needs to compensate with an even bigger surprise, capturing one of the state where polls show Clinton well ahead, but where the campaigns have been battling mightily in recent days, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, or Michigan.\nAdvertisement\nSo state by state, hour by hour , this is what you need to keep your eyes on:\n7 p.m. — Polls close in Virginia.\nClinton is expected to win Virginia, so a Trump upset would be a first sign of unexpected strength.\n7:30 p.m. — Polls close in North Carolina and Ohio.\nThese are really must-have states for Trump. If Clinton carries either one, that would effectively secure her place in history.\n8 p.m. — Polls close in Florida, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.\nTrump needs Florida to keep his hopes alive, and probably New Hampshire too. If both those states go to Clinton, you can pretty much shut off the TV and head to bed.\nBut if Trump makes it this far, pay attention to Pennsylvania. Trump has spent a lot of time campaigning there, and a win would be transformative, giving him a real chance at carrying the night.\n(Note: many polling places close before 8pm in Florida and New Hampshire, so it’s possible their fates will be known earlier in the evening.)\n9 p.m. — Polls close in Michigan.\nThe nine o’clock hour could be Trump’s last stand. In just the last week, Trump has been making a big push to defy the polls and win over Michigan voters. If we get to 9 p.m., and Trump finds himself in a middling position — winning the states he must but as yet unable to pull off the necessary surprise — Michigan will be his last real chance.\nAnd here’s one reason to stay awake: during the primaries, polls of Michigan were off by an astonishing 20 percentage points .\n10 p.m. — Polls close in Nevada and Utah.\nThis could be the year that deep-red Nevada gets repainted blue by a growing Latino population. And while that may seem a mere footnote by the time 10 p.m. rolls around, there are a few scenarios where it could really matter.\nIf Clinton loses New Hampshire, along with a handful of other close states, she may need Nevada to put her over the top.\nUtah is interesting for a different reason. It’s the only place with a competitive third-party candidate: Evan McMullin. A well-respected Mormon politician in a Mormon-heavy state, he’s siphoned off a lot of Trump support. Maybe not enough to capture the state’s electoral votes…but maybe.\n11 p.m. — It’s pretty much over.\nYes, there are a few states whose polls close this late, but they’re reliably partisan. If you’re still up watching TV, it’s not because you’re wondering whether Clinton will win California. It's because some of those earlier states proved tighter than expected, and the outcome is still unclear.\nFor now, take heart. This presidential season has been incredibly long, but it’s almost over. And election night itself could be mercifully short. Unless Donald Trump finds some unlikely victories early on, his hopes for a November surprise quashed.\nEvan Horowitz digs through data to find information that illuminates the policy issues facing Massachusetts and the U.S. He can be reached at evan.horowitz@globe.com .

Hillary Clinton had her own “comeback kid” moment in 2008 when she won an upset victory against then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008.\nFor Trump, New Hampshire is the site of his first big win of the 2016 Republican primary, proving that a candidate once dismissed as a political sideshow could be the real thing. He won decisively against a historically large field of rivals, garnering 35 percent of the vote.\nIn 2015, Political reporter James Pindell took us on a tour of what was — and might still be — Clinton Country.\nTouring Clinton Country",

The search giant plans to show up-to-the-minute information detailing the progress of multiple U.S. election day races and other referenda to anyone who queries for “election results.”\nGoogle said it would deliver the updates every 30 seconds in more than 30 different languages, according to a blog post by Shashi Thakur, vice president of engineering on the Google search team. Included in the briefings are the presidential, senatorial, congressional, and gubernatorial races, as well as other ballots throughout the U.S.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nHere’s a glimpse of what the search tool should look like, per the blog post:\n\nThe rundown includes real-time statistics on the matchup between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic contender for the White House, and Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. Alongside details of the tug-of-war for the executive office are key numbers concerning open legislative seats, battleground states, and the top two political parties (blue for Democrats, red for Republicans).\nAlthough this is not the first time that Google has offered informational tools during an election, this year marks a notable increase in the company’s efforts to meet consumer demand as more people turn to the web--and increasingly their smartphones--for news. Google said that it had seen traffic for the search term “how to vote” more than triple in the past four years, up 233% from 2012.\nIn addition to the political precis that will appear on election day (above), Google has already debuted tools detailing how to register , how and where to vote , and info on who is running--including an election-themed Google Doodle.\n40 Under 40: Reactions to the 2016 Election Year \nGoogle said that YouTube, its video division, would stream live coverage from a number of news outlets as well, including NBC, PBS, MTV, Bloomberg, Telemundo, and The Young Turks starting at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday. “From the ballot box to tomorrow's late-night returns, we hope Google's tools help guide you through Election Day in a simple, clear and informative way,” Thakur said.\nOf course, Fortune encourages you to visit Fortune.com for all your coverage needs as well.",

      "text": " Google+\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\nCharlie Bering lit a candle during a multifaith prayer service Monday at Church of Good Shepherd in Watertown.\nBy Lisa Wangsness Globe Staff November 08, 2016\nBROOKLINE — They sat in silence in the old stone church, deep in thought, the turbulence and traffic of the world outside reduced to shadows and light at play on the walls.\nThey prayed for the nation. They murmured a beloved psalm: I lift up my eyes to the hills/From where is my help to come? And they listened to a French Jesuit priest’s poem that ends this way: “Accept the anxiety of feeling yourself in suspense and incomplete.”\nAdvertisement\nThe service at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church was part of an extraordinary 48-hour election prayer vigil called by Episcopal bishops in an effort to kindle a spirit of reconciliation at the end of an election year marked by fear and division. From noon Sunday to noon Tuesday, churches across the state decided to open their doors for parts of the days for prayer services, interfaith gatherings, and moments of quiet meditation.\n“We must pray for a peaceful transition, no matter the outcome of our elections,” the Episcopal bishops of Massachusetts said in a statement announcing the vigils. “We must pray that the demonization of one another’s opponents which has characterized this election not be further stoked by its outcome. We must pray that all those elected on that day be moved, strengthened, and guided by the Spirit, to lead us through fractious and dangerous times.”\nGet Fast Forward Jeannie Baca, a social worker from Roslindale and a member of St. Paul’s, said she felt a bit better when the 15-minute noonday prayer ended.\n“It’s a much more productive thing than I would otherwise be doing, which is refreshing FiveThirtyEight,” she said with a wry smile, referring to the website of data analyst Nate Silver that is an online destination for the politically obsessed. “It feels centering to be here. This is a place that was here before the election and will be here after the election.”\nElection Day seems to bring out more formal religious observance with every passing election. Four years ago, about 30 churches of various denominations around Massachusetts, including many Episcopal congregations, participated in a national effort called Election Day Communion, which asked churches to hold a service on election night to emphasize themes of unity and common spiritual bonds.\nAdvertisement\nPraying for the country and its leaders is a longstanding tradition in the Episcopal church, noted Bishop Alan M. Gates of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. The church’s Book of Common Prayer includes a whole section of prayers for the government — for courts, for sound government, for elections, for leaders.\nBut the divisiveness of this campaign — especially the presidential contest involving Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump — seemed to call for a remarkable religious response, said Bishop Douglas J. Fisher of the Diocese of Western Massachusetts.\n“This particular election cycle was so divisive, and people were so bitterly opposed — and quite frankly, the language used in the debates was so hate-filled and demeaning, we felt we needed to increase our efforts,” he said. “Much more so than in 2012, there’s tremendous anxiety out there.”\nGates said: “It may be that we are rediscovering and offering those prayers with a particular intensity at this time in our national life.”\nThe prayer vigils are taking different forms. About two dozen people, including Fisher, gathered on the steps of Worcester City Hall for a vigil Sunday night. In Lynn, congregants of St. Stephen’s Memorial Episcopal Church are expected to take turns leading prayers in the chapel on Election Day, as well as helping to remind people to vote and offering rides to the polls, an extension of the congregation’s work on social issues.\nAttendance was quite small at the first two of six services planned for before and after Election Day at St. Stephen’s Episcopal in Westborough — sometimes just a couple of people. The Rev. Jesse Abell said he thought it was still worthwhile.\n“Prayer can never hurt,” he said. “Even if one person is praying, at least they are praying for all of us.”\nThe Rev. Amy McCreath of the Church of the Good Shepherd in Watertown coordinated a multifaith service. It made sense, she said, given her city’s rich history of welcoming immigrants and the fear-inducing rhetoric in this year’s election.\nAt the service, she said in an interview before the event Monday night, an Iranian Muslim was expected to read a poem by Rumi; a Jewish woman would blow the shofar; Unitarians would share a reading about voting as a spiritual practice; representatives of the Brahma Kumaris Learning Center for Peace would lead a circle of light meditation. She said the congregation would also sing a few chants from an ecumenical Christian community in Scotland. For everyone who attended, there was the prayer of a stranger, written on a card, to take home and recite on Election Day.\n“This is a great chance to build community,” McCreath said. “If you’re praying someone else’s prayer, that’s a great way to do it.”\nThis year, in Concord, N.H., about a dozen houses of worship — including a mosque and a synagogue — are scheduled to open for prayer from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday so that voters can pray before or after casting their ballots. A pre-election prayer vigil was scheduled to be held Monday evening at the city’s Temple Beth Jacob; a post-election unity breakfast planned for Wednesday at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Concord will include the singing of “God Bless America.”\nThe Rev. Jeffrey Mello, rector of St. Paul’s in Brookline, said he hopes the services reassure and strengthen both his parish and the wider community who sees his flock at prayer.\n“For me, there is something about gathering in an extraordinary time with ancient words to remind us that we are not the first to go through times such as these,” he said. “It’s how we live in these times that has the potential to bring out who it is God needs us to be.”\nAnd as for those who can’t stop checking the FiveThirty-Eight website but who don’t pray or cannot?\nMello suggests they find “whatever it is in their life that connects them on some deep level with the goodness and peace in the world,” he said.\n“It’s about remembering who we are at our best,” he said, “so we can be that person when we are stressed or under pressure.”\nThe 2016 presidential race Election reading list Even in college, Donald Trump was brash Hillary: The Wellesley years Clinton charity never provided foreign donor data The Atlantic City savior that came up snake eyes Series: America on Edge\nLisa Wangsness can be reached at lisa.wangsness@globe.com .

      "text": "Taylor Swift , who once said that voting makes her feel, “so completely American,\" must have felt pretty American today!\nThe pop star definitely voted for one of the candidates running for president — or possibly wrote in Taylor Swift in that blank space even though she's about a decade too young for eligibility — but we have no idea who she cast her ballot for. And we, the people, cannot shake it off.\nAccording to Google Trends, Swift's ballot was a hot search on this election day — ahead of anyone who actually has anything to do with politics.\nSEE ALSO: Rihanna wore the best t-shirt of the entire election\nAmerica really wants to know who @taylorswift13 is voting for pic.twitter.com/dW6CyFmJyD\n— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) November 8, 2016\n\"I follow it, and I try to keep myself as educated and informed as possible. But I don’t talk about politics because it might influence other people,\" Swift told Time back in 2012. \"And I don’t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for.\"\nAlthough Swift has budged on some of her previous views, including publicly embracing feminism, she didn't endorse a candidate during this election.\nSome people are really mad that Swift has declined to become a political figure, accusing Swift of squandering her influence in order to remain friendly to as many markets as possible.\nOthers believe she's keeping quiet because she's a Trump supporter, citing a few reasons Swift might not be with her. Many of Tay's known enemies (Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, etc.) are Clinton supporters. Tay's bestie, Karlie Kloss, would be Ivanka Trump's sister-in-law if she ever marries her longtime boyfriend, Joshua Kushner. Swift's dad was a Wall Street dude before the family relocated to Nashville.\nmy 2 working Taylor Swift conspiracy theories rn: 1) she might be releasing an album this weekend 2) she is definitely voting for Trump\n— Taylor Tetreau (@taylortetreau) October 23, 2016\nI love @taylorswift13 but I think she's voting Trump\n— Cedrick (@_cedrickt) November 8, 2016\nIt's a lot of baseless speculation, which, of course, is the internet's specialty.\nWhat we do know is that Swift voted for the next president of the United States of America bright and early this morning .\nToday is the day. Go out and VOTE 🇺🇸\nA photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 8, 2016 at 8:01am PST\nSwift posted the Instagram at 8:01 a.m. PST, meaning she likely voted in California, the location of one of her residences, even though she went to jury duty in Nashville earlier this year.\nConsidering that she was in NYC last night throwing a birthday party for Lorde amongst Clinton supporters like Lena Dunham, Mae Whitman and Aziz Ansari, she likely got on her private jet first thing in the morning to participate in democracy.\nSince everything Swift does is intentional, we must look at clues wherever we can find them.\nFrom the image, we can see that Swift is standing by a man in a blue shirt. Is he a Democrat? Or, like all men, does he just have a closet stocked with several light blue button down shirts that have no discernible differences?\nSwift opted to wear a cold shoulder style shirt, which could be a sly nod to Clinton that may have been inspired by Dunham.\ntaylor swift finally told u who she's voting for with a SWEATER. i'm screaming pic.twitter.com/aqECzAkCOh\n— Kaitlyn Tiffany (@kait_tiffany) November 8, 2016\nHeaded to Denver to meet some of my favorite Nasty Women in support of @hillaryclinton! Let's do all we can in the days that remain. RN I'm paying tribute in my @lpathelabel cold shoulder sweater...\nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Nov 4, 2016 at 5:41pm PDT\nCan this broken nation heal itself without a confirmation of all of our pop stars' political leanings? We may have to.\nBonus: Doug the Pug Recreates Taylor Swift Instagrams",

      "text": "Reddit \nIt’s Election Day. So, hopefully all those prospective voters out there have done their research on the issues, figured out who most aligns with the direction they want to see America head in and planned their vote accordingly. But barring that, you can always go with “whatever Taylor Swift did.” \nWhile “Who is Taylor Swift voting for?” isn’t the top search on Google Trends related to the elections, it is the top ask among “Who X cast a ballot for” queries. The “Shake It Off” singer is followed by Monica Lewinsky, George Bush, Al Gore and Mitt Romney. \nThe actual most-searched query will give you a little more hope in your fellow Americans, if only slightly. “Who is on my ballot?” is the top-searched question, followed by “Where do I vote?”“What time do polls open?”, “What time will the president be announced?” and “What do I need to bring to vote?” \nAs for the actual candidates’ they’re currently neck-and-neck in searches, as should be expected from such a close race. If you feel like panicking every few minutes, check out this real-time “Electionland Trends” map created by Google . It shows what people are searching in the U.S. and where, noting spikes in search traffic in different cities. \"Who Is Taylor Swift Voting For\" is the #1 most searched \"Who Is __ Voting For\" on Google in the US. #Election2016 pic.twitter.com/yPsNI0AMqh \n— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) November 8, 2016 Artists",

      "text": "By Jennifer Earl CBS News November 9, 2016, 3:05 AM What Americans were searching on Google as election came to a close \nAfter casting their votes, Americans headed home on Tuesday to anxiously await the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. \nAnd most likely, they pulled out their laptops and surfed the web while doing so. \nThroughout the day, Google saw a variety of questions related to voting. But as day turned to night, the searches shifted, and voters focused on issues that mattered most to them as results trickled in. \nHere are some subjects people were searching for just two hours before polls closed on the West Coast (11 p.m. ET): 1. Canada immigration \nThe website cic.gc.ca goes to a 500 Internal Server Error as the site crashes the night of the U.S. presidential election. cic.gc.ca \nIt’s no surprise people were searching for “Canada immigration” as the 2016 U.S. presidential election came to a close early Wednesday morning. \nThroughout the campaign, frightened American voters stated, “If they get elected, I’m moving to Canada !” \nThe Canadian government website for immigration crashed Tuesday night while media reported several battleground states were still too close to call. The website cic.gc.ca went to a 500 Internal Server Error throughout the night Tuesday and into the early hours on Wednesday. \nThere was no answer at the Canadian Immigration Services headquarters late Tuesday, so it’s not known if the website’s outage was related to nervous from American voters. \nBut perhaps some of those voters were looking to follow through on their promise. 2. Dow futures — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 9, 2016 \nOverseas stocks tumbled Wednesday as Donald Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count in the presidential election . \n“Right now, the markets are heading for the hills, but we’ll see,” Robert Tipp, chief investments strategist for global bonds and foreign exchange at Prudential Fixed Income told CNBC . “That’s a function of fear as much as fact.” \nAs of 12:20 a.m. ET, Dow futures, which bet on the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, had dropped 840 points. 3. Michigan electoral votes — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 9, 2016 \nMichigan was declared a “tossup” by the CBS News Decision Desk early Tuesday evening. \nIt came as a shock to Democrats -- as the state has historically gone their way. \nIn fact, a Republican nominee hadn’t won the state of Michigan since 1988, CBS News reported. \nPeople on Google clearly wanted to know: What happened? 4. Dow jones — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 9, 2016 \nPeople were also frantically searching for “Dow Jones” on Tuesday, which is most likely linked with the search for “Dow futures,” which plunged about 5 percent early Wednesday morning. 5. Wisconsin electoral votes — CBS News (@CBSNews) November 9, 2016 \nWhat’s happening in Wisconsin? \nThe battleground state was declared a “tossup” Tuesday evening. By early Wednesday morning, the CBS News Decision Desk reported that Trump “[had] an edge” over Clinton. \nAround 12:30 a.m. ET, the desk said the race was too close to call, and that it was still waiting on a vote count from the Milwaukee area. \nWhile commenting on the current projections in Michigan, a Clinton aide told CBS News her camp did not believe Clinton would pull out a victory “in the end.” \nThat may come as a surprise to some, because Barack Obama -- a Clinton supporter -- won the state by 14 points in 2008 and 7 points in 2012. \nBut others have pointed out that the current Democratic nominee hadn’t visited the state since April. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "title": "Everything you need to know about 4K streaming on Chromecast Ultra",
      "text": "\nBuying the Chromecast Ultra was the easy part.\nGoogle is doing its part to make 4K streaming more accessible, but buying a Chromecast Ultra is only part of the equation. In order to stream a the highest-available resolution you'll need a few different pieces to come together. Namely you need a display that can handle the resolution, enough internet bandwidth to carry all of those extra bits and of course you have to find the 4K content to stream.\nIt's going to be a little while before 4K streaming is ubiquitous, but you can be ahead of the curve with your Chromecast Ultra and all of the right equipment to support it.\nFirst, a 4K screen \nThe most important starting point for this equation is a screen with a 4K (or UHD) resolution. Though that can mean a computer monitor, chances are you're looking to use this with a TV. 4K TVs aren't nearly as expensive as they used to be, and it's actually getting kind of tough to buy a new TV that isn't 4K. Go pick up a new TV with the resolution, and you'll be good to go.\nMore: Best 4K HDR TVs under $700 \nIf you want to guarantee compatibility, make sure the TV you're buying (or the one you have) supports HDCP 2.2, which is a prerequisite for streaming copy-protected content on the Chromecast Ultra. If you use an A/V receiver or a soundbar system with your TV, those will also have to be HDCP 2.2 compliant.\nWhile you're shopping, you may consider splashing a little extra cash to get a TV that supports HDR video as well. You'll get more vivid colors and dynamic range, and the Chromecast Ultra supports HDR streaming. Another nice-to-have feature is HDMI CEC, which lets the TV and Chromecast Ultra talk to one another, enabling features like the Chromecast turning the TV on and outside devices to control the Chromecast via the TV.\nA lot of bandwidth You either have a 4K screen or you don't — that part is pretty easy — but whether or not you have enough internet bandwidth is definitely another question. In order to stream in 4K, Google recommends at least 20 mbps sustained speeds for the Chromecast Ultra — and for what it's worth, Netflix recommends 25 mbps . That honestly doesn't sound like too much if you live in a major city and have cable internet, but there are a few things to consider here.\nChances are you're getting less speed than you think, and that may be an issue.\nJust because you have advertised speeds of (usually denoted as \"up to\") 20 mbps to your home doesn't mean that you have that speed sustained — it could be much less. If you do have that much bandwidth, you have to also take into account the fact that multiple devices in your home are likely sharing that bandwidth, and depending on the quality of your Wi-Fi router at home that may also take a chunk off the top of your internet speed as it's delivered to the Chromecast Ultra.\nIf you don't meet the bandwidth requirements, the Chromecast Ultra is likely to fall back to streaming in 1080p in order to keep the stream going. Chances are it'll still look really good, and will stream smoother, but then again it won't look any better than streaming in 1080p from a cheaper second-gen Chromecast, either. If you are using a slower DSL connection or find your cable internet slows down heavily at peak times, you may never be able to stream in 4K.\nExternal power brick \nIf you had one of the prior two Chromecast models before your Ultra you may have enjoyed the freedom of running your Chromecast off the power provided by a USB port on the back of your TV — saving you from extra cables and power outlets. With the Chromecast Ultra, it's a requirement that you use the included power brick if you want to stream in 4K, as the new model draws more power than previous generations, and more than any TV can reliably provide.\nThe power brick outputs 5V/1A of power, so theoretically you could use any power brick you have laying around that offers the same output, but considering the included one is ... well, included, you might as well use it.\nThe power brick is a little bulky, but it also has the benefit of giving you an ethernet port, which means you can get your Chromecast Ultra hooked up to a wired network without extra accessories. Since many people have a router or switch in their home entertainment setup, this may be the best way to ensure you meet those above-mentioned bandwidth requirements for 4K streaming.\nNow find the 4K content \nSo you've jumped through all of the hoops in terms of hardware, now you just have to find some content that actually streams in 4K. It's true that the majority of what you'll find out there today is still in 1080p, but there are a few reliable sources for finding that high-resolution goodness you bought the Chromecast Ultra for.\nNetflix has a good amount of 4K video that you may actually want to watch — just remember you have to upgrade to the highest-tier subscription to get it, which costs $11.99 per month (and also gives you simultaneous viewing on four devices). YouTube also offers lots of 4K video . If you like to use Vudu, you'll find 4K content there as well. Vimeo also has 4K and supports Google Cast. Google Play Movies has 4K content, though it's tough to identify just which movies and TV shows are in the higher resolution. Google keeps a comprehensive list of all Google Cast apps on its website , and tags the ones that are 4K capable. After you search through and find some good 4K video to be impressed by you're likely to fall back to watching mostly 1080p video as you start to make viewing choices based on the actual content rather than the resolution. But with the Chromecast Ultra all set up and ready for 4K, you'll seamlessly stream the highest-quality video when available — no need to configure anything extra. Eventually, more and more of what you actually want to watch will also be coming at you in 4K.\nChromecast \nChromecast and Chromecast Audio review Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Chromecast vs Chromecast Ultra: Which should you buy?

      "text": "Pinterest \nGoogle has traditionally taken a hands-off approach when it comes to hardware for Android devices, which is why the latest addition to the Android Compatibility Definition Document was such a surprise. The company has added an entire section “strongly recommending” against the use of third party and proprietary charging standards. \nThe section is assumed to be aimed squarely at Qualcomm Quick Charge. The technology allows batteries to be charged faster than ever over a USB Type-C connection. However, Qualcomm’s Type-C cables operate on a slightly different standard from the regular cable; which is what Google is trying to put a stop to. \nIdeally, USB Type-C represents the start of a new singular standard for everyone to adopt. This can only happen if manufacturers refrain from tinkering with proprietary cables and connectors. \n“Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers.” \nGoogle’s document is largely used as a guideline for manufacturers to provide some semblance of a consistent Android experience. Of course, there is nothing stopping them from deviating from the recommendations. However, doing so many force Google to take drastic steps to standardise USB Type-C connections.",

      "title": "How to Rank on Google Home",
      "text": "Posted by Dr-Pete \nGoogle Home, Google's latest digital assistant, is part of a broader market experiment in voice-only search. While the hardware is new, Google has been building toward this future for a while, and one of the clearest examples is the introduction of featured snippets to answer questions in search. For example, if I ask Google: \"What is a moonshot in business?\" I get this answer... \n\nIn desktop search, Google also returns a set of traditional organic results, and, in some cases, ads, news results, Knowledge Panels, and other features. Featured snippets weren't designed for desktop, though — they were designed for devices that only have room to display a small number of results (such as mobile phones) or even a single result. \nGoogle Home is a single-result search device, and featured snippets were designed for exactly this purpose. The good news is that, if we can optimize for featured snippets, we can optimize for voice. Below are six examples that explore how featured snippets become answers on Google Home. \n\"How many people have walked on the moon?\" Here's a question that should have a factual answer, but, for whatever reason, that answer is not available in Google's Knowledge Graph. So, the answer is extracted from Wikipedia and presented as a featured snippet. It's interesting to note that the answer (twelve) is pulled out of the paragraph and presented on its own... \n\nHow does this two-part answer \"appear\" on Google Home? Let's find out... \n\nGoogle Home starts with the short answer: \"Twelve\". Then, it moves on to attribution: \"According to Wikipedia...\". Finally, the device reads the snippet, but only the first sentence in this case. As we'll see, Google may choose to cut off the featured snippet, but the logic of when and where isn't perfectly clear. \n\"Who has walked on the moon?\" Let's move on to the natural follow-up question — who are these people? This question returns a more typical, paragraph-based featured snippet... \n\nHere's how it sounds on Google Home. \n\nIn this case, we get attribution first (\"According to Universe Today...\"), followed by the full snippet. Even though this snippet is fairly long, Google Home chooses to read the full contents. \n\"How do I get to the moon?\" Hey, I'd like to be one of those people — how do I get in on this whole moon thing? I'm feeling starved for glory. Here, Google returns a list-based format. I've purposely chosen a messy example (notice how Google presents an ordered list but then repeats the numbering, e.g. \"1. Step 1.\") to see how Google Home will handle it... \n\nHow will Home deal with an ordered list that includes a bit of mess? Let's find out... \n\nFirst, notice the attribution is different: \"According to some information I found on Live Science...\". This may just be for variety's sake, but I'm not entirely sure. Google Home then proceeds through the steps, but some are truncated. Step 1, for example, becomes simply: \"Assemble the Pieces.\" We're left a bit unclear what we're assembling the pieces of (the moon?). Google also reads the odd syntax (\"1. Step 1.\") verbatim, but this is more of a problem with the featured snippet algorithm than Google Home itself. \n\"List all the moons.\" Let's try a longer list, and a slightly different format. This isn't a question so much as a command, but featured snippets handle it well enough... \n\nWhat happens to the longer list on Google Home? Here's what we get... \n\nGoogle Home skips a couple of words in the list and pauses oddly in one spot, before finally ending the list with \"...and more.\" Clearly, there's a length limit to the spoken answer, but that limit isn't entirely consistent and seems to depend on the format of the answer. \n\"What kind of cheese is the moon made of?\" This one's just for fun. We all know what kind of cheese the moon is made of... \n\nHere's the snippet on Google Home, which is structured just like our first example... \n\n\"List of ISS missions.\" Occasionally, Google formats a featured snippet as a table, generally extracting it from tabular data in the source page. Here's an example... \n\nInterestingly, this same search returns no results on Google Home. I tried a handful of tabular featured snippets, and either they returned no results or Google substituted a paragraph-based snippet. Obviously, translating a table into a voice answer is tricky business, and it appears that Google hasn't worked out how best to solve that problem. \n\"What is Page Authority?\" How does this help you and your brand? Obviously, we're not all in the moon business. While featured snippets are naturally focused on informational queries, questions are relevant to many aspects of our business and even our branded properties. For example, if I search Google for \"What is Page Authority?\", one of Moz's own proprietary metrics, I'm rewarded with a featured snippet... \n\nObviously, this isn't a household term or particularly high-volume search, and yet there's still opportunity to be had. Is the same question answered by Google Home? Yes, it is... \n\nGoogle Home needs a little work on its pronunciation, but we do get back the full snippet and are even rewarded with \"According to Moz...\" and a bit of a brand boost. \n\"Where do we go from here?\" This is one question Google Home definitely can't answer. The direct translation of featured snippets into voice answers means that Google Home does present clear search marketing opportunities. At the moment, though, it's very difficult to measure the extent or the impact of those opportunities. How does a voice answer help us without a corresponding click? How will we measure voice answers? How will Google monetize voice? I don't think even Google knows the answers to these questions yet. \nFor now, it's worth exploring ranking for voice if only because winning featured snippets also positions you well in desktop and mobile search. As voice evolves, we can expect to see more interplay between devices, where a voice search saves a link in an app (Amazon Echo's app already does this with Bing searches) or opens a page directly on a linked device. Our investments now will create opportunities over the next few years as the market for voice search grows. \nRemember, Moz Pro can help you find and track featured snippets , as well as flag opportunities where you might be in a position to win a snippet. If you can rank in position #0, you can rank for voice and on Google Home. \n\nSign up for The Moz Top 10 , a semimonthly mailer updating you on the top ten hottest pieces of SEO news, tips, and rad links uncovered by the Moz team.

Share Save \nBased on the search strings that trended for November 9th, the world turned to Google in an effort to understand the President-elect's surprise win and the United States' complicated voting system. Google Trends posted the most popular searches after Donald Trump was named the 48th President of the United States on Twitter, and as Mashable noted, it reflects a lot of people's confusion. \nAs you would expect, the candidates' names are linked to election-related searches, such as \"What will Hillary Clinton do now?\" and \"How did Donald Trump win?\" But even generic search strings like \"How did...\" and \"Why did...\" were dominated by the presidential elections. \"Why did Hillary concede?\" trended, as well as the question that probably plagued a lot of people's minds: \"How did the polls get it so wrong?\" Across the pond, people also looked up what Trump means for Brexit. \nWe embedded some of Google's top search trends below, but you can check out Google's World POTUS website for more search data. As for what results come up when you look up these questions, we're afraid you're going to have to Google them yourself. \"What does Trump mean for Brexit?\" was among the top questions on #Brexit in the hours following @realDonaldTrump 's #USElection2016 win pic.twitter.com/wmb7JERu5M",

      "text": " Google+\nA screen capture of Jeff Immelt’s letter.\nBy Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nSo what is Jeff Immelt really saying about the election of Donald Trump?\nThe chief executive of General Electric Co. shared his thoughts about the presidential election in a message to company employees Wednesday afternoon. It included pointed references to GE’s “core values” that respect “diversity” and “people of all races, genders and sexual orientations”—phrases that during the political campaign had a fairly loaded context.\nAdvertisement\nGE relocated to Boston from suburban Connecticut in August to tap into the region’s higher education system and pool of tech talent and entrepreneurs. It also received public subsidies from both the city and the state to call Boston home.\nDuring one point early in the campaign populist Democrat Bernie Sanders villified General Electric as an archtype of corporate greed, and Trump, too, mentioned job losses at GE plants during campaign events in appealing to displaced workers.\nGet Business Headlines Immelt spoke out earlier in the campaign, too. And he essentially reiterated some of those thoughts in his note Wednesday, acknowledging the “political volatility and populism” that characterized the election, but also striking a note for the “importance of globalization and investment.”\nThe full text of Immelt’s letter is as follows:\nThe American people have spoken loudly and voted for change and Donald Trump won a decisive victory. The company will support the new congress and the President Elect and work with his administration as we have with each administration for the past 125 years.\nAt GE, we do a lot of things well but one thing we really know how to do is adapt to the rapidly changing new world order with a sense of optimism and purpose. The reason we can embrace change and adapt is that our core values always remain the same. We value diversity and respect for each other above all else. We support people of all races, genders and sexual orientations and will continue to ensure a level playing field. We celebrate and will continue to strengthen our affinity groups as a key pipeline for talent. We believe in the importance of globalization and investment. With these core values, we are able to run a global company that adds value to the countries and communities in which we do business. We are a meritocracy with the highest standards.\nAdvertisement\nWhat we witnessed last night is not a uniquely American phenomenon. This election is the latest step in a longer-term, global trend that we have been adjusting to for a while -- one that’s marked by political volatility and populism. It is important to understand and learn from this election. This trend began with the financial crisis in 2008 - many people believe the system is not working for them. They haven’t seen real economic growth and they believe that their countries are on the wrong track. People don’t trust traditional institutions like the media, the Washington establishment and business. We also saw this in Britain with Brexit, and in other recent elections in Europe and Asia.\nGlobally, we’ve worked to adapt the company to this trend. We are localizing our operations and building strong relationships with suppliers and customers around the world. We are providing the goods and services needed to grow economies and improve the lives of all people -- reliable, cost-effective power, healthcare, transportation. We will continue to do this in the US as we do elsewhere.\nI am proud to work for GE and proud of all of you. Over my career I have learned to listen more and judge less. In these times of uncertainty, we control what we can control. We must lead with more passion and commitment than ever before. We must embrace each other’s differences and views (including views on this election!) and encourage people with new thinking and perspectives to join the company around the world.\nThe next step is on us. Let’s go!\nloading\nElectoral votes 228 Clinton\n31 Undecided\n279 Trump\n59,814,018 votes\n270 to win\n59,611,678 votes\n99.1% reporting\nData source: AP\nAdam Vaccaro can be reached at adam.vaccaro@globe.com .

      "text": "Get in the game.\nGoogle's Daydream View launches today , as you may know , but along with it is a host of software experiences you can get for the new platform.\nThat's because Daydream is both hardware and software, and the View is just the first example of hardware we're going to see for it; as Cardboard did to inexpensive mobile VR, Daydream hopes to do with slightly-more-expensive-but-still-affordable mobile VR.\n\nThe Daydream View itself is available for $79 in the U.S., and goes on sale today. It's also available in Canada, the UK, Germany and Australia, all through Google and in some cases, like Canada and Germany, at various carriers.\nThe software story is a little weird. Google has released updates versions of Google Play Movies & TV and Street View on which to view VR-enabled content, but there isn't much in the way of original content, at least at launch. There are 12 games , including Mekorama and Hunter's Gate, and 13 apps , including Fantastic Beasts and YouTube VR, that are Daydream-optimized.\nRussell Holly, in his review , says that the Daydream View, and its accompanying platform, are fully-formed out of the box:\nDaydream View is a complete thought, which is something I don't get to say often enough when looking at new VR platforms. This isn't a way to soak up the existing VR content and act as a gatekeeper for those experiences, it's a standalone idea.\nRight now, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the only two phones that work with Daydream, but that number should increase relatively quickly as more phones are released running Android 7.1 Nougat.\nAre you planning on picking up a Daydream View, or did you receive a code for one when purchasing a Pixel? Let us know!\nSee at Google \n",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 10th, 2016 \nLook what we have here: new live cases have shown up at the Google Store ! Google is preparing to sell two new cases that’ll offer some unique flair for your smartphone: Google Earth (above) : This case ships with a collection of curated landscapes from Google Earth. When pressing the shortcut button while a certain wallpaper is up, you can see the corresponding location on Google Maps in case you’re curious to explore more. Google Trends (below) : The latest search trends will be visualized as a live wallpaper on your home screen. Pressing the shortcut button gives you a quick rundown of the latest trends so you can learn more. \nAs with all Google Live Cases, the shortcut buttons can also be customized to open your favorite app in case you get bored of the default actions. \nGoogle is letting these particular cases go for $49.99 where $39.99 used to be the norm. It also seems Google is only letting these new cases go for the Pixel and Pixel XL . If you’re fine with that, then stay tuned as Google only has them listed as “coming soon.”",

      "text": "\nThis post originally appeared on our sister site, TabTimes . \nGoogle is currently beta testing Android apps running on its Chrome OS with a few Chromebooks, such as its own Pixel, the Acer Chromebook R11 and the ASUS Flip . This week, some people who own the Flip claimed they were blocked from downloading Microsoft’s suite of Office apps for Android. However, Microsoft said in an official statement it does plan to allow access to the Office Android apps for Chrome OS users when it becomes officially available sometime in late 2016.\nSee also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 9to5Google received this statement from a Microsoft spokesperson:\nOur strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.\nSo if your Chromebook can’t currently run those Android apps, it should be able to when the Chrome OS-Android beta period is over. One thing to note is that, per Microsoft’s own rules, any device that has a screen that’s bigger than 10.1 inches will limit the features of those Office apps for free. Users won’t be able to create, edit or print any files or documents from those apps unless they purchase an Office 365 subscription from Microsoft.",

      "text": "Google's defense against anti-trust claims: 'we're open' Mountain View used the European Commission's own data against it. Save Josh Edelson via Getty Images Google has a response for the European Commission's anti-trust allegations . In a lengthy blog post , the tech juggernaut addressed the EC's concerns point by point. That starts with the EC's stance that Android isn't in competition with Apple's iOS mobile operating system, and Google citing the Commission's own research that 89 percent of survey respondents feel that the two are competitors. That last bit is a recurring theme, with Google pointing toward the survey responses for the EC's stance on Android's \"stable and consistent framework\" across devices as well. \nIn perhaps the most poignant response, Google made a GIF that illustrates how many apps are typically pre-installed/bundled on Android devices versus the competition -- something the EC directly called out . By Mountain View's count, of the Samsung Galaxy S7 with Android 6.0.1's 38 pre-installed apps, only 11 were from Google. Contrast that with 39 out of 47 on the Lumia 550 from Microsoft and 39 out of 39 from Apple on the iPhone 7 running iOS 10.0.2. \n\"Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it,\" Google's Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kent Walker said in a statement. \"Android is the most flexibe mobile platform out there, balancing the needs of thousands of manufacturers and operators, millions of app developers and more than a billion consumers. \n\"Upsetting this balance would raise prices and hamper innovation, choice and competition. That wouldn't just be a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for the entire ecosystem, and -- most critically -- for consumers.\" And with that, the battle moves onward. Maybe the EC's stance won't leak ahead of the next round. Maybe .",

People who have never done it before is who we are seeing a lot more of come in.”\nThe ballot measure allows for the legal possession and use of one ounce or less of marijuana for adults 21 and older beginning Dec. 15. The new law passed Tuesday, 54 to 46 percent, clearing the way for what many expect will become a multi-billion-dollar industry.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here As for places to purchase pot, marijuana shops can open at the start of 2018. However, state officials this week said they hope to delay the target date to give regulators time to formulate best practices for handling the changes to state law.\nView Story Treasurer calls on state to delay opening of pot shops The new law doesn’t give state government enough time to prepare for a retail marijuana industry, the state treasurer said.\nQuestion 4 , among other things, allows for the average of-age person to grow up to six marijuana plants, with a limit of 12 plants per household. This way, they can enjoy a homegrown product and avoid buying pot on the black market or waiting a year to visit a shop.\nThat provision is what has many curious first-time growers coming into shops like Napoli’s, with questions about where to begin.\nAdvertisement\nNapoli said soil, fluorescent lights for indoor growing, and pots used to house marijuana plants have been popular items. To aid buyers with newfound green thumbs, he directs them to where to find seeds, and offers books and literature about growing operations.\n“What we are seeing primarily is people who are saying, ‘I have never done this before, I always wanted to try it, can you help me out?’” he said. “And we have everything anybody would need to grow their own cannabis at home.”\nConversations on Web forums like Reddit have also sprouted for those confused about how a seed becomes a plant with a smokeable product.\nAnd at the Northeastern Institute of Cannabis , in Natick, which educates people about the cannabis industry, officials have been busy handling questions from prospective students.\n“The day after the election, we saw an immediate increase in phone calls and email inquiries,” said Maggie Kinsella, a spokeswoman for the school, in an e-mail. “We definitely expect an increase in student enrollments.”\nShe said they offer a “Grow Room Design” class, and three cultivation classes that teach how to grow. And the school plans to expand its “Law and Regulations” class and create an advanced curriculum for the future, too.\nEli Constantinou, owner of GYOstuff (the GYO stands for Grow-Your-Own) in Cambridge, said he, too, has witnessed a steady flow of novice cultivators with a laundry list of questions coming to his business in the past two days.\n“Literally overnight in online sales, we noticed an uptick. And a lot more people came through the shop yesterday and today,” he said. “[Question 4 passing] had an effect.”\nGYOstuff carries starter kits, seed-starting supplies, lights, odor-reducers, humidifiers, and harvesting tools for small-to-medium growing operations — but not just specifically for marijuana.\n“You come in, tell us what you’re looking to do and how much space you’re dedicating to it, and how many plants you are looking to grow,” said Constantinou. “And we will take it from there.”\nThe store also offers classes to break down the process, step by step. Shop owners say growing weed can be a tricky and time-consuming hobby that requires months of patience.\nFrom seed to pipe, it can take up to four months to grow marijuana. And, as with anything new, there’s a learning curve, Constantinou said.\n“But most people find once you get set up, it’s real easy to maintain,” he said. “We have people from all walks of life that are having no problem with it.”\nTo accommodate the demand for a spot in the classes offered , Constantinou said GYOstuff has doubled slots available, from 75 to 150 per week. As a promotional stunt, they also dropped the prices.\n“We’re celebrating Question 4. We felt that by doing this we are giving back to the community,” he said. “Right now, it seems to be, ‘I want my plants, dammit!’”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": "Android Helps the Competition, Says Google Lawyer Reddit \nGoogle's Android mobile operating system boosts competition rather than hurts it, the company's general counsel said on Thursday, in a rebuttal of EU antitrust charges that it uses the platform to crush rivals. \nThe comments by Google general counsel Kent Walker on a blog came a week after the US technology group rejected two other EU accusations of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking competitors in online search advertising. \nThe Android case could potentially be the most damaging for Google. Android has made about $31 billion (roughly Rs. 2,07,835 crores) in revenue and $22 billion (roughly Rs. 1,47,495 crores) in profit for Google since its release in 2008, an Oracle Corp lawyer told a US court in January. \n( Also see: Google Attacks EU Antitrust Case, Says It 'Doesn't Fit the Reality' ) Android's market share in Europe is above 90 percent, according to the European Commission.\nWalker said the Commission has got the whole case wrong, ignoring both the fierce rivalry with iPhone maker Apple , the demands from apps developers and the dangers of modified versions of Android. \n\"The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it,\" he said. \nThe case is distorted because the EU competition enforcer does not see Apple's iOS as a rival to Android, he said. \n\"To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today's competitive smartphone landscape,\" Walker said. \nThe company said it bundles some of its apps and products in order to offer the package for free instead of charging upfront licensing fees. Such a practice put Microsoft in the EU crosshairs, eventually resulting in millions of euros of fines for the US software company. \nCommission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed receipt of Google's response. \nLobbying group and complainant FairSearch, whose members include US travel sites Expedia and TripAdvisor, dismissed Google's arguments. \n\"The truth is that Android is today a closed operating system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous. Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity,\" FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said in a statement. \nThe EU antitrust enforcer intends to hit the company with deterrent fines in the Android and shopping cases, according to charge sheets seen by Reuters. \nThe penalty could reach $7.4 billion, or 10 percent of Google's global turnover, for each case if it is found guilty of breaching EU rules. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "\nProject Soli is one of the coolest projects we’ve ever seen out of X (formerly known as Google [x]). Soli uses a radar sensor to pick up hand movements in space – making interactions with your smartwatch possible via hand gestures rather than through screen-based taps and swipes. As if that wasn’t already cool enough, Soli has just been granted superpowers allowing it to recognize objects.\nBut it wasn’t Google that gave Soli these new abilities. Researchers at the University of St. Andrews, who were given a Soli AlphaKit by Google, souped it up in a project dubbed RadarCat. RadarCat is so advanced it can instantly and accurately identify various objects placed on Soli’s radar.\nSee also: Project Soli showcased on a smartwatch May 20, 2016 RadarCat RadarCat can not only identify the various hand gestures that so impressed us about Project Soli, but it can also make out the difference between apples and oranges, as well as between full, empty and half-full glasses of various liquids – all using radar alone. RadarCat can even distinguish between different parts of your body, so it knows if its “looking” at your hand, your wrist, your forearm or your leg.\nRadio waves bouncing off an object create a very specific pattern akin to its fingerprint.\nRadarCat does this by using radio waves to bounce off an object touching the Soli sensor. This creates a very specific pattern akin to the object’s “radio fingerprint”; think of it like the echo-location mechanism bats use.\nThese radar-based echoes are so accurate and stable that RadarCat can even differentiate between various materials like glass, steel, plastic and copper or even which side of an object is lying face down on the Soli sensor. Because RadarCat employs machine learning, the list of recognizable objects only grows over time.\n\nThe applications for RadarCat are huge, and the researchers came up with a variety of use cases for the technology, some of which you can see in the video above. From displaying nutritional information about fruits and vegetables placed on the sensor to automatically bringing you a fresh drink when your glass is empty, RadarCat has a lot of potential.\nViBand But the St. Andrews team aren’t the only ones doing research into gesture recognition capabilities on wearables. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (some of whom came up with a very clever new device pairing technology we covered recently), have also hacked a smartwatch’s accelerometer to basically make it work like Project Soli, but without the need for a radar.\nSpeeding up a smartwatch's accelerometer makes it work like Project Soli, but without the need for a radar.\nCalled ViBand, the project uses a custom kernel to ramp up the sample rate of a smartwatch’s accelerometer to 4000 samples per second. Where a typical accelerometer performs at 100 Hz, the ViBand operates at 4000 Hz, making it much more sensitive to even the finest of movements in the immediate vicinity.\n\nBio-acoustic signals – essentially micro-vibrations that travel through the wearer’s arm – are picked up by the accelerometer and identified by software. ViBand can be used to manipulate virtual buttons, sliders or dials as well as to recognize larger gestures like claps, flicks of the wrist and taps on various locations of the arm and palm.\nThe range of gestures are just as wide as Project Soli, although they are admittedly a little more “rugged” than some of the fine gestures demoed by Google. Still, to be able to recreate Soli-like results on an existing smartwatch simply by ramping up accelerometer sensitivity is an impressive feat.\nSMARTWATCH REVIEWS: Samsung Gear S3 vs Gear S2 at IFA... Huawei Watch Jewel Review LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition First... Smartwatches: Is There a Failure... As far as battery consumption goes, the researchers tell me ViBand only uses around twice as much compared to a normal accelerometer, which is admittedly very little. The team is quick to point out that this is more of a proof of concept than a final solution though. “In a real commercial version of this, a special co-processor would be used, like what “OK Google” uses now – something special purpose and very low power.”\nAre you excited to see Project Soli, RadarCat and ViBand come to market? What applications can you imagine for them?",

Every year on this day, I spend a little extra time reflecting on my service in the United States Marine Corps. I remember the moments when the task placed before me seemed impossible. Whether that task was traversing an obstacle in training or making it through a mission in Iraq, there was one constant that gave me confidence and strength. I knew that the men and women next to me had my back and together we were focused on achieving our goal. There was comfort in that camaraderie that I haven’t experienced anywhere else. \nHere is the full doodle being displayed on Google’s U.S. homepage: \nSearch Engine Land thanks all of our veterans – today and everyday!

      "text": "\nThere are different builds for the European, U.S. and Verizon Pixels.\nGoogle dropped three new Android 7.1 builds for the Pixel and Pixel XL recently, complete with the November 2016 security patches. But it wasn't immediately clear which of the three builds posted update-hungry Pixel owners should apply to their devices.\nIn the past day or so, Google has refreshed its factory images page (but curiously, not its OTA images page ) with a small but important update — specifically, which Pixel variant each build is for. Here's how it breaks down:\nNDE63U = Europe NDE63X = Verizon NDE63V is not labeled, but by process of elimination this is almost certainly for U.S. unlocked Pixels Google will probably provide similar region/carrier information when new Android builds drop each month, so if you don't want to wait around for an automatic update, it'll be a little easier to figure out which build is intended for your phone.\nIt's worth remembering that flashing a factory image or OTA with a build number that doesn't match your region probably won't do much, if any harm. We've been running NDE63X on a European Pixel XL for the past few days with no issues whatsoever. So you'll probably be fine whichever of the three you're running. (Although it may affect which automatic updates you get in the future.)\nSo good luck, and happy sideloading. (Or you could just wait for a seamless update to hit in the background.

Schmidt and Maggie Haberman New York Times November 11, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take over the job of leading Donald Trump’s transition effort, taking the helm from Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, as Trump moves to assemble a government after his stunning upset victory, several sources close to the transition team said Friday.\nChristie had been in charge of the transition for the last several months, but the surprise nature of Trump’s victory made it critical to move more quickly to assemble a team.\nAdvertisement\nThe president-elect told advisers he wanted to tap Pence’s Washington experience and contacts to help move the process along, according to people familiar with the discussions. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Pence as the process moves forward.\nChristie, along with Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who has been a top campaign supporter, will serve as vice chairs of the transition, the sources said.\nGet Political Happy Hour Trump’s administration is being assembled behind the scenes. But like much else in the nation’s capital, little stays secret for long.\nView Story A look at Trump’s transition team News broke Friday that Mike Pence would take over for Chris Christie leading Donald Trump’s transition team, along with several vice-chairs. Here’s a look at the team:\nThe list of names being mentioned as possibilities for crucial posts in Trump’s Cabinet is growing by the hour, giving official Washington what it craves most: a never-ending parlor game as speculation grows about who might actually get the nod.\nA big revelation may come soon, according to Trump himself, who took to Twitter on Friday morning with some news. “Busy day planned in New York,” the president-elect said. “Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government.”\nAdvertisement\nOne thing is clear already: Those helping Trump make the decisions are the members of his campaign’s inner circle. At Trump Tower on Friday morning, the president-elect’s closest aides arrived, one by one, waving to journalists as they entered elevators to Trump’s offices.\nThose included David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager; Steve Bannon, the campaign chief; and Hope Hicks, the campaign spokeswoman. Giuliani arrived a few minutes after Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager. Brad Parscale, the campaign’s digital director, also headed up to the top floors.\nAides to Trump have declined to confirm who is on the shortlist for Cabinet posts.",

      "text": "GUEST: \nIf you want to see the future, look to the patent office. Google recently published the full text of a patent for a contact lens that can monitor blood glucose and dispense insulin automatically, while Samsung patented a contact lens with an integrated camera just a few short weeks ago.\nThe next great wave of tech innovation may come in the form of the one of the most intimate of all wearables: contact lenses. We’re not quite there yet. Smart glasses and Snapchat Spectacles will continue to dominate the vision-tech front in the short term. But the golden age of research in contact-lens technology has officially begun.\nAs CEO of some of the world’s largest online optical companies , I can say that contact lenses are poised to get a dramatic overhaul. Here’s a look at innovations, both in the near term and further down the road, that are leading us toward the fabled “smart” contact.\nTaking lens technology to the next level Since mass-produced contacts first emerged in the 1970s, advancements have come mainly in the form of thinner, softer, and cheaper lens materials, most notably silicone hydrogel , which allows more oxygen to reach the cornea. Contacts are now more comfortable than ever (and even come in colors), but their actual functionality hasn’t changed.\nIn many respects, traditional manufacturers have been content to play it safe, sticking with a high-margin business even as Lasik and other new technologies have eaten into their share of the market. Still, contacts account for a more than $10-billion-a-year business , with more than 100 million wearers around the globe.\nThat rate of progress is about to take a major tick upward, however, thanks to advances in materials science. The first major innovation, currently in the works, is a material that will increase by roughly 30 percent the amount of time a person can safely and comfortably keep a contact lens in their eye. This translates to better and more useful lenses in the short term and also allows us to imagine much more ambitious features going forward.\nFor instance, the military is already interested in building night-vision contact lenses for use by special forces. They are backed by very real science , using the wonder-material graphene to detect light well into the infrared spectrum and fit a traditionally large detector into a tiny contact lens. The actual amount of light amplification they could provide is fairly low at present but hints at future potential.\nAlphabet (or rather, Alphabet’s life sciences subsidiary Verily) is certainly thinking past just advanced contact-lens materials, as it’s already produced working test units for a medical e-contact lens. Yes, the team formerly known as Google X has managed to produce a contact that can control a blood-glucose monitor embedded in a prescription lens. It wirelessly sends and receives data and power and can automatically trigger the release of insulin. That sort of intimacy with the wearer could also allow an e-lens to monitor common eye-health issues like macular degeneration.\nDisplays under your eyelid But the true long term potential for the contact lens — the Holy Grail that major players are feverishly pursuing — is as a display. This kind of display would track to the movement of your eyeball, layering an image over your regular vision for an even more seamless experience than Google Glass can provide.\nFull-fledged contact lens displays have actually been in the works for years. In fact, this is a contact lens display, working, back in 2009. It powers and controls a visible array of 64 pixels, safely, in a living eye, in a surface area smaller than one side of a penny. These pixels are “active,” meaning they project light. But a more efficient approach would to use “passive” pixels, which simply alter light that’s already incoming from the environment. That saves on power and reduces possible strain on the eye.\nVR and early smart glasses are already showing us a few things we could do with those pixels. Indeed, as augmented reality matures alongside contact lens technology, some truly fascinating possibilities open up. Armed with built-in cameras and displays, contacts could ostensibly become the ultimate AR platform, far more versatile and immersive than current goggle-based technology. Interestingly, major companies are already investing in the ability to develop iOS apps compatible with contact lenses, hinting at the future potential.\nAbove: EGPL’s smart contact lens wants are designed to support augmented reality\nOne caveat: Tech timetables are notoriously fluid and I’m not an expert in advanced electronics or contact lens engineering. But I can say with confidence that the optical market is shifting its focus toward developing achievable products for commercial release. While the legacy optical industry has been fairly slow-moving, tech players like Google and Samsung are giving contacts a much-needed push. Much of the needed technology exists or is in development. Consumer demand for wearables like glasses is growing . This much is clear: Contacts with screens, cameras, and even apps won’t remain science fiction for long.\nRoy Hessel is the founder and CEO of EyeBuyDirect , an online retailer of prescription eyewear.

      "text": "\nThis is Google's biggest release year in recent memory, but that comes with extra responsibility.\nMost companies in the Android world like to front-load their announcements for the first quarter (or so) of the year, but Google has consistently stuck to a Fall release schedule for all of its biggest consumer-facing products. This year was perhaps its biggest yet, dropping the Pixels , Chromecast Ultra , Google Home , Daydream View and Google Wifi all at once. And even though we're five weeks removed from the launch event, we're just now hitting the point where these products are actually shipping out in real numbers.\nI've had my Pixel and Pixel XL for about a month now (primarily using the Pixel, fwiw), but just received my Chromecast Ultra and Google Home this week. I'm still waiting for my free-with-purchase Daydream View, and though I haven't made up my mind on buying a Google Wifi I don't have a choice right now.\nUnfortunately for Google fans, the company is still pretty bad about shipping products in a timely and consistent fashion, while keeping them in stock for new buyers. Though Google has made it over the hurdle of dead websites and two-month waitlists back in the Nexus 4 days, its products are still consistently out of stock or unavailable in certain SKUs. Over a month removed from launch, the Pixel XL is still tough to come by, and models that are \"in stock\" have 3-4 week ship times. Depending on the day Google Home, Chromecast Ultra and Daydream View may actually be in stock, but with a few days to a week of lead time before shipping. How about Google Wifi? ::crickets::\nThe physical products are now the main attraction, and Google has to deliver (figuratively and literally).\nPerhaps I've been spoiled by same-day (and two day at the most) delivery from Amazon, and forget how bad ordering from the Google Store used to be, but it's still extremely frustrating to see a company the size of Google be incapable of keeping its brand new products in stock when enthusiasm is the highest. We're definitely starting to get into the swing of the holiday shopping season, and Google has to have these products ready to ship.\nThe stock and shipping issues are really indicative of Google's overall hardware shortcomings. It has shown serious ambition with this \"Made by Google\" initiative, but as our own Russell Holly astutely summarized this week , Google is a bit short on execution. The Pixels are perhaps the most complete thought of the bunch, with very few missing pieces. Chromecast Ultra is a new Chromecast — that wasn't too difficult. Google Home is a great idea but clearly needs a lot of software tuning and server-side improvements to make it actually great (or, just above average). Daydream View is clearly a great product ready to take over from Cardboard, but is launching with effectively no VR content. Again, Google Wifi? ::more crickets::\nWhen Google was just releasing products here and there, we cut it slack on the execution part of things because we always knew the true product was having you use the internet and its services as much as possible. Now with \"Made by Google\" the physical products are the main attraction, not a secondary piece of things — and it has to actually start delivering. No more half-baked ideas, no more \"it'll get better in the future\" caveats — that won't fly anymore.\nA few closing thoughts on the week that was:\nI know the HTC Bolt isn't the next amazing drool-worthy phone, but you have to give HTC credit for doing a lot of neat stuff with what would otherwise be a boring carrier-branded handset. Shame it has to be saddled with a Snapdragon 810 processor and being a Sprint exclusive — it's putting a cloud over an otherwise solid phone. Sprint is still going to use the Bolt as a centerpiece of its marketing the next few months, though, and that's going to sell a considerable number of phones. I'm excited to give the Samsung Gear S3 a try again after first seeing it over two months ago. I want to use the new software especially, but I'm not particularly enthused by how huge both models are (and I have larger-than-average wrists). I always enjoy watching people guess which phone I took my Instagram photos with. Many times they're right, sometimes they're way off. That's it for this week. This is supposedly the \"slow\" part of the year in the Android world, but we're certainly staying busy. See everyone next week.\n",

      "title": "Top considerations when securing your Android phone",
      "text": "\nKnow how to use the tools your given to keep your phone and your data secure.\nGoogle, Apple , and Microsoft have great tools for managing your online security . Some implementations may be technically better than others, but you can be reasonably sure that your data — both on the phone and in the cloud — is safe. If you need more reassurance or have different needs, third-party companies are available that with the big three to provide enterprise-grade security assurances. No method is 100% secure, and ways to get around it are found regularly; then patched quickly so the cycle can repeat. But these methods are usually complicated and very time-consuming and rarely widespread.\nThis means you are the weakest link in any chain of security. If you want to keep your data — or your company's — secured you need to force someone to use these complicated time-consuming methods if they wanted to get into your phone. Secure data needs to be difficult to obtain and difficult to decipher if someone does get hold of it.With Android, there are several things you can do to make someone work really hard to get your data — hopefully so hard that they don't bother trying.\nUse a secure lock screen \nHaving a secure lock screen is the easiest way to limit access to the data on your phone or the cloud. Whether you just left your phone on your desk while you had to walk away for a moment or two or if you've lost your phone or had it stolen a lock screen that can't be simple to bypass is the best way to limit that access.\nThe first step is to lock the front door.\nIf your company issued you a phone or you work for someone with a BYOD policy there's a good chance your phone is forced by a security policy to have password protection and your IT department may have assigned you a username and password to unlock it.\nAny method that locks your phone is better than none, but generally a random six-digit PIN is enough to require someone have special knowledge and tools to bypass it without triggering any self-destruct settings. Longer randomized alpha-numeric passwords mean they will need the right tools and a lot of time. Entering a long complex password on a phone is inconvenient for you and we tend not to use things that inconvenience us so alternatives have been thought up that use patterns, pictures, voiceprints and a host of other things easier to do than typing a long password. Read the instructions and overview for each and decide which works best for you. Just make sure you're using one.\nEncryption and two-factor authentication Encrypt all of your local data and protect your data in the cloud with two-factor authentication on your account logins.\nRecent versions of Android come encrypted by default. Android 7 uses file-level encryption for faster access and granular control. Your corporate data may have another level of security to reinforce this. Don't do anything to try and lessen it. A phone that needs to be unlocked to decrypt the data is one that only someone dedicated is going to try to crack.\nOnline accounts all need to use a strong password and two-factor authentication if offered. Don't use the same password across multiple sites and use a password manager to keep track of them. A centralized spot with all your account credentials is worth risking if it means you'll actually use good passwords.\nKnow what you're tapping on Never open a link or message from someone you don't know. Let those people email you if they need to make the first contact, and offer them the same courtesy and use email instead of a DM or a text message to get in touch with them the first time. And never click a random web link from someone you don't trust. I trust the Wall Street Journal's Twitter account, so I'll click obscured Twitter links. But I won't for someone I don't trust as much.\nTrust is a major part of security at every level.\nThe reason isn't paranoia. Malformed videos were able to cause an Android phone to freeze up and had the potential to allow elevated permissions to your file system where a script could silently install malware. A JPG or PDF file was shown to do the same on the iPhone. Both instances were quickly patched, but it's certain that another similar exploit will be found now that the \"right\" people for the job know where to look. Files sent through email will have been scanned and links in the email body are easy to spot. The same can't be said for a text message or a Facebook DM.\nOnly install trusted applications \nFor most, that means Google Play . If an app or link directs you to install it from somewhere else, decline. This means you won't need to enable the \"unknown sources\" setting required to install apps that didn't originate from a Google server in the Play Store. Only installing apps from the Play Store means Google is monitoring their behavior, not you. They are better at it than we are.\nIf you need to install apps from another source you need to make sure you trust the source itself. Actual malware that probes and exploits the software on your phone can only happen if you approved the installation. And as soon as you're finished installing or updating an app this way, turn the Unknown sources setting back on as a way to combat trickery and social engineering to get you to install an app manually.\nNone of this will make your phone 100% secure. 100% security isn't the goal here and never is. The key is to make any data that's valuable to someone else difficult to get. The higher the level of difficulty, the more valuable the data has to be in order to make getting it worthwhile.\nSome data is more valuable that others, but all of it is worth protecting.\nPictures of my dogs or maps to the best trout streams in the Blue Ridge Mountains won't require the same level of protection because they aren't of value to anyone but me. Quarterly reports or customer data stored in your corporate email may be worth the trouble to get and need extra layers.\nLuckily, even low-value data is easy to keep secure using the tools provided and these few tips.\n",

On the other hand, if you're commuting to work, the service might soothe you with tunes you like to listen to on the subway.\nGoogle's machine learning algorithms also take the weather into account, so you'll get a different set of tunes when it's raining than you would on a beautiful sunny day.\nAnd if you're concerned about privacy, don't worry: the service is opt-in.\nThe new Google Play Music also has a revamped home screen, which recommends music based on all the contextual data mentioned above, as well as your listening habits. To deliver the experience, Google mixes machine learning with human curators, and it's likely to get better at guessing what you like over time.\nFor those moments when you're out of internet connectivity, Google will also always have an offline playlist handy, even if you don't download any music yourself.\nGoogle's competitors such as Spotify and Apple Music also offer a music discovery feature, but Google's trove of data on user habits promises more precision when it comes to matching your mood, location and activity.\nGoogle says the new Play Music will start to roll out in 62 countries this week.

      "text": "Google’s self-driving cars are naturals when it comes to three-point turns Posted Lima beefs up its Dropbox alternative with the $129 Lima Ultra \nGoogle updates the world monthly on the progress of its self-driving car project, and this month’s update includes the usual stats, like over 2,230,175 miles driven in autonomous mode, as well as an explainer on how the cars handle a tricky task: multi-point turning. \nThe three-point turn is a boilerplate part of any driving test, and one that can prove quite challenging depending on where you’re trying to accomplish one. Google says that its cars have some big advantages over humans when it comes to multi-point turns, like full 360-degree wraparound vision, and extremely accurate distance measurement. \nAs a result, Google has fund that its cars could actually do maneuvers that don’t resemble the standard three-point turn but that might be more efficient overall – but that’s not ideal UX when it comes to human passengers. Humans are more comfortable when cars drive in easy that include recognizable behavior, so Google has trained its self-driving fleet not only to execute three-point turns, but to do so in a way that “feels natural” to those on board. The Google tee cars do around 1,000 multi-point turns on actual city roads per week, Google says. \nGoogle also uses the report to spell out any accidents its test cars are involved in, and they did have one to report from October 26. The self-driving car was tapped from behind going 3 mph by a vehicle going 6 mph, however, making it a minor fender-bender where the human was at fault and damage was minimal. \nIt’s interesting to get a look at how the Google team is building UX into their tech, at the same time as they’re solving difficult technical challenges. Good UX will probably be just as important to long-term user acceptance of autonomous driving tech as will safety issues, so it’s smart to build them hand-in-hand. 0",

Indeed, the first six posts, if viewed from a PC browser, combine to form one image, showing off the familiar Android mascot, along with a Pixel phone, a Pixel C tablet, Android Wear devices and apps for Android Auto and Android Pay . There are also jelly beans, lollipops, marshmallows and nougat pieces that, of course, reference current and past Android codenames (no KitKat pieces, though). There does not appear to be any hidden messages or Easter eggs, but if you spot one that you think might be a secret message, be sure to share it in the comments.\nIt will be interesting to see how much Google uses the Android Instagram channel to promote both the OS in general and its various hardware products in the future.\nCheck out Android on Instagram ",

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/Carlo Allegri\nStephen K. Bannon during a meeting at Trump Tower.\n November 15, 2016\nP residents and their presidencies are largely defined by those they pick to staff their government. On that front, President-elect Donald Trump has made two notable moves since his upset win last week.\nOne is reasonable and might even be reassuring — if the other weren’t so appalling, that is.\nThe reasonable move was naming Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff for the new administration. Priebus is a well-known face, and a figure with ties to many in the Republican Party establishment. A lawyer by training, he has been a long-time Republican political operative, first in Wisconsin and then, since 2009, at the RNC. There, he served as legal counsel and, since 2011, as chairman, a post in which he is generally credited with having done a solid job. Priebus’s downside is that he’s not known as a particularly strong or forceful manager; certainly he’s never done anything remotely comparable to the job he’ll be undertaking. Overall, however, he is a reasonable choice who may grow into the job, and whose selection signals that Trump recognizes the need for an establishment figure in his administration.\nAdvertisement\nNow for the outrageous news: Trump’s other high-level appointment is of the disreputable Stephen K. Bannon as his senior counselor and chief strategist. Bannon, the former head of the right-wing Breitbart News, doesn’t belong within 10 miles of the White House, in any capacity whatsoever. Under his tenure, Breitbart moved beyond a right-wing partisan polemical perspective and started publishing articles tinged with racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, becoming a favorite of the so-called alt-right, which might more bluntly be described as the bigoted right. No wonder, then, that former KKK leader David Duke applauded, back in August, when Trump made Bannon his campaign CEO. Or that, as the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented, white nationalists are celebrating his upcoming role in the White House.\nPersonally, Bannon is known for his profane, bullying style. Thrice married, he is credibly reported to have physically abused his second wife, Mary Louise Piccard. In 1996, California law-enforcement officials charged him with battery, misdemeanor domestic violence, and trying to dissuade his wife from filing charges; according to news reports , after an argument over a credit card, Bannon grabbed her by the neck and wrist forcefully enough to leave marks. The case against him was ultimately dismissed because Piccard did not appear for the trial. In their divorce proceedings, she said Bannon had pressured her to leave town for the trial period. In later court proceedings, she also said that Bannon disliked Jews and had not wanted their twin girls going to school with Jews. Bannon has denied making those comments.\nGet Today's Headlines Bannon’s reputation as a bigot proceeds him, which is why a number of watchdog groups are sounding the alarm. “It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the Alt Right — a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists — is slated to be a senior staff member in the ‘people’s house,’” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League.\nBut it’s not just the watchdogs who should be alarmed. No matter whom they supported in the presidential race, all fair-minded Americans should be revolted by this appointment. And they should speak up and make that revulsion known.",

According to 9to5Google , once a customer receives the code via email, they can follow the link to the Google Store where they will be able to order their free Daydream View.\nIn early October , Google announced Google Pixel and Pixel XL pre-orders would include a free Daydream View coupon when the device launched. It was only last week that Google started shipping the VR product.\nThe Daydream View is Google’s new VR headset which works in conjunction with a compatible smartphone (like the Pixel or Pixel XL). In our full Daydream View review , we said we’d hesitate to recommend the headset for the full $79 retail price. If you’re one of those who can get it for free, it’s certainly worth checking out.\nSee also: Launch day: Daydream VR apps roundup 5 days ago If you pre-ordered one of the Pixels in the US, check your inbox to see if your promo code has arrived – it’s valid until the end of this year.\nHave you received your code yet?

      "text": "Google’s new app PhotoScan turns prints into digital photos Posted Pinterest launches an ‘explore’ section for trending topics and ideas \nGoogle Photos , Google’s cloud photo storage and sharing service, aspires to be a single home to everyone’s photographs. But so far, that has only extended to the digital photos we take, as well as our personal videos. The company is today is working to change that with the launch of a new tool called PhotoScan can help you to turn printed photos into high-quality digital copies. The end result is that older photos detailing your family’s history and the pre-smartphone era can also become a part of your Google Photos experience. \nUnlike digital photos, printed photos tend to showcase more important moments, as people were choosier about which pictures to take because of the price of film and prints, explains David Lieb, the Product Lead for Google Photos, whose team developed PhotoScan. \n“But it’s very likely that you’ll lose these photos permanently,” he adds. Google estimates there are trillions of print photos out there in the world, and it wants to bring them online. \nCurrently, there are a handful of ways to turn printed photos into digital ones. You can ship them off via postal mail to a scanning service, you can buy a scanner and manually scan each one by yourself, or you can use your phone to take a picture of the existing, printed photo. \nThe latter is what many people already do (as evidenced by the Throwback Thursday postings), simply because it’s easiest. \nBut this doesn’t tend to lead to high-quality photos. Instead, images snapped with your smartphone camera tend to have a glare from the overhead light streaked across the image; they often are not properly aligned; and, if not cropped, may even show the table or surface they’re resting on as part of the digital copy. \nGoogle PhotoScan instead will help you take photos of these prints, then automatically address all these common problems. pixel-1",

      "text": "Share this Story Google PhotoScan App Turns Your Old Photographs Into Digital Memories \nA new application from Google called PhotoScan , which is part of a broader update for the Google Photos service, is making its way to Google Play. \nWith PhotoScan, Google is attempting to persuade anyone with a compatible smartphone to upload all of their old photographs to the Google Photos service. The process of scanning an old photo and uploading is made extremely simple, as a login for PhotoScan is not even required. \nTo get started, you simply open the PhotoScan app, hover over the points that are displayed on your old photo through the viewfinder, and that’s it. From there, Google’s software handles the rest, removing any possible glare, cropping, and leaving you with a high quality digital image for your safekeeping. Gone are the days of needing a bulky scanner to scan, crop, and upload your photos. \nAs I mentioned, the launch of PhotoScan is part of a larger update for Google Photos. In this update, the Photos team is introducing new editing tools for those who enjoy doing that. For editing, there is a series of filters called “looks” that users can choose from for applying to photos. The experience is similar to what you find on Instagram. Editing goes a step further with access to light, color, and “pop” tools for any photo you have. \nTo get started, follow the Google Play link below for PhotoScan, and also make sure your Google Photos app is up to date.",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nRichard Newayno, a carrier for 28 years, delivered mail along his route in Dorchester Tuesday.\nBy Megan Woolhouse Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nAnyone who thought the US Postal Service was doomed to irrelevance in the digital age should think again. The agency is looking to hire 500 full-time letter carriers and postal clerks in Massachusetts to meet demand to deliver more packages.\nThe Postal Service said an aging workforce and a wave of retirements have caused the abundance of openings in the ranks of 13,000 in Eastern Massachusetts, but filling the vacancies has posed a challenge as Boston’s economy steams along.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s not always the most attractive job. You must like walking, of course — more than half the jobs are in the city, with its dense neighborhoods best navigated by foot, not truck. And you must be willing to deliver in any weather — you know what they say about snow, rain nor gloom of night.\nAdd to that relatively modest salaries (starting at $16.06 an hour) that don’t go far in the Boston region and job demands that can include hefting packages for mega-retailer Amazon.\nGet Business Headlines “This is the most aggressive we’ve ever been in recruitment,” said John “Mike” Powers, district manager for the Greater Boston District of the US Postal Service and a 36-year employee. “Our biggest challenge is filling routes within Route 128, and the city of Boston.”\nThe hiring effort signals a potential change of fortune for the Postal Service, which had halted hiring during the 2008 recession and several years following it, Powers said.\nJust three years ago, the Postal Service considered ending Saturday delivery of letters in an effort to pare $16 billion in losses. On Tuesday, the agency reported $5.6 billion in losses for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, blaming retiree health benefit obligations. But those losses were partly offset by a jump in revenue that the agency attributes to an increased volume of package delivery.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a trend that’s been building for several years. Internet sales have been an unlikely savior, as the Postal Service has begun delivering an increasing number of packages for competitors such as FedEx and UPS, along with e-retailers such as Amazon. Nationally, revenues from package deliveries rose to $6.9 billion, up from $4.5 billion last year and $3.1 billion in 2010.\nBut more packages has meant the agency needs more people to deliver them at a time when its own workforce is aging.\nIn the Greater Boston district, extending from Boston to Worcester and the Cape and Islands, a third of postal workers are eligible to retire.\nTogether, those shifts have led to a surge in hiring for jobs that in generations past were considered a solid pathway to the American middle class.\nThe high cost of living in the Boston area has made that increasingly difficult, however. Typically, postal workers start as hourly employees, earning about $16-an-hour, with no guarantee of 40 hours. Most are eligible to become permanent employees in about a year, with pay starting around $37,000 a year, or about $17 an hour.\nThat pay doesn’t go far in Suffolk County, according to a “ Living Wage Calculator ” created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A person working full time would need to earn $24.41 an hour to support him or herself, another adult, and one child, it said. Two working adults need a minimum of a combined $17 an hour to raise a family with two children.\nPostal Service officials said the pay rate can approach $60,000 and that overtime opportunities can bump pay much higher.\n‘The job’s not for everybody. And not everybody has the capability and desire.’\nJohn “Mike” Powers, Postal Service district manager, on its hiring effort The Postal Service also gives preference to veterans, who currently make up about 18 percent of the national Postal Service workforce.\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nLetter carrier Tom Ryan sorted mail in Wellesley. The Postal Service seeks 500 more workers in the region.\nLarry Last, a postman for 40 years, is one of those carriers hanging up his satchel.\nThe 66-year-old Vietnam vet retired in early November. He said he never minded the job, which most recently included walking a 10-mile delivery route daily in Stoneham.\nHis postal pension will amount to 76 percent of his $60,000-a-year postal salary. He also works a second job at a referee instructor school to make ends meet.\nIn a state where the unemployment rate fell to a low of 3.6 percent in September, employers are competing for qualified workers, and job seekers can be more selective, said Michael Goodman, a professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\n“It’s a sign of an increasingly competitive labor market where qualified workers are harder to find,” Goodman said. “To the extent that the job itself and the day-to-day conditions at work are not appealing, it makes it harder to attract workers.”\nFinding workers who have a valid driver’s license has also been a key problem for the Postal Service. Powers said many people in the city rely on public transportation or don’t have access to a car. Uber has snatched up other employee prospects. A driver’s license is required because many routes don’t come with a delivery truck and carriers need a way to pick up mail and take it to their route, even if it will ultimately be delivered by foot.\nSome carriers find themselves walking miles a day, a treat on a glowing Autumn day, but not so enticing in February. Carriers are also hauling more packages, slippery catalogs, or chunky periodicals to customers’ doorsteps, by foot, truck — and occasionally by three-wheeled dollies.\nWhile that’s good for the industry, it can be tough on carriers. About 40 percent of new hires in Greater Boston quit within the first three months of the job, Powers said.\n“That’s part of our challenge,” Powers said. “The job’s not for everybody. And not everybody has the capability and desire to do what needs to be done.”\nYet Postal Service bureaucracy may be another hiring obstacle. Local district offices don’t even have their own Facebook page, so they have trouble attracting younger workers through social media.\nOfficials said they have been holding meet-and-greet sessions at local post offices from Chelsea to Chestnut Hill and Weymouth to Wellesley to get word out. But it hasn’t been wildly successful in an era when many don’t bother to go the post office — preferring to buy their stamps online, if they buy them at all.\nPostal carrier Richard Newayno said he’s been delivering letters and packages for 28 years, about 20 of those in the leafy Ashmont Hill section of Dorchester.\nThe 58-year-old from East Milton said the job has changed over the years, and hauling more packages and parcels can take a physical toll. But he said he plans to do the work as long as possible.\n“I like the exercise, the people, the fresh air,” he said. “That’s what keeps me going.”\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nNewayno stuffed letters into a mailbox on his route.\nMegan Woolhouse can be reached at megan.woolhouse@globe.com .

      "title": "Forget OnHub: Google’s sleek, compact wireless AC router, Google Wifi, is now available for pre-order",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIn October, Google announced a revision to the OnHub router, aptly titled Google Wifi. The new router is actually a system of routers, which use overlapping signals to provide you with better reception throughout your home. The Google Wifi router system is available for pre-order on the Google Store . \nDuring October’s event, Google’s Mario Queiroz introduced the new Wi-Fi system, detailing the impressive behind-the-scenes work the router (or routers) do to ensure you receive the best possible reception even as you move throughout your home. The Google Wifi system uses mesh networks to essentially bathe your home in a durable, powerful, Wi-Fi signal. In a news post on Tuesday, Google’s Sanjay Noronha elaborated on precisely how the Google Wifi system works. \nMore: Goodbye, Google Cast! App gets rebranded as the more inclusive Google Home \nYou can buy Google Wifi as just a single router for $129, or as part of a three-pack for $299. According to Google, when you set up the three-router system, your phone or mobile device will seamlessly transition between your various access points, using a background network-assist system which will transition you to the best Wi-Fi access point. It will even juggle you between Wi-Fi channels to make sure you’re not on one that’s too congested by other devices. \nAnother feature introduced at the Google Event will allow parents or router administrators to control access to the routers via a companion app. As was demonstrated, you will be able to pause the internet connection of any device connected to your home router. For instance, a parent could pause their kids’ internet connections to compel them to come to dinner. Or you could pause your roommate’s Wi-Fi when they don’t pay their part of the internet bill — or the rent. \nNaturally, your home router already likely has this functionality but it is buried in the administrator settings and not quite as accessible as the Google Wifi companion app aims to be. \nThe Google Wifi system is available for pre-order and will ship sometime in December. Just in time for the holidays and just the right size for stocking stuffers.",

      "text": "Ballet and business both demand exacting performance to succeed. In fact, both a Google executive and NASA&apos;s first black female astronaut credit their career successes, in part, to their dance training. It takes precision, discipline, and countless hours of hard work to succeed as a dancer.\nAnd, as Lucy Bowen McCauley , artistic director and choreographer for Bowen McCauley Dance, points out, \"It&apos;s called show business, not show art.\" McCauley, who serves on Arlington, Virginia&apos;s Chamber of Commerce board, is also a member of the Arlington Economic Development Commission. Here are some other lessons that make the leap from ballet to business. \nPerfect Your Technique Before they can ever perform on stage, ballet dancers spend hours at the barre perfecting each tiny movement. This is perhaps the best example of applying the 10,000-hour rule—that you need to practice for 10,000 hours before you become truly proficient—an idea popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers .\nStanford Makishi , New York City Center [Photo: Erica Freudenstein] \"A dancer must put in the hours, there are no alternatives,\" says Stanford Makishi , vice president for programming at New York City Center. \"Even naturally gifted dancers require repetition and work hard in order to make their instrument [body] an expressive and communicative tool.\"\nMake it Your Own Going from good to great, an idea popularized by Jim Collins , is often discussed at DanceWorks Chicago , says cofounder Julie Nakagawa. \"Going from good to great is a daily journey,\" she says. You can’t just settle on performing the dance as it has been done before. You need to use creativity and curiosity to put your own spin on it and find a new way to tell an old story because \"if you are just repeating things, you’re not moving the art form forward,\" she says.\n\nDoing that requires a willingness to be brave, take risks, and be vulnerable, says Makishi. Little things, such as your gaze and the tilt of your head, are the difference between a good dancer and a great dancer, he says. \"You need to be hyperaware of what you’re doing and fine-tune every aspect.\"\nJulie Nakagawa , Chicago DanceWorks [Photo: Cheryl Mann] Recognize That Everyone Plays a Role One person can’t carry the performance or a business. \"It doesn’t work well if one person is trying to do everything,\" says Nakagawa. Performances turn out best when everyone is working to their full potential, maximizes the role they play, and has a strong sense of responsibility, she says.\nThe best leader doesn’t micromanage. They will focus on each team member’s strengths and offer recognition. \"Appeal to their strengths and give them responsibility, and they will achieve their goals,\" Richard S. Wellins, coauthor of Your First Leadership Job: How Catalyst Leaders Bring Out the Best In Others , told Fast Company in a previous interview . \nNever Stop Learning Earning a degree or being recognized in your field doesn’t mean it’s time to stop learning. Even the best ballet dancers will continue to work on their craft and take a daily class. \"You can’t cut out daily practice or it will show up on stage,\" says McCauley. Some of the most successful people in business are lifelong learners who are constantly growing, by being open to new ideas and willing to learn from others.\nLucy Bowen McCauley , Bowen McCauley Dance [Photo: John McCauley] Build Trust \"Whether you’re an executive at a multinational firm or a dancer, you need to trust your partner and others implicitly,\" says Max \"Meredith\" Hodges , executive director of the Boston Ballet. When two dancers perform together in a pas de deux, it requires an immense amount of trust, she says.\nMax Hodges , Boston Ballet [Photo: Liza Voll, courtesy of Boston Ballet] \"The dance depends on split-second timing, and you’re not able to look back to see if your partner is with you,\" says Hodges, who has a Harvard MBA and once worked at Bain and Company. \"You have to trust they will be there.\" The same is true in business. Employees who feel trusted tend to take more risks, move more quickly, and put more of themselves into their work. They don’t feel the need to hold back and, as a result, creativity flourishes and productivity rises .\nFind Your Audience If you don’t find the right audience for your product, your business won’t succeed. Running a dance troupe is the same. McCauley doesn’t just sit back and hope that an audience comes to performances. She brings dance to the community through a residency program that offers dance classes at local schools, as well as free community performances and a free weekly dance class for people with Parkinson’s disease and their caretakers. McCauley says these strategic partnerships allow her to bring performances to those who think they don’t like dance, or that they can’t afford it, and open their eyes to its benefits.\nLucy Bowen McCauley [Photo: Jeff Malet] Seek Feedback Dancers don&apos;t see feedback as a criticism. \"Without question, being a professional dancer means you are getting constant feedback,\" Hodges says. \"If the teacher offers you feedback, that is a compliment,\" she says, \"because the teacher thinks you’re worth their time.\"\n\nThe most successful people are those who are better at handling negative feedback. \"Being able to accept feedback requires a modicum of critical self-awareness,\" says Mark Murphy, founder of Leadership IQ and author of Hiring for Attitude . As he told Fast Company in a previous interview : \"Nobody who’s doing anything worthwhile is going to skate through a situation without feedback.\"",

      "text": "× Hi! \nYou are about to activate our Facebook Messenger news bot. Once subscribed, the bot will send you a digest of trending stories once a day. You can also customize the types of stories it sends you. \nClick on the button below to subscribe and wait for a new Facebook message from the TC Messenger news bot. \nThanks, TC Team Google signs on to the .NET Foundation as Samsung brings .NET support to Tizen Posted Zwift, a multiplayer game that’s making indoor athletics more social, just raised $27 million \nMicrosoft is hosting its annual Connect(); developer event in New York today. With .NET being at the core of many of its efforts, including on the open source side, it’s no surprise that the event also featured a few .NET-centric announcements as well. For the most part, these center around the .NET Foundation , the open source organization Microsoft established to guide the future development of the .NET Core project. \nAs the company announced today, Google is now a member of the .NET Foundation, where it joins the likes of Red Hat, Unity, Samsung JetBrains and (of course) Microsoft in the Technical Steering Group. \nGoogle already allows developers on its Cloud Platform to deploy .NET applications thanks to its support for Windows Server and offers .NET libraries for more than 200 of its cloud services. The company is also an active .NET contributor already. Today’s announcement doesn’t come as a complete surprise then, but it’s still interesting to see that two companies that compete on so many other fronts still find room to work together on other projects. \nSamsung, too, is deepening its commitment to .NET by launching support for it on its Tizen platform . As Samsung’s Hong-Seok Kim told me, Samsung was looking for a framework in addition to the web framework and C API that Tizen developers currently use to write their applications. “We looked into alternatives but .NET was superior,” he said and noted that Samsung was looking for a framework with a strong foundation in terms of language support, APIs and tooling, as well as one with a large built-in developer base and open source community. “.NET has been around for a long time and we liked how open Microsoft was about .NET,” he also noted and added that Microsoft’s patent promise around .NET also helped the company make this decision. \nGiven .NET’s existing ecosystem, Samsung surely hopes that this move will also broaden its own Tizen developer ecosystem. In this first release, which will be available as a developer preview today, Samsung’s team focused on bringing .NET to smartphones. By default, though, Tizen is an operating system for lots of different devices, including TVs and watches. Over time, Samsung plans to expand its .NET support to other devices as well. Samsung is also making a Visual Studio extension and documentation available for .NET developers who want to look into writing apps for Samsung’s operating system. 0",

      "title": "Google joins Microsoft’s .NET Foundation",
      "text": "As part of its slew of announcements at its Connect(); 2016 developer event in New York City today, Microsoft unveiled that Google is joining the .NET Foundation. Specifically, Google is becoming a member of the Technical Steering Group, which Microsoft says “reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community” and also underlines “Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET.”\nAt its Build 2014 developer conference, Microsoft created the .NET Foundation, a group for overseeing the open sourcing of .NET. In March 2016, Microsoft formed the Technical Steering Group to share the direction of .NET’s core components with other companies and interested parties. Unity, JetBrains, and RedHat joined the foundation at that point, and Samsung followed in June.\nSo what does Google joining actually mean? In short, Google will help steer the future of .NET in a way that is “similar to an open standard,” Xamarin co-founder and now Microsoft’s vice president of mobile developer tools Nat Friedman told VentureBeat.\nGoogle’s decision is being driven out of its enterprise business ( Google Cloud ) and the desire to keep up with businesses adopting public and hybrid clouds. The company sees it the move as part of its commitment to open source technology, which benefits all enterprises, and cross-platform development that gives developers and IT professionals access to the best tools.\n“.NET is a key component in the modern enterprise, and the Google Cloud Platform team has worked hard to ensure that .NET has first-class support on Google’s infrastructure, including excellent infrastructure for Windows,” Google product manager Chris Sells said in a statement. “For years, Google has offered .NET libraries for more than 200 of its cloud services. More recently, we’ve built native GCP support for Visual Studio and PowerShell. Google is already an active contributor to .NET, including heavy involvement in the ECMA specification for C#. Joining the Technical Steering Group for the .NET Foundation expands our participation.”\nMore than half of the GitHub contributions to .NET’s corefx and coreclr come from outside of Microsoft. It thus makes sense for tech companies that are helping shape .NET to also have a say in the platform’s future.\n",

      "text": "Travel the world with Google’s new Google Earth VR program From San Francisco to Florence share Google announced today that it was bringing its satellite-powered location tracker, Google Earth, to the HTC Vive. Available through Steam, Google Earth VR lets users visit various landmarks around the world, providing them with a 360-degree, immersive view. According to the company, “you can fly over a city, stand at the edge of a mountain, and even soar into space.” As of right now, the app is only available to use through the Vive. Google has not said if it plans to make the program accessible through its new, lower-end VR headset, the Daydream . The company recently released its ultra-powerful, VR-capable phone, the Pixel , so there’s a good chance that Google will eventually bring the app to specific phones. Google isn’t the only company interested in allowing VR users to see world landmarks, however. Microsoft announced in October that it was working on a program called HoloTour that would allow headset wearers to visit different cities around the world through a totally immersive VR experience. Google Earth VR is available to download right now for free via Steam . More From Polygon",

Chocolate cheese is a thing now. Watercooler Johnny Lieu / 1 hour ago Chocolate and cheese, it's not just a Ween album. Image: instagram/vicmarket \nOccasionally, you might find yourself craving something a little sweet and a little salty. But you probably wouldn't think chocolate-infused cheese could be the solution to that problem. \nDairy specialist Curds & Whey in Melbourne, Australia, is providing just that. The Italian blue cheese called Choco 21 has been ripened in a chocolate liqueur, then rubbed with cocoa and decorated with chocolate chips. And while it sounds a bit suspect, the foodies are loving it.",

      "text": "MOSCOW — Russia's state internet watchdog added social network LinkedIn to its official blacklist on Thursday. \nAll of the country's internet providers are obliged to enact the ban, Roskomnadzor said on its website. \nHowever, LinkedIn appeared accessible from NBC News' office in Moscow on Thursday afternoon. A LinkedIn logo. ROBERT GALBRAITH / Reuters, file \nThe social network aimed at job seekers and recruiters ran afoul of a 2015 Russian law requiring all personal data of Russians to be stored on servers inside the country. \nInternet giants Google, Facebook and Twitter are also liable. None have voiced any plans to move servers to Russia, but have faced no repercussions from the Russian government so far. \nLinkedIn was sued by Roskomnadzor for its failure to comply earlier this year, and lost the case and the appeal in Moscow last week. \nA spokesman for the watchdog had earlier said that LinkedIn was punished for alleged leaks of user data, Russian media reported. \nInformation about 120 million LinkedIn user accounts was stolen in 2012, the attack reportedly blamed on Russian hackers. \nLinkedIn has not publicly commented on the issue, but has requested a meeting with Roskomnadzor, watchdog spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky told TASS state news agency last week. \nLinkedIn says it has 460 million users, including 6 million in Russia. \nRussia was ranked 52nd out of 65 countries and ranked \"non-free\" in the 2016 Freedom on the Net report by the Freedom House rights watchdog.

      "text": "Slide: 1 / of 2 . Caption: Google \nSlide: 2 / of 2 . Caption: BIG Author: Sam Lubell. Sam Lubell Design Date of Publication: 11.17.16. Time of Publication: 12:56 pm. 12:56 pm Google’s A-Team Architects Will Shape Its New London HQ Google \nBjarke Ingels Group and Heatherwick Studio—the same design firms working on Google’s Mountain View, CA headquarters—are now moving ahead on the company’s new London offices. Unlike most of Google’s buildings, this one will be vertical—a 10-story structure that the two firms describe as a cross between a Silicon Valley startup garage and a London train shed. \n“We’ve tried to create an interestingness that fits the scale and the community of King’s Cross,” the two firms noted in a statement released this week, of a project they say “couples clarity with eccentricity and anchors innovation with heritage.” \nGoogle wouldn’t let the design firms comment directly, but a massing model released by BIG shows a wedge-shaped building that abuts John McAslan’s lacy, semi-circular addition to the King’s Cross train station’s Western Concourse. In recent years a massive redevelopment has transformed King’s Cross, on London’s North Side, into a burgeoning urban hub that includes 50 new buildings, 10 new parks, and 30,000 new residents. It’s a central part of London’s so-called Knowledge Quarter, which includes 75 research and innovation organizations within a mile radius of King’s Cross. \nBIG and Heatherwick’s new edifice will be Google’s first purpose-built structure outside the United States. (The company often reuses existing structures.) It joins a growing Google campus at King’s Cross, which will eventually include three offices and house 7,000 employees in more than 1 million square feet of space. BIG \nAnd like most of Google’s buildings, it’ll likely be designed to keep those employees around as long as possible. A scrapped plan for the site by London-based AHMM featured rooftop gardens meant to encourage employee lounging, eating, and relaxation. An interior rendering of the new office shows a multi-level, open work space warmed by wood walls, internal plantings, and natural light. \nGoogle has at times struggled to fit into new neighborhoods, its force of money and culture overwhelming its locality and driving up rents. It’s hard to say what impact it will have on this rapidly evolving part of London, but it’s tempting to look to Heatherwick’s other King’s Cross development, Coal Drops Yard, for clues. The firm transformed the former coal yard into a canal-side shopping area by stitching together two 19th century buildings by their curved, gabled roofs. This respect for history, combined with an audacious willingness to create something utterly new, is likely to be echoed in BIG and Heatherwick’s plans for Google. Both design firms are experts at nailing a place’s aesthetic. Whether they can do the same for its culture remains to be seen.",

      "text": "Can a neural network learn to recognize doodles? Google intends to find out.\nGoogle has always had a vested interest in developing and exposing people to the growing power of machine learning technologies. Their most entertaining way of doing this is through their A.I. experiments , which invite the public to explore machine learning by playing with pictures, music and language.\n\nTheir latest experiment, Quick, Draw! lets you play a virtual game of pictionary against a neutral network that will try and guess what you're doodling in under 20 seconds. You'll be given six words to draw. Once you start drawing, the A.I. instantly starts trying to guess what you're drawing — meaning the first guess is typically 'a line'.\nIt's a fun little time waster for us, but a valuable learning tool for Google's machine learning development. Once you've completed your drawing, you can go in and click your drawing to see the logic behind the scenes that the A.I. used to guess your doodle. You can then scroll down a bit further and see what other people drew for that word. Reviewing the other doodles, it becomes pretty clear which were drawn with a mouse, and which were drawn with a laptop touchpad.\n\nThe game has taken the world by storm, being shared far beyond the typical tech experiment. That's probably because it's actually really fun — especially if you're a terrible doodler, like a lot of us!\nIf you're looking for more fun A.I. experiments to play around with, you can find them all right here , including other experimental apps for Chrome and Android found from the dropdown menu.\n  Popular Tech Deals Dell XPS 13 non-touch with Kaby Lake $882 using coupon code TENOFF Dell PlayStation Pro Now shipping! $399 Amazon Amazon Fire TV Media Player (Refurb): 2nd Gen 4K for $65 Amazon Panlong Bluetooth OBD2 OBDII Car Diagnostic Scanner Check Engine Light for Android $13 Amazon",

      "text": " Google+\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nHope Daniels and HomeStart worker Gabrielle Vacheresse held hands Thursday at the “Housing Surge” event in South Boston. Daniels, who had been homeless, got an apartment through the event.\nBy Cristela Guerra Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nIt still hasn’t hit Tommy D. As of Thursday morning, he officially has a home address.\nBefore Christmas, the 51-year-old is expected to move into his new apartment.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s a one-bedroom in Charlestown, not far from family.\nHere, for the first time in a long time, he’ll have a room he doesn’t share with four others.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign For the first time in a long time, he’ll have a roof of his own over his head. He’s thinking about getting a dog. A Boston terrier. Tommy D. didn’t want to use his last name for fear of embarrassing his family. He said he spent 17 years on the street and in and out of shelters.\n“Booze stole my spirit,” Tommy D. said. “Now, I’m getting it back.”\nThursday morning, he was one of 31 people who walked into the Labouré Center in South Boston homeless and walked out with an apartment from the Boston Housing Authority.\nAdvertisement\nTen more got vouchers for housing.\nRaised in Dorchester, Tommy D., who’s sober now, preferred sleeping on cobblestone to shelters. In his new place, he’s going to cook simple meals. Maybe grilled cheese or hot dogs.\n“I can’t even begin to tell you how I feel,” Tommy D. said.\n“There’s no drug in the world that’s as strong as this high.”\nBoston city officials call the event a “Housing Surge.” The title is appropriate. There was an energy, a humming throughout the morning as people began getting placed in new housing, vacant units the housing authority had set aside for the surge.\nThe one-stop shop began about 5:30 a.m.\n“Since we started doing these, every organization is more energized than they were before,” said Sheila A. Dillon, chief of housing for the City of Boston.\n‘It’s not typical that you can walk in and . . . leave with an address.’\nLaila Bernstein Representatives from many key agencies filled rooms: MassHealth , the medical plan for low-income residents; the Social Security Administration; Catholic Charities; and the BostonHome Interfaith Collaborative, whose members volunteered at the event. What can take months was completed in hours as specialists helped eligible people fill out applications and collect paperwork. There were quiet rooms for private counseling.\n“There’s almost nothing you can’t do here today,” said Emily Cooper, chief housing officer for the state Executive Office of Elder Affairs. “If you take advantage of everything here, you’re walking out with an apartment, services to support you in that apartment, food stamps, finding out about the resources in your community from elder service agencies, and a full belly. That is the goal.”\nMayor Martin J. Walsh’s goal is to end chronic homelessness by 2018.\nWalsh, who visited Thursday, said homes have been found for nearly 1,000 homeless people since 2014. The target population Thursday was the chronically homeless over the age of 50. An estimated 52 people showed up, and 41 left with housing of some kind. Eight others will likely get housing offers pending documentation.\n“It’s not typical that you can walk in and that day leave with an address,” said Laila Bernstein, adviser to the mayor for the Initiative to End Chronic Homelessness.\nFrancisco Soberal, 51, walked in hoping for the best possible outcome. He has been in and out of shelters for several years, he said. Originally from Puerto Rico, he was ready to have a place of his own. He wanted to invite friends from the island to visit him in Boston.\n“It’s sad; it’s a hard life,” Soberal said in Spanish. “You have to be careful. I’ve kept warm with cardboard, and I’m cautious about strangers. You don’t feel safe. All the people here are in the same fight as I am. I wish them well. We’re all fighting to move forward with our lives.”\nThough his faith in God taught him patience, depression still overwhelms him.\nIt took a few hours Thursday to move through the various stations in the building. Oscar Cartagena, housing placement specialist at the Pine Street Inn, a well-known haven for the homeless, expected Soberal to qualify for an apartment.\nBut Soberal would need to wait a little longer.\nThe man with the ruddy complexion tried to keep a smile on his face.\n“Well,” he said. “It’s a beautiful day anyway. Not everyone’s luck is the same.”\nHope Daniels, 50, shuffled around the building in a bright red Santa hat that said “Naughty.”\nIt’s her favorite hat, and she wears it from November to January.\n“It says naughty,” the grandmother said. “But I’m very good.”\nShe didn’t want to miss any opportunity. Gabrielle Vacheresse, housing search program manager with the nonprofit HomeStart, an organization that assists in finding permanent housing for the homeless, said Daniels is probably on every waiting list for housing in the city. The Dorchester woman with a bracelet that says “Back on my Feet” survived a brain tumor. She lost her hair. She was devastated after her mother’s passing a few years ago.\n“I got good people backing me now. I didn’t care about nothing for months. Not clean clothes or washing up,” Daniels said. “I would’ve given up a long time ago if it weren’t for Gaby.”\nLike Soberal, she waited for housing. Hope stayed hopeful.\n“I got grandbabies that want to visit me,” Daniels said.\n“I can’t have them come to see me at Pine Street.”\nBy the end of the day, Vacheresse said Daniels got placed in an apartment.\nCristela Guerra can be reached at cristela.guerra@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nDamon Winter/The New York Times\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Jim Tankersley The Washington Post November 18, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\nAdvertisement\nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump’s tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n‘‘Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,’’ the company said in a statement. ‘‘We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.’’\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate’s frequent campaign attacks on Ford’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n‘‘I’ve had a very good meeting with him,’’ Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. ‘‘He’s a very good listener and he knows the facts.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/File\nJared Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump, at Trump Tower in New York earlier this week.\nBy Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman New York Times November 17, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, has consulted with lawyers about the possibility of joining the new administration, a move that could run afoul of federal nepotism laws and would all but certainly invite legal challenges.\nKushner, 35, had been planning to return to his private businesses after Election Day. But on the morning after Trump won, he began discussing a role in the White House, according to two people briefed on his discussions, who requested anonymity to describe his thinking.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is urging him to join, according to one of the people briefed, a sentiment shared by Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist for the White House, and Reince Priebus, who was named chief of staff.\nKushner has consulted with at least one lawyer and believes that by forgoing a salary and putting his investment fund, his real estate holdings and his newspaper, The New York Observer, into a blind trust, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules, according to one of the people briefed.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Still, it is not clear that such an arrangement would be legal. Under federal statute, the president cannot accept voluntary services that are not permitted by law, and a separate statute bars public officials from employing family members in any capacity.\nView Story In Trump’s orbit, son-in-law expected to stay a power center Jared Kushner is likely to continue to wield considerable influence in the new administration.\nTrump denies seeking security clearances for children Presidents have wide latitude to let relatives into secret circles\nThose discussions were disclosed as Trump’s transition pivoted on Thursday, trying to leave behind the disarray of its first week for an accelerated schedule of official meetings, including Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with a world leader, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.\nLater Thursday, Trump’s team planned to announce the officials who will coordinate the handoff at the crucial national security agencies, as well as at the Justice Department. These so-called landing teams will make contact with the Pentagon and the State Department and begin the transfer of control to the new administration. For people in the vast government bureaucracy, it will be the first time since Trump’s victory last week that they have heard from a representative of the incoming administration.\nAdvertisement\nThese emissaries will also provide an insight into the new administration’s priorities for running the government’s national security apparatus, since they will populate the agencies with hundreds of political appointees, from deputy secretaries to midlevel officials.\nTrump’s aides have dismissed reports that the transition was in flux. They said that the news media and disgruntled people were stoking negative accounts, and that the wholesale shake-up of the transition leadership ranks — including the ouster of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey — reflected a drive by Vice President-elect Mike Pence to rid the operation of lobbyists.\nTrump, who has continued to work out of his office in Trump Tower, was scheduled to receive a stream of visitors on Thursday, including Henry A. Kissinger, a former secretary of state; Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who has emerged as a candidate for secretary of state; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency and the top officer at the military’s Cyber Command; and Gen. Jack Keane, a former vice chief of staff of the Army who has been a longtime informal adviser to Hillary Clinton.\nSome of these visitors, like Haley, are candidates for Cabinet posts. Others, like Kissinger, were invited to give the president-elect counsel. Keane, who has advised Republicans as well as Democrats, was an early proponent of President George W. Bush’s troop surge in Iraq. He has called for more aggressive U.S. military action to counter the Islamic State.\nThe frenzy of speculation about marquee Cabinet posts continued, with Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, seen as a leading contender to take over the Department of Homeland Security. But Trump’s staff appeared to be working on a more methodical schedule of interviewing candidates.\nStill, the confusion of the first few days has left a mark. The State Department, for example, has had no role in planning for Trump’s meeting with Abe, who leads America’s linchpin ally in the Pacific. During the campaign, Trump made several provocative remarks about Japan, declaring that it needed to pay more to provide for its own defense and suggesting that it consider acquiring nuclear weapons.\nTrump also vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama’s ambitious Asian trade deal, on which Abe expended significant political capital at home to join.\n“We stand ready to support him and his team with any information that they might require,” John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday. “We are ready and able to provide context if it is desired.”\n“There has been no outreach to date,” he added.\nSome of the people said to be in the running for top positions in a Trump administration have come under scrutiny.\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is on a shortlist for secretary of state, is grappling with questions about his web of business ties, including to foreign states like Qatar, and the millions of dollars he was paid for speeches.\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is being considered for attorney general or defense secretary, has been criticized for racially tinged comments he made as a federal prosecutor in Alabama decades ago. Those comments helped capsize his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to be a federal district judge.\nRelated In Trump’s orbit, son-in-law Jared Kushner expected to stay a power center Donald Trump denies seeking security clearances for children Presidents have wide latitude to let relatives into secret circles",

Not only was he Boston born and bred, he had been a state legislator for 16 years.\nHe discovered that he had perhaps taken a bit for granted.\nAdvertisement\nAt a campaign event in Jamaica Plain, a retired school administrator named Patricia Kelly asked a question that got under his skin: “What are you going to do about racism in Boston?”\nBy his own admission, Walsh responded defensively and superficially. He said he had represented a diverse legislative district and founded a program to bring people of color into the building trades. But that didn’t mean he was prepared to say what he would do as mayor about race.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign He wasn’t.\nView Story Mayor’s city race dialogue to start next Saturday The discussion Nov. 19 is an effort to help Boston heal from its troubled past and become “a more socially cohesive and resilient city,’’ officials said.\n“I realized I was just learning, that it was my first day of learning about it,” Walsh said this week. “Even though I’d spent 16 years as an elected official, I was just learning about it that night. I knew about it and knew there was racism in Boston — and as a white, Irish-Catholic politician, it’s a difficult thing to talk about. It doesn’t roll off your tongue like other things do.”\nOn Saturday, Walsh will kick off a citywide dialogue on race at the Cutler Majestic Theater. Going where few white politicians dare, he believes the city needs to have an open discussion. The event is planned as the first of several across the city.\nAdvertisement\nWalsh doesn’t really know what the conversation will or can accomplish. But he is convinced that it is a discussion that a changing city needs to embrace.\n“What would I like? Obviously I’d like a harmonious, peaceful, understanding community of everybody,” Walsh said. “But, in saying that, these dialogues are going to bring up hard feelings. They’re also going to educate people.”\nThe idea of convening a conversation on race has been percolating for a long time. Walsh has held two closed-door meetings with diverse community groups to discuss the issue and sought input from community leaders and people of color on his staff.\nOn the other hand, the turmoil over racial incidents at Boston Latin School illustrated just how potent and sensitive racial issues remain. Walsh’s awkward handling of it didn’t win universal acclaim, either. Both he, and the city, have plenty of work to do in learning how to address racially sensitive matters.\nSuch is the longstanding reluctance to try to talk candidly about race that I asked Walsh why he had decided to make the attempt. If Boston politics has a third-rail issue, surely this is it.\n“Sometimes it’s good to deal with the third rail,” Walsh said. “I’m the mayor of Boston; I’m the mayor of everyone. I think it’s important to have this dialogue. This date was set long before the presidential election, but I think it’s even more important now to have the dialogue. In a lot of ways, it’s a divided country, and you don’t pull together unless you have dialogue.”\nKelly, Walsh’s campaign interlocutor, is a veteran of Boston’s racial divides. An African-American teacher, she began her career at an elementary school in Charlestown in 1974, the first year of court-ordered desegregation. She went on to become a principal and assistant superintendent before retiring five years ago. She and her husband now conduct cultural competency training , mostly for educators .\nWalsh invited her to City Hall last year to thank her for prodding him to think more seriously about the city’s racial issues. Kelly says she welcomes the new series of conversations but hopes Walsh’s efforts don’t end there. She’s especially interested, she says, in seeing how the city addresses the ongoing racial issues at Boston Latin.\n“It’s always great to have dialogues,” she said. “But at some point you need to take action.”\nShe’s right. But pushing people to see what they’ve overlooked can be an important step, too.\nAdrian Walker is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at adrian.walker@globe.com .

      "text": "Writer James Welch is celebrated in the main image on Google today, which would have been his 76th birthday. (Image courtesy Google) \nA Man and a Movement \nJames Welch , like many Americans, was a child of multiple cultures. The Blackfeet of his father’s family and the Gros Ventre of his mother’s had different origins, but had come together by the 19th century in Montana, creating a rich cultural and linguistic background for following generations. Today, on what would have been his 76th birthday, he’s celebrated in the central logo illustration on Google. It also comes in the middle of Native American Heritage Month . \nBorn in 1940, Welch was a young man in the 1960s when fellow Native American Billy Mills won the Olympic gold medal in the men’s 10,000-meter race and Native American cultural pride and awareness was rising along with the predominantly African American civil rights movement. \nOut of those years, that struggle, and that heritage came a whole generation of authors whose work has become known as the Native American Renaissance. Music, painting, sculpture and other arts and cultural expressions (including the revival of traditional non-instrument navigation in Hawaii ) were revived and expanded during this time as well, and have awoken the rest of the U.S. to the continued presence and vitality of richly diverse native cultures. (Explore the work of Native American contemporary artists on Google Arts & Culture.) \nJames Welch himself had a distinct voice and ever-changing approach that was an inspiration to his colleagues. Paraphrased in Welch’s 2003 obituary in The Missoulian , fellow author Ivan Doig said that “Welch wrote about what it means to be an Indian in modern American society. He wrote about the people of the West without glorification, without cliche in an honest, clear voice from an intimate perspective.” \nWelch’s Writing \nUnconventional in many ways, Welch explored new ways of telling different stories with each novel. The simple, direct prose of these novels has been hailed for speaking authentically from the Native American perspective in a contrasting format to the poetry that attracts a greater number of Native authors. \nHis first novel, “Winter in the Blood,” in 1974 told of the struggles and sadness of contemporary life on a reservation. Twenty years later, “Killing Custer” resurrected the lives and concerns of the Sioux and Cheyenne so often dismissed en masse from tellings of the story. Welch’s Poetry Foundation profile contains summaries of each of his major novels. \nA film version of “Winter in the Blood,” was released in 2012. In a mixed review, the LA Times said it was “a difficult film to get a handle on, not least because it often feels like it should be easier to dismiss. But then it locks onto a moment that is unexpectedly arresting and little jabs of poetic meaning or hard-earned truths reel a viewer back in.” (The film version is available for digital rental on You Tube.) This is a recurrent challenge for anyone interested in films and writing from underrepresented cultures: when the creators are coming from outside the main stream, the more fresh and authentic they are, the more our brains skip and stutter as the usual expectations aren’t followed. \nThat’s perhaps the greatest value of writers like James Welch: they somehow find a way to express a little-heard and very particular perspective in an authentic way that is still accessible to readers from outside that culture. It is communication at its best. \nE Pluribus Unum \nIn recent weeks, the concerns of Native Americans have been brought to the national consciousness in the U.S. much more prominently than they had for some time. In two major cases, with the Standing Rock Sioux and the Blackfeet Tribe , the U.S. government listened to objections over oil development that put clean water and sacred sites at risk, and people of all cultures have shown their support. \nThis Native American Heritage Month, writers like James Welch can broaden everyone’s exposure to Native American culture and individuals, pushing beyond headlines, and facilitating the communication between people of all backgrounds that for 400 years has been life in the New World at its best. \nExplore More",

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., President-elect Trump’s pick for attorney general.\nAfter Sessions became one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump this February, he became an adviser on almost every major decision and policy proposal Trump made during the campaign:\nAdvertisement\n- A top Sessions aide helped Trump communicate his immigration policy.\n- Sessions chaired Trump national security advisory committee.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

(Sessions was also in the running himself for the No. 2 job.)\nView Story Donald Trump picks Jeff Sessions for AG Donald Trump has asked Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo to be director of the CIA.\n‘‘The president-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama’s attorney general and U.S. attorney,’’ a Trump transition statement released Thursday read. ‘‘It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.’’\nHere’s a crash course in a politician likely to be a pivotal figure in Trump’s administration:\nThe basics: Advertisement\nSessions has served as a senator from Alabama for two decades. But Alabama is such a loyal state to its top lawmakers that Sessions is actually the junior senator from the state; Republican Sen. Richard Shelby has been in office three decades.\nSessions is popular back home: Aside from his first election in 1996, Sessions has never won with less than 59 percent of the vote. In 2014, he ran unopposed.\nHis middle name is: ‘‘Beauregard.’’ (Fun trivia fact.)\nHe’s ‘‘amnesty’s worst enemy’’: The conservative National Review crowned Sessions with that title in 2014, with good reason. Sessions has opposed nearly every immigration bill that has come before the Senate the past two decades that has included a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.\nHe’s also fought legal immigration, including guest worker programs for illegal immigrants and visa programs for foreign workers in science, math and high-tech. In 2007, Sessions got a bill passed essentially banning for 10 years federal contractors who hire illegal immigrants.\n‘‘Legal immigration is the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States,’’ Sessions argued in a 2015 Washington Post op-ed. ‘‘... What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together.’’\nHe’s a debt hawk and a military hawk: Sessions, a lawyer before he became a politician, is known for touring Alabama with charts warning of the United States’ ‘‘crippling’’ debt. On foreign policy, Sessions has advocated a get-tough approach, once voting against an amendment banning ‘‘cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment’’ of prisoners.\nThese are two positions that could put him at odds with the president he’ll serve: Trump has expensive plans that involve significant spending, like $1 trillion on an infrastructure program -- and he campaigned on a strong non-interventionist worldview (often claiming, inaccurately, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started).\nHe’s a climate change skeptic: Here’s Sessions in a 2015 hearing questioning Environmental Protection Agency’s Gina McCarthy: ‘‘Carbon pollution is CO2, and that’s really not a pollutant; that’s a plant food, and it doesn’t harm anybody except that it might include temperature increases.’’\nAccusations of racism have dogged Sessions’s career: Actually, they almost derailed it. In 1986, a Senate committee denied Sessions, then a 39-year-old U.S. attorney in Alabama, a federal judgeship. His former colleagues testified Sessions used the n-word and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were ‘‘OK, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.’’\nBy the time the testimony was finished, Sessions’s ‘‘reputation was in tatters,’’ wrote Isaac Stanley-Becker in The Post this July, on the eve of Sessions delivering a prime time speech at the Republican National Convention for Trump.\nIn 1986, Sessions defended himself against accusations of racism. ‘‘I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,’’ he told the very same Senate Judiciary Committee he now sits on. ‘‘I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks.’’\nAnd he told Stanley-Becker this summer: ‘‘Racism is totally unacceptable in America. Everybody needs to be treated fairly and objectively.’’\nBut the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Heidi Beirich, who tracks hate speech, said Sessions is guilty of it, and that his mere presence in Trump’s inner circle is ‘‘a tragedy for American politics.’’\nHe’s got a populist streak: Here’s one area where he and Trump likely get along swell. Wall Street and corporate executives are often the antagonists in the Alabama senator’s speeches. ‘‘A small group of CEOs don’t get to set immigration policy for the country,’’ he said in a 2014 speech opposing a multi-billion-dollar bill to help control the stem of influx of Central American refugees on the border.\nAs hard-line as Sessions can be, he’s worked with Democrats before: ‘‘Say what you will about him,’’ former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. ‘‘He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well.’’\nEven people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: ‘‘Please don’t say that. That’s my nightmare. I promise I’ll be nice.’’\nSessions has joined with Democrats to support criminal justice reform legislation, and in 2010 he teamed up with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., on a proposal to put strict limits on non-military federal spending. It fell one vote short of passing.\nIn 2016, he’s gone from fringe to mainstream: Aside from immigration battles, Sessions mostly operated in the background on Capitol Hill. Until 2016. His mix of hard-line immigration position and a populist streak had made him a tea party star and thus and a coveted endorsement catch for Republican presidential candidates catering to the tea party. In presidential primary debates, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, would even brag about his ties to Sessions.\nIn the end, Sessions chose Trump, surprising the political establishment by jumping on stage with him at a rally in February in Madison, Ala. two days before Super Tuesday and donning a ‘‘Make America Great Again’’ hat.\n‘‘I told Donald Trump this isn’t a campaign, this is a movement,’’ Sessions said at the time.\nNine months later, Sessions will be a central figure in transitioning that ‘‘movement’’ into a working government.",

      "text": "\nWhat comes to your mind when you think of the NBA? Bromance. Duh. There are even websites dedicated to NBA bromance. And it seems like the Los Angeles Clippers duo Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan just can’t get enough of each other in the latest Google Duo commercial. Check it out below:\n\nAs you can see, DeAndre spots Blake having a meal with someone else even though he said he “had practice.” DeAndre’s mustard decides give Blake’s ketchup a ring, and of course, Google didn’t waste a moment showing off the Knock Knock feature, which lets you see the caller even before answering the call, provided that you are using an Android device. DeAndre is definitely a little salty that his best bud is having a meal without him, but as Google says, Google Duo is for duos who can’t stay mad at each other.\nSee also: Audio-only calls are coming to Google’s Duo soon August 18, 2016 This is just one of the animated Google Duo ad series on YouTube but the first one to feature NBA superstars. The other ones – featuring undeniable duos like salt and pepper, peanut butter and jam, toothbrush and toothpaste, left sock and right sock – are actually very well-made as well.\nGoogle Duo, for those who don’t know, is Google’s video-chatting app. Essentially it is the search giant’s attempt to take on Apple’s FaceTime – a one-to-one video calling app that supports high quality video and audio with a very simple UI. Unlike FaceTime, however, Duo is available for both Android and iOS.\nEssentially it is the search giant's attempt to take on Apple’s FaceTime – a one-to-one video calling app that supports high quality video and audio with a very simple UI.\nAt any rate, it seems like the LA Clippers are on a roll here: on top of the sweeping victory on Monday against the Brooklyn Nets, their power forward and center are featured in the world’s biggest search giant’s commercial. We will have to wait to see how they will fare against the Sacramento Kings tonight.\nWhat do you think about Google’s new Duo ad? Will you be rooting for the Clippers tonight?

      "title": "Here’s what companies like Google, Facebook and Apple lost when Trump’s win killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership",
      "text": "share Win McNamee / Getty The giant international trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership died last week . It was supposed to be the largest regional trade deal in history . The TPP itself was a massive 30-chapter lawbook that would have freed access to markets for things like car manufacturing, data storage, online commerce, intellectual property and medicines. Hoards of technology and media companies supported the trade deal. Google was pro TPP . As was Microsoft , Apple and Facebook. The Motion Picture Association of America supported it too. The deal would have allowed them to make it easier to store user data across borders, offer stricter copyright protections and clamp down on digital pirating. President-elect Donald Trump positioned his opposition to the trade deal as one of the defining issues of his campaign. He compared the TPP to the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s that allowed U.S. manufacturers to move jobs to Mexico. President Obama, on the other hand, was betting on the trade accord to be a part of his foreign policy legacy, refocusing the American economy toward Asian countries and hedging against China’s growing power. But after Trump’s unexpected win, there are no hopes for the Republican majority Congress to ratify it. China, meanwhile, has a trade deal of its own the country is hoping to pass in the wake of the TPP’s failure. Now that deal is off the table, the large companies that supported it will have to go back to the foreign policy drawing board. Here’s what American technology companies would have gotten had the deal been finalized. The TPP’s e-commerce chapter included the world’s first set of international trade rules that would have barred governments from blocking how companies share data across national borders . The internet works by freely moving data across the world. It’s how an artist in Mexico is able to have a fanbase in the U.K. just by posting a video on YouTube. Now governments can impose laws on how data is ferried outside of their country, potentially blocking content and balkanizing the internet. On the flip side, technology companies cooperate with digital surveillance operations across borders too, and the TPP would have muddled the way countries would have been able to pass national privacy laws. In many of the participating countries it is not currently illegal to break the digital rights management, a digital lock that technology companies can add to their products to prevent piracy, tinkering and repair. But DRM is easy to circumvent, and hackers as well as media pirates have found ways to break to digital locks to make pirated copies of movies and music. In the U.S., it’s illegal to break DRM under copyright law, and the TPP would have expanded that internationally. Several countries would have had to make bans for repairing or tinkering with software or devices if DRM was circumvented, which would have been a win for the digital music and movie industry’s battle against piracy, as well as device manufacturers. Six of the twelve participating countries would have expanded their copyright terms an additional 20 years. Under the TPP, it would have taken over 70 years for a copyrighted work to enter the public domain, which is what happens when a song or film is so old that it’s legal to access it for free. Tech companies also were in favor of the TPP’s ban on “forced localization,” or laws that require a company to keep its citizens’ user data stored within its borders. Technology companies oppose these statutes on the grounds that they inhibit their increasingly cloud-based business models. When a country requires that data generated in the country stay stored within its borders, tech companies are forced to build data centers there in order to do business. Forced localization could also open a technology company or website to being compelled to follow a country’s censorship laws by dint of operating servers there. recode_divider",

The CIA and the people they protect are the old power structure. Phase 3, the Clinton Foundation email, would have dealt a huge blow to the old power structure which is why they prevented the release of the emails at all costs.

      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nA diverse audience attended the racial dialogue session at Boston’s Cutler Majestic Theatre. The event was packed.\nBy Evan Allen Globe Staff November 20, 2016\nJim Rooney grew up a poor white Southie kid in the ’60s, and ’70s, in a Boston that was bitterly divided — economically, ethnically, racially. It was Charlestown versus West Roxbury; African-American versus Haitian versus Asian versus white, he recalled.\n“We had hurtful names for every group we could think of, and we were taught stereotypes about each other that were wrong and dangerous,” Rooney told a packed house at the Cutler Majestic Theatre Saturday morning as he opened the first in a series of citywide conversations on race, convened by Mayor Martin J. Walsh.\nAdvertisement\nThe extraordinary session was marked by frank and emotional remarks, intense at times but also civil. Such self-examination is essential, Rooney said, for the racism of his childhood is not confined to history. If left unacknowledged, he said, it is a poison that will sicken the city.\n“As a city, we are hanging on to a whole lot of messed-up crap,” said Rooney, president and chief executive officer of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. “It’s time to get it out, and have the uncomfortable conversations.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here Kendra Gerald, a biracial 16-year-old Roxbury girl, spoke of the pain she felt when confronted by those old hatreds — when her classmates told her black people steal, or that their parents would disown them if they dated a black person.\nView Story Boston officials prepare for race dialogue Boston officials spent more than a year preparing for today’s town hall meeting on race.\nEditorial: Walsh opens painful, but needed, dialogue\n“Is this what the general white population thinks about me and other people of color?” she asked.\nSaturday’s talk launched a series of citywide events that will span the coming year. Walsh began planning the series while he was still campaigning for mayor in 2013, after a woman in Jamaica Plain pressed him on whether he thought Boston was a racist city. Attendees left saying they were pleasantly surprised by the honesty with which the subject of white privilege was handled, with white speakers openly admitting their failures in order to learn from them.\nAdvertisement\nRuth Georges, 31, who is Haitian, lauded what she called a show of “strong leadership” by the city.\nPeople were “speaking to communities that are being oppressed by societal structures, and speaking to those who don’t understand that they are part of those structures,” said Georges.\nSaturday’s event was in the works long before President-elect Donald Trump even announced his candidacy, but Walsh said the timing — less than two weeks after a fractious election that has inspired protests — was fitting.\n“This is a time when our nation is in great transition,” Walsh said. “We have no idea where the [leadership] is going to take us. But we are not going to go backward. We are going to go forward.”\nSpeakers hailed from many fields: academics, city officials, an author, and two young people of color who spoke about the weight the country’s history of racism brings to bear in their daily lives.\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nDr. Monica O’Neal, a licensed clinical psychologist, spoke at the session.\n“From an early age, I learned to be afraid to be black,” said 20-year-old Dante Omorogbe. His grandparents told him stories about the Deep South, where whites terrorized black people for fun. In Boston, Omorogbe gets stopped by police when he’s walking down the street, he said, whether he’s wearing a hoodie, or a button-down shirt and khakis on his way to an interview.\n“From the murder of Emmett Till, to the murder of Trayvon Martin — two boys who looked like me, and did nothing wrong . . . racism isn’t just a word,” Omorogbe said.\nDebby Irving, who wrote the book “Waking Up White,” spoke of the mistakes she made in trying to understand racism and her slow realization that she had internalized stereotypes about white superiority. She flashed images on the screen behind her: the smiling white faces of the cast of “Friends,” the white faces of our first 43 presidents. Whites are kind, whites are leaders, whites are Americans — she had been blind to these stereotypes, she said.\nShe spoke of learning about “redlining,” the systematic process of keeping black people from moving into “white” neighborhoods that today still shapes our racially and economically segregated cities — and how that realization shook her faith in the myth of America as a great meritocracy, where everyone gets what they deserve.\n“White skin carries history,” she said.\nWalsh shared a conversation he had with one of his staffers about learning to drive. The staffer, a person of color, was teaching his son that if he was pulled over by police, he should put his wallet on the dashboard, and say “Yes sir” and “No sir.”\nWhen Walsh was growing up, he said, his first move upon being pulled over was trying to think of friends he had in the Police Department whose names he could drop. If that failed, he said, he’d try to think of family members the officer might know.\n“The point of it is, those experiences are very, very different,” Walsh said.\nDuring a question-and-answer period in which attendees spoke to Walsh, Dr. Monica O’Neal, a Harvard-trained licensed clinical psychologist and Harvard Medical School lecturer, questioned officials’ emphasis on the need to talk about race without hostility. Officials had called for conversation without anger or defensiveness.\n“That seems a bit unfair,” she said. Race and racism rightly raise strong feelings, she said, and banning the expression of those feelings “feels a bit like limiting the truth of what needs to be heard.”\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nThe crowd at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston on Saturday.\nO’Neal pressed him to say flatly that racism is a problem in the city, which Walsh did, saying, “Boston has an issue with racism.”\nOther attendees voiced fear of police, or spoke of their desire for more “pipelines to equity.” One woman lamented the fact that some people in the city simply would not attend talks like these on race, and so would not be reached.\nSome of the attendees and many of the speakers touched on the election of Trump, and urged people to fight to protect the rights of all Americans by doing things such as speaking openly about race in gatherings such as this one.\n“It seems incomprehensible that this country would follow seven years of the first African-American president with someone who uses racism, xenophobia, and sexism to become president,” said Ceasar McDowell, professor of the Practice of Community Development at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “When I hear people protesting, speaking up to protect those who are scared, I know there’s an America that wants to be.”\nThe United States, he said, contains the most complex group of people who have ever lived together. And while conversations about race often take place within groups of people who feel the same way, it is a rare thing for people with differing views to gather and speak openly and honestly.\n“We can use our conversation around race,” he said, “as the anchor for a new democracy.”\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nMorgan Shattuck at the race dialogue session on Saturday.\nGlobe correspondent Martha Schick and Meghan E.

      "text": " Google+\nEvan Vucci/AP/File\nPresident-elect Donald Trump with his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, earlier this month.\nBy Catherine Lucey Associated Press November 20, 2016\nBEDMINSTER, N.J. — President-elect Donald Trump says he’s moving to the White House soon, but his wife and young son will follow him at the end of the school year.\nTrump spoke Sunday to reporters gathered at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, during a day of private meetings with potential administration officials. He said he will live in the White House and wife Melania Trump and 10-year-old son Barron will move ‘‘right after he finishes school.’’\nAdvertisement\nTrump lives with his wife and son in the penthouse apartment at Trump Tower in New York City. Barron attends a private school in the city.\nThe New York Post reported Sunday that Trump’s wife and son would not immediately be moving with him to Washington.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Trump is not the first recent president to move to the White House with school age children. When President Barack Obama took office, daughters Sasha and Malia were 10 and 7. When Bill Clinton came to Washington, Chelsea Clinton was 12. All three White House kids moved during the school year and attended the Sidwell Friends, a private school in northwest Washington.\nTrump has continued to spend most of his time in Trump Tower since winning the presidential election, which has prompted a massive security effort around the luxury building with bomb-sniffing dogs, security checkpoints and police barricades.",

T+L Newsletters \nIt can now translate entire sentences at a time, rather than just single words. \nThis story originally appeared on Time.com . \nGoogle is improving its language translation service with a new approach that interprets whole sentences at a time rather than phrases piece-by-piece, the search giant announced Tuesday. The firm says that should make translations from the service, called Google Translate, easier to understand. \n“It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then arranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar,” Barak Turovsky, product lead for Google Translate, wrote in a new blog post . \nGoogle provided an example showing how Google Translate results differ with the new system compared to the previous approach ( click to embiggen :) \nThis new version of Google Translate is powered by neutral machine translation, which is a new method of teaching computers to translate human languages, according to the Association for Computational Linguistics . Google published updates regarding its research into this field in September; it’s now integrating the technique directly into Google Translate. \nThe upgraded translation technique will work immediately with English, French, German, Spanish and Chinese, among other languages. Google says it will eventually make similar upgrades to all of the 103 languages Google Translate currently supports. \nThe announcement comes as Microsoft has also been bolstering its own translation service. Microsoft hopes to release an app by the end of the year that can translate multi-lingual group conversations in real time, ZDNet recently reported . ",

Google's huge London property empire is starting to take shape Nov. 21, 2016, 6:23 AM 13 print Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaking in London on November 15 2016. James Cook/Business Insider \nGoogle is looking to expand its UK workforce from around 4,000 people today to 7,000 people by 2020. \nThe search giant currently has three main offices in London with one in King's Cross, one on Tottenham Court Road, and another in Victoria. It also has a smaller startup space near Old Street known as Campus. \nOver the next few years, Google is planning to make King's Cross, a neighbourhood in the north of Central London, its main base in the city, opening a number of new buildings in the area. \nHere's a look at some of the properties that Google is planning in King's Cross and some that it already has in the area and across the rest of London. The area behind King's Cross has been significantly redeveloped over the last few years and Google is moving into a number of new properties in the area. St Pancras Train Station in King's Cross. Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Google announced plans to build a new £1 billion HQ on the 300m green plot of land in 2013. An artist's impression of Google's new complete London campus. Google Architects AHMM drew up these plans for Google's UK in September 2013. AHMM/Dezeen \nAt the time, The Guardian wrote : \"On a long, thin sliver of land between the railway tracks in King’s Cross, where rusting gasometers and soot-caked sheds once stood, a multi-storey pleasure palace will soon rise out of the ground. Complete with climbing wall, indoor football pitch and a rooftop swimming pool, this is not a new leisure centre for the people of Camden, but Google’s spanking new £1bn London headquarters – designed to make going to work feel like an exciting day out.\" \nBut ex-Google CEO Larry Page dismissed them in February 2015 for being too boring. Reuters As Google stalled on its main HQ, it snapped up this huge building over the road which had already been built. 6 Pancras Square. BNP Paribas The office, which is over the road from UCL university and the British Library, boasts roof terraces with great views over London. It can be accessed through this funky tunnel which runs from King's Cross station. Jim Edwards The 6 Pancras Square building also contains a \"YouTube Space\" on the ground floor which is kitted out with studios and meeting areas. Google Staff began moving into 6 Pancras Square in June and up to 2,800 Googlers are expected to be in the building by the end of 2016, including Android engineers and AI researchers at DeepMind. It has been designed to be more subtle and stylish than some of Google's other buildings, which have Google's bold colours throughout. Tim Soar A floating staircase links some of the upper floors in the 11-storey building. Tim Soar Google CEO Sundar Pichai finally announced the new architect for the main HQ building in November. Ramin Talaie/Getty Images British superstar architect Thomas Heatherwick, whose firm designed the Olympic Cauldron for London 2012, has been tasked with designing Google's new UK HQ. Getty Images Entertainment This appears to be the only image that Heatherwick Studios has released of the new Google HQ building. Heatherwick Studios is also designing Google's new international HQ in California. Google In addition to 6 Pancras Square and the Thomas Heatherwick building, Google is also planning to move into this yet-to-be-built property at King's Cross. It is being built on a plot known simply as \"S2\". Mossessian Architecture Outside King's Cross, Google has offices in Tottenham Court Road and Victoria. It's understood that these offices will eventually be closed as Google expands in King's Cross. Flickr/Martin Varsavsky Google also has a space for startups in East London known simply as Campus.

      "text": "\nControlling hundreds of smart devices and services by voice is easy with IFTTT's Google Assistant channel.\nOne of the cool things you can do with your Google Home is using your voice to control connected items around your house. While there are native connections to things like Phillips Hue lamps, SmartThings devices and Nest equipment, Google Home's Assistant was ready for IFTTT on day one. That means you can control all sorts of things! \nIn case you didn't know or just weren't sure, IFTTT (short for IF T his T hen T hat) is an online service that smart devices can connect to and it facilitates communications between them. Companies like Facebook and Amazon and Google have used the service for a while and there are literally hundreds of \"things\" that connect to IFTTT. Some you've heard of and some you haven't . Getting things to talk to one another is also simple to set up using a sort of flow chart system. Pick a \"thing\" that will be a trigger — the weather channel says it's going to rain — then pick a thing that will act on that trigger — I get a text message telling me to bring my umbrella.\nIFTTT is the messenger between two services and knows how to talk to both.\nIt works the same way with Google Home through Google Assistant . When you say \" OK, Google. Turn on my bedroom TV, \" it's a trigger that the IFTTT Harmony channel can use to fire up my television through my Harmony remote. It's really easy to use and works surprisingly well. Even if you don't have a Google Home or a phone with Assistant it's worth taking a look at because you probably are using something that is hooked into IFTTT. Have a look at the list of supported applets . Now think of things you can do to one of them that will make another do something on its own. Taste the rainbow.\nThe best way to understand how IFTTT works and to learn how to get it to play nice with Assistant is to just do it.\n\nVisit the IFTTT website or install the app from Google Play and get an account set up. If you already have an account at IFTTT, you can use it (and you likely already know how easy it is to add a channel like Google Assistant.) Make sure you're logged in at IFTTT, and head to the Google Assistant applet page. You can find it at ifttt.com/google_assistant if you're using a web browser, and if you're using the IFTTT app tap the search button at the bottom and search for \"Google\" and it will be the first one on the list. Once you're there, tap the blue Connect button. You'll be redirected to a secure Google login page unless you're already logged in through the browser or on your phone. If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Google account you'll need to authorize things. Once you're logged in properly you'll be asked to allow IFTTT to \"Manage Google Voice commands.\" Tap the Allow button and you're done. You're conveniently redirected back to the Google Assistant page at IFTTT. You'll see all sorts of pre-built applets you can play with that have Google Assistant do things like tell your robot vacuum to clean the room or turn your lights on. You'll also find practical things like writing a note to Evernote or Todoist or Google Drive, making your lost phone ring or logging meals and weights to FitBit. All you have to do to try one is give it a tap. You'll be walked through everything you need to do to set it up and test it. From there, you can look through the services that use IFTTT and start building your own.\nOK, Google. Let's do cool stuff. \n",

      "title": "Google Play Music's latest update is two steps forward, one step back",
      "text": "0 Comments Last week, Google Play Music took its first step towards a long, long overdue overhaul. \nThe recent Google Play Music update changes only one element of the UI: the home page. Before the update , it was a mix of Recents and Recommendations. Now, Listen Now is entirely recommendations, with only a Recents button in the top right corner to remind you that Play Music is anything but AI-made radio stations… until you switch to Downloaded. Then, Home changes into something far more useful. \nIn Downloaded Only mode, the home page changes to Downloaded music, showcasing the playlists that you have stored locally, starting with the most recently-used four playlists. There's also a Shuffle button that pops up right above your playlists, allowing you to quickly shuffle all your offline tunes, but the real gem is hiding at the bottom of the page: Cached music. \nCached music is made up of songs that you listened to once or twice and Play Music downloaded them in case you want to hear them again. Previously, it was impossible to tell what was Cached music as opposed to downloaded as a part of a playlist/album. Listing it is a great first step, but I'm eagerly awaiting the ability to tap a song in here and tap Remove from cached music to clear out songs I don't want wasting space without emptying the whole cache. \nThere are honestly some great features in here, but they're only accessible on Downloaded, which many users never turn on. \nYou may also notice there is a page indicator just above Downloaded music; if you swipe right, you'll be treated to another menu we haven't seen on Play Music before: Other music on this device. Before now, if you had music downloaded on your phone, Google Play Music would show it and play it as if it was part of your cloud library, but you couldn't tell what was local-only. This menu will be useful, especially when you're about to migrate to a new device and need to know what needs syncing off the old phone. \nThere are honestly some great features in here, but they're only accessible on Downloaded, which many users never turn on, and the regular menus they replace are far less useful (at least to my Station-avoiding tastes). At least these menus encourage me to stay offline and save my data, but should the main page of an app change so completely based on your data status? Is there a happy balance to be re-struck between our personal libraries and cloud recommendations? I think so, but for now, here's what we've got. \nWe can only hope as more changes come, they're more consistently useful than Home. Like us!",

      "text": "Share this Story Google Now Lets You Check How Busy a Place is In Real-Time \nBack in 2015, Google introduced a featured in Google Search that showed you when a retailer, bar, restaurant, or other location was the most popular. The Popular Times section in the place’s listing featured a graph that let you see at what time might be best to visit to avoid crowds. Today, Google is upgrading this feature with a real-time representation of how popular a place is at the moment. \nAs you’ll see in the GIF below, Google has tagged the Popular Times section as “Live” and with a pink bar in the graph of the current time. This should show you in real-time if a place is busy and whether or not you may want to avoid it. You can also report to Google if they are incorrect on the level of busyness. \nHappy hour, easier than ever to decide upon, thanks to Google. \nAdditionally, Google has added in an estimate as to how long people typically stay at a location. The idea here is to help you plan around timing, assuming you need to get to multiple places or be back home at a certain time. \nFinally, search results will now show hours of operation broken out by departments or special services. For example, some restaurants have separate hours for restaurant and bar sections, as do retailers for their specific areas, like pharmacy drive-thrus vs. the rest of the store. \nTo see these new options, just search for a place you are thinking of visiting.

      "text": " \n\nThis week is one of the most anticipated, and also one of the most dreaded, times of the year for shoppers. Black Friday used to be just one day, but retailers are now offering huge discounts on certain items all this week. That means crowded shopping centers and stores, and long delays at registers. Today, Google announced some new additions to its Search app that should make life a little easier for shoppers who want to go to their favorite store at the best possible time.\nSee also: The best Black Friday deals of 2016 \nPreviously, the Google Search and Map apps showed the estimated popular times for restaurants or stores, but with today’s update, those search results will now display real time numbers on how crowded they are. That hopefully means you can choose to avoid going to that location at that time and wait until it isn’t quite as busy.\nAnother new addition for Google Search is an estimate of how how long people usually stay at a shop, restaurant or other location. This is also ideal, especially if you don’t want to wait a while to eat at your favorite steak house, burger joint or nightclub.\nFinally, there are some businesses that close certain sections before the entire store closes up, like pharmacies at department stores or service sections at auto dealerships. Google Search can now display the specific opening and closing times of those kinds of departments alongside the main hours. Will these new features be helpful for you, especially for this coming Black Friday week? Let us know in the comments.\n ",

US Military Flag officers loyal to Donald Trump took matters into their own hands when they saw the election hack being initiated in the early morning hours of November 9th! Remember when all the counting seemed to freeze and Fox News said they wouldn’t be able to call any of the critical states until the next morning? That’s exactly when they tried to steal it! Mainstream fake news announcers were all in on the steal and knew it was coming! This explains why Megyn Kelly and others looked so shocked after having just reported from Fox’s election back room to be told no results until morning! US Military Flag Officers were willing to declare war on the CIA in Virginia and forced them to back off and disconnect their computers immediately or face an airstrike! Hear the amazing story directly from Stew Webb in the video. We’ll never know the names of the patriots who stopped the steal but they are the true heroes! The evil ones are desperate now! They are now playing their last cards of Race War, Protests, Killing Cops, False Flags and Electoral College fraud by pushing the lie Hillary won the popular vote! She didn’t!\n…\n“We can now report that Hillary Clinton made a call to her CIA ‘handler’ daddy Bush aka George Herbert Walker Bush to hack and steal five (5) states on election night 2016 on behalf of Satanist lesbian Hillary as daddy had done for his Satanist homosexual son in the year 2000 election coup de eat.\nAfter a half an hour after the 2016 election coup was ordered by pedophile daddy Bush (George H.W. Bush) the patriotic U.S. Military stepped in and stopped the election hacking operation and tuned off the E-Systems West Star satellites and Israeli VIA Sat satellite out of Englewood, Colorado that were about to steal yet another U.S. Presidential election.”\nhttp://www.stewwebb.com/2016/11/21/pizza-gate-is-pedophile-gate/\nMegyn Kelly in shock! The steal didn’t happen as she was told! She has no viewers anymore!\n10 Ways We Drain the Swamp – Donald Trump!\nhttps://youtu.be/fYl_ZAz7ENY\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "title": "The dangers of delightful design",
      "text": "Designs words at Dropbox. Previously at YouTube and Google. yesterday The dangers of delightful design How delightful details can get you into trouble When you think of delightful things, you might think of things that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Stuffed animals. Cupcakes. Hugs. But delightful things can have negative side effects. A silly joke can offend you. A clever ad can mislead you. A cute sound effect can drive you nuts. In the world of design, we often praise delightful details. But as you’ll soon see, delightful details can sometimes get you into trouble. Delight gets in the way If you’re not careful, delightful details can hurt the usability of your product. Morimoto , named after the famous Iron Chef Morimoto, is a great example of a website that clearly values delight over usability. Their desktop site tries hard to be delightful, but the delightful details make the site hard to use. The initial buttons are tilted at 45° angles, making them hard to click. Images shift around when you move your cursor, distracting you. A music track automatically starts playing, whether you like it or not. Menus animate in and out, making you wait 5 seconds after each click. Morimoto’s epic website Delightful details give you an opportunity to express your brand’s voice. They give life to your product. But if you’re not careful, delightful details can get in the way. Like Morimoto’s website, too many delightful details can just get annoying. They slow people down from doing what they need to do. Delight has a shelf life To create delight, you need an element of surprise. Delight happens when you do something new and unexpected to make people feel happy. I remember the first time I started up my Android phone and saw these spinning circles: When I saw the circles magically morph into an Android logo, I was blown away. I thought it was the coolest loading animation ever. After a while though, this animation got old and repetitive. After seeing it again and again, I no longer felt that same feeling of delight. It just wasn’t surprising to me anymore. Delightful details lose their charm over time. Delight has a shelf life, and even the most delightful details can start feeling stale after a while. To keep things fresh, you’ll probably have to redesign the same things over and over again. Delight is subjective Ever come across an error message that tried to be fun and clever? It’s tempting to poke fun at a bad situation, but when someone is desperately trying to save their work or finish a task, a fun error message can come across as unsympathetic and insulting. Delight varies from person to person. What’s delightful to one person can be dreadful to another. There’s no such thing as universal delight. Delightful or dreadful? Even though your heart might be in a good place, you never know when you might rub someone the wrong way when you’re trying to be delightful. Delight doesn’t scale Delight gets a lot trickier as your audience grows. If you’re a smaller brand, you can often get away with using a lot of fun language in your product. But as your audience gets more diverse and global, it’s harder to be delightful to everyone. Just compare the language used by large global brands (on the left) with the language used by smaller brands (on the right): Microsoft Teams vs. Slack Google Docs vs. Quip Eventbrite vs. Splash Notice a trend? In general, the language used by large global brands tends to be more straightforward and conventional, because it’s a safer choice for global audiences. Straightforward language is easier to localize and less likely to feel alienating. The language used on the right side is definitely more fun to me, but it speaks to a specific kind of audience. If you feel like you’re not part of that audience, you probably won’t find the language delightful. So when is it safe to be delightful? By now, you can see how delightful details can sometimes get you into trouble. Designing for delight can be risky, but that doesn’t mean you should totally avoid it. The toughest part is just figuring out when to be delightful. One thing I’ve learned is that it’s usually safer to be delightful on the screens that a user won’t see too often. For example: When they first launch an app When they finish setting up an account When a new feature is introduced When they complete an important action for the first time When there’s an empty state These are experiences that a user will probably only see once, so it’s easier to be delightful without feeling repetitive or annoying. This is why you’ll often see delightful imagery in onboarding flows. Below is a recent example from Google Sites. Most of the UI is pretty conventional and straightforward, but in their one-time onboarding flow, they’ll surprise you with this cute illustration. Because you only see it once, it’s delightful. To be honest, I’m still figuring this all out for myself. Because delight is so subjective, it’s hard to craft rules around it. My methodical mind wants to create guidelines about when to use delight and when to avoid it, but it’s tougher than you’d think. Everyone has their own thoughts about what’s delightful. Do you have guidelines for when to be delightful in your product? If so, I’d love to hear about it. Feel free to chime in below and delight everyone with your comments.",

      "text": "Updates and more usually begin off with the region of USA being amongst the first to experience it. But this time, it’s Canadian users of the Google Pixel who are reporting of a new update rolling out for the smaller of the two Pixels by Google.\nClocking in at 261MB, this update is curiously rolling out to Canadian Pixel owners without a changelog in the official updater screen. The update build number is NPF26J, which does not really tell us much on the face of it. Redditors on the Google Pixel subforums however have noted that the build date for this release is October 26th. Compared to the previous NDE63V build with a build date of September 1st, this update likely involves a whole bunch of fixes that Google has managed to undertake in more than a months work. Further, the shift from the “P” development branch from the “D” development branch could be indicative of yet more changes.\nAlong with the presumed security and bug fixes, the NPF26J update brings in two new gestures to the Pixel. As spotted by eagle-eyed Redditors who received the update, the new “Moves” are Double-Tap-to-Wake and the Lift-to-Wake gestures. Custom ROM and several OEM skins have implemented features like these since a while now, and now the Google Pixel will also be joining in on the convenience.\n\nBoth of the new gestures are enabled by default in the update, though you can disable them if you prefer not using them.\nMeanwhile, word is floating around that a new Android 7.1.1 Dev Preview 2 is right around the corner. The upcoming builds are number NPF26F for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 and Android One, while the Pixel C will be getting NPF26H.\nWe are waiting on the official changelog of the update, along with requisite download links. We will inform our readers of new information soon.\nWhat are your thoughts on the newest Android version updates? Have you received the update? Let us know in the comments below! \n",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist November 22, 2016\nThomas Farragher/Globe staff\nPaul Ruane at St. Peter Church, where he is known as the \"Food Angel.&apos;&apos;\nWORCESTER — It was one of those compassionate gestures that happen all the time. Often it’s transitory, an ephemeral good deed. Not this time.\nHere’s what happened: A few years back, Paul Ruane was sitting in St. Columba Church in Paxton, where he and his family worship. There was an announcement. A poor parish in nearby Worcester needed help.\nAdvertisement\nSo Ruane joined other parishioners and jumped in. They made Thanksgiving food baskets. He packed his daughter Jill, then an eighth-grader, in the car with a bunch of other kids and drove to St. Peter Church on Main Street here.\nWhat they found was sobering. Most of the food ready for the poor people of St. Peter’s was not typical Thanksgiving fare. There was canned tuna. Boxed cereal. Packages of pasta. Hardly worthy of Norman Rockwell.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “The kids were in disbelief,’’ Ruane recalled. “They were asking me: ‘That’s all these people get for Thanksgiving?’ ”\nYes, the church’s longtime pastor, Monsignor Frank Scollen, assured them. Food is scarce, even on Thanksgiving.\nWith that, a one-man movement was born. Ruane spent 33 years at the state Department of Correction, rising to superintendent. A 2009 heart attack presented a grim choice: retire or die. He retired. And then went back to work, earning a new title around the rectory and the parish center at St. Peter’s.\nAdvertisement\n“We refer to him as our Food Angel,’’ Monsignor Scollen told me Monday as volunteers assembled hundreds of Thanksgiving food packages for distribution. “Paul comes every week to help us with food. For him, it’s not a once-a-year thing. This is a very good guy.’’\nAcross the years, Ruane — who used to supervise recycling for the DOC — has become a fixture at St. Peter’s and at nearby food pantries.\nHe also became a fixture at the produce counter at the Big Y. He scours Stop & Shop ads for the best buy on turkeys. He’s got an eagle eye for deals on pumpkin pies. He knows where to get day-old bread and bins of donated delicious apples.\nThe result? Some 535 families of the St. Peter’s family will go home this week with a turkey meal and all the fixings: potatoes, carrots, squash, yams, cranberry sauce, gravy, assorted fruits, and cider.\nThere are important lessons, too. Don’t judge the down and out because you never know their whole story. Gratitude is everywhere. People are good.\n“Along the way, we all received help,’’ Ruane told me at the parish center on Monday. “Even if you didn’t realize it, you’ve had help. There will be people crying here this week because they’re so grateful.’’\nA bit of full disclosure: I have known Paul Ruane all my life. We grew up together in a small town not far from here. We served as altar boys at the 7 o’clock Mass on weekday mornings before school. We were Cub Scouts in the same den led by Mrs. Burgwinkle and Mrs. Gibbons.\nI see him now only occasionally — at wakes and at class reunions where he is our hilarious master of ceremonies. But I know him well enough to say this with confidence: He’s no angel.\nHe’s the next best thing. He’s not trying to save the world. He’s seen a need, and he’s figured out a way to fill it. And then he kept doing it — without complaint or pursuit of applause — year after year.\nHe didn’t ask me to write about him. I pestered him to let me do it.\n“Supposedly learned people tell us that people are out there scamming the system,’’ Ruane said. “They’re alcoholics and drug addicts with their hands out. It just isn’t true. Hunger is out there every day. Good people are hurting. I can see it.’’\nI sat a few desks away from Ruane when the Sisters of Presentation taught us in grammar-school religion class the importance of helping the needy and downtrodden.\n“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor,’’ we were told.\nTurns out some of us were listening more closely than others.\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist.

      "text": "Share this Story Google Home Now Just $99 for a Limited Time! \nNovember 23 has arrived and that means Google Home is officially discounted for a limited time during this Black Friday deals week to $99. That’s a cool $30 discount on the brand new home assistant. \nNeed a refresher on what Google Home is and can do? The unboxing and setup below should help, but think of it a lot like Amazon Echo. You get to control portions of your smart home with voice actions and Google Assistant, set reminders or timers, check traffic, order an Uber, look up information, play games, check on the weather, and listen to music, just to name a few items. I’ve got a couple in my house and use them multiple times per day already. At $99, they are a steal. \nA bunch of retailers all have them discounted and they are linked below. \nAnother failed product from Google. Add it to the graveyard ctk4949 \nBest place to buy is from B&H, no taxes!! https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1297281-REG/google_ga3a00417a14_home.html Matthew Dickinson \nFor everyone excited too about the 6 months of YouTube Red, read the conditions first. Kinda, no actually, really crappy. Probably have to pair this to one of my other accounts because of it. drdrowsy \nany with free shipping/ no tax (NJ)? Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nGo through the links and see. Is NJ taking taxes from Amazon now? NexusMan \nYes. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nI took mine back… But I’m thinking about getting it as a present…but since I’m buying for someone else I’m heavily leaning Echo. Still thinking about which one hkklife \nGreat price but for ME personally, this is the answer to a question no one was asking (much like smartwatches). I’d still rather see Google focus on addressing OEM’s lack of updates, the dearth of Android tablet-UI and app optimizations, fragmentation and battery life & performance optimizations in Android instead of more foolish endeavors like this and Glass. Good_Ole_Pinocchio \nGoogle is a one trick pony(which isn’t a negative) At the base of it all they care about Data. AI is where they’re focused for now and the future. Android is just one vehicle. Google has never really cared what 3rd party OEMs do as long as they preloaded google services. Now with PIxel they care much less. NexusMan \nI don’t recall anyone asking for a touchscreen computer in their pocket either… About Droid Life \nWe consider ourselves to have the greatest Android community in the world, here at Droid Life .

      "text": "\nNormally, a premium subscription to Google Play Music is $9.99 per month. If you haven’t tried it yet, Google is offering you the chance to access it free for four months. The better news that this also comes with access to the YouTube Red service as well.\nSee also: Best music player apps for Android June 4, 2016 Here’s the breakdown for what you get with this deal. In addition to the already free features on Google Play Music, such as listening to tunes, uploading up to 50,000 of your own songs and access to podcasts and radio stations, the normally $9.99 a month subscription fee offers access to 35 million songs, ad-free, along with downloading songs to play them offline. The YouTube Red service that comes with it eliminates all ads from the video service, along with background audio support, a way to play videos offline and access to original video content available nowhere else.\n\nAgain, this four-month free trial offer is for new customers only. After the trial is over, you can continue to access both services for $9.99 per month (plus tax), or you can simply cancel ahead of time and you will still get that free four months of premium music and video. It’s pretty much a “win-win”, especially if you want to eliminate all those annoying video ads at the beginning of most YouTube videos.\nGet the offer at Google Play Music ",

      "text": "Photo Dev Patel in “Lion,” Garth Davis’s movie about a real-world incident. Credit Mark Rogers/The Weinstein Company The first part of “Lion,” Garth Davis’s unabashedly tear-jerking movie about a remarkable real-world incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a long-ago time — 1986, to be precise — before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar), who accidentally travels more than 1,000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroo’s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an out-of-service train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. Video Trailer: ‘Lion’ A preview of the film. By THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY on Publish Date November 23, 2016. Photo by The Weinstein Company. Watch in Times Video » embed With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo’s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel ) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), who was also adopted from India and has mental health and substance-abuse problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the happily-ever-after stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy ( Rooney Mara ), from America. But memories of his long-ago life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It’s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you’re not familiar with the true story behind “Lion,” that the fairy tale will come true. Photo Nicole Kidman and Sunny Pawar in “Lion.” Credit Mark Rogers/The Weinstein Company Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O’Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child — or a mother — this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent.",

      "text": " Google+\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\nMitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani.\nBy Jeremy W. Peters and Maggie Haberman New York Times November 25, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Rival factions of Republicans are locked in an increasingly caustic and public battle to influence President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for secretary of state, leaving a prominent hole in an otherwise quickly formed national security team that is unlikely to be filled until next week at the earliest.\nThe debate inside Trump’s wide circle of formal and informal advisers — pitting supporters of one leading contender, Mitt Romney, against those of another, Rudy Giuliani — has led to the kind of dramatic airing of differences that characterized Trump’s unconventional and often squabbling campaign team.\nAdvertisement\nAnd it traces the outlines of the enduring split in the Republican Party between establishment figures who scoffed at Trump’s chances of victory and the grass-roots insurgents who backed him as a disrupter of the Washington power structure.\nThe most publicly vocal faction has been the group opposed to Romney, which has questioned whether he would be loyal after his searing criticism of Trump during the campaign. But Trump himself has told aides that he believes Romney “looks the part” and would make a fine secretary of state, a senior Trump official said Thursday. Trump, who is always difficult to read and is capable of changing his mind at any minute, has also praised Giuliani in recent conversations with acquaintances.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Even Thanksgiving did not provide a reprieve from the extraordinary public efforts to cast doubt on Romney. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said on Twitter that she had received “a deluge” of concern from people warning against picking Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor.\nThose raising concerns about Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and an early and loyal supporter of Trump, have said they fear that his tangle of foreign business ties could lead to a damaging confirmation battle. They are also worried that Giuliani lacks the vigor for the globe-trotting job.\nBoth Romney and Giuliani have made their interest in the role known to Trump. But while Giuliani has been very public about his intentions — angering Trump at times with his statements — Romney has been more reserved.\nAdvertisement\nThe split over the two men has opened the door for other candidates. One potential pick Trump and his team have entertained is General John Kelly of the Marines, a former head of the US Southern Command. Others are David H. Petraeus, a retired general and former CIA director, and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, according to two people involved in the process.\nAsked about Trump’s deliberations, a spokesman, Jason Miller, said in an e-mail Thursday, “The president-elect is meeting with a number of well-qualified potential selections for this important position who share his America First foreign policy — some of whom have been made public and others who have not — and the president-elect will make public his decision when he has finalized it.”\nRomney would represent a departure from the hard-liners Trump has already picked for his national security team. Aides like Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, have expressed doubts about how loyal Romney would be given his denunciation of Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud.” Bannon and others have told colleagues they fear that a State Department under Romney could turn into something of a rogue agency.\nAsked to explain her Twitter post about Romney, Conway said that while she trusted Trump’s judgment, she found it notable that the most outrage directed at Trump from the party’s grass-roots “is not against something he said but something he may do.” In another post, she said that being “loyal” was an important characteristic for a secretary of state.\nOthers hoping to catch Trump’s ear have taken their message to a place they know he is likely to absorb it: cable news. Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, who has spoken with Trump about his concerns that Giuliani would not be confirmed by the Senate, has taken to making those arguments on a daily basis on his morning show, which he knows Trump watches.\nOthers, like Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, have gone on television to try to dissuade Trump from picking Romney. Huckabee, who said during the 2008 presidential campaign that Romney reminded voters of “the guy who laid them off,” told Fox News on Wednesday that picking Romney would be “a real insult” to Trump’s supporters. Giuliani is a favorite of the Republican voters who turned out in large numbers to lift Trump to victory.\nSean Hannity, a Fox News host whose opinion Trump often privately solicits, has also been deeply critical of Romney on his show.\nShortly after the election, Giuliani told associates that he believed the job was his. He had communicated to Trump’s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions.\nBut he began to run afoul of Trump when he told a Wall Street Journal forum that he would probably be a better candidate than John Bolton, who served as one of George W. Bush’s ambassadors to the United Nations.\nAnd when reports surfaced about Giuliani’s foreign business entanglements and highly compensated speechmaking, Trump grew even warier. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar, and Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.\nAs a backup plan, some of Trump’s aides encouraged him to meet with Romney. Although some in Trump’s inner circle, like Reince Priebus, his choice for chief of staff, thought that such a meeting would anger the president-elect’s supporters, Trump went ahead, and he started sounding Giuliani out about a different post, director of national intelligence.\nBut what many people believed would be a perfunctory meeting with Romney last weekend at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., turned into something more substantial.\nTrump liked Romney quite a bit and was intrigued by the possibility of such a camera-ready option to represent the country around the globe, Trump advisers say. The following day, Giuliani met with Trump and urged him to make a decision in one direction or the other.\nThe option of a third person like Kelly has gained currency in recent days inside the transition team. Kelly served as the senior military assistant to former defense secretary Leon E. Panetta. The Southern Command he led for four years under Obama is responsible for all US military activities in South and Central America.",

      "text": "Gauteng High Court in Pretoria (Picture: Google SV) A mother bludgeoned a three-year-old girl to death after finding out the toddler had been raped by her nine-year-old son. \nThe South African woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, murdered her friend’s young daughter Asanda Mbuku in order to ‘silence her’ and protect her own child.\nThese are all the ways the US tried (and failed) to kill Fidel Castro She killed the toddler with a blunt rocked and dumped the body in her back garden, and covered her body up with corrugated iron sheets – while Asanda’s family formed a desperate search party.\nThe 32-year-old mother told Gauteng High Court in Pretoria that she was looking after Asanda as a favour to her parents when she found her half naked near the door. She then realised that her son had raped the toddler.\n‘I realised she was not moving and sprinkled her with water to wake her, but she did not,’ she told the court, adding that she killed her out of fear that she would wake up and tell people what had happened.\n‘I took a rock and I hit her on the head to kill her. I hid her at the back of my garden. I did all this because my son had raped her and I did not want anyone to find out. I burnt her jacket and shoes.\n‘When her parents came to the house to fetch her, I said I did not know where she was.’\nUS taxpayers 'face £2.4m bill so Secret Service can stay at Trump Tower' The rapist nine-year-old was sent to school the next day as usual, but he couldn’t keep what he had done a secret and confessed all to his aunt when he got home.\nAppearing at court on Wednesday, the woman pleaded guilty to one count of murder and another of attempting to obstruct justice, and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.\nJudge Tshifhiwa Maumela said it was a shame she didn’t realise that her son would not have been arrested, as in South Africa a child under the age of 10 cannot be held criminally responsible for their actions.",

      "text": "2 This is at best a guess, since Google might not have covered the initial citation as it did not become widely spread at that time. The alleged date of the citation was before Google was founded after all. – March Ho Jul 24 '15 at 10:52 6 1973 indeed predates the founding of Google, but Google News has access to digitized archives of many newspapers in English and other languages. Also, it is highly likely that a quote like this would have left at least some trace in the online universe in the past two decades. That's why I agree with @PauloBuchsbaum, the fact that all actual references on the Internet date from the past few months is strongly suggestive of a hoax. I also don't seem to find any relevant references to a journalist named Brian/Bryan Davis. – Viktor Toth Jul 26 '15 at 2:23 There's plenty of info if you equate Brian Davis with Neil Brian Davis, who closely matches the profile. He was Australian but worked for an English company about the time, as well as with American papers. – HDE 226868 Jul 27 '15 at 20:32 8 If this quote were real, it likely would have made the rounds on the Internet during Obama's run for the Democratic primary in 2007, and again as soon as Pope Francis was named. People would have been speculating \"Does this mean Cuba/US relations are about to change?\" – Flimzy Jul 29 '15 at 2:25",

      "text": " Google+\nLinda Davidson/The Washington Post/AP\nWhite nationalist leader Richard Spencer spoke to the media on Nov. 18.\nBy Renée Graham Globe columnist November 27, 2016\nAS DONALD TRUMP scrounged for votes in this nation’s shadiest corners, his rhetoric about making America strong and respected was a direct appeal to white men. At its core, his slogan “Make America Great Again” is about restoration of white male supremacy — and the notion that for this nation to be great, white men must be dominant, front, and center. For some of these men, it’s been an unbearable eight years with Barack Obama as president; electing a woman would have been a bridge that much farther.\nTrump’s stridency made him president, and now white supremacists and nationalists are acting as if they’ve hit the swastika sweepstakes. Meanwhile Trump, who riled up white men by promising to return America to a “Mad Men”-style era that will never again exist, pretends recent outrages have nothing to do with him.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, others voted for Trump as well. Yet no demographic backed his candidacy with as much fervor as white men of all ages, education levels, and socioeconomic backgrounds. For them, Trump was a corrective candidate, someone with potential to make their country into a place they again understood and recognized.\nEven his oft-repeated assertion that only he could save us and make the world right was a proclamation of male superiority. (No woman would ever make such a claim.) Trump’s man is one for whom negotiation and compromise are tantamount to capitulation. When Trump bellowed about building a wall and making Mexico pay for it, he was flexing a stark, redoubtable version of American brawn right out of a John Wayne movie.\nFor white men who feel put upon, it was an antidote to a near-decade of impotence. Now Trump’s most disreputable supporters are moving on his promises of supremacy.\nAt the recent conference of the National Policy Institute in Washington, D.C, self-described as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States, and around the world,” leader Richard Spencer greeted his audience with “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” In his speech, he spoke of an America that was “until this past generation, a white country designed for ourselves, and our posterity.” He added, “It is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us.”\nAt the end, in a room filled mostly with white men, they flashed Nazi salutes.\nFor months, hate has feasted on hate. Yet Trump acts as if it’s just something happening outside his window, and he’s as shocked as anyone else. When asked by Lesley Stahl on “60 Minutes” to respond to the swell of bigotry and violence spurred by his election, the best the soon-to-be 45th president could muster was: “I’m so saddened to hear that, and I say, ‘Stop it,’ if it helps.”\nAdvertisement\nIt doesn’t help when I say, “Stop it,” to my dog when he’s dragging his bum across the rug. Hard to imagine such a flaccid retort will have any effect on those spraying swastikas on buildings or telling Hispanics and Muslims they’ll soon be deported.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump drew sharp lines between his supporters and everyone else, including immigrants and Muslims. Now he sits there like butter won’t melt in his mouth, unwilling to acknowledge his role in giving his most extreme backers a voice.\nAs Trump confronts what he might actually have to do as president, he’s slightly moderating his tone for some audiences. He’s already disenchanting some supporters by backing away from his promise to hound Hillary Clinton into an orange jumpsuit.\nHe can’t afford to alienate those who’ve anointed him messiah of their movement. Yet he also can’t control them. With the way things are already going, Trump may soon discover the monster he’s unleashed is worse than he ever imagined.\nRenée Graham is a Globe columnist.

      "text": "She parked at this retail centre (Picture: Google) A woman says she was told it’s against the law to shop at a retail park twice in one day. \nKeri Ewins, 42, said she visited the out-of-town shopping area in the morning, parking her car to pick up some things at Home Bargains on the morning of November 10.\nTeacher jailed for having intercourse with boy, 13, repeatedly for nearly two years She drove off, then got on with the rest of her day including going to a doctor’s appointment and the school run.\nLater in the afternoon, she returned to the retail park to go to Halfords at Christchurch Retail Park near Bournemouth.\nJust a normal day, right? Why are we telling you this?\nWell, apparently going back to the retail park was against the law.\nObviously, it isn’t actually – but Keri, a healthcare assistant from Lymington, says that is what she was told when she received an £85 fine in the post.\nIf a parking ticket is unfair there are ways to fight it (Picture: Getty) The private company which runs the car park said she had been parked there for six hours and forty minutes, even though she had actually driven off and come back during that time.\nHighview Parking said they weren’t able to rewind the CCTV to find out if she had left the area and returned, according to Keri.\n‘When I phoned them, they were so rude, saying I had to pay the £85,’ Keri told the Bournemouth Echo. \nCoach full of passengers gets stuck in Lewisham sinkhole ‘They also said that once you have been to the car park, you couldn’t return within four hours.\n‘I mean what if I was an elderly person and forgot to get dog food or something and then had to go back? They said that was breaking the law. It’s just ridiculous.\n‘I’ve been back to the park and taken a picture of the signs. All they say is that you can’t park for longer than three hours and return within one.’\nKeri added: ‘It also doesn’t allow for if you are dropping someone off or picking them up.\n‘I can prove I wasn’t there for six hours because of the appointments I had.\n’85 is a lot of money; I’m just not paying it. If they want to take me to court they can.\n‘I’m really worried vulnerable people have had the same happen to them and hope this might warn people.’\nCommenting on the original article, others said they had experienced similar problems.\nCarol Faulker wrote: ‘My elderly disabled parents received a fine here because they had parked for over three hours. They had parked outside Costa in a disabled space and gone for a coffee, then moved the car to outside Petsathome into a disabled space to do some shopping.\n‘After this they then decided to eat at Pizza Hut, so moved the car there. So yes they were there for more than three hours because they were using all the retailers!\n‘I wrote on their behalf and the fine was canceled but it should never have been given. They are elderly and it worried them terribly.’\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Highview Parking for comment.\nFighting an unfair parking ticket If you think you have been given a parking ticket which is not fair (in a private car park i.e. not issues by the council or police), there are ways to fight it. \nThey are often classed as invoices rather than fines, and may not be legally enforceable. \nThere are numerous ways you can fight against an unfair ticket – you can help your case by collecting evidence of why it was unfair, e.g. in Keri’s case the signs saying people can return after one hour. \nMoneysavingexpert.com has some thorough advice here . \n\n",

      "title": "The Man Behind the Google Curtain",
      "text": "The Man Behind the Google Curtain Caption \n    \nThe Google fairy tale is a familiar one by now. Employees feast on farm-fresh fare and take on-campus naps. Corporate drudgery is banished from the lush Googleplex. Instead of cubicles, you’ll encounter bright primary colors, zippy golf carts, bikes connecting distant buildings and even the skeleton of a life-size T. rex — a not-so-subtle company reminder for employees to never become obsolete. \nIt all contributes to the mythology of the company, the so-called Googliness, that X factor. Equally responsible? Matt Teper, Google’s chief wordmaster, and former speechwriter for Vice President Joe Biden. Teper and his team in the company’s little-known editorial department are tasked with both the big and small of telling the story of one of the most important companies in the world. They pound out op-eds, pen speeches for top executives, blog and handle social media. As Google’s Head of Editorial, Teper sits at the cusp of a changing profession within corporate-identity construction. In an age where companies must not only be high-performing, but also exude rock-star status like celebrities and politicians do, Teper is part of a fleet of Olivia Popes–cum–Sam Seaborns. Many are alums of Washington, D.C. who flocked westward to Silicon Valley and now wield their talents to manage the image of a company through crisis and growth. Source Sean Culligan/OZY On the day I swing by to meet 39-year-old Teper, he’s retreated outside, away from the noisy Mac-clacking workspaces and onto a sunny patio. In this techno-utopia, deeply Midwestern Teper is a tad out of place. He’s got silvery hair and doesn’t exactly fit the mold of a typical millennial programmer. After growing up in Milwaukee, Teper studied journalism at the University of Texas and earned a law degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Teper never intended to be a lawyer, but that’s when he honed the “creative juices that come from writing and storytelling mixed with policy pushes and persuasive thinking,” he says. After a few brief stints of speechwriting at nonprofits and advocacy groups, he landed the job under Biden, writing up to eight speeches a week, mostly on the fly, aboard Air Force II . These days, Teper still bears “the soul of a speechwriter,” says David Murray, the executive director of the Professional Speechwriters Association. “He’s still got bags under his eyes from working with Biden years and years ago. He’s young, but there’s an old weariness about him.” Jaded after three-plus years of nonstop travel and crushing White House workloads, Teper eagerly traded his black suit and tie, which “felt like a costume,” for jeans and sneakers. Basking in the sunshine today, he doesn’t look nostalgic for his once mercurial schedule or Biden’s habit of speaking off-script. Before Teper came along, Biden was infamous for gaffes like “You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent” in 2006 or describing Obama as “the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy” in 2007. But Teper was one of the rare few who could both stomach an unpredictable agenda to hammer out speeches at a moment’s notice, says Murray, and embrace his boss’ embarrassing flubs. (The Office of the Vice President did not respond to requests for comment.) Later on, Teper’s knack for handling scandal and slipups helped him shine as Eric Schmidt’s speechwriter — quite an undertaking, given how many public faux pas the former Google CEO committed in the past. Teper’s explanation of the job is simple: “Google strives to be your cool, interesting friend that you run into at a party who knows a little bit more than you,” he says. In Silicon Valley, tech titans like Google and Facebook now have in-house speechwriters where they didn’t decades before. “Silicon Valley touches so many different aspects of people’s lives and is one of the hotbeds of change, and wherever there’s a change, you need people to communicate what that means,” says Ian Griffith, an executive communications strategist. Teper’s outsider “ignorance” helps his fellow techlorians weed out wonky software jargon that simply won’t resonate with Google’s global audience. “My ability to have a bigger picture helps bring people out of their gilded tech silo,” while also harnessing the style and gravitas of the nation’s most seasoned political leaders, he says. Source Sean Culligan/OZY Now, Teper is retooling Google Insider, an internal news channel for 60,000-plus employees, and presiding over the launch of Keyword, the company’s official blog on product updates, company culture and business strategy at Google. He doesn’t have to touch the tough stuff often — like privacy snafus or tax-evasion allegations — and instead gets to remain comfortably in the role of internal propagandist-slash-cheerleader. In that sense, the stakes of Teper’s words today may not be as high as they were during his Washington days. But his power — and that creativity — comes in the broad license he’s given to tell Google’s more offbeat stories, ones that touch on the larger zeitgeist the company is fueling. And in those tales? Self-driving cars as a boon for sex , spooky street views from Google Maps and how their machine-learning tech could save , um, a sea cow. Looks like he’s got plenty of material with enough humor and color to make Uncle Joe proud.",

      "text": "\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, Google has captured a 10% share of the premium smartphone segment in India with the Pixel and Pixel XL. The premium smartphone segment is defined where the smartphone is priced over ₹30,000 ($440).\nGoogle shipped 33,000 units of Pixel to India as of October end after launching earlier in the month, becoming the number 3 player for the month. However, per the report, Apple continues to maintain a clear lead in this segment with around 66 percent of the overall market share, followed by Samsung with around 23 percent share.\nGoogle is aggressively trying to take advantage of the lack of competition in this segment and does not want to miss-out on the opportunities. The company is leaving no stones unturned with heavy spend on marketing, there are exchange and cashback offers also available for the new entrant. A refreshing and feature packed Pixel is making for a good proposition against the incumbents Apple’s new iPhone and Samsung’s [Galaxy] S7 smartphones.\nGoogle has been running a 360 degrees advertorial campaign in major cities across India as well as heavy spends on digital and print. The company offered no-cost EMIs for buying Pixel devices from both online and offline stores, cashback for HDFC Bank card holders, as well as an exchange program and extra discount on Flipkart.\nOf course, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco aided the numbers for Google. The expected launch of the device in October never happened, leaving a void in the market for other flagship smartphones.\nWe are very enthused by the feedback from Indian customers and the initial response for Pixel has been extremely positive and in line with our expectations. Pixel is Google’s take on the total user experience as we envision it — bringing the best of Google’s software, such as the Google Assistant, with hardware that really brings the experience to life.\n– A Google spokesperson\nMind you, the report is based on units shipped, and not necessarily sold. The idle inventory with the retails too is counted towards the number. However, with heavy spends on marketing and generally positive reviews all around, Google is likely to maintain the market share, if not extend it in the quarter.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Q. This week my smartphone received an alert from Google listing the balances due on my credit cards. My response was “never” do it again, but I have to wonder about my personal financial/identity security. How did they get this information? Is it legal? A. Many credit card and utility companies send payment reminders by email that include details like the name on the account, the payment amount and the due date. What is probably happening here is that Google is automatically scanning your Gmail messages for notices about package deliveries, flight times, restaurant invitations, and yes — bill reminders — and using the information in smartphone alerts for its Google Now/Google Assistant software . Photo If you don’t want to see your bills or other types of personal information in your Google feed, you can make adjustments to the app’s settings. Credit The New York Times The Google bill-payment alert should not show the full account number or anything too specific, and should just echo the details contained in the message from the bill sender. If you look at the alert on the Google Now screen, you should see an option to view the original message so you can compare the two. (In the Google app, you can also type in “show me my bills” to see a list of emailed payment notices.) If anything arouses your suspicion, call your credit card companies to confirm your account security. Google makes no secret of the fact that it collects personal information from you as you partake of its free services like Gmail and Google Search. The company says it uses this data to make its services work better for the people who use them, although the information is also used for targeted advertising. If you do not want to get bill reminders or other smartphone alerts based on messages sent to your Gmail account, you can adjust your Google app settings to disable the payment notices or turn off the Google Now feed altogether. Open the Google app on your phone, tap the menu icon (or profile photo) in the top-left corner, select Settings and then Your Feed to make adjustments. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

      "text": " Google+\nJEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GETTY IMAGES/File\nSteven Mnuchin spoke to reporters at Trump Tower in New York earlier this month.\nBy Binyamin Appelbaum and Maggie Haberman New York Times November 29, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Steven Terner Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, sources close to the transition say.\nMnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Trump’s campaign. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the “X-Men” franchise and “Avatar.”\nAdvertisement\nAs Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would play an important role in shaping the administration’s economic policies, including a package of promised tax cuts, increased spending on infrastructure and changes in the terms of foreign trade. He could also help lead any effort to roll back President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and opening to Cuba by reimposing sanctions on Tehran and Havana.\nHis selection fits uneasily with much of Trump’s campaign rhetoric attacking the financial industry. Trump, in a campaign ad intended as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as the personification of a global elite that the ad said had “robbed our working class.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. But Mnuchin has said that he agrees with Trump’s priorities, and he was an early supporter of a candidate who clearly prizes loyalty.\nView Story Trump names Elaine Chao for Transportation President-elect Trump announced Tuesday he has picked Elaine Chao as transportation secretary.\nWhen Trump won New York’s Republican presidential primary in April, Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Trump’s invitation to become the campaign’s national finance director.\nA number of Mnuchin’s friends made comments to various publications expressing shock at the decision. Mnuchin was unfazed.\nAdvertisement\n“Nobody’s going to be, like, ‘Well, why did he do this?’ if I end up in the administration,” he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August.\nMnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after graduating from Yale University. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee trading in government securities and mortgage bonds.\nAfter leaving Goldman in 2002, he founded Dune Capital Management, a hedge fund named after the dunes near his beach house in the Hamptons.\nHe also started investing in the movie business and bought a house in Bel-Air. He is engaged to the actress Louise Linton, who would be his third wife. He told The Times in May that he has focused in recent years on the “West Coast economy,” although he added that he was not turning his back on Wall Street.\nMnuchin was part of a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He became chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation’s largest small-business lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid.\nDuring his tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers. Fair-housing groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, alleging that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods.\nMnuchin and Trump have known each other for years — not always under the best of circumstances. Mnuchin’s company helped to finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled.\nMnuchin has never worked in government, but Treasury secretaries are often drawn from the private sector. He would become the third Goldman alumnus to serve in the job, after Henry M. Paulson Jr., under President George W. Bush; and Robert E. Rubin, under President Bill Clinton.",

      "text": "  WITH Apple ’s iPhone 7 and Google’s new Pixel phones putting such an emphasis on powerful camera technology , smartphone photography is more robust than ever. And while phones typically have great built-in photography apps, many other options can be easier or expand your range. ProCamera is an excellent option for iOS devices. Using this app feels like raising a single-lens reflex camera to your eye: The first thing you see is a view through the camera lens, superimposed with many controls and information like the exposure and whether the flash is activated. With a few taps on the screen, you can display a grid to help compose a shot properly and a guide to warn if your composition is tilted (great for getting those tricky horizons straight). You can also control the white balance and the ISO setting and bring up a live histogram that shows how saturated the colors in the final photo will be. There are quick-access buttons to shoot in video, photo, high dynamic range or other modes and there’s even a bar code scanner option. Photo ProCamera includes an anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter. Most impressive is ProCamera’s anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter. In the settings menu, you can control most of the app’s features and select how much compression is applied to the final saved images. In other words, the app gives users professional-level control of an image. Because of its complexity, ProCamera takes a while to get used to, and the exact features depend on which iPhone you have. The app costs $5 and some features, like a low-light mode to help shoot better pictures at night, are upgrades that cost a few dollars each. It’s definitely worth it. \n  On Android, one equivalent to ProCamera is Camera FV-5 . This app also feels like using a single-lens reflex camera, with similar manual control. Camera FV-5 includes features like a live histogram, burst-mode shooting, exposure bracketing and time-lapse imagery. It also offers choices over the kind of files it saves to your device, and has a comprehensive settings page. Photo The Darkroom Photo Editor is a slightly simpler alternative to Photoshop for iOS. Unlike some other Android camera apps, Camera FV-5 has a professional-looking and easy-to-use interface. It costs $4. To edit that perfect portrait or landscape photo, Adobe’s software is the choice of professional photographers. There is a version for mobile devices too — Adobe Photoshop Fix — which lets you heal an image’s blemishes, adjust shadow intensity, fix the contrast or add effects like vignetting. There is also a powerful liquefy tool that can distort the image in a smooth way to pull off some shape-modifying effects.",
