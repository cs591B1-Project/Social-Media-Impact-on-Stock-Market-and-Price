      "text": "Credit cards are going the way of fax machines \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nIn Q3 2016, Starbucks beat estimates on earnings and revenue, but US same-store sales growth fell slightly short of expectations for another consecutive quarter, according to the company’s earnings presentation held Friday . This quarter, US same-store sales growth hit 4%, a percentage point below the 5% target Starbucks has been promising to return to. \nStarbucks Rewards, the company’s rewards and loyalty program, could be the tool the company needs to grow. Loyalty customers are poised to dominate in-store spend. Thirty-eight percent of Starbucks tender comes from rewards or gift cards, 33% of which are registered and enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, according to Starbucks exec Matthew Ryan. And that number could grow as the program expands following a revamp that shifted rewards structure from a per-transaction to a per-dollar basis — the program’s membership increased 18% in Q3. Digital comprises a significant share of that. The Starbucks mobile app accounts for 25% of total in-store purchases at the chain, and 26% in September, up from 20% in the previous year. That figure is flat sequentially, though Ryan emphasized that this is mostly a result of order consolidation thanks to the new rewards structure, rather than stagnating mobile spend. That growth indicates that digital engagement is poised to rise in the coming quarters. \nAnd Mobile Order & Pay, the chain’s order-ahead offering, could be the catalyst of that growth, ultimately accelerating same-store sales across the board. Mobile Order & Pay comprised 6% of Starbucks US sales in the quarter overall and 7% in September, a figure up from 5% in Q2. And its impact is continuing to expand; at some locations, up to 20% of orders at peak hours come through mobile order-ahead. That could help accelerate digital growth, particularly because customers that order in-app tend to be more engaged and have higher order volume. Starbucks also noted that mobile order-ahead leads to increased productivity in stores, which helps improve efficiency. New features the firm plans to unveil could help magnify that impact. Starbucks plans to expand the mobile order-ahead experience with its customers soon through new offerings like real-time personalized suggestions and the ability to save orders and stores. That could make the service even more appealing to consumers, and ultimately push more of the firm’s new rewards members to digital, therefore increasing customer engagement and, ultimately, spend. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nEvan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Addresses the key barriers that are preventing mobile in-store payments from taking off. Identifies the growth drivers that will ultimately carve a path for mainstream adoption. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

What is pumpkin spice? Aren’t pumpkins just a bland mushy food?\nIt’s hard to explain the true majesty and power of this simple flavor until one has tried it for themselves, which these curious rodents point out.\nPerhaps their biggest question, even more than “Why does everyone adore Pumpkin Spice?” is: Why hasn’t Pumpkin Spice been added to guinea pig food?\nIt’s time for our pets to enjoy the savory yet sweet sensation of this fall flavor too!\n ",

      "text": "Summary \nStarbucks maintains a 3 year dividend growth rate of 23.6%. \nStarbucks' forward P/E ratio is just over 21, a value statistic for a premier growth company. \nThere are new paths for Starbucks to continue its pace of double-digit growth. Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX ) dividend was increased by 25% with an overall yield just below that of the S&P 500 Index at 1.95%. Starbucks is the leading retailer, roaster, and brand of specialty coffee in the world. The global firm sells a wide variety of beverages and whole bean coffees through its global stores, supermarkets, and online. it was founded in 1971 when Starbucks opened first store in Seattle's Pike Place Market. It has over 24,000 company-owned stores worldwide including 3,581 abroad (primarily in Europe and China). Starbucks' sales are now over $20 billion a year. Starbucks initiated its first dividend on March 24, 2010 at $0.05 per share. The new dividend ($0.25) is five times what the firm paid over six year ago. Starbucks indicated it is targeting a consistent dividend payout range of 35 percent to 40 percent of net income. Starbucks currently ranks 38th in yield within the large cap consumer discretionary category. Starbucks has maintained a solid three-year growth rate of dividends of 23.6 percent. The quarterly dividend for the December payment will be $0.25 versus the prior year rate of $0.20 per share. Starbucks also released earnings results for the firm's Q4. Net income was $801 million, or $0.54 cents per share. This was an increase of 22% from last year's net income of $652.5 million, and 25% above the $0.43 cents per share earned last year. Total revenue grew by a solid 16% to $5.71 billion from $4.91 billion to the year previous. This revenue number topped the average analyst estimate of $5.68 billion. However, U.S. sales targets were behind target for the large consumer beverage company. Global same store sales of 4% missed analyst's consensus forecasts of 4.8%. But within the Americas, sales went up 5 percent. For the first quarter, Starbucks expects EPS of $0.51-$0.52. This is three cents below consensus estimates. For the next full year, Starbucks pegs earnings at $2.12-$2.14, also a few cents shy of consensus view. On the positive side of the ledger, mobile payments continue to gain more scale. These type of electronic payments rose to 25% of U.S. transactions. This is 25% higher than last year's number. The firm opened more than 2,000 new stores in the past twelve months. Positive news also came out of Asia, especially the China region where Starbucks is generating a higher 6% same-store growth. Revenue in Asia advanced by a stellar 29% to $839.2 million. Starbucks COO commented on Friday that he expects Starbucks' outlets in China to supersede those in the United States with over 5000 stores before 2022. Starbucks does qualify as a member of our Top 100 Dividend Stocks ( see below ). The dividend will be paid at the new higher rate on December 2, 2016, to shareholders of record at close of business on November 17, 2016. Starbucks is currently priced at $51.77. Listed in the table below are the quarterly dividend payments since 2010. Date",

      "text": "print \nBI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nIn Q3 2016, Starbucks beat estimates on earnings and revenue, but US same-store sales growth fell slightly short of expectations for another consecutive quarter, according to the company’s earnings presentation held Friday . This quarter, US same-store sales growth hit 4%, a percentage point below the 5% target Starbucks has been promising to return to. \nStarbucks Rewards, the company’s rewards and loyalty program, could be the tool the company needs to grow. Loyalty customers are poised to dominate in-store spend. Thirty-eight percent of Starbucks tender comes from rewards or gift cards, 33% of which are registered and enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, according to Starbucks exec Matthew Ryan. And that number could grow as the program expands following a revamp that shifted rewards structure from a per-transaction to a per-dollar basis — the program’s membership increased 18% in Q3. Digital comprises a significant share of that. The Starbucks mobile app accounts for 25% of total in-store purchases at the chain, and 26% in September, up from 20% in the previous year. That figure is flat sequentially, though Ryan emphasized that this is mostly a result of order consolidation thanks to the new rewards structure, rather than stagnating mobile spend. That growth indicates that digital engagement is poised to rise in the coming quarters. \nAnd Mobile Order & Pay, the chain’s order-ahead offering, could be the catalyst of that growth, ultimately accelerating same-store sales across the board. Mobile Order & Pay comprised 6% of Starbucks US sales in the quarter overall and 7% in September, a figure up from 5% in Q2. And its impact is continuing to expand; at some locations, up to 20% of orders at peak hours come through mobile order-ahead. That could help accelerate digital growth, particularly because customers that order in-app tend to be more engaged and have higher order volume. Starbucks also noted that mobile order-ahead leads to increased productivity in stores, which helps improve efficiency. New features the firm plans to unveil could help magnify that impact. Starbucks plans to expand the mobile order-ahead experience with its customers soon through new offerings like real-time personalized suggestions and the ability to save orders and stores. That could make the service even more appealing to consumers, and ultimately push more of the firm’s new rewards members to digital, therefore increasing customer engagement and, ultimately, spend. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nEvan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Addresses the key barriers that are preventing mobile in-store payments from taking off.

      "title": "Red Holiday Cups To Be Rolled Out By Starbucks This Week",
      "text": "Reports have it that the coffee chain Starbucks is expected to roll out their seasonal red holiday cups this week. Plus they’ll be offering a free beverage with the purchase of a holiday drink to its customers.\nCBS Los Angeles reports that Starbucks customers who buy one holiday drink can get another one free. This offer appears to be good from Nov. 10 through Nov. 14 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at participating stores.\nAs you may remember Starbucks received some backlash last year since their solid red holiday cup didn’t feature any holiday images or symbols.\nBreitbart.com even went as far as posting an article and alleged that all the typical signs of the holiday like the previously depicted images of ornaments and snowflakes had been removed and called the plain red cups a “War on Christmas.”\nHowever, other people have chimed in and disagreed with those who are in an uproar and claimed the cups weren’t festive enough with the hashtags #ItsJustACup and even #AreYouSerious.\nAccording to an anonymous photo leaked by a Starbucks barista, the design on the holiday cup is supposed to feature more of a holiday theme this year.\nLast week Starbucks unveiled a green cup , that features a mosaic of more than a hundred people drawn in one continuous stroke, a work of art by Shogo Ota. It was designed to represent shared humanity and connection. Some people mistook that as Starbucks holiday cup and got into a bit of an uproar over it.",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Talks Retail, Election And ‘Amazon Effect’",
      "text": "Share \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz recently shared his thoughts with GeekWire about recent trends in consumer behavior, how they relate to the U.S. election, what he calls the “Amazon effect” and how Starbucks will stay ahead. \nGeekWire quoted Schultz as saying: “I don’t think we’ve ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election,” he said. “It’s very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer.” \nEveryone’s feeling the toll of an unusually brutal election season. Stocks and equities are sliding down, consumers fear their financial health will weaken and banks are bracing for a rough four years at least. “I think everyone is hoping that, post-election, there will be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior,” said Schultz. \nOn top of election uncertainty, Schultz noted a dramatic shift in consumer trends. He noted “a significant drop in foot traffic on ‘Main Street’ and in malls, not only domestically and around the world as a result of e-Commerce, the web and what I’ll loosely describe as ‘the Amazon effect.’” \nAs customers do more shopping from home, brands are more and more often announcing brick-and-mortar closures. “Over the next five years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer … There’s going to be a tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.” \nDespite the unstable political climate and the changing face of retail, Starbucks continues to do well. GeekWire reported Starbuck’s earnings at $5.7 billion for Q3, a rise of 16 percent from last year. “We are going to be in a very unique position five, 10 years down the road because there’s going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I’m not talking about the coffee category, I’m talking overall … We’re playing the long game in everything we do.” Starbucks opened 2,100 stores worldwide in 2016. \nSchultz contributed his success to Starbuck’s continued innovation, including expanding the “roastery” experience from Seattle to Shanghai and New York. “ As good as Seattle is, wait ’til you see what we’re going to do in New York and Shanghai. It’s going to change the company, the brand and everything we do.”",

      "text": "Rick McKee / Augusta Chronicle \nBy Peter Funt \nA sign on the door at Starbucks advised that hours on Christmas Day will be 4:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Good to know-but 60 days in advance? Inside the Paso Robles, California, store coffee was being served in festive green cups, although outside it was 82 degrees on a sunny fall afternoon.\nChannel 4 in New York City was running a commercial for Radio City’s Christmas Spectacular: “A mesmerizing holiday tradition.” The mall in Tempe, Arizona, was playing “Holly Jolly Christmas.” An email from the NBA offered free shipping on basketball shirts from the “2016 Christmas Day Collection.”\nA full-page ad by Lord & Taylor heralded the “unveiling” of its holiday windows. The Hallmark Channel was pumping out Christmas programming 24/7.\nToo much, too soon? Humbug. There’s no stopping the retail-driven juggernaut to New Year’s Day that we now refer to as The Holiday Season.\nIt used to be that Christmas decorations went up the day after Thanksgiving, confining the merriment to roughly a month. Nowadays, on home shopping cable-TV channels it runs about six months, beginning with Christmas in July. For some retailers it starts after Labor Day, while the Scrooge-like holdouts wait until after Halloween.\nThe polling firm Penn Schoen Berland surveyed 1,000 consumers in late August and found that one-third of them had already started Christmas shopping or planned to by Labor Day. Among parents the figure was 50 percent.\nMany factors contribute to what is known as Christmas creep, but clearly the condition is commerce-based, rather than being tied to faith or family. As more holiday buying takes place online-and 2016 might be the first year in which the figure reaches 50 percent of all sales-it has the unintended consequence of pushing the start of retail sales even earlier.\nTrying to compete with online merchants, Walmart has already added “holiday helpers” to assist shoppers along with “selfie stations” and in-store toy demonstrations. Target has a “Wondershop” with several thousand seasonal items. Kmart and Toys R Us are promoting holiday deals designed to compete with online bargains.\nAs retailers expand the calendar their ads permeate newspapers and TV, adding to a premature holiday buzz. The shopping mall, which in many communities is the new Main Street, supports the merchants’ wishes by rushing holiday decorations. Kids see it all unfold, and the creep becomes a mad dash.\nIt’s axiomatic that people tend to expand a task to fill the time available to complete it. Given four months of holiday promotions, some shoppers willingly take four months to accomplish what might ordinarily get done in a week.\nMoreover, does the commercial creep impact the interpersonal side of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah? At minimum it dilutes the holidays, blurring their deeper meanings.\nThe online site CreditCards.com did some research in September and found that about one million Americans had already completed their holiday shopping for 2016.\nYet, the rush to buy is clearly leaving some folks conflicted if not downright depressed about Christmas creep. The same research found that 74 percent of shoppers are annoyed that holiday sales start earlier than ever before.\nA pharmacy in Sacramento pulled its Halloween merchandise two days early this year to meet a corporate directive about Christmas decorations. That, you’ll agree, is rather creepy.\n—\nPeter Funt can be reached at www.CandidCamera.com\nPeter Funt is a writer and speaker.

      "title": "The worst things you can do at Starbucks, according to a barista",
      "text": "You should never do these things at Starbucks. Getty Images\nI’ve been working as a Starbucks barista on my campus for over a year now. Don’t get me wrong — I love my job. There are few things that make me happier when someone asks for a suggestion and then ends up loving it, or comes back to thank me because their drink came out great.\nWith that being said, though, there are a handful of things Starbucks customers do that really grind my gears, and I’m sharing this article with the hopes that you can spare your barista the grief and avoid doing them as well.\nView As: One Page Slides 1. Not saying what size Luis Galdamez/Reuters I get it, you’re at Starbucks because you need your daily fix of caffeine, and if you’re anything like me, you’re like a zombie before you get it. With that being said, though, more people than you would think don’t say what size drink they want — probably about a third of all customers don’t.\nEven if you don’t know the Starbucks lingo, you can ask for a “large” and we’ll know what it means, but, please, don’t give us some really complicated order without saying what size so we can actually mark the cup as you say it. It just gets really repetitive having to ask customer after customer what size drink they want while trying to remember their orders.\n2. Ordering while on your phone A Starbucks store is seen inside the Tom Bradley terminal at LAX airport in Los Angeles Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Also with ordering, please have the courtesy to get off of your phone for two seconds to communicate your order. Not only is it incredibly rude to be on the phone or glued to your text when trying to order, but chances are we won’t be able to understand you and you won’t be paying attention to us if we ask you a question. So please, hang up with mom before getting in line.\n3. Dumping coffee into the trash Madison Malone Kircher/Tech Insider When we ask you if you want room for cream in your coffee, it is so that there is space in the cup to put milk in if you wish. That’s not such a hard concept, is it? If not, then why do people ask for no room but then go over and dump half a cup of hot coffee into the trash to add milk? Please stop doing this. The trash bags are already disgusting when we get around to changing them, and dumping liquid in them just makes it worse.\n4. “I wanted that iced” Getty Images/Justin Sullivan We all make mistakes, but if I had a penny for every for every time I heard this one, I could afford all the Starbucks my heart desires. Unless you specify, all of our espresso beverages are made hot. I don’t care if it’s the middle of summer; you need to let us know if you want something iced. We’re happy to remake it for you but it messes up our flow and slows us down, and this could all be avoided by specifying when you order.\nThis also applies to, “I wanted that with soy,” or, “I didn’t want whip on that.” We are baristas, not psychics.\n5. “Frappé” Katie Schaumann/Getty Images A “frappé” is a drink at McDonald’s. Starbucks does not have “frappés.” If you order a “frappé” instead of a Frappuccino, you will sound stupid and your barista will judge you, no questions asked.\n6. “Is this mine?” REUTERS/Carlo Allegri You just ordered a small hot drink one minute ago, so, no, this large iced drink is not yours. I don’t get this. You think that all of these people that have been waiting here longer than you are just standing around for fun? This venti Frappuccino with whipped cream is not your tall hot chai tea latte. We make drinks in order, so your order is not going to be ready right after you pay.\n7. Being in a hurry Flickr / Aranami This one goes along with the last one. We make drinks in order, so we are not going to prioritize yours just because you are in a hurry. It’s extremely rude to ask the barista to make your drink first because you need to make it across campus in 5 minutes. It’s not our fault that you thought that would be enough time to order Starbucks and make it to your meeting.\n8. Iced Caramel Macchiato Rafi Letzter/Business Insider My last pet peeve is probably the one that bothers me the most. Macchiatos are not supposed to be iced. Macchiato in Italian means “marked,” meaning that your milk is marked with espresso, creating a strong coffee flavor at first that gradually fades into sweet milk. When you order it iced and drink it through a straw, this is already going to be backwards since you are starting at the bottom.\nAnd to make things worse, a piece of me dies every time I watch someone stir their iced caramel macchiato after they get it, combining the layers. Or worse, order it “upside down”. That isn’t a caramel macchiato anymore. It’s an iced latte. If that’s what you want, order that, but why am I wasting my time making a macchiato if you’re just going to mess it up?\nIt’s clear that nobody actually knows what a caramel macchiato is and that they are just ordering it because it sounds cool, but please don’t. If you want to know what a drink is, ask your barista. We love to share our knowledge.\nLong story short, I ask you to please avoid doing these things, in attempt to help keep your barista sane amidst all the crazy, caffeine-deprived people we encounter on a daily basis.\nRead the original article on Spoon University .

There are few things that make me happier when someone asks for a suggestion and then ends up loving it, or comes back to thank me because their drink came out great.\nWith that being said, though, there are a handful of things Starbucks customers do that really grind my gears, and I’m sharing this article with the hopes that you can spare your barista the grief and avoid doing them as well.\n1. Not saying what size Luis Galdamez/Reuters \nI get it, you’re at Starbucks because you need your daily fix of caffeine, and if you’re anything like me, you’re like a zombie before you get it. With that being said, though, more people than you would think don’t say what size drink they want — probably about a third of all customers don’t.\nEven if you don’t know the Starbucks lingo, you can ask for a “large” and we’ll know what it means, but, please, don’t give us some really complicated order without saying what size so we can actually mark the cup as you say it. It just gets really repetitive having to ask customer after customer what size drink they want while trying to remember their orders.\n\n\n2. Ordering while on your phone Lucy Nicholson/Reuters \nAlso with ordering, please have the courtesy to get off of your phone for two seconds to communicate your order. Not only is it incredibly rude to be on the phone or glued to your text when trying to order, but chances are we won’t be able to understand you and you won’t be paying attention to us if we ask you a question. So please, hang up with mom before getting in line. \n\n\n3. Dumping coffee into the trash Madison Malone Kircher/Tech Insider \nWhen we ask you if you want room for cream in your coffee, it is so that there is space in the cup to put milk in if you wish. That’s not such a hard concept, is it? If not, then why do people ask for no room but then go over and dump half a cup of hot coffee into the trash to add milk? Please stop doing this. The trash bags are already disgusting when we get around to changing them, and dumping liquid in them just makes it worse. \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

Analysis of Starbucks’ Dividend Increase Starbucks stands out as one of the best managed companies that is able to produce strong revenue and dividend growth November 07, 2016 | About: SBUX +0% \nStarbucks’ ( NASDAQ:SBUX ) dividend increased by 25% with an overall yield just below that of the S&P 500 Index at 1.95%. \nStarbucks is the leading retailer, roaster and brand of specialty coffee in the world. The global firm sells a wide variety of beverages and whole bean coffees through its global stores, supermarkets and online. It has 8,875 company-owned stores in the Americas and 3,581 abroad (primarily in Europe and China). \nStarbucks’ sales are now over $20 billion a year. Starbucks initiated its first dividend on March 24, 2010, at five cents per share. The new dividend (25 cents) is five times what the firm paid over six years ago. Starbucks indicated it is targeting a consistent dividend payout range of 35% to 40% of net income. Starbucks currently ranks 38th in yield within the large-cap consumer discretionary category. Starbucks has maintained a solid three-year growth rate of dividends of 23.6%. The quarterly dividend for the December payment will be 25 cents versus the prior year rate of 20 cents per share. How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? \nStarbucks also released earnings results for the company's fourth quarter. Net income was $801 million, or 54 cents cents per share. This was an increase of 22% from last year’s net income of $652.5 million and 25% above the 43 cents per share earned last year. Total revenue grew by a solid 16% to $5.71 billion from $4.91 billion in the year prior. This revenue number topped the average analyst estimate of $5.68 billion. However, U.S. sales targets were behind target for the large consumer beverage company. Global same-store sales of 4% missed analyst’s consensus forecasts of 4.8%. But within the Americas, sales went up 5%. \nFor the first quarter, Starbucks expects EPS of 51 cents to 52 cents. This is three cents below consensus estimates. For the next full year, Starbucks pegs earnings at $2.12 to $2.14, also a few cents shy of consensus view. \nOn the positive side of the ledger, mobile payments continue to gain more scale. These type of electronic payments rose to 25% of U.S. transactions. This is 25% higher than last year’s number. \nThe company opened more than 2,000 new stores in the past twelve months. Positive news also came out of Asia, especially the China region where Starbucks is generating a higher 6% same-store growth. Revenue in Asia advanced by a stellar 29% to $839.2 million. Starbucks' chief operating officer commented on Friday that he expects Starbucks’ outlets in China to supersede those in the United States with over 5,000 stores before 2022. \nStarbucks does qualify as a new member of our Top 100 Dividend Stocks ( see below ). \nThe dividend will be paid at the new higher rate on Dec. 2 to shareholders of record at close of business on Nov. 17. Starbucks is currently priced at $51.77. Listed in the table below are the quarterly dividend payments since 2010. Date \nAnalysis of Starbucks Corp. is based upon our five key criteria, which include; Category Dividend Growth (3-6 year avg) 31.9% \nAdditional Information on price-sales (P/S) ratio and historical yield: % Yield 3 Year Div. Growth Rate 6 Year Div. Growth Rate SPS 2016 Starbucks maintains a three-year dividend growth rate of 23.6%. Starbucks maintains a credit rating of A-. This is an investment grade. Starbucks’ current dividend yield (1.95%) is at the top of its five-year average historical dividend yield. Starbucks maintains a beta of 0.95, lower than the average company. Starbucks’s forward P/E ratio is just over 21, a value statistic for a premier growth company. \nNegatives Starbucks’ dividend yield is below that of the S&P 500 Index. Starbucks is trading at a higher than average P/S basis. \nOverall, our analysis of Starbucks’ third-quarter dividend increase and earnings results are positive. Both revenue and earnings beat forecasts. The large-cap company continues to increase its dividend at one of the highest rates within the sector. \nMobile payments continue to gain steam along with momentous growth in the China region. There are also new paths for Starbucks over the next several years to continue its pace of double-digit growth. One is its new new Roastery stores. The new Starbucks Reserve Roastery stores are dedicated to providing coffee education and availability of their small-lot Starbucks Reserve coffees. The first one opened in Seattle in 2014. Openings are expected in Shanghai in 2017 and in New York City and Tokyo by the end of 2018. \nThe company is experimenting with new smaller store formats and expanding their food offering to customers. Its rewards program continues to be a strength and builds brand loyalty. Another growth area is the firm’s single-serve coffee division, which includes its VIA product and the company’s K-Cup partnership with Keurig Green Mountain. \nAll these are strong positive for Starbucks and within the competitive food and restaurant industry, Starbucks stands out as one of the best managed companies that is able to produce strong revenue and earnings growth. \nAlthough its yield is still below 2%, it is now at the upper edge of its historical range and highest since August of 2012. The stock maintains a beta below the market as well, a rarity for a large-cap growth company. Based on its compelling yearly dividend increases, moderate forward P/E, excellent revenue and earnings prospects and high credit rating, Starbucks has entered our Top 100 Dividend Stocks list at number 90, replacing Archer Daniels. \nDisclosure: I have no position in SBUX.

PART 2 OF 8 Strong Sales in Asia-Pacific and China Drive Starbucks’s Revenue By Ralph Nathan | Nov 7, 2016 4:27 pm EST Revenue sources \nStarbucks ( SBUX ) has classified its operations into five categories: Americas, China and Asia-Pacific (or CAP), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), channel development, and all other segments. In fiscal 4Q16, Starbucks’s Americas revenue formed 69.5% of its total revenue, while CAP, channel development, and EMEA formed 14.7%, 9.1%, and 4.7%, respectively. 4Q16 revenue \nStarbucks posted revenue of $5.7 billion, which represents a growth of 16.2% from the $4.9 billion reported in fiscal 4Q15. The revenue growth was driven by positive SSSG (same-store sales growth) and unit growth in the last 12 months. \nRevenue from the Americas segment rose 17.3% to $4 billion. The SSSG of 5% and the addition of 804 new restaurants in the last 12 months drove revenue from the Americas segment. The CAP segment posted revenue growth of 28.7%, driven by SSSG of 1% and the addition of 981 new restaurants. \nHowever, revenue from the EMEA region fell 12.4% in the quarter, due to SSSG of -1% and refranchising. The company operated 214 fewer company-owned restaurants in the EMEA region than it did in 4Q15. Strengthening of the US dollar also contributed towards the decline in revenue from this segment. \nThe channel development segment posted revenue of $518.5 million, which represents a growth of 13.5%. The revenue growth was driven by strong sales of K-Cups and the launch of new items, such as Fall Blend and Caffè Latte K-Cups. Starbucks’s and PepsiCo’s ( PEP ) North American Coffee Partnership contributed to the revenue growth by increasing its market share in the liquid coffee and energy segment through strong performance from the Doubleshot Frappuccino. Peers comparisons \nDuring the same period, Dunkin’ Brands ( DNKN ), Domino’s Pizza ( DPZ ), and McDonald’s ( MCD ) saw their revenue rise -1.3%, 5.2%, and -2.9%, respectively. Outlook \nDuring fiscal 2017, analysts are expecting Starbucks to post revenue of $23.1 billion, which represents a growth of 8.2% from $21.3 billion. The revenue growth is expected to be driven by the addition of 1,880 new restaurants, and positive SSSG. Next, we’ll discuss Starbucks’s SSSG.

PART 1 OF 8 Starbucks’s Share Prices Boosted by Strong Fiscal 4Q16 Earnings By Ralph Nathan | Nov 7, 2016 4:27 pm EST 4Q16 performance \nSeattle-based coffeehouse giant Starbucks ( SBUX ) announced its fiscal 4Q16 results after the market closed on November 3, 2016. The company posted adjusted EPS (earnings per share) of $0.56 on revenue of $5.71 billion. Market response \nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to post EPS of $0.55 on $5.68 billion. The better-than-expected earnings and revenue increased investors’ confidence, leading to a rise in Starbucks’s share price. As of November 4, 2016, the company was trading at $52.80, which represents a growth of 1.9% from the previous day’s closing price. Year-to-date performance \nAlthough the share price moved up after the fiscal 4Q16 earnings release, year-to-date, Starbucks’s share price is still down by 9.5%. The revamping of Starbucks’s loyalty program to a spending-based structure from its earlier frequency-based structure during fiscal 3Q16 led to lower-than-expected 3Q16 same-store sales growth. This low growth made investors skeptical about Starbucks’s future earnings, leading to a fall in its share price. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, peers Dunkin’ Brands ( DNKN ), Domino’s Pizza ( DPZ ), and McDonald’s ( MCD ) have returned 14.3%, 52.7%, and -5.6%, respectively. \nThe iShares US Consumer Services ETF ( IYC ) has returned -0.8%. IWP has invested ~11.7% in restaurant and travel companies. Series overview \nIn this series, we’ll take a look at Starbucks’s fiscal 4Q16 earnings call and notes. We’ll also look at the company’s performance on key metrics during the quarter. We’ll cover management’s guidance and analysts’ estimates for fiscal 2017. Let’s start by discussing Starbucks’s revenue in fiscal 4Q16.

      "title": "Starbucks Verismo V Review",
      "text": "Starbucks Verismo V is the Pod Coffee System for Starbucks Die-hards (Review) By Tiffani Buteau · On November 7, 2016 \nThe Starbucks Verismo V is the perfect home barista system for die-hard Starbucks fans. It makes both espresso and brewed coffee in a jiff, and can even froth milk for cappuccinos and lattes. The pods are a bit on the expensive side, but if you are looking to quit an expensive in-store Starbucks latte habit, it will save you money in the long run, while still giving you that familiar Starbucks taste. What’s In the Box? \nThe Versimo V System includes the brewer, a milk frother, and 12 coffee pods. The brewer is fairly intuitive to use, with a very minimal learning curve. It is petite and fits easily on the counter top, not taking up a ton of space at 11″ tall x 7.6″ wide x 12.9″ deep. Its overall design aesthetic is attractive and classy in the kitchen. \nThe real star in our opinion is the milk frother. Typically, even with high-end coffee systems, you end up having a spraying steaming nozzle of terror to deal with to froth your milk, and more often than not, you just end up with watery milk. The Verismo frother is just plain magic. Pour in milk to the indicated line, and within a couple minutes, you have smooth, peaking foam that would send the most skilled of baristas into a tizzy, all without the nozzle of terror. To make a latte, foam the milk first, pour that into a cup, and then put the cup under the brewer and make a shot. It’s so good you won’t want to go to Starbucks anymore. What Can You Make With It? \nWith the Versimo V you can make one-ounce espresso shots, a 10-ounce cup of brewed coffee, a six-ounce Americano, or a six-ounce caffe latte, and more. Starbucks sells latte kits so you can have your favorite flavor of latte each day. You can also make chai lattes with a chai pod. Milk can be incorporated either by using the frother or by using a milk pod. They offer white chocolate or mocha sets, too. It is so versatile you can make almost any drink you could get at Starbucks, barring a few obvious exceptions, like frappuccinos. I even used the frother to make a matcha latte. You can peruse the pod selection here . The Verismo V comes with beverage recipe sheets that will make your mouth water. There is a sheet each for hot beverages, cold beverages, and sweet treats. My favorite was Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The most intriguing was the Dark Chocolate and Espresso Truffles recipe. Upkeep Costs \nAs we all know, Starbucks doesn’t come cheap. The Verismo V system on its own is not terribly expensive at $179. However, the pods are where the real expense comes in. Each box of pods, be it brewed coffee or espresso, comes in at $11.95 for 12. So that means each cup of joe is about a $1, or $2 if you like double shots. Factor in milk and sugar, and your morning 2-shot latte is probably just about under half the price of paying for it in store. Factor in time and barista snark saved, and you have yourself a deal. It is not as cheap as other pod systems, but that is because it is Starbucks. There are ways to trim costs. For example, they offer subscription discounts of 5 percent. Buy in a bulk amount of 96 pods and that takes the cost down to $0.83 a cup or shot. The pods are not reusable. \nUpkeep is pretty average. You need to rinse before and after each use. Every three months you need to descale your machine, particularly if you have hard water. This is recommended to be done by purchasing a specific descaling cleaner for the system. The frother only needs a simple rinse after each use, and it is back in operation. Add-Ons \nAlong with the Verismo V system we got a beautiful collection of glasses by Bodum. Normally, I wouldn’t think to get special glasses for my lattes, but wow do I love these glasses. They are impossibly light, made from glass, but you’d never know that by how they feel in your hand. Best of all, these glasses have an air gap between the liquid container and your hand (double-walled), effectively creating an artful display of your drink. Lattes of all kinds look beautiful in it. The smallest glass, for espresso, turns that little shot of energy into a beautiful layered edible art to look at. They are must-haves. Read on for the verdict… ",

      "text": "Starbucks' New Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew is a Festive Option By: Katherine Pendrill   news.starbucks & qsrmagazine To celebrate the start of the holiday season, Starbucks has debuted a new holiday drink called the Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. However, unlike the other beverages in the holiday lineup, the new drink is served cold for a \"a cool twist on the traditional holiday spice.\" The new Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew drink is a festive beverage that combines the chain's refreshing cold brew with the same festive holiday spices found in many baked goods this time of year. The drink itself consists of cold brew coffee that has been slow-steeped for 20 hours and spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and anise. The drink is then finished with a serving of house-made sweet cream for a deliciously indulgent treat. The new drink not only capitalizes on the success of the brand's Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Nitro Cold Brew this past summer, but it also help to diversify Starbucks' holiday drink menu.",

      "text": "Schultz “A Bit Anxious” About Election (SBUX) By Dan Moskowitz | November 7, 2016 — 12:27 PM EST \nHoward Schultz, chief executive officer of Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ), is a lifelong Democrat. Other than one contribution to John McCain in the late 1990s, Schultz has only donated to Democrats. He also endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. The difference between now and the past is that Schultz is now much more vocal about the opposition. \nSchultz wrote a letter to his employees, which was obtained by CNNMoney yesterday. In that letter, Schultz wrote that he as \"a bit anxious\" about the election. He also wrote: “Let's each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other.” \nIf reading between the lines, that statement seems to indicate that Schultz is steadfast anti-Donald Trump and a supporter of Hillary Clinton by default. Schultz has instructed his employees to treat all customers with kindness, compassion, empathy, and love. \nStarbucks recently launched green Unity cups, which are limited-time only and feature a collage of characters designed to represent unity. “The green cup and the design represent the connections Starbucks has as a community with its partners and customers. During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other, Schultz said” \nThere has been some backlash related to the Unity cups because customers are saying it has nothing to do with the holidays. According to Schultz, these cups weren’t intended to relate to the holidays. \nCoincidentally (or not), Starbucks just announced that it will be offering a limited-time deal of Buy 1 Get 1 Free holiday drinks, which will be served in red holiday cups. Eligible drinks include: Chestnut Praline Latte Peppermint Mocha and Skinny Peppermint Mocha Caramel Brulée Latte",

Photo: Andrew De La Rue ╳ exit \nFast food chains McDonald's, Hungry Jacks, KFC and Starbucks and banking giant CBA will be forced out of their prime, high-trading Swanston Street stores to make way for the government's $10.9 billion Melbourne Metro Rail project. \nThe business behemoths will join a growing exodus of key retailers abandoning the city's main shopping core, Swanston Street, ahead of years of disruption expected from work on the project's centrepiece tunnel and two city stations. \nMetro authorities are negotiating the compulsory acquisition of four Swanston Street properties between Young & Jackson's Hotel on Flinders Street and the Nicholas Building on the corner of Flinders Lane. \nAll four buildings – along with the Port Phillip Arcade behind – will be razed to make way for the rail project's CBD South station. \nPlans for the new city tunnel have already seen a number of retailers take flight, looking for other locations nearby to set up shop. \nMen's clothing store Tarocash, shoe retailer Foot Locker and Brunetti's Cafe are in negotiations, or have announced, new trading locations. \nStarbucks is being forced to move from a site at the base of Westin Hotel at the rear of City Square due to looming construction that will see City Square overtaken as a staging base for much of the tunnel project. \nThe nine-kilometre twin tunnel will have five underground stations – Domain, CBD South, CBD North, Parkville and Arden – expected to take half a decade to complete before they become operational in 2026. \nMcDonald's owns the three-storey building at 9-11 Swanston Street and will be hard pressed to find a store in an equally prominent location to replace what has been a jewel in its trading crown. \nMcDonald's confirmed it was approached by the Metro Rail authorities and were \"working through the process\", a spokeswoman said. \"We are keen to maintain a presence it the area,\" she said. \nHungry Jacks is believed close to sealing a deal to replace one of the two trading locations it will lose on Swanston Street, but would not comment. \nAs well as being required to move from a two-level building at 15-19 Swanston, it is also being forced to vacate its store at the northern end of the strip on the corner of La Trobe Street, which will be demolished to make way for CBD North station. \nColliers International retail director Cam Taranto said the rail project was pushing retailers to open shops in other high-traffic locations such as Elizabeth and Bourke streets. \nAnother agent, Jarrod Herscu, said other retailers were taking advantage of the perceived disruption to secure better, long-term deals. Rozzi's Italian Canteen recently leased an entire building at 157 Swanston at below market rates, Mr Herscu said. \nMetro Rail confirmed it was in discussions with building owners. \nThe compulsory acquisition process was likely to be triggered early next year once planning approvals were received, a spokesman said. \nSome CBD roads – including sections of Franklin and A'Beckett streets – will be permanently closed once tunnel work is underway.

      "text": "Despite the contentious nature of the election, Starbucks sbux CEO Howard Schultz wants to spread the love.\nSchultz is urging his employees to embrace “respect and dignity” during this “epic, unseemly election,” as well as encouraging them to share “kindness, compassion, empathy, and love,” according to a letter he wrote on Sunday .\nAlthough the Starbucks exec did endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in October , he didn’t suggest employees should vote for a particular candidate come Tuesday, according to the letter.\n“Let’s each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other,” Schultz wrote.\nHe continued: “Like the drawing of so many faces with a single, unbroken line on this season’s green unity cup , we are all connected.”\nSchultz has notoriously been more vocal about social and political issues than other top execs. In the past, he’s shown support for marriage equality and has called for open discussions about race at Starbucks stores. The coffee-chain also found itself in the center of a national debate on guns a few years earlier, in 2013.",

      "text": "Aol.com Editors Nov 7th 2016 5:47PM \nStarbucks is out to make the world a better, more inclusive and peaceful place, one latte at a time. \nWith the company's release of green holiday cups (instead of their iconic and seasonally-awaited red cups), CEO Howard Schultz has been actively making strides (or at least attempting to) towards making the world that much jollier of a place. \nSEE ALSO: Starbucks just signaled a terrifying sign for the economy \nAnd though a Pumpkin Spice Latte won't exactly make liberals and conservatives hold hands and skip down the street together, especially in this election cycle, Schultz is hopeful that another crucial aspect of the Starbucks empire might just be able to enact the change that the world needs these days. \nHe's not talking about anything you can consume or buy – In fact, Schultz is placing the responsibility in the hands of the baristas themselves. \nIn fact, Schultz thinks that his workers might just be the \"true promise of America.\" \nBold statement. \nHe recently drafted a letter to his employees, explaining to them each just how important he believes they are during these difficult times: \n\"Many Americans have allowed the vitriolic nature of the presidential campaign to ignite our differences and strip away our civility and dignity. In the process, we've lost faith in what we all know has always been true, the promise of America. But you are the true promise of America.\" \nSchultz, who at this point in the letter might as well announce that he's about to become a global ambassador for peace, continues: \n\"Let's each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other.\" \nAnd in case you were wondering about the intention behind those new green cups: \n\"Like the drawing of so many faces with a single, unbroken line on this season's green unity cup, we are all connected.\" \nDeep. \nSo whether your hope is to \"Make America Great Again\" or you're \"With Her\" (the candidate that Schultz himself has very openly supported), just know that the Starbucks baristas are here to make things right again. \nRELATED: Starbucks holiday cups through the years 5 PHOTOS Starbucks holiday cups through the years See Gallery Starbucks holiday cups through the years 2015 ",

      "text": "starbucks Share this article \nIt is half-past “I need a Latte” o’clock and there is already a crisis brewing in Starbucks. \nThe two girls ahead of me in line—which snakes around the entire shop— are studying their drinks with knitted brows and pursed lips. It’s not that their names are spelled wrong or that their vanilla lattes are missing a pump of syrup. \nIt’s November 1st and the cups are not red. \nThey neglect to sip from the foamy lip and instead, cradle the cup; swiveling the foreign object around in their hands and searching for answers. I can see that its green, but I can’t make out the design until I hear, “Salted Caramel Mocha for Kelly” and I am greeted with a cup full of unfamiliar faces scribbled together with spindly black ink. Must be the holiday cups, I thought. I don’t know who these people are but this drink is damn good. \nWhile the faces on your beverage seem like they’re staring through your soul at first sip, they are serving a purpose. \nOnce the black cat costumes are packed away and Michael Buble emerges from his cave, Starbucks releases their holiday cups. Traditionally, there is only one design and they are red. This year, however, as the campaign season comes to an end, the company wanted to release a political message that costumers could sip on and take with them to the polls. \nThe coffee kingdom unveiled the “green cup” designed with community faces drawn in one continuous line to show that we are all connected, no matter how polarizing or divisive the political stage can be. \nUnfortunately, the message was steamier than a flat white. \nMany took to twitter to voice their opinions, claiming the design was “political brain-washing” and it made their holiday beverages “less festive.” \nThe green cups didn’t make everyone see red. \nTaking the campus’s temperature on the issue proved that the message was a non-issue for students. For most, the message didn’t leave a bad taste in their mouths. \n“I think the concept of the single line is really cool,” said Macie Kramer ’17. “It honestly doesn’t matter—red or green—as long as the coffee inside the cup is the same.” \nMaria Langenhorst ’17 agrees with the symbolic message. \n“I think the message they’re sending is a very positive one and uniting people shouldn’t be seen as forcing politics on people, she said. “I can see how people would be put off by the timing, but the overall point is something I think everyone should be supportive of.” \nIf you’re not a fan of the green cups or an ounce more of political symbolism—take a deep breath—the red cups will be back post political shenanigans. \nIn the meantime, just enjoy the damn mocha and worry about the Venti problems. \nHCXO,",

      "text": "The controversy whirling around Starbucks’ new green cup has officially gone from gale force wind to cyclone. On Monday an innocent joke made on the internet set the fundamentalist Islamic world on fire. \nMohammed is actually on the Starbucks green cup. You just have to find him. Just like Waldo. \nNo one is sure where the quip originated. What is known is that countless variations of it have evolved, and politicians are trying to cash in on the mania. Starbucks is trying to sell you Mohammed cups, folks. You know that green is the color of Islam? Starbucks is selling you Sharia in a venti-sized cup. – Donald Trump We are stronger together. The Second Commandment is sacred to Islam and Christianity. As a signal of good will, my administration will airlift green cups to Syrians who will still be trapped in Aleppo when I become President. – Hillary Clinton \nWhat is known for certain is that many of the alt-right are joining hands with their existential enemies, radical Islamists, to burn effigies of the Starbucks green cup. Groups of Christians and Muslims are uniting together to create giant sized paper models of the hated green cup to burn to the ground. \nSome of the non-radically minded religious are happy with this turn of events. \nI’m just glad they’re not persecuting me. – every single Jew in America \nThe Obama administration is urging citizens to calm down and relax. He only has a few more months to be President and doesn’t want to be remembered as the Commander-in-Chief who had to proclaim martial law due to a pandemic of American stupid. \nAnti-cuppists refuse to be mollified by reason. Radical Islamic imams have gone without sleep for days searching for Mohammed on the Starbucks cup. None have been successful. However, that does not deter the faithful. “I believe in belief. Allah willing, he will show me the Prophet on the accursed cup, and we can go full-jihad on pumpkin spice,” stated an anonymous imam.",

      "text": "Kenn White/Twitter \nDog owners, rejoice. Your furry friend can enjoy Starbucks just as much as you do. Actually, they might enjoy it more. \nIn case you were unaware, Starbucks has a special treat for dogs that isn’t advertised. It goes by several names like the pup cup and puppuccino, but it’s really just an espresso cup with whipped cream… and it’s changing puppers’ lives everywhere. For example, 4 1/2-month-old German shepherd Leopold lost his mind when he discovered it. Luckily his owner Ken White decided to share Leo’s experience with the internet. 2",

      "text": "Next Starbucks \"unity\" cup \nIf you’ve enjoyed a beverage from the Seattle-based coffee chain this season, you’ve surely noticed something different: The new green cup . \nThe design features “more than a hundred people drawn in one continuous stroke,” meant to be a “symbol of unity,” according to Starbucks. \nThis isn’t the only curveball Starbucks has thrown its adoring fans. Every year since 1997, a fresh cup design has debuted to herald the beginning of the holiday season. This year, there’s already talk of another holiday-themed cup coming soon. \nHere’s a look at the Starbucks cups through the years, from 2005 to present. Credit: Starbucks 2005 \nBack in 2005, the Starbucks holiday cups were decorated with a white pattern resembling Christmas lights and the almost-too-factually-correct line, “It only happens once a year.” Credit: Radu Sigheti/Reuters 2006 \nUnder the festive sleeve, the 2006 Starbucks holiday cup was decked out with silhouettes of ice skaters and last-minute shoppers. Credit: Lookinthetunk/Flickr 2007 \nThis cup won praise as one of the most aesthetically pleasing designs from Starbucks. Illustrations of skiers and polka-dot snowflakes were complemented by the blue sleeve, exemplifying the theme “Pass the Cheer.” Credit: Jueno/Flickr 2008 \nThis 2008 seasonal cup borrowed from the previous year’s theme with snowflakes and white decor. The iconic Starbucks logo served as an ornament on the cup. Credit: Starbucks 2009 \nUnlike previous years, where the design theme was dominated by pictures, the 2009 Starbucks holiday cup was plastered with different festive phrases, like “I wish every day was a holiday.” Credit: Starbucks 2010 \nThat year’s cup marked the arrival of caroling characters. Each design had a different statement, including, “Stories are gifts.” Credit: Starbucks \nThis festive cup featured even larger carolers in 2011. Credit: Starbucks 2012 \nThe evolution of the cup characters continued (and ended) in 2012. This snowman design featured even bolder shapes and colors. Credit: Starbucks 2013 \nWith the introduction of the 2013 holiday cup, the characters were omitted in favor of a more subtle design: red- and gold-trimmed ornaments and snowflakes. Credit: Starbucks 2014 \nThe following year’s cup continued the theme of a cleaner, yet eye-catching, look. The red cups used designs that hinted at a Christmas tree, holiday decorations and snowflakes. Credit: Starbucks 2015 \nIn 2015, Starbucks went with a sleek, red design that seemed harmless. But instead of signaling that the holiday season was upon us, the cup drew major criticism. Credit: Starbucks 2015 cup controversy \nCritics of the 2015 cup believed it was part of a “ war on Christmas ” because of the omission of any Christmas-themed illustrations. \nDuring a campaign rally in 2015, Donald Trump weighed in on the controversy, saying, “Maybe we should boycott Starbucks. I don’t know.” \nSome celebrities seized on the opportunity for humor. Weird Al Yankovic put his red cup in a sleeve emblazoned “Hail Satan” and tweeted a photo with the caption: “Okay, Starbucks, NOW you’ve gone too far.” Credit: Twitter/@AlYankovic 2016 cup controversy \nAlthough the green cup was intended to symbolize unity, it also has become a divisive subject. Some critics believed Starbucks was continuing a perceived anti-Christmas sentiment, while others insist the cup is a political message. \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz said, “During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other.” \nAlso, per Starbucks, “The rest of our holiday plans are still under wraps,” and the new “unity” cups shouldn’t be considered “holiday cups.” Credit: Starbucks",

      "text": "Echo Park: Starbucks & Chipotle Want In (SBUX, CMG) By Dan Moskowitz | November 8, 2016 — 11:32 AM EST \nWhether or not Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. ( CMG ) knows what it’s doing can be debated, but it would be difficult to argue the consistent success that Starbucks Corp ( SBUX ) has delivered through the years. If you read the company’s SEC filings, you will find that Starbucks has repeatedly stated that it focuses heavily on location. In fact, chief executive officer, Howard Schultz, looks at performance numbers for every Starbucks location in the world every morning. This might sound impossible, but he says he knows what metrics to look for, which allows him to breeze through the list. \nWhen it comes to geographic diversification for Starbucks, the game plan is simple. If a location is faltering, close it. If an area is thriving, open a Starbucks. Obviously, Starbucks can’t open a location in every thriving area, but it has consistently picked top-tier locations. Enter: Echo Park, which is currently experiencing gentrification . When you combine that with 43,000 people in area of just 2.4 square miles, a retailer has a massive opportunity. It’s likely that every single person in Echo Park will pass by a retailer located in Echo Park at some point. This is why Chipotle and Starbucks will be a part of a new restaurant complex called Mohawk Collective. Both Chipotle and Starbucks are expected to open in the new restaurant complex next spring. The Continental Development Group is redeveloping the strip after acquiring it, which has led to long-time retailers like Wells Tile & Antiques and Eric’s Architectural Salvage being pushed out after 25 years of residence, and new \"hip\" retailers and restaurants like Starbucks and Chipotle setting up shop. \nIf you live in or near Echo Park, then this information has a direct impact. If you don’t live in or near Echo Park, then pay attention to the bigger picture – savvy geographic selection by both Chipotle and Starbucks. That is often a sign of quality management. \nCMG has depreciated 39.20% over the past 12 months. \nSBUX has depreciated 14% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.51%.

      "title": "How much a cup of Starbucks coffee costs in 8 cities around the world",
      "text": "Have you wondered why your bank account is suddenly empty? Are you spending every pay check in order to get your morning necessity or mid-afternoon pick me up?\nDepending on how strong your caffeine addiction might be, daily visits to Starbucks might be the end to your bank account. If you’re a Starbucks junkie and looking to travel the world, then you should make your plans accordingly.\nThe thought of spending more money than before on coffee may cause you to cringe. However, desperation for a warm latte or cold brew iced coffee has individuals willing to still pay exorbitant prices.\nThe quality and taste of Starbucks remains the same no matter what state, area, or region. But the amount of money you hand the cashier varies by country. In order to save money while traveling, I decided to compare the highest priced Starbucks coffees in America to seven other countries with the most expensive Starbucks drinks outside the US. \nReuters/Jacky Naegelen \n1. New York, USA The most expensive cup of coffee in America is in located in New York . Here, a tall, hot, steamy cappuccino and latte is $3.15. If you find yourself as basic as me, then you may indulge in a seasonal pumpkin spice latte or peppermint mocha, which will skyrocket the price to over 5 dollars.\n2. Berlin, Germany Berlin, Germany has the highest price for a cup of coffee in the world. If you think you're spending outrageous prices in the United States, then you will be in  tears to find that a cappuccino costs a whopping $6.06  in Berlin. However, how can you complain when you have the chance to drink coffee alongside the stunning mountains lakes and rolling green hills?\n3. Copenhagen, Denmark You may need to withdraw extra money if you're planning to travel to Copenhagen, Denmark. In second for the most expensive coffee, their rich foamy cappuccino and latte costs $5.84 . With drinks different than the US, Denmark has seasonal honey and almond hot chocolate and banana caramel s’more Frappuccino.  \n4. Oslo, Norway Although there are Norwegian coffee shops on almost every corner, you may stick to what's familiar: Starbucks. However, a price of $4.97 for a tall cappuccino and $5.33 for a latte is minor when considering the beautiful views and welcoming coffeehouse environment. In attempts to bring joy to customers during the day, Norwegian Starbucks' have added an \"evening menu,\" which entails alcoholic beverages, mac n' cheese , and delicious flat breads.\n5. Helsinki, Finland In Finland, you might be asking yourself, why would anyone pay $4.80 for a cappuccino and $5.25 for a latte? The real question is why would anyone waste money on a less expensive, flavorless coffee? As espresso lovers know, life is too short for a bad cup of coffee, and Starbucks' even in Finland never disappoint. When the line at Starbucks gets too long, check out these classy cafés in Helsinki that are totally worth the experience.\n6. Brussels, Belgium The guilt of spending $4.75 for a cappuccino or latte will end the minute you taste your iced or steamed drink from Belgium. Unfortunately the price can truly add up, considering true coffee lovers are not a stranger to multiple cups a day.\n7. Stockholm, Sweden Refusing to go a day without coffee may have you paying $4.54  for either a cappuccino or latte. However, these are not the only items you can order since Starbucks' in Sweden just introduced their seasonal  banana yogurt and chocolate chip cream Frappuccino.   \n8. Paris, France Drinking coffee near the Notre Dame or the  Eiffel Tower may just be the icing on the cake for your trip. In these picturesque parts of France, a tall cappuccino or latte would cost you $4.41 . But how can you really put a price on a trip that may be once in a lifetime?\nWith 24,000 stores in 70 countries , Starbucks has been surveyed to find that their three most popular items — the cappuccino, the latte, and the Americano — continue to vary in price depending on the country. If you're strapped for cash and spending money on coffee is your biggest vice, there's no need to freak out. \nIf you spent your entire bank account on coffee in five months like me, then picking a travel destination based on their average Starbucks price may be one of the smartest decision you’ve made.\nNOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies \n",

New York, USA The most expensive cup of coffee in America is in located in New York . Here, a tall, hot, steamy cappuccino and latte is $3.15.

Stockholm, Sweden Refusing to go a day without coffee may have you paying $4.54 for either a cappuccino or latte. However, these are not the only items you can order since Starbucks' in Sweden just introduced their seasonal banana yogurt and chocolate chip cream Frappuccino.\n8. Paris, France Drinking coffee near the Notre Dame or the Eiffel Tower may just be the icing on the cake for your trip. In these picturesque parts of France, a tall cappuccino or latte would cost you $4.41 . But how can you really put a price on a trip that may be once in a lifetime?\nWith 24,000 stores in 70 countries , Starbucks has been surveyed to find that their three most popular items — the cappuccino, the latte, and the Americano — continue to vary in price depending on the country. If you're strapped for cash and spending money on coffee is your biggest vice, there's no need to freak out.\nIf you spent your entire bank account on coffee in five months like me, then picking a travel destination based on their average Starbucks price may be one of the smartest decision you’ve made.\nRead the original article on Spoon University .

Alphabet \nA Google drone might deliver your Chipotle burrito , but it looks like it won't deliver your Starbuck's coffee. \nThe Project Wing drone delivery program , now a part of Google's parent company, Alphabet, has scrapped a Starbucks partnership as part of a cost-cutting move, Bloomberg reported Tuesday . The budget cuts also mean a hiring freeze and an attempt to shift employees to other projects, according to the report. \nGoogle didn't immediately comment on the report. But a representative for Alphabet's X \"moonshot\" group indicated the company still believes in the technology: \" Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world. What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" \nE-commerce titan Amazon remains a vocal advocate of drones to deliver products. With faster delivery, e-commerce will expand from an occasional activity to a frequently used way to get whatever you need whenever you need it.",

      "text": "Alphabet's drone service reportedly nixes Starbucks delivery deal So much for that idea. Save Associated Press \nIt looks like Alphabet is walking back its Project Wing drone delivery initiative. Some employees are being told to seek other jobs within the company formerly known as Google , and the outfit even killed a partnership with Starbucks, according to Bloomberg . Wait, Starbucks? Apparently, there were talks of using the drones to deliver coffee, much in the way that Chipotle was going to fly burritos to Virginia Tech students. Google provides WiFi at some of the coffee chain's locations. \"Those plans were nixed largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted,\" according to Bloomberg 's sources. Sounds like classic Alphabet. \nIt follows some belt-tightening around Mountain View, with the search juggernaut \"pausing\" the rollout of its Fiber internet service, and a few key departures from the mysterious X Lab. The company announced it was making marginal strides to not losing money recently, so more moves like this shouldn't come as a surprise.",

      "text": "11/08/16 AT 6:01 PM Close \nIf you were dreaming of having your next grande no-whip soy latte delivered by drone, you can forget about it. Project Wing’s wings were clipped by Google parent Alphabet as it tightens budgets across the board, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, quoting people familiar with the decision. \nBloomberg said the decision to end the proposed venture with Starbucks followed the departure of project leader Dave Vos, who has not been replaced. Hiring also was frozen, and some people were urged to seek employment elsewhere in the company, Bloomberg reported. \nThe Alphabet decision comes as other companies are ramping up drone programs despite a lack of Federal Aviation Administration approval for deliveries outside test zones. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos said recently tests currently underway in the United Kingdom show his company’s drones can fly 50 mph, navigate and land by themselves, and have a 20-mile range when delivering packages of 5 pounds or less. \nThe White House in August backed development of unmanned aerial vehicle delivery. Alphabet announced an agreement with Chipotle Mexican Grill to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech in September. Google had wanted to deliver healthcare items by drone, including medication and defibrillators, but those plans were scrapped. Related Stories New Drone Flying Rules Take Effect \nBloomberg said the Starbucks deal had been in advanced talks but failed amid disagreements about access to customer data. Talks also reportedly were underway in Ireland to provide suburban grocery delivery. \nAlphabet cut back its Project Wing and ended talks with Starbucks on drone delivery amid disagreements over access to customer data. The drone pictured here is carrying a UPS package on Children's Island off the coast of Beverly, Massachusetts, Sept. 22, 2016. Photo: Brian Snyder/Reuters \nA major obstacle to implementation of drone delivery programs in the United States are FAA rules that prohibit companies from making deliveries outside the line of sight of operators. The FAA said it has received 854 waiver applications for drones weighing no more than 55 pounds. Of those, 71 waiver requests had been rejected and 36 approved, Law360 reported . \nAnother obstacle is the lack of sense-and-avoid technology needed to keep the UAVs from flying into, buildings and other obstacles, as well as each other. Echodyne, a Bellvue, Washington, startup announced a new cellphone-sized radar system it says is capable of detecting small aircraft 1.8 miles away no matter the weather conditions.

      "text": "November 8, 2016, 4:56 PM Google drones slow and Project Wing ends its Starbucks partnership By Bloomberg News Tighter budgets at Alphabet affect the drone unit, and project leader David Vos left in October. \n(Bloomberg)—The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc. \nProject Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., No. 443 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. \nThe decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. \n\"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" a spokeswoman for X wrote in an email. \"What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" \nIn August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. \nRobotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. \nAlphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. \nA Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. \nSimilarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service , a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. \nThe status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. \nCourse correction \nProject Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said. \nProject Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission—data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. \nThen Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X . Vos did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on Tuesday. \nTeller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and \"really dramatically, magically, change the world.\" \nHowever, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received \"90-day notices,\" which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision. \nLast November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a \"commercial business up in running in 2017.\" It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. \n\"You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery,\" said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. \"Nobody knows how long it's going to take.\" Topics",

      "text": "Alphabet taps brakes on drone project, nixing Starbucks partnership Mark Bergen, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nThe latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet. \nProject Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks, according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. \nThe decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. \n\"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" \nIn August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. \nRobotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. \nAlphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. \nA Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. \nSimilarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. \nThe status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. \nProject Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said. \nProject Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. \nThen Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. \nTeller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and \"really dramatically, magically, change the world.\" \nHowever, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received \"90-day notices,\" which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision. \nLast November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a \"commercial business up in running in 2017.\" It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. \n\"You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery,\" said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. \"Nobody knows how long it's going to take.\"",

      "text": "share Alphabet Inc. Alphabet Inc.’s Project Wing, the drone delivery team that began as part of the Google X “moonshot” factory, has canceled a tentative partnership with Starbucks, according to Bloomberg . Members of Project Wing and Starbucks apparently clashed over the handling of consumer data, Bloomberg reports, straining the partnership and ultimately pushing both companies out of an air-delivered coffee venture. The deal would have marked Project Wing’s second high-profile food and beverage delivery pilot program, after a deal with Chipotle was finalized back in September . That partnership culminated in burrito deliveries by drone to a small number of students and faculty at Virginia Tech, though the minds behind the project have said the burrito drones were simply a beta test for bigger things. Losing the Starbucks deal is just one of many hurdles Project Wing faces More telling for the fate of Project Wing is the direction of the division now that former project head Dave Vos left Alphabet in October . Bloomberg reports that the company froze hiring at Wing following Vos’ departure and began telling some employees in the division to relocate to other projects in and around Google. So the disintegration of the Starbucks deal is just one of the setbacks in the division’s larger struggle to grow from a kind of innovation lab into a full-fledged business. Alphabet’s X division had no comment on the news, but did offer a statement to Bloomberg saying that it is “developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" The report is just the latest to underscore some of the tensions playing out across Alphabet’s many sprawling interest areas. Since the massive restructuring in August of 2015 that created Alphabet and separated out Google from the corporation’s more costly and forward-looking endeavor, Alphabet has applied pressure to its various units outside of Google and Android to cut costs and headcount while turning a focus toward profitability. Smart home appliance maker Nest, another Alphabet subsidiary, lost its CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell back in June. Access, the new division created to oversee Google Fiber, said last month it would replace division chief Craig Barrat and pause fiber deployment in new cities . And instead of focusing solely on fiber internet, Access is now looking into wireless gigabit internet to circumvent the high costs of fiber. Nest, Google Fiber, and Project Wing and have all suffered executive shake-ups It appears Wing is facing similar scrutiny. The Federal Aviation Administration granted Wing a commercial testing exemption in August , as part of a White House initiative to kickstart drone development. However, as the Starbucks deal sours, it looks like drone delivery is proving challenging on multiple fronts, from the logistics of working under FAA regulations to the management and leadership hurdles involved with operating an Alphabet subsidiary no longer protected by Google. For what it’s worth, Alphabet remains confident that, with enough time, it can work out the kinks and expand beyond food and drink into truly transformative sectors like emergency medicine delivery. “I don’t want to minimize the challenges for the Wing project. We need to make things that can successful move long distances completely autonomously with very high levels of safety and reasonably inexpensively. That is not a solved problem,” Astro Teller, the X chief who now oversees Project Wing personally, told The Verge in an interview published earlier today. “There are a lot of as yet unsolved problems.” Update 6:35PM ET 11/8: Clarified that Alphabet’s X had no comment to share with regards to Project Wing’s Starbucks deal or the hiring freeze.",

      "text": "print \nReuters/Jacky Naegelen \nHave you wondered why your bank account is suddenly empty? Are you spending every pay check in order to get your morning necessity or mid-afternoon pick me up? \nDepending on how strong your caffeine addiction might be, daily visits to Starbucks might be the end to your bank account. If you’re a Starbucks junkie and looking to travel the world, then you should make your plans accordingly. \nThe thought of spending more money than before on coffee may cause you to cringe. However, desperation for a warm latte or cold brew iced coffee has individuals willing to still pay exorbitant prices. \nThe quality and taste of Starbucks remains the same no matter what state, area, or region. But the amount of money you hand the cashier varies by country. In order to save money while traveling, I decided to compare the highest priced Starbucks coffees in America to seven other countries with the most expensive Starbucks drinks outside the US. \nGetty Images 1. New York, USA \nThe most expensive cup of coffee in America is in located in New York . Here, a tall, hot, steamy cappuccino and latte is $3.15. If you find yourself as basic as me, then you may indulge in a seasonal pumpkin spice latte or peppermint mocha, which will skyrocket the price to over 5 dollars. 2. Berlin, Germany \nBerlin, Germany has the highest price for a cup of coffee in the world. If you think you're spending outrageous prices in the United States, then you will be in tears to find that a cappuccino costs a whopping $6.06 in Berlin. However, how can you complain when you have the chance to drink coffee alongside the stunning mountains lakes and rolling green hills? 3. Copenhagen, Denmark \nYou may need to withdraw extra money if you're planning to travel to Copenhagen, Denmark. In second for the most expensive coffee, their rich foamy cappuccino and latte costs $5.84 . With drinks different than the US, Denmark has seasonal honey and almond hot chocolate and banana caramel s’more Frappuccino. 4. Oslo, Norway \nAlthough there are Norwegian coffee shops on almost every corner, you may stick to what's familiar: Starbucks. However, a price of $4.97 for a tall cappuccino and $5.33 for a latte is minor when considering the beautiful views and welcoming coffeehouse environment. In attempts to bring joy to customers during the day, Norwegian Starbucks' have added an \"evening menu,\" which entails alcoholic beverages, mac n' cheese , and delicious flat breads. 5. Helsinki, Finland \nIn Finland, you might be asking yourself, why would anyone pay $4.80 for a cappuccino and $5.25 for a latte? The real question is why would anyone waste money on a less expensive, flavorless coffee? As espresso lovers know, life is too short for a bad cup of coffee, and Starbucks' even in Finland never disappoint. When the line at Starbucks gets too long, check out these classy cafés in Helsinki that are totally worth the experience. 6. Brussels, Belgium \nThe guilt of spending $4.75 for a cappuccino or latte will end the minute you taste your iced or steamed drink from Belgium. Unfortunately the price can truly add up, considering true coffee lovers are not a stranger to multiple cups a day. 7. Stockholm, Sweden \nRefusing to go a day without coffee may have you paying $4.54 for either a cappuccino or latte. However, these are not the only items you can order since Starbucks' in Sweden just introduced their seasonal banana yogurt and chocolate chip cream Frappuccino. 8. Paris, France \nDrinking coffee near the Notre Dame or the Eiffel Tower may just be the icing on the cake for your trip. In these picturesque parts of France, a tall cappuccino or latte would cost you $4.41 . But how can you really put a price on a trip that may be once in a lifetime? \nWith 24,000 stores in 70 countries , Starbucks has been surveyed to find that their three most popular items — the cappuccino, the latte, and the Americano — continue to vary in price depending on the country. If you're strapped for cash and spending money on coffee is your biggest vice, there's no need to freak out. \nIf you spent your entire bank account on coffee in five months like me, then picking a travel destination based on their average Starbucks price may be one of the smartest decision you’ve made.

      "text": "Alphabet wants Project Wing to enable product delivery by aerial drone.\nAlphabet A Google drone might deliver your Chipotle burrito , but it looks like it won't deliver your Starbucks coffee.\nThe Project Wing drone delivery program , now a part of Google parent company Alphabet, has scrapped a Starbucks partnership as part of a cost-cutting move, Bloomberg reported Tuesday . The budget cuts also mean a hiring freeze and an attempt to shift employees to other projects, according to the report.\nThe company still believes in the technology. \" Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" the X group said in a statement. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems. While there's still a lot of work to be done, we believe that opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods is a moonshot worth pursuing.\"\nAnd Astro Teller, interim leader for Project Wing, said in a September blog post that X projects like Project Wing necessarily change course as they develop, with progress looking \"much more like a sailboat tacking than a sprinter racing in a straight line.\"\nE-commerce titan Amazon remains a vocal advocate of drones to deliver products. With faster delivery, e-commerce will expand from an occasional activity to a frequently used way to get whatever you need whenever you need it.\nFirst published November 8, 1:57 p.m. PT.\nUpdate, 4:22 p.m.: Adds comment from Alphabet's X group.",

Or does it only work for one transaction? Spoofee (Spoofee.com!) - 3 months ago Make sure you are using Visa Checkout.

      "text": " Alphabet’s drone division drops deal to air-deliver Starbucks The Verge 1 hr ago Nick Statt © Provided by The Verge Alphabet Inc.’s Project Wing, the drone delivery team that began as part of the Google X “moonshot” factory, has canceled a tentative partnership with Starbucks, according to Bloomberg . Members of Project Wing and Starbucks apparently clashed over the handling of consumer data, Bloomberg reports, straining the partnership and ultimately pushing both companies out of an air-delivered coffee venture.\nThe deal would have marked Project Wing’s second high-profile food and beverage delivery pilot program, after a deal with Chipotle was finalized back in September. That partnership culminated in burrito deliveries by drone to a small number of students and faculty at Virginia Tech, though the minds behind the project have said the burrito drones were simply a beta test for bigger things.\nMore telling for the fate of Project Wing is the direction of the division now that former project head Dave Vos left Alphabet in October. Bloomberg reports that the company froze hiring at Wing following Vos’ departure and began telling some employees in the division to relocate to other projects in and around Google. So the disintegration of the Starbucks deal is just one of the setbacks in the division’s larger struggle to grow from a kind of innovation lab into a full-fledged business.\nLosing the Starbucks deal is just one of many hurdles Project Wing faces\nAlphabet’s X division has not yet responded to our requests for comment, but did offer a statement to Bloomberg saying that it is “developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\"\nThe report is just the latest to underscore some of the tensions playing out across Alphabet’s many sprawling interest areas. Since the massive restructuring in August of 2015 that created Alphabet and separated out Google from the corporation’s more costly and forward-looking endeavor, Alphabet has applied pressure to its various units outside of Google and Android to cut costs and headcount while turning a focus toward profitability.\nSmart home appliance maker Nest, another Alphabet subsidiary, lost its CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell back in June. Access, the new division created to oversee Google Fiber, said last month it would replace division chief Craig Barrat and pause fiber deployment in new cities. And instead of focusing solely on fiber internet, Access is now looking into wireless gigabit internet to circumvent the high costs of fiber.\nIt appears Wing is facing similar scrutiny. The Federal Aviation Administration granted Wing a commercial testing exemption in August, as part of a White House initiative to kickstart drone development. However, as the Starbucks deal sours, it looks like drone delivery is proving challenging on multiple fronts, from the logistics of working under FAA regulations to the management and leadership hurdles involved with operating an Alphabet subsidiary no longer protected by Google.\nFor what it’s worth, Alphabet remains confident that, with enough time, it can work out the kinks and expand beyond food and drink into truly transformative sectors like emergency medicine delivery. “I don’t want to minimize the challenges for the Wing project. We need to make things that can successful move long distances completely autonomously with very high levels of safety and reasonably inexpensively. That is not a solved problem,” Astro Teller, the X chief who now oversees Project Wing personally, told The Verge in an interview published earlier today. “There are a lot of as yet unsolved problems.”\n-Source: Bloomberg Go to MSN Home",

      "text": "Some days I seriously wonder how humanity got this far in the world. I call those my cranky days, and yes, the past week has been full of them as people unload socially on the new Starbucks “Unity” cups. \nLet’s look at the cup in question: Friends, baristas, and customers drawn in one continuous line—reminding us we're all connected. 💚 pic.twitter.com/qspqJc8KWB \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 1, 2016 \nOkay, so that’s a nice message, and the design is pretty neat. Plus I really like green. \nHowever, others feel VERY DIFFERENTLY about these cups. Let’s take a look at some tweets: I really don't like the new green holiday cups at Starbucks… #TeamRedCup \n— Princess (@Hayley_Elaine34) November 2, 2016 \nFine … nothing really wrong with preferring last year’s design (though she might be in the minority, based on the hullabaloo from 2015 over the red cups ). It's November 1st & you know what that means. Time for the annual War on Christmas, Thanksgiving & green & red Starbucks cups #HappyHolidays pic.twitter.com/NClE2SbQvE \n— James Wood (@JimEWood) November 1, 2016 \nI’m half-hoping he’s being sarcastic … \nThe following tweet was deleted, but not before CBS News included it in its article about the uproar over the new cups: @Starbucks i need answers. this new green cup is extremely ugly & gives me anxiety. are these the official holiday cups or just the pre cup? pic.twitter.com/wxvqZ4CjWD \n— me (@ash_guid) November 2, 2016 \nSeriously? These cups are giving you anxiety? Try scaling a wall of looming deadlines while planning a business trip to Lisbon (more on that below). @Starbucks Screw you. My coffee should NOT (and does NOT) come with political brainwashing. I dropped @Starbucks like a hot rock. \n— #HillarySatan (@RadioAnna) November 1, 2016 \nUmmm … political? Say what? \nBut everyone can chill out, because on Nov. 4, Starbucks announced the red holiday cups would return on Nov. 10, and better yet: \n… Customers who buy one holiday beverage and can get another one free* to share at participating Starbucks stores in the U.S. and Canada November 10-14 from 2-5 p.m. \nThere? Happy yet? \nLook, here’s the deal: The 2015 freakouts over the red cups and now the outrage over the green “unity” cups from Starbucks is a reminder that humans are fickle, when they don’t like something many of them will voice their distaste, and social media helps magnify this 1,000-fold.",

      "text": "Alphabet halts drone project, ends Starbucks plan By MARK BERGEN   15 minutes ago •   The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks, according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. \"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. Project Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said.",

      "text": "The future can be a scary realm for your mind to drift into. Will Samsung blow more pants apart with their next phone? What will a Trump presidency actually entail? When do the robots takeover, and should we just let them? These are all questions which are currently plaguing humanity. And we have some bad news — you won't even have coffee effortlessly slung to your door in order to cope with all these hypothetical worries. That's after Alphabet – the parent company of Google – announced that it will be severing a partnership it holds with Starbucks for its Project Wing drone delivery program. Bloomberg indicates the inexplicable move is actually to save some cash, and will also mean a freeze on staff hires and a shift in projects for many current employees. This doesn't mean the handy tech is being scrapped completely, there'll just be no on-demand coffee. \"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" a spokesperson for Google's X research lab said in a statement. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems. While there's still a lot of work to be done, we believe that opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods is a moonshot worth pursuing.\" That's all great, Google — really, it is — but we just want a festive gingerbread latte on call.

But there's an extra bonus this year. Not only will you get that oh-so-Instagrammable cup, you can also get a buy one, get one free holiday drink from Nov. 10-14. \nQualifying drinks include Chestnut Praline Latte, Peppermint Mocha and Skinny Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Brulée Latte, Gingerbread Latte, Eggnog Latte, Teavana Joy Brewed Tea, and Spiced Sweet Cream Nariño 70 Cold Brew. \nAnd look, if you want to get the BOGO deal and pretend that one's for a friend but then drink both yourself and spend all day buzzing with caffeine and sugar? Well, we wouldn't judge. \nAllison Carter is Facebook editor at IndyStar and has never had any of these drinks. Follow her on Twitter @AllisonLCarter .  //indy.st/2ff42nx TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Shares of Starbucks ( SBUX ) have been on a downward slope since late 2015. Can Starbucks ever get back its premium valuation?\nIn the past I have been bullish on shares of Starbucks . I thought Starbucks' success hadn't been reflected in its share price, but it seems investors really don't want to give the stock a premium valuation.\nLast Thursday, Starbucks reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results . The company said it earned 56 cents per share, one cent better than the consensus estimate. Revenue rose 16.2% to $5.71 billion, vs. the $5.69 billion estimate.\nJim Cramer, TheStreet's founder and manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , wrote to Action Alerts PLUS subscribers on Friday that Starbucks had \"much-better-than-feared results.\" Still, Cramer and Research Director Jack Mohr downgraded the stock's rating, even though they like the company. They said that \"the trend of 'staying at home' has clearly trickled down and hit even the best of the bunch, Starbucks.\"\nStarbucks is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells SBUX ? Learn more now .\nU.S. comparable-store sales rose 4%, comprised of a 6% increase in the average ticket and a 1% decrease in traffic.\nManagement cut guidance for fiscal 2017. The company said it sees earnings between $2.12 and $2.14 and revenue growth in the double digits. Revenue guidance was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 8% revenue growth. Management is planning to add approximately 2,100 net new stores globally. Over 70% of its new stores will be located outside the U.S., especially in China, Russia and India. It wants to double the number of stores in China from the current 2,400 to over 5,000 by 2021.",

      "text": "One of the reasons Starbucks has been so successful is the speed at which it gets a hot cup of coffee into your hand. As well as ensuring you don't wait in line very long, there's also the Starbucks app to speed up payments, and even the ability to order ahead so your coffee is waiting when you arrive.\nHowever, Starbucks wants to go further and remove you from the coffee delivery equation completely. How do you achieve that? With drones .\nUsing drones means you could order a coffee using the Starbucks app and then simply wait for it to be delivered. Starbucks would use your GPS location to map the route, and as long as you are within range of a coffee drone base station, the hot or cold beverage would arrive from the sky a few minutes later.\n\nOn paper, it's a great idea for lazy consumers, and one that I'm sure more than a few of us would pay a little extra to take advantage of. But in order for such a system to work, Starbucks requires a hardware partner to provide the drones. That partner was going to be Google parent Alphabet's X research lab, but the deal has fallen through, according to Bloomberg .\nAlphabet is thought to be scaling back its X research lab operations in a bid to save money and refocus on projects that show the most promise in terms of profitability.",

      "text": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images \nStarbucks' CEO Howard Schultz sent a solemn note to Starbucks' 120,000-plus US employees on Wednesday morning, following Donald Trump's presidential election win. \nThe CEO encouraged the chain's workers to move \"onward together.\"\nSchultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics, known for his support of progressive causes. In September, he  endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. \n\"I think it's obvious that Hillary Clinton needs to be the next president,\" Schultz said in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow in September. \"On the other side, we've seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country.\" \nOn Sunday, Schultz wrote a letter to employees (who Starbucks refers to as partners) criticizing the  \"epic, unseemly\" election, and asking them to share in compassion and empathy.  \nHere's the note in its entirety:\nDear partners,\n Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned.\n We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\n As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\n Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.\nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism.\nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans.\nI am so very proud to be your partner.\nOnward,\nHoward\nNOW WATCH: We did a blind taste test of Pizza Hut, Domino's, and Papa John's pizza — here's the verdict \n",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz 'stunned' by Trump's election (SBUX)",
      "text": "print \nSpencer Platt/Getty Images \nStarbucks' CEO Howard Schultz sent a solemn note to Starbucks' 120,000-plus US employees on Wednesday morning, following Donald Trump's presidential election win. \n\"Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans — both Democrats and Republicans — I am stunned,\" the note begins. \nThe CEO goes on to encourage the chain's workers to move \"onward together.\" \nSchultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics, known for his support of progressive causes. In September, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. \n\"I think it's obvious that Hillary Clinton needs to be the next president,\" Schultz said in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow in September. \"On the other side, we've seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country.\" \nOn Sunday, Schultz wrote a letter to employees (who Starbucks refers to as partners) criticizing the \"epic, unseemly\" election, and asking them to share in compassion and empathy. \nHere's Wednesday's post-election note in its entirety: Dear partners, Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. We can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. Today, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. I am so very proud to be your partner. Onward,",

      "text": "friends Share this article \nIt’s just my luck that I reach Starbucks at its busiest hour. As I stand in line behind the dozens or so fellow students of mine, I can’t help but notice how transfixed they are on their phones. No one is chatting or exchanging ideas with one another. They’re all just focused on their phones. It’s not a wholly new concept; since the invention of smart phones, social media and endless apps, we’ve all become more isolated from one another. \nYou may be thinking, “I have 1,000 friends on Facebook, I’m not isolated!” But seriously, how many of those people do you know? How many do you speak to on a daily basis; not just through instant messaging or text, but actually sit down and talk with them? I’m guessing that number is low. So why then, is everyone so interested in how many followers you have? If you can’t possibly know every single one of them, why should it matter? \nI don’t think it should matter at all. \nMy follower count doesn’t tell you who I am as a person. It doesn’t tell you what I’ve been through. It may show that 20 people liked my artsy photo of my frappuccino, but what does that really mean? \nThe way we portray ourselves on social media is not always the same person we are in real life. We like to put the best version of ourselves forward on the Internet so people can catch the happiest parts of us. We don’t share our experiences in depth or what we’re really thinking. Besides, we’re told nowadays to be careful not to share too much – you never know whose looking. \nAnd that’s exactly why you shouldn’t judge me by my follower count – the \"me\" attracting all of those followers is not the complete me. At the same time, the person without so many followers isn’t necessarily all alone. Our social media life does not define who we truly are. \nInstead of judging me for who you see on social media, take the time to get to know the real me. Talk to me to learn more about my hobbies; each one shapes me differently. The lyrics I tweet aren’t just empty words to me; they mean so much more. The photos I choose not to share are the ones that matter the most. But you’d never know any of this just looking on the surface. \nThere is so much more to me than my follower count. All you need to do is look up from your phone long enough to find out. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Getty Images Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. \nStarbucks CEO and Hillary Clinton supporter Howard Schultz was \"stunned\" by Donald Trump 's election to the White House, he said in a memo. \nIn a memo released to employees, Schultz called for Americans to \"honor the democratic process.\" \nDear Partners, Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. We can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. Today, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. I am so very proud to be your partner. Onward, Howard \nEarlier this year, Schultz endorsed Clinton , saying it was obvious that she had the ideal \"life experience\" and \"professional experience.\" His coffee chain has faced challenges this election season, and Trump has suggested that supporters boycott the brand after it released a green cup representing unity .",

      "text": "CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nWhen Howard Schultz endorsed Hillary Clinton for president back in September, he told CNN, \"I think it's obvious Hillary Clinton needs to be the next president.\" Upon seeing the final election results , the Starbucks CEO--like many Americans across the political spectrum--was shocked. \nBut in a letter on Wednesday to employees (or \"partners,\" as the company calls them), Schultz expressed his acceptance of President-elect Donald Trump and adopted the optimistic view necessary for the leader of a public company with more than 170,000 U.S. employees. Starbucks's stock is down 9 percent for the year, and Schultz is likely hoping that any customer backlash due to his vocal opposition of Trump will dissipate as Election Day grows more distant. Here's the full text of his note to employees: \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans - both Democrats and Republicans - I am stunned. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Share story JOSEPH PISANI The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) The Associated Press \nBy JOSEPH PISANI, AP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
