      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) – A federal judge is ordering pilots for a cargo airline that delivers Amazon packages to go back to work.\nThe judge in Cincinnati said Wednesday that holiday shoppers expect to receive their packages on time, so it’s in the public’s interest to end the strike.\nAbout 250 pilots for ABX Air went on strike early Tuesday in a dispute over working conditions and time off. Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.\nThe airline went to court to block the strike, saying it would cause irreparable damage to the company, its customers and consumers.\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

As they part ways for the day, they hug and the imam leaves. The two friends then do the same thing, log on to Amazon to shop. \nDays later, each of the men receive the iconic Amazon box with the smile on the end. They find out that they each bought the other the same gift - knee braces. \nAfter the gift, both men are able to kneel in prayer without the pains of age. \nWatch the entire advertisement below : \nThe ad, which some take as a refutation of the past election year, is being called exactly what was needed after the hate and rhetoric spewed during the presidential campaign. \n",

      "title": "James May on The Grand Tour, the BBC, and Amazon",
      "text": "The Great Motoring Show Countdown of 2016 is finally over. After a year of anticipation, the ex– Top Gear trio of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May premiered their new Amazon series, The Grand Tour , last Friday to stellar reviews. For fans of the old Gear, seeing them fool around and drive supercars again is surely a delight — as is the influx of Amazon's money . (The first episode’s sprawling opening sequence in California’s Mojave Desert was estimated to cost in the low millions.) On a recent afternoon, Vulture sat down with May at the Classic Car Club Manhattan to discuss reinvention, where he’d like to film next, and why everybody should chill out about the BBC.\nHow did you three decide that Amazon would be the best home for the new show?\nThis isn’t my forte, but we liked the new platform and we liked the streaming thing. Amazon was prepared to do it in such a way that they would give us a healthy budget, but they would also let us produce the show as our own entity. We formed a production company [W. Chump and Sons] to do it. So we had a budget, freedom to do it ourselves, and then we had to make a car show. Can’t do much else, and it’s best that they leave it to us.\nDid you field other offers? I’m sure there was a massive amount of interest.\nWe had a sort of gentleman’s agreement that whoever we decided to choose, we wouldn’t reveal what the others were. But they were massive, massive organizations! Brilliant!\nWhat are the key differences between Amazon and the BBC? Do you have more creative freedom now?\nIt’s not really more “creative freedom,” to be honest. The BBC gave us almost complete freedom; they rarely interfered unless we really stepped over the line. They didn’t tell us what to do. There were a few basic house rules, but there are few rules at Amazon as well. You can’t go completely mad and we wouldn’t want to. We wouldn’t want to do anything like incite riots or offend minority citizens or make distasteful jokes. We won’t do anything nasty. We don’t swear and cuss a lot, because we police ourselves. We’re still doing what we’ve always done. Behind the scenes is a bit more complicated, because we actually have to run the whole business right down to buying paper for the printer and paper clips. But obviously the three of us aren’t doing that. We’d be really bad at it. [ Laughs .]\nJeff Bezos has said that the show is “ very, very, very expensive,” and the sharp production quality attests to that. How were the traveling-tent studio and cinematic segments fleshed out?\nThe cinematic element is that it’s in 4K, which makes all the difference, and also makes it a lot more difficult to do. You need more kits and people and there’s a huge amount of data, which has to be shipped back and makes the edit take longer. But the quality of the films are amazing mainly because we took with us quite a lot of the sound cameramen that we used to work with in the old days on Top Gear. Over the years, we’ve been honed in with probably the best team in the world for filming cars and recording the sound of cars. It’s mainly down to them. A bit of it is 4K, but that in itself is just the tool. The tool doesn't do the job. It’s the craftsperson who does the job, and we have the best picture and sound-craft people in the business.\nAnd the tent! The tent originally stemmed from some slightly mad idea that Jeremy had. We liked the idea that we would be a “homeless car show” rather than going to the same studio every week. And then we got this idea that we were a bit like Victorian explorers, and all of the very difficult fun they had mapping out the world back in the day. So once that idea took hold, we ran with it. But it turns out to be much more complicated than you imagine — because, of course, you need a big tent. Plus you need a hospitality tent, a support tent, a guest tent, and a technical tent for all of that 4K outside-broadcast type stuff. All the tents! By the time you finish, you’ve actually built a portable studio. It takes about a week to take apart, it’s unbelievable. It’s worth it, but it’s very complicated and I’m afraid to say an easily expensive operation.\nA worthy expense, I’d say.\nI’d think so, yes. We’re probably over budget, but we don’t look at that. We don’t spend it on clothes.\nYou couldn’t take trademarked BBC names, such as the Stig. Did the BBC impede your production in any way that you didn’t expect?\nWe couldn’t obviously take the name Top Gear. We couldn’t have the Stig, the Cool Wall, Star in the Reasonably Priced Car, we couldn’t use our old track. But we didn’t want to use any of those things. Even if we’d been able to, we would’ve still said, \"No, we’ve done this thing before, let’s think differently.\" A lot of the stories of the BBC saying I can’t use some of my catchphrases is all nonsense. They haven’t tried to bully us in any way whatsoever. It’s all gentlemanly. It’s quite simple, really. The Stig belongs to the BBC, so we can’t have it, no more than I can have the boots you’re wearing.\nI don’t have any quarrel with the BBC. I still work for them; I’m just making a short series for them. They’re perfectly magnanimous about it. They got to invent their show, we reinvented ours. The rivalry is very healthy. I hope we’ll get to the point where instead of having one really great, big car show, there'll be two.\nYou have 36 episodes planned for The Grand Tour . Are there any cities where you’re particularly keen to pitch the tent?\nWe haven’t decided the next 24 locations yet. I’d quite like to film in Central Park. I think we have asked, but we’re not allowed to. We’d like to put it in Hyde Park in London as well, but it’s either not allowed or too complicated or too expensive. Other places I’d quite like to go to are South America. Mexico too. We’ve done a lot of deserts, like in the first episode obviously, so it would be nice if we went somewhere very snowy. Asia and the Middle East would be great. We can even possibly do one in Australia or New Zealand, but we’d have to plan that really well.\nYou have to film in Central Park! We’ll get Bill de Blasio on the phone.\nYou make a good point. The other thing that’s more complicated than we thought, which is pretty interesting, is that you want to have a nice view out of the window. Sometimes it’s just very naturally beautiful like the desert, but sometimes, like we did one in Rotterdam, it’s the European cityscape. You’ve also got to think about the time of year, which direction the tent is facing, what the sun is going to do as it comes straight through that big window, or else you can’t film anything.\nLet’s talk about that opening sequence in the Mojave Desert.\nVery expensive! [ Laughs .]\nI was going to say, lots of reports on the cost.\nThe price is going up with every report, but yes, it was very expensive.\nWhat was it like filming that? Did you get it all in one take?\nIt’s one of those fun television storytelling things that you do for real, and then you go back and film other bits like the wheels of cars or clouds of dust to piece the story together. So it’s more than one take, but in terms of how we drove through the convey of Mad Max cars, we did that in one go. And we got it right! But when you’re actually in the car, you can’t see a bloody thing. It’s terrifying. You have to make your way through the throngs of cars, and sometimes you get as close as inches away before you actually see anything. I’m conflicted because I like being in deserts. I find them sort of cleansing, but there’s another part of me that hates dust. And I particularly hate dust in cars, so it’s a huge conflict going on there.\nCalling the venue Burning Van was pretty amusing.\n[ Laughs. ] That was one of those things where someone in the office said, \"Ho ho ho, we can call it Burning Van.\" And the next thing we knew, we’d actually arranged a burning caravan to be there. That probably cost a bit of money as well. Spending our pocket money.\nThe Grand Tour has been in development for more than a year. Is it a relief to finally have the series out there?\nIt is. We tried to tell ourselves that we were relaxed. We knew we had a certain amount that the fan base would be able to get the show on Amazon Prime. We knew we’d be doing something fairly familiar. So there would have to be a pretty massive shift in the public perception of us and the tastes of our audience for it to be a complete failure. So I thought, logically, it must work. But it was still fantastic as the first episode starting streaming and we looked on the Twitter feed and saw all of these nice things coming through. I pressed the Twitter icon and I thought, shall I? But it was all good.\nHave you ever thought about your television legacy? Or your greatest moments?\n[ Pauses. ] That’s an interesting question. Maybe from Top Gear it would be taking the Bugatti Veyron to its top speed, because that’s something that isn’t impossible for much longer. But amongst stuff I’ve done, there were things like a flight in the U-2 spy plane with the U.S. Air Force [in \"James May at the Edge of Space\"]. I was able to look at the curvature in the Earth and look down at California and the sea at over 70,000 feet. I’d be quite happy if that was the only thing people have ever seen of me. I’m amazed it’s lasted as long as it has. I feel like I may have gotten quite old, and a little bit of me thinks that I’m too old to do this type of thing. But I’m very grateful that I’m still allowed to do it. I got into it just thinking, Oh, television, maybe I’ll have a go at that. I could’ve never imagined that it would get to this.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

      "text": "While so many major US retailers have been kind enough to share , preview and detail their full Black Friday deal collections well in advance of the year’s biggest shopping days, Amazon kept almost everything a secret until its discount avalanche began earlier today.\nHopefully, you saved a couple of hundreds of dollars in the bank after stocking up on VR gear and home entertainment products, because that Sony Xperia XZ goes perfectly with a $200 black leather Huawei Watch. Or a $149 Samsung Gear Fit 2, marked down from $180.\nFor an extremely limited time, you can also buy some stylish Withings smart trackers on the cheap, including a $70 Activité Pop and $90 Activité Steel. Or you can settle for an arguably uglier Withings Go, available at just $40 after a massive $40 rebate.\nBut if it’s a low-cost wearable from an early market leader you prefer, there are Fitbits on sale setting you back as little as $69 (the Flex 2), and as “much” as $150 (Blaze). $99 gets you the Fitbit Alta (previously $130), while the Charge 2 goes for $129 instead of $150.\nLast but not least, check out the $40 Garmin Vivofit, $70 Vivosmart HR, and $99 and up Vivomove, sold at $10 to $80 discounts. ‘Tis the season to procure ultra-affordable wearable gear!\nThe post Amazon offers great savings on select Fitbit, Garmin, Withings and Samsung wearables appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "While so many major US retailers have been kind enough to share , preview and detail their full Black Friday deal collections well in advance of the year’s biggest shopping days, Amazon kept almost everything a secret until its discount avalanche began earlier today.\nHopefully, you saved a couple of hundreds of dollars in the bank after stocking up on VR gear and home entertainment products, because that Sony Xperia XZ goes perfectly with a $200 black leather Huawei Watch. Or a $149 Samsung Gear Fit 2, marked down from $180.\nFor an extremely limited time, you can also buy some stylish Withings smart trackers on the cheap, including a $70 Activité Pop and $90 Activité Steel. Or you can settle for an arguably uglier Withings Go, available at just $40 after a massive $40 rebate.\nBut if it’s a low-cost wearable from an early market leader you prefer, there are Fitbits on sale setting you back as little as $69 (the Flex 2), and as “much” as $150 (Blaze). $99 gets you the Fitbit Alta (previously $130), while the Charge 2 goes for $129 instead of $150.\nLast but not least, check out the $40 Garmin Vivofit, $70 Vivosmart HR, and $99 and up Vivomove, sold at $10 to $80 discounts. ‘Tis the season to procure ultra-affordable wearable gear!\nThe post Amazon offers great savings on select Fitbit, Garmin, Withings and Samsung wearables appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "title": "Trump ‘Make America Great Again’ ornament on Amazon gets ALL the reviews, the best!",
      "text": "The hat that identified a movement is now a Christmas tree ornament. (Amazon screenshot) Here’s a Christmas tree topper for ya — a small, red, baseball hat ornament that reads “Make America Great Again.” For half the population in the United States, what better way to celebrate the presidential election of Donald Trump. And for the other half, what better way to test their comedy chops than in the reviews for the item on Amazon.\nThe ornament is made of brass and finished in 14-karat gold, according to its product description, which also says it is “sure to make any tree stand out.” It’s currently unavailable on Amazon, but over on the Trump website , you can grab one for $149. Spokesperson Hope Hicks told the New York Daily News that the ornaments are made in the USA.\nOn Amazon, there are currently 1,346 customer reviews (and climbing) on Trump’s tiny lid, with 91 percent of users rating it 1 star. Just 6 percent of the reviews are 5 stars. Jeff Bezos better be ready to be tweeted at again.\nHere’s a sampling of the customer feedback:\n“It tried to put my nativity figures into an internment camp. Would not buy again.” — Emily “It called Mary a nasty woman, told Joseph to go back where he came from, built a wall around the manger, and then when you press it it sings “I’m Dreaming Of A Totally White Christmas.” — Swell Gal Mary “Despite ordering a more reasonable ornament, this one arrived. It. Is. Yuge. It’s absolutely yuge. It’s the biggest ornament. Yuge. “I hung it on my tree, but it is so yuge that it has totally unbalanced my whole tree. No matter where I hang it, the tree leans w y over to the far right.” — Simon Webb “Every autumn my family chooses a new ornament to go onto our holiday tree. This year it was between this ornament and another one that is less flashy, less gaudy, and just overall nicer. During our family meeting we overwhelmingly chose the other ornament but somehow we still ended up with this one. We’re not sure what happened.” — Grrrowler “Many people are saying this is a fantastic ornament, so I bought it without doing any further research.” — Allison “For the first time ever, my three cats won’t go anywhere near my Xmas tree! This ornament made Xmas safe again!” — Megan H. Faust ",

      "text": "The Donald J. Trump campaign surprised \"Make America Great Again\" supporters with a new holiday gift just before Thanksgiving. For $150, you can own a Christmas ornament shaped like the red MAGA hats.\nBut there's another surprise — a priceless one — that just keeps on giving. Amazon users took to the product page , where the ornament was unavailable as of Thursday morning, to leave what we can bet to be fake, but nevertheless hilarious reviews.\nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump's first speech as president-elect is surprisingly tame AF\nOut of 1,501 customer reviews, 90 percent are for one star while 7 percent are five stars. Here's some of the best:\nImage: amazon\nImage: amazon\nImage: amazon\nImage: amazon\nImage: amazon\nThe ornament is unavailable on Amazon, and with those reviews, who knows if it'll ever come back. But for those itching for their hands — no matter how big — on the ornament, it's still up on Trump's campaign website .\nBONUS: These are the most shocking Quote: s to come out of Trump’s 60 Minutes interview",

      "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday ordered pilots for a cargo airline that delivers Amazon packages to go back to work.\nThe judge in Cincinnati said that it was in the public's interest to end the strike because holiday shoppers expect to receive their packages on time.\n\"Imagine Christmas without Amazon!\" U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black wrote in his ruling.\nAbout 250 pilots for ABX Air went on strike early Tuesday in a dispute over working conditions and time off. Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.\nThe airline went to court to end the strike, saying its timing threatened to leave millions of dollars' worth of freight undelivered to homes and stores during the Christmas shopping season.\nABX parent Air Transport Services Group Inc. said pilots would begin returning to work Wednesday night. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike was causing ABX to cancel about 75 flights a day. Besides Amazon, ABX's other major customer is Deutsche Post AG's DHL delivery service.\nAmazon and Google want you to get a digital home assistant for Christmas — even if you didn't ask for one Tracey Lien The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... (Tracey Lien) Analysts said an extended strike would have forced Amazon to put more of its deliveries in the hands of UPS , FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.\nThe strike's impact would be short-lived — a few days, said Satish Jindel, president of logistics adviser SJ Consulting Group. \"I don't think it's going to disrupt e-commerce or Amazon,\" he said.\nEven before the judge's ruling, Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy noted that Amazon and other retailers have contingency plans to deal with disruptions of any sort — from weather to strikes — during the holidays. Amazon has spread its deliveries among a larger number of carriers, from the post office down to small providers, he said.\nAmazon has been trying to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx since those companies delivered millions of packages late during the 2013 holiday season. This year, Amazon leased planes from ABX and another cargo carrier, Atlas Air, and began building its own ground-transport system.\nThe surge in online shopping — which is growing faster than in-store shopping — and promises of free shipping have put additional stress on delivery companies like ABX.\nThe ABX pilots say management violated their contract to keep planes flying. The union says the company is denying vacation time for some pilots and compensatory time off for others just to keep all its planes flying.\n\"We are doing all sorts of emergency shifts because we don't have enough people,\" said Tim Jewell, a union officer who flies Boeing 767 jets for ABX. \"It's taking a tremendous toll on our families.\"\nJewell said pilots will abide by the judge's order and return to work, \"but manning and staffing will continue to be a problem.\"\nABX argued that the union was violating federal law by conducting a strike before checking off the necessary steps that federal law requires before a work stoppage in the airline industry.\nABX President John Starkovich said the company would continue negotiations and arbitration to settle its differences with the union.\nLabor relations at railroads and airlines are governed by a federal law that dates to the 1920s and makes strikes difficult. Most airlines haven't had a strike in many years, although pilots for Spirit Airlines walked off the job in 2010.\nAssociated Press\n UPS International Brotherhood of Teamsters",

      "text": "38 shares \nAmazon launched the Echo and Echo Dot in the UK and Germany earlier this year. And now, for Black Friday, the company is slashing its prices on the devices to the lowest level seen since the launch. \nToday, you can grab an Amazon Echo for just £119.99 (reduced from £149.99). The cheaper Amazon Echo Dot has seen a similarly steep price decrease and you can now get one for just £39.99 (reduced from £49.99). \nIf you’ve been contemplating getting an Amazon Echo, now’s the time to grab one. \nAlthough the Echo and its diminutive brother, the Echo Dot, only launched a few months ago, they already pack a number of helpful UK-specific Alexa skills.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone \nBlack Friday is nearly here and to celebrate, I have rounded up all the best deals from my guides to Amazon, , , And Walmart to present the best of the best. Let’s break them down: \nNote: my thanks to BestBlackFriday.com which has worked with me to collate these deals and create order from the inevitable annual chaos Black Friday 2016 has some fantastic offers and some you should avoid. Image credit: Target via BestBlackFriday \nStar Buys Toshiba 49-inch LED 4K Ultra HDTV w/ Built-in Chromecast (49L621U) for $199.99 (save $250) – Best Buy Phillips 55-inch Class Smart 4K UHDTV for $298 – Walmart – a standard brand at a stunning price \nBlack Friday general TV tip: always remember to check the specific TV model when retailers release them before making a purchase. Even the best manufacturers have weak models in their line-up that you are better off avoiding, so do your research. Any iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus – get up to a $250 Best Buy Gift Card with installment billing agreement with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T – Best Buy – a massive gift card win iPad Pro 9.7″ starting at $449 (save $150.99) – Target - the cheapest iPad Pro deal iPad Air 2 (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - as above Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $198 (save $71.99) – Target – Best best Series 1 deal, $22 less than Best Buy. There are no Series 2 discounts this Black Friday from any retailer Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge + $250 Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR Headset + $50 Oculus Content Pack with activation of the phone – Target & Best Buy – Edit: the Oculus Content Pack was left off the Best Buy listing, but is included by Samsung on all S7/S7 Edge purchases Microsoft 12.3″ Surface Pro 4 Bundle with Signature Type Cover for $599.99 (save $400) – Best Buy - a ‘Doorbuster’ worthy of the name Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle + Xbox Wireless Controller for $299.99 (save $114.99) – Best Buy – the extra controller deal is hidden but comes free with any 1TB bundle making this a winner Xbox One S 500 GB Battlefield 1 Bundle + Gears of War 4 + Extra Controller for $249.99 (save $170) – Dell - not from the retailers listed, but added as it is too good to miss and far above the standard $250 Black Friday deal for one game and a single controller Sony PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 Bundle + Ratchet and Clank and The Last of Us (Remastered) Games for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy - two additional games compared to the standard $250 bundle DJI Phantom 3 Standard Drone for $369 (save $130) – Walmart – a red hot product and $30 cheaper than the next best deal Amazon Tap for $89.99 (save $40) – Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet for $74.99 (save $25) – Amazon – was $84.99 for Black Friday 2015 Walmart Black Friday gaming offers are strong in 2016. Image credit: Walmart via BestBlackFriday \nSolid Deals \nThe best of the Solid Deals. While the offers above are truly superb, these deals are too good to leave behind if you’re interested in any of these products: Apple iPhone SE starting at $9.99/mo. for 24 months, 0% APR for qualified Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T customers – Best Buy LG 40-inch 1080p LED HDTV (40LH5000) for $149.99 (save $130) – Best Buy Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Favorites Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Target HP 15.6″ Laptop w/ AMD A10 Quad Core Processor for $259.99 (save $140) – Target Roku Express Plus for $25 (save $14) – Walmart DJI Phantom 4 White Quadcopter for $999.99 (save $200) – Best Buy FitBit Charge 2 for $129 (save $20) – Walmart - a price you will also found widely elsewhere, but still a solid deal FitBit Alta for $99 (save $30) – Walmart – as above Best Buy iPhone deals are strong, but watch out for some weaker iPad and Apple Watch offers. Image credit: Best Buy via BestBlackFriday \nNote: for specialist camera coverage read Paul Monckton’s Black Friday guides while John Archer is covering TVs . \nTreat With Caution \nAlong with the best of the best comes the worst of the worst. When shopping this Black Friday be very care to avoid these deals, for the following reasons: Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369 – Best Buy (and others) - misleading as this is not a discount, but the standard retail price. Take $105 in Kohl’s Cash if you want to pay $369 for the Series 2 now iPad Pro 9.7″ Tablet (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - Target offers this for $150.99 off, so why pay more? iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (save $70) – Walmart – an old model likely to be discontinued in early 2017. Put the money towards a Star Buy iPad deal instead Otterbox Defender for Samsung and Apple for $25 (save $14.96) – Walmart – regularly on sale throughout the year for under $15 Alcatel POP 4 Plus 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked Cell Phone for $49.99 (save $100) – Best Buy – a mediocre phone with poor storage. Put the money towards a better smartphone offer Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle for $129 (save $50) – Walmart – an old, dead console available pre-owned from GameStop for $50 after rebate. Ignore when a new Xbox One S 500GB bundle costs just $120 more Google Chromecast for $25 (save $10) – can be found cheaper in the off season 32-inch 720p LED TV, $69.99 – Amazon – very cheap, but no brand mentioned (see Black Friday TV tip above and there are simply too many great, premium brand TV offers available this year to risk this Insignia 7-inch Portable DVD Player with Swivel Screen for $39.99 (save $40) – Best Buy – a largely dead product category and not a premium brand RCA 9-in. Portable DVD Player for $53.99 (save $36) – Target – as above, and poor customer rating as well \nFor a full breakdown of Black Friday deals at Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target, Walmart plus eBay, Microsoft and Samsung please find the links below. \nBlack Friday Guides On Forbes ",

      "text": "Yes, it's here everyone! It's Black Friday . \n\nBrits are going to spend more than £2bn this year as they pile into shops to bag up electricals and other Christmas gifts. The retailers are promising bigger cuts than ever, with John Lewis committing to price match its rivals throughout the day as they slash their prices.\n\nAnd if you're not willing, or able, to get your elbows out and hit the high street, lots of retailers have deals online. Here are the best deals on offer from e-commerce giant Amazon (which has had offers on all week):\n\n*Amazon Fire TV Stick, £24.99 - save £10*\n\n*Amazon Echo, Black - £119.99, save £30*\n\n*Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation), Black - £39.99, save £10*\n\n*Sony PlayStation 4 500GB + Uncharted 4 + FIFA 17 - £199.99, save £66.94*\n\n*Le Creuset Cast Iron Provencale Round Casserole, 22 cm - £79.99, save £35*\n\n*Lenovo Ideapad 100S 11.6-Inch HD Laptop (Red) - £99.95, save £50.04*\n\n*Microsoft Surface Pro 4 12.3-Inch Tablet with Keyboard (Black) - £549.99, save £250*\n\n*Xbox One S (500GB) with FIFA + Controller - £229.99, save £45.49*\n\n*SONOS PLAY:1 Smart Wireless Speaker, Black - £139, save £30*\n\nMany of the deals are only available while stocks last, so make sure you move quickly. If you're looking for more wide-ranging offers, our guide has everything you need to know about deals from John Lewis, Apple, AO World, Sky and more. \n\nLots of retailers aren't taking part - Asda have bowed out for the second year in a row, and Marks and Spencer are only offering 30 per cent off dressing. Perhaps a wise decision, given that retailers have had a tough year and need to recoup their margins over the most important shopping season.\n\nBut if you won't have the chance to take full advantage of the nation's biggest shopping spree, don't worry, analysts are saying that the January sales will be bigger. But, the advantage of Black Friday is that retailers have everything in stock - particularly useful for fashion deals, because you'll need to find items in the right size.",

Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.\nThe airline went to court to block the strike, saying it would cause irreparable damage to the company, its customers and consumers.",

      "text": "Donald Trump is the President-elect of the United States, but he’s still a crafty businessman, so it should come as no surprise that the billionaire has a plan to capitalize on your holiday cheer in the form of licensed ornaments.\nOne ornament in particular — modeled after the now iconic, ill-fitting red cap that became a symbol of the Trump movement — has accumulated over 1,200 reviews on Amazon, and they’re some of the best pieces of writing you’re going to find anywhere online.\nMUST SEE: Watch Trump’s Thanksgiving message to the American people right now\nThe reviews, which range in length from a sentence or two to full-fledged stories, are almost entirely tongue-in-cheek, but rather scathing nonetheless. There’s many references to Trump’s alleged mistreatment of women, views on immigrants, and overall abrasive personality:\nView photos\nView photos\nView photos\nMany of the reviews also make reference to the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 Presidential race, but Trump was elected due to his majority of electoral college votes:\nView photos\nView photos\nSome reviewers clearly put some additional thought into their writing, even going so far as to bring President Obama into the mix:\nView photos\nAnd, of course, you don’t have to look far to find a reference to Trump’s freakishly small hands:\nView photos\nIt’s Amazon’s shockingly lax review policy that makes this kind of mass-reviewing possible. The site doesn’t require verification of a product purchase before allowing users to write reviews of virtually anything they want. Verified purchases show up with their own special tag, but hundreds of fake reviews flood a product, you’d be hard pressed to find a confirmed buyer anywhere in the crowd.\nThe company has, in the past, culled obviously fake reviews under similar circumstances, so it’s likely that Trump’s little red hat will see a similar ratings purge at some point in the near future.\nTrending right now:\nAll the best deals you’ll find in Walmart’s big Black Friday 2016 sale, which is now live Amazon’s massive Black Friday 2016 sale is live, and these are the best deals so far Here’s a sneak peek at Apple’s official Black Friday 2016 deals See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

There are a few different styles to choose from, some costing more than others. The Jewel/Pearl model, shown above with a gold finish tiny jewels circling the display, is down to $349.99 on Amazon, B&H, and Walmart. That's a whopping $200 off the original price, by far the lowest it has ever been (the last lowest price was $470). \nIf you're thinking to yourself, \"What's the catch,\" there really isn't one. We gave the watch solid marks in our review , and with it being one of two watches with the Android Wear 2.0 preview , it's safe to say it will receive the finished update. If you think the Gold/Jewel design is too flashy, several other models are heavily discounted as well. \nHuawei Watch - Jewel/Pearl",

      "text": "online Share this article \nYears ago, Amazon began a beautiful holiday tradition called Cyber Monday, where online sales are abundant. The best part about it? You don't even have to change out of your pajamas to shop the best stores, while getting the same deals as you would during Black Friday shopping. This year, however, many of the sales online are happening during \"Black Friday Weekend\" - which is right now! Here's where you need to be doing your holiday online shopping: \n1. JCrew \nThis year J.Crew is running a huge sale - 40% off your ENTIRE purchase. The expensive, professional-meets-preppy store never offers deals that big, but it is happening now through November 27th at 11:59 PM eastern time, so I highly suggest hitting it up. 2. Nordstrom \nSimilar to the Nordstrom annual sale, this Black Friday weekend the department store is doing an additional 20% off already on sale items, which is a big deal since they are transitioning between their fall and winter stocks, so you can get that additional 20% off of some cute fall outfits and get ahead of the game for next year. The sale ends Sunday so don't miss out! \n3. TopShop \nThis year, the trendy boutique is offering up to 50% off merchandise. Considering the usual prices, the deals are pretty big. To shop the selected merchandise, head to TopShop's home page and click shop all on their Black Friday weekend pop up - the sale ends November 28th, so start shopping now! 4. ULTA Beauty \nIf you're looking for anything from small gifts for friends to Secret Santa stocking stuffers, ULTA has got you covered, with tons of sets and products with huge markdowns this weekend. Some notable big ticket items on the list? 20% off Clairsonic Holiday kits - which run up to around $300, and $75 Ultra Chi products, which are usually pried at $149.95. If you need a new flat iron or hair dryer, head to the ULTA website right now! \n5. Amazon \nThe website that started it all, amazon has extended their Cyber Monday deals into a Cyber Monday week ! Shop all the crazy markdowns, from Amazon to independent sellers, all throughout the week. It's already started, so start shopping now! \nI hope these deals help you make the best of your holiday shopping without breaking the bank! Happy hunting! You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "TWEET Can a hat-shaped ornament make Christmas great again? A whole lot of Amazon shoppers don't think so. A Trump-themed Christmas tree ornament in the shape of his campaign's iconic \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap has been garnering hilariously negative reviews. More than 1,600 Amazon users have written one-star reviews of the brass and 14 karat gold ornament, making references to everything from Trump's hateful rhetoric to his catch phrases. The ornament cost $149 , but it's no longer available on Amazon. \n\"Every time I try to hang it on the branch, it yells 'WRONG!'\" Amazon user BSPhD writes in a one-star review. \"No matter which branch I try, it's 'WRONG!' My brother and father can hang it up just fine, but when my mother and I try, it's just 'WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!'\" Check out some of the funniest reviews so far: A review of the Trump ornament ",

      "text": "By KIRO 7 News , | November 28, 2016 @ 5:47 am Last year, customers ordered more than 54 million items worldwide during Cyber Monday. (AP) Tweet \nHundreds of people are working around the clock in DuPont, where workers could ship more than 50,000 packages on Cyber Monday. \nKIRO 7 got a unique look inside one of the busiest retail buildings in the world – the Amazon fulfillment center. \nThe building is the size of 28 football fields, uses robots to help fulfill orders, and has 800 full-time employees. \nLast year, customers ordered more than 54 million items worldwide – that’s 629 items every second. \nAnalysts expect online sales to hit at least $3.3 billion Monday. Amazon’s specials started at midnight. \nThe online retailer will roll out more than 75,000 sales, such as $40 off the Amazon Echo and $250 off a Dell laptop. \nAmazon says so far this holiday season, the most-watched deal has been the mermaid tail blanket. \nCyber Monday is also a good day to find travel deals. Experts say slow summer travel sales should result in big airfare and hotel discounts. \nTrips to the Caribbean and Europe are expected to come cheap. \nBut not everything on Cyber Monday is cheap. \nCyber security experts say be sure to take a good look before trying to score Cyber Monday deals using a smartphone. \nScammers are using fake retail sites and product apps that look just like a valid retailer but may have a letter missing in the name or some other small but telltale indication that it’s a fake. \nAnother issue is thieves scooping up packaged items ordered on Monday. Thieves may have their calendars marked for “package theft Wednesday.” \nNearly half of all holiday purchases are made online and it can take a few days for those items to arrive. \nSo more thieves are targeting the deliveries left at people’s front doors. \nExperts say one possible solution is to have packages delivered straight to your work during business hours.",

      "text": "Tweet \nOne of the benefits of shopping with Amazon is that you are able to read reviews written by other customers before you part with your cash. Now the company has updated its review policy, placing a limit on the number of reviews customers can write in a week. \nThe new limit means that there is now a maximum of five reviews per customer per week, but there is an exception. If Amazon is able to verify that products have been purchased by -- rather than gifted to -- the reviewer, the limit is increased. But it gets a little more complicated. \nStrangely, the upper limit on non-verified purchase reviews does not apply to books, videos and music -- but Amazon has not given a reason why this is. In its updated Community Guidelines , the company says: \"When we find unusually high numbers of reviews for a product posted in a short period of time, we may restrict the number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews on that product\". \nIn a statement to GeekWire , Amazon said: \nWe are introducing a policy change around customer reviews. Customers can now only submit a limited number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews a week. The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00am UTC through Saturday 11:59pm UTC. Customer's ability to submit Amazon Verified Purchase reviews will not be impacted. This policy also does not apply to Vine reviews or reviews on digital and physical books, music, and video. We're always innovating on behalf of our customers and shoppers consistently tell us that they value reviews from other shoppers who they know have purchased the product on Amazon. \nDo you agree with the restrictions, or do you feel they’re unnecessary?",

      "text": "Amazon expands its online gift shop “Interesting Finds,” adds human curation Posted Facetune 2 puts a powerful photo editor in your pocket \nFollowing its debut earlier this year, Amazon quietly launched a revamped and expanded version of Pinterest-like feature called “Interesting Finds,” which is also now available on mobile. Tucked away inside the “More from Amazon” section of its mobile app as well as on the web, the Interesting Finds section offers shoppers a curated feed of products across a number of categories, like items for the home, for men, women, children, or pets, as well as popular sections dedicated to specific products like watches, audio or photo equipment, sneakers, tees, sunglasses, lighting, and more. \nFor years, Amazon has experimented with ways to enable better discovery of products, in order to capture data related to shoppers’ intent with regard to future purchases, in addition to fueling the retailer’s capability to target its customers with personalized recommendations. \nIn 2013, Amazon debuted Amazon Collections , an image-centric site for saving and sharing favorite items that operated much like its own Pinterest clone. \nThen in 2015, it began testing a feature called “Amazon Stream ,” which organized products for men and women into a feed of thumbnail images you could click to save to your own collection of favorite items. That later morphed into “Interesting Finds” earlier this year . The revamp turned the “Save” button into a heart and gave the site a cleaner, more modern look – similar to the curated shopping service Canopy . \nHowever, at the time, Interesting Finds was still fairly limited in terms of its filtering and curation capabilities. There were just four sections: All, Women, Men, and Fun. (You can still see that version on the mobile web here .) That has now changed. \nThe discovery feature online and in the native mobile app now organizes products into an expanded array of categories beyond the initial handful, and it utilizes human curators, too. Several of these new categories go beyond simply rounding up top products in a single genre, like “Watches,” and instead focus on a theme. \nFor example, the “Daily Carry” section includes toteable items like keychains, wallets, backpacks, water bottles, hats, iPhone cases and more. “Mid Century” rounds up furniture, décor, lighting and even books dedicated to this time frame. \nBoth “Little Kids” and “Big Kids” get their own sections that include toys, games, sports equipment, plus educational items like flashcards and books. \nAs you browse through the sections, you can heart the items you like which are then saved to your “My Hearts” collection. \nThe image-heavy site, which is still updated daily, also inserts links to other curated collections as you scroll. For instance, there are cute pots in “Playful Planters;” there’s a Star Wars-themed “Use The Force” collection; gifts for cat lovers are found in “Here Kitty Kitty;” things made of marble or felt can be uncovered in “Marvelous Marble” and “Felted Finds,” respectively, and so on. \nShoppers can also favorite these collections, known as “boutiques,” many of which have been created in-house by Amazon employees (as a simple googling of the curators’ names will tell you.) These saved boutiques are accessible from anytime from your “My Hearts” page. \nAfter you favorite items, Amazon says it will show you “more like them tomorrow,” according to the text description at the top of the “Interesting Finds” section. In other words, the shop is combining Amazon’s algorithmic understanding of users’ interests along with human-driven curation to craft its revamped online store. \nDespite Interesting Finds’ high profile – a banner at the top of Amazon.com’s homepage – the feature is still flying a bit under the radar. \nAnd on mobile, it’s also a bit tucked away: you have to tap the navigation menu, then the “More from Amazon” link, then “Interesting Finds.” \nThe revamped feature itself is still being tested, too, as it pops up asking you if you like the theme or to rate the service. You can respond with emoji like happy faces (“Ooh” or Aah!”) or the less-thrilled “Meh.” \n(It’s unclear how an “ooh” really differs from an “aah,” but hey, it’s Amazon’s system.) \nWhile Amazon’s extensive catalog and fast shipping options have made it an internet retailing behemoth, it’s still not really thought of as a site that’s “fun” to browse, or a source of inspiration. \nThat has left room for others, like Pinterest, to build services that are more focused on the “before” side of shopping – when people are signaling about their tastes and interests, ahead of any possible sale. \nCanopy, too, has worked to fulfill the need for a more curated way to shop Amazon with its easy-to-use site that points to products collections , many of which have now been duplicated at the category level by Amazon’s “Interesting Finds.” \n“Interesting Finds” isn’t the only way Amazon has begun to curate its products. Also in the “More from Amazon” section on mobile is its fashion trends TV show “Style Code Live,” which links to Amazon products, and “Amazon LaunchPad,” its collection of new products, including those from startups and Kickstarter. 0",

      "text": "\nPhoto via Amazon (CC-BY) This belongs under every single Christmas tree. \nIt's been well over a year since The Force Awakens introduced a whole new lineup of sweet merch, and the hottest toy to come out of it all is still Sphero's BB-8 robot . (Sorry, Chewbacca mom.) \nThe app-controlled Droid is the closest thing we have to a real BB-8, and now you can get one for $99.99 , thanks to a sweet Cyber Week deal on Amazon. Sphero's version of BB-8 moves through an app on your phone, but it's much more sophisticated than your average remote-control robot. But to start, he can fly 4.5 mph at a 100-foot range.\nThis toy has an adaptive personality that changes over time as you play. It records and projects holograms, and, just like you, reacts to Star Wars movies with a bunch of excited sounds when they play. \nBB-8 now even has a companion smartwarch. Sphero recently introduced the Star Wars Force band , which controls BB-8 without your phone—like a real Jedi. \nA toy this high-tech normally costs $149.99, but you can get one for $50 off while this deal or supplies last. This is a hot holiday item, so it will likely sell out quickly at this price. ",

      "text": "Bloomberg—Bloomberg via Getty Images Amazon doesn't always offer the best deals. Other retailers offer lower prices. \nAs you begin your holiday shopping this year, you might want to remember that Amazon.com doesn’t always offer the best deals. \nGoogle’s price comparison site showed that other retailers offer lower prices on Amazon’s site for about 60% of the online retailer’s bestsellers, Re/code reported . It’s a timely reminder to shop around, since millions of Americans will do their holiday shopping on Amazon Prime . \nWalmart , for instance, is making a big play to try to undercut Amazon’s prices. The superstore was beating Amazon on 20% of top-selling toys that both retailers were selling, and it matched its price on an additional 35% of products. What’s more, Jet.com—also owned by Walmart—offers better prices on 46% of bestselling toys sold on both sites. \nIf you are in the market for some Amazon products, though, here are some of the site’s best deals for Cyber Monday: Amazon Echo for $139.99 (usually $179.99) Amazon Tap for only $89.99 (usually $129.99) ",

      "text": "LeEco is perhaps best known away from China for its electric cars (and the cash crunch they caused), but it's now making a big US push with its bread-and-butter electronics products . After launching its LeMall.com site earlier this month , it'll let US consumers buy its phones and TVs at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Target, starting on December 1st. To entice buyers, it's offering free trials for AT&T's DirecTV Now streaming service, launching tomorrow.\nIf you buy the Le S3 or Le Pro3 smartphones or 43-inch X43 Pro 4K TV, you'll get three months of DirecTV Now. The more upmarket Super4 X55 or Super4 X65 4K sets will land you a six-month trial, or 12-months with the purchase of a $5,000 85-inch uMax85 TV.\nDirecTV just launched yesterday as a competitor to Sling TV and Playstation Vue at the promotional price of $35 a month, expected to rise to $60. The service won't count against the company's data caps, which is great for AT&T internet subscribers, but sucks for its competitors and net neutrality in general.\nLeEco is a successful e-commerce company in China, and its founder, Jia Yueting, is the country's 30th richest individual. However, LeEco recently spent enormous sums launching its own LeSee electric car and backing two other companies (Faraday Future and Lucid Motors), and Jia recently admitted that the company is running out of cash .\nAs for the products themselves, we found that the company's Le Pro3 smartphone had nice hardware but was hobbled by its heavily skinned UI. There aren't a lot of reviews out there for the 4K TV models, though the company also owns Vizio, a Chinese TV manufacturer well-known in the US. You'll be able to buy LeEco-branded TVs and smartphones at \"over 100 retailers\" starting December 1st or via LeMall.com, which just extended its sales times to 24/7.",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo The home assistant wars are heating up, thanks to the recent launch of Google Home, and a new rumor suggests Amazon has an advanced product in the pipeline. According to Bloomberg , Amazon is readying a new connected smart home assistant that will offer a more premium experience than the current $179 Amazon Echo.\nThe device, which may or may not carry the Echo name, will reportedly feature a 7-inch touchscreen display and access to Amazon Alexa, the company’s voice assistant. It’s also reportedly powered by Amazon’s Fire OS, an operating system that’s based on Android which also runs on the company’s Fire-branded tablets. The display will offer consumers a glimpse at daily information, like calendar alerts and the weather, Bloomberg explained, noting that consumers might also be able to “pin” their favorite digital pictures to the device’s homescreen.\nPlenty of companies have tried to offer these sorts of products — touchscreen displays meant to sit in the family room or kitchen — though none have really caught on. Perhaps it’s the voice assistant technology that’s missing; after all, Amazon has proved that Alexa is valuable. She’s also very capable, able to play music, recite sports scores or control the lights with a quick voice query. A unit placed in a central location of the house could make it easier to quickly begin a favorite podcast, control the lights or restart a music playlist without having to ask.\n“The latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said, ” Bloomberg explained, noting that it will pack better speakers than the Amazon Echo. The product description reminds me of something similar, albeit much smaller, the Alcatel Xess, a 17-inch touchscreen tablet meant to serve as a sort of hub to the home.\nPrice will matter for Amazon’s advanced new Echo tablet Amazon’s rumored new product sounds compelling enough, but the price will be especially important. While the Amazon Echo is still my favorite personal home assistant, the $40 Echo Dot is a better buy for most people. If the new Amazon Echo product is priced much higher than the $179 Echo, will the touchscreen and speakers really be enough to justify the cost? After all, you can plug the Echo into any speaker of your choosing, and the information Bloomberg suggests will be available on the unit’s touchscreen is also always accessible on a smartphone or tablet. The new device will reportedly launch early next year.\n\n\nSource : Bloomberg ",

      "text": "Stephen Root, one of America’s most cherished character actors, is now the title role in a very popular Amazon series. With the second season of The Man in the High Castle just two weeks out, it’s been announced that Root will play the titular Man we’ve all been wondering about, the heretofore faceless figure that’s catalyzed a guerilla resistance against occupying Axis forces in the historical drama. Up until now, the Man has existed only in name, and his primary concern has been collecting film reels that depict alternate versions of reality that exist around events of World War II and its aftermath. We don’t yet know what the Man’s endgame is with the history-bending short films, but we do know that the Japanese and German occupiers both want to get their hands on them. In the clip above we get our first look at a sufficiently disheveled Root as the symbolic center of the uprising, while our heroine, Juliana Crain, looks entirely confused to be in his presence. Poor Juliana. No one tells her anything.",

      "text": "Amazon has best weekend ever for selling its own devices November 30th, 2016 at 9:23 am - Author Jon Martindale \nThe last week has been very kind to Amazon, with its bevy of sales helping it make tens of millions at discounted retail, but it also showed that some of the most popular products were Amazon’s own. Alexa equipped devices were some of the hottest sellers and Amazon managed to sell many, many more Fire TV and Fire tablets than this time last year. \nThe biggest increase in sales year on year for a specific product line, was with Alexa voice devices like the Echo, Tap or Echo Dot. Thanks to the launch of new products in that line up and a big increase in public awareness, Amazon sold as many as seven times more of the connected music players over Cyber Monday. This resulted in millions of devices being shipped out to consumers. \nAmazon’s tablets also did well, with the Fire range shifting more than two times the figure sold last Cyber Monday, while the Kids Edition had its best shopping weekend ever and maintains its number one spot as the most popular child-focused tablet in North America. \nFire TV sticks were a popular choice too, with Amazon shifting more than 2.5 times the same number it sold last year. \nAmazon believes the big reason it sold so many devices was a shift in its pricing. With tablets, TV sticks and Echo products all under $50, it made it possible for more people than ever to get access to them. Amazon has also been aggressively marketing its new Alexa devices, encouraging people to put the listening devices in their home. \nIt released some quite detailed statistics of its users over the Thanksgiving weekend, pointing out that Alexa devices helped many people cook their meal, with people asking three times the questions they did during the week prior. We also know that the most requested playlist during Thanksgiving last Thursday, was the “Thanksgiving with Family,” playlist. \nKitGuru Says: As much as I like the functionality of the Echo and similar devices, I really don’t trust having a cloud-connected, open microphone in my house.",

      "text": "Amazon' smart home speakers Echo 2 may come with a 7-inch touchscreen and more By Harsh Soni Nov 30, 2016 11:49 AM EST Advertisement (Photo : Amazon Echo Official Twitter Account)Amazon Echo 2 may come with a large touchscreen \nAmazon's next Alexa device, Echo 2, is said to be coming with a large seven inch touchscreen display. Advertisement \nA new report from Bloomberg says that Amazon is working on a new Alexa-integrated speaker that will feature 7-inch screen and will run an optimised version of Fire OS. \nThe display of Echo 2 will tilt upwards to let the user easily access information, such as news and weather etc. And it will also let you pin things like photos to the screen. \nVoice interaction will still be a key component of the gadget, so goes the report, and one source said the hub will play a high-quality audio at all volumes. \nAccording to this report, we could see this new Amazon Echo product as Q1 2017. It will also reportedly be the most expensive of the Echo lineup, with Amazon continuing to sell the existing devices alongside. Advertisement \nAmazon, as per The Verge , has also a software update that brought Alexa to newer Fire tablets in late October, although it's not yet clear if interacting with Alexa on this new speaker will work in a similar fashion or not. \nAmazon is releasing this device when the other players are moving into this space like, Google just launched its own smart hub, Home, while Apple is rumoured to be eyeing the space with a Siri-powered device of its own. As you can imagine, this product will likely cost more than the Echo, Tap, and Dot. \nAmazon's Echo has been facing competition from Alphabet's Google Home voice-activated digital-assistant speaker, as it comes under the same target audience. Echo may soon go up against Apple, which is rumored to be building a smart-home device using its Siri digital assistant. \nA new touchscreen device like the Echo 2 could be Amazon's attempt to stay ahead of competition and differentiate itself from the pack. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "“Beauty lay not in the thing, but in what the thing symbolized.”\nvia Amazon In the world of classic literature, many books that we now consider traditional actually broke barriers in their time. Some famous examples include  Jane Austen  works  Emma  and Sense and Sensibility , and sensational works like Wilkie Collins'  The Woman in White . \nBut other classic novels broke barriers in darker, more taboo ways. One such example is  Thomas Hardy's 1892 novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles .\nStructured in seven phases, the novel shocked early audiences with its rebellion against the typical moral behaviors expected of young women at the time. Hardy targets society and its high expectations in this novel. He also addresses the struggle and vulnerability that comes with being a young, impoverished woman.\nThis week we're taking inspiration from one of the most controversial novels of the late 19th century, and one of the most lasting heroines of English literature: Tess of the d'Urbervilles inspires some late fall looks.\nInnocent Girl Products:   Sweater ,  Jeans ,  Highlighter ,  Nails ,  Necklace ,  Boots \nAt the start of the novel, peasant Tess Durbeyfield is at a crossroads in her life. The oldest child of a drunk, she meets the town's most important men, Angel Clare and Alec d'Urberville. This meeting will forever alter the course of her life.\nA palette of pale pink and somber black reflect this novel well, mixing darkness and innocence. Pair a pink and white sweater with black jeans and combat boots for hardy English weather. A music note necklace is a hint to the May Day dance where Tess meets Angel while the gold nail polish reflects Tess's father's higher aspirations. A pale pink highlighter gives off an innocent glow.\nSweet Sorrow Products:   Earrings ,  Satchel ,  Lipstick ,  Tights ,  Sweater Dress ,  Booties \nThis novel has a great deal of sadness and tragedy in it. I've straight up cried both while reading the book and while watching one of its many movie adaptations.\nFor gloomy winter weather - and a look that reflects it - use burgundy accents against a neutral base, like using these tights and this lipstick with this cozy dress and grey booties. A black satchel goes with everything and carries all your essentials, while hoop earrings complete the look with grace and class.\nPure Angel Products:   Tank ,  Pants ,  Blazer ,  Bangle ,  Boots \nAngel is a complicated romantic hero. While he appears virtuous, the son of a Reverend, and is hardworking and charming, he also has high moral expectations that are unrealistic and unfair to Tess. While his and Tess's romance is sweet, it is also tragic.\nFor Angel's look, start with a simple shell - as Angel is a simple man at heart - and a professional blazer. These trousers are perfect for an office environment or for classes all day, and these boots were made for showing off. Finish the look with a simple golden bracelet.\nFinal Thoughts Tess's story will stick with you long after you've read it, and is certainly going to be a classic for years to come.\nWhat did you think? Which look was your favorite for Tess of the D'urbervilles. What other classic novels have you read that pushed boundaries in their day? What book would you like to see fashion inspiration for next?\nLet us know in the comments below! ",

      "text": "Google and Amazon have the two best voice-enabled virtual home assistants in Google Home and Amazon Echo . Both devices were on sale through Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and each of them should be a great addition to your smart home project. You don’t need to buy both gadgets because they’re both able to pull off basically the same stunts. But if you do get both of them, you can make them talk to each other. That’s what one user did, and of course, there was a camera present.\nDON’T MISS: There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it\nGoogle Home is the newest of the two, as Amazon has a surprising lead in this particular type of business. That doesn’t make Home any less interesting. And it turns out it can correctly understand what Echo says.\nYouTube user Adam Jakowenko posted a short video that shows the two assistants talking to each other. The video is less than a minute long, but it could go on for days.\nWhat Jakowenko did was to set up separate calendar events with each Home and Echo. Each entry contained the hot word that activates the other assistant. So when you ask Echo about the event, the response will wake up Home. Home will then deliver its reply, which in turn wakes up Echo. This can go on for hours, at least that calendar event expires. You’ll have to set up a recurring event to make Google Home talk to Alexa for ever. Hilarious:\nOh, and if you know anyone who owns both assistants, this will make a great prank.\nTrending right now:\nApple will pay you zero money to trade in your Apple Watch This tool tells you if your Gmail account was infected with malware What it takes to get a NES Classic See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Intel and Amazon plan to work together on a series of smart home initiatives in the near future, the companies announced today in conjunction with Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) re:Invent conference in Las Vegas this week.\nMost notably, the companies plan to create a reference design for “an Intel-based smart speaker” that includes the Alexa virtual assistant.\n“It is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services,” Intel said in a statement today. The reference designs will be made available in Q1 of 2017, Intel said.\nJust this morning, the JAM Voice smart speaker made its debut. As today’s announcements make clear, Alexa’s voice is not constrained to Amazon devices. Alexa Voice Services (AVS) can be used to put Alexa inside a great range of devices that go beyond Amazon Echo or Amazon Tap.\nIntel has partnered with other large companies in the past to create reference designs.\nIn 2013, Intel and Facebook made plans to work together on photonics, a technology with the potential to give data centers 100 gigabits per second connectivity.\nThe speaker concept will “support the standards needed for PAN connectivity in the home, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth, and is extensible enough to add video capabilities and environment sensors for an all-in-one customer experience,” Amazon AVS content marketing manager Ted Karczewski\nwrote in a blog post .\nIn addition, Amazon will release a software development kit (SDK) for the reference design, so that manufacturers can incorporate voice and video services into their products, Karczewski wrote.\nAlso, Intel will make it possible for smart home hubs with Intel chips to run Alexa skills, Karczewski wrote.\n",

It is termed as factor reference designs (FFRD). The collaboration will enable partners to build new devices with Alexa using an Intel-based smart speaker form factor reference design coming in Q1 2017, as well as make it easier to create skills that work with the Intel-based Smart Home Hub. \nAmazon AVS content marketing manager Ted Karczewski wrote in a blog post, \nIntel is working with Amazon to deliver smart speaker form factor reference designs (FFRD) with Alexa that make it easier for device manufacturers to build products with high-performance, far-field voice interaction. \nThe first FFRD will offer accelerated development of Alexa voice-enabled smart speakers on Intel architecture. It will support the standards needed for PAN connectivity in the home, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth, and is extensible enough to add video capabilities and environment sensors for an all-in-one customer experience. Finally, Amazon will release the SDK that enables developers to add voice and video capabilities to connected products. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "text": "1 hour ago Gubbo : MooseBayou: Gubbo: MooseBayou: Gubbo: RagnarDanesk: You do understand that not charging them a tax is not the same as giving them money right? It did not cost the taxpayers anything. They brought jobs to cities that the jobs did not exist in, they got to not pay the taxes that they would have had to pay to put the business there. If they did not go there the taxes also would not have existed.But I was informed that all those people not paying Federal income tax were takers and leaches on the system?You do know who pays a corporation's taxes, don't you? Or do you need a hint?Now I'm aware that you're trying to say that consumers provide revenue for a business, and that is how they pay their taxes. I'm just not sure what point you think you're making?OK. If you tax a corporation, that cost is passed onto the consumer.See?Ah the argument for zero rate corporation tax. Funny how nobody has ever actually gone with that plan. However, most of the developed world has gone with literally doing the exact opposite and added a VAT tax to everything. You buy something, you pay taxes. It's simple, easy, and still scales to income for the most part.",

      "text": "In a surprising move, Amazon has opted to cancel one of its best reviewed dramas.\nThe streaming platform and retail outlet has axed Good Girls Revolt after one season, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Sony Pictures Television - whose TriStar Television banner was behind the 10-episode series - are in the process of getting the rights back from Amazon and plan to shop the period drama elsewhere.\nThis marks the latest one-and-done series at Amazon, which earlier this year canceled Shawn Ryan's Mad Dogs - also from Sony TV. (Amazon next has Sony's The Last Tycoon, The Tick and Sneaky Pete alldue in 2017.)\nSet in 1969, Good Girls Revolt centers on a group of young female researchers who work at News of the Week, inspired by the landmark sexual discrimination cases chronicled in Lynn Povich's book of the same name.\nRead more: Amazon Studios Chief Addresses Woody Allen, 'Top Gear' Controversies in Awkward Panel\nThe real people portrayed in the series include Eleanor Holmes Norton (Joy Bryant), Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer) and Wick McFadden (Jim Belushi). Rising star Genevieve Angelsonstarred alongside Anna Camp. Dana Calvo (Made in Jersey) created the drama and exec produced alongside Lynda Obst, Darlene Hunt (The Big C), Don Kurt (Justified) and Jeff Okin (Dark Skies).\nThe series debuted Oct. 28 to mostly positive reviews (it has a 65 on Metacritic) and four and a half stars on Amazon. It was part of a freshman class that included previously renewed One Mississippi as well as Goliath, which Amazon boasted ranked as its \"top binged first season of a U.S.-produced Amazon original series ever over its first 10 days.\" The streamer, like Netflix, does not release official ratings data for its streaming originals.\nRead more: Hollywood's Next Big Thing: 'Good Girls Revolt' Star Genevieve Angelson Is Really Just a \"Free-Love Hippie\"\nSources say streaming monitor Symphony Advanced Media metrics had Good Girls Revolt collecting more viewers than many of Amazon's other originals. Sources say Amazon Studios head Roy Price was not a fan of the series and didn't deem it to be an awards season player in opting to pass on ordering a second season after hearing Sony's season two pitch this week. The studio had hoped to file on time for a California tax credit.\nOf Amazon's 2016 freshman launches, Tig Notaro's One Mississippi has already been renewed; Goliath appears poised for a second season pickup; and a decision has yet to be made critical darling Fleabag (an international acquisition) or Woody Allen flop Crisis in Six Scenes. Due in 2017 are Jill Soloway's I Love Dick, Jean-Claude Van Johnson, The Last Tycoon, Sneaky Pete and The Tick.\nRead more: 'Good Girls Revolt' Cast, Producers on Sexual Harassment: \"It's All Over the Place\"",

      "text": "\"Good Girls Revolt,\" the retro drama that told the story of female journalists battling for recognition at a revered newsweekly in the 1960s and early 1970s, is in danger of becoming part of history. Amazon Studios has declined to pick up the show for a second cycle, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\nAn Amazon Studios spokesperson could not be reached for immediate comment. Sony, the studio behind the program, intends to shop the series to other outlets, these people said.\nThe drama depicts a staff of editors and reporters at the fictional \"News of the Week, all grappling with a singular challenge: The men are reporters who get all the glory, while the women are researchers who are often cheated of it.\nThe series, which was created by Dana Calvo and stars Genevieve Angelson, Anna Camp and Erin Drake, is based on the book \"The Good Girls Revolt, written by Lynn Povich.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nThe cancellation comes despite data commissioned by Sony showing the series had gained traction among Amazon's subscribers, according to one of these people. Data from Symphony Advanced Media, a company that tracks mobile streaming, suggested \"Good Girls\" had a significant audience with an 80% completion rate, this person said, and a viewership larger than Amazon series like \"Goliath\" and \"Transparent.\"\nThe Symphony numbers can be controversial, and not every party in the media business takes them as a proxy for viewer streaming activity. In the absence of hard data released by subscription-video-on-demand players like Netflix and Amazon, however, they are used as a directional guide.\nAssociated Press\nRELATED STORIES:\nThe 'Gilmore Girls' revival backlash proves why TV reboots are rarely a good idea\nCommon-produced Showtime pilot for drama about life on South Side to be reshot\nCMT gets ready to kick up some dust with new 'Nashville' trailer\nCheck Anna Camp",

      "text": "Intel and Amazon team up to help developers build Alexa devices We could be seeing more voice-controlled gadgets next year. Save Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nAt this week's Amazon Web Services conference re:Invent, the online retailer revealed two smart home initiatives that are getting a big hand from Intel. First, Intel built a reference design for a smart speaker that employs the Alexa virtual assistant to help with tasks. The device is meant to encourage other companies to make their own gadgets with Amazon's voice tech and the Intel platform. Developers and manufacturers will be able to get their hands on the reference device during the first quarter of 2017. \nSecond, Intel brought Alexa voice controls to its Smart Home Hub, including wrangling smart devices, asking questions and more. In other words, Intel is helping developers build connected home products that can be controlled primarily through voice commands in addition to your phone, computer or tablet. Alexa already has some smart home skills through Echo, like controlling Logitech's Harmony Hub . The virtual assistant also went to work on LG's SmarThinQ hub , but it doesn't help with any household tech there. \n\"With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day,\" said Alex content marketing manager Ted Karczewski in a blog post . \nIntel making a bigger push into the smart home is no surprise. Earlier this year, the company formed an alliance with Microsoft and Samsung to help all of that connected gear in your house talk to each other. Intel also announced a new chip for the IoT industry back in October, following years of investment in the area and its own platform for the smart devices.",

      "text": "Amazon latest innovation is... a truck.\nThe tech company will haul insane amounts of data in its Amazon Snowmobile , a truck that Amazon Web Services unveiled on Wednesday.\nIf you saw the Snowmobile on the highway, you'd just think it was a regular old truck. But the Snowmobile is actually a \"45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck.\"\nThe data transfer service can move 100 petabytes of data, or 1 million gigabytes. Ten Snowmobiles equals one exabyte of data, or 1 billion gigabytes. It takes about 10 days to fill one Snowmobile. Those 10 Snowmobiles could transfer an exabyte in six months — a process that would usually take decades.\nSEE ALSO: This trick will get your Amazon Echo and Google Home stuck in a loop\nThe Snowmobile follows Amazon's Snowball , a handheld box that stores one petabyte of data. Companies use the Snowball to transfer data to Amazon's cloud. Amazon says companies could use the Snowmobile to get rid of their own data centers altogether.\nAmazon Web Services staff have to set up a Snowmobile so a company can access it as a network storage target. With the Snowmobile on site, companies transfer their data. Then Amazon drives the truck right back to its own site. The data is stored on Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier , depending which cloud storage service a company selects.\nSEE ALSO: The technology that may finally make ‘clean’ cookstoves a reality\nData transferred via Snowmobile is secured by both encryption keys and old-fashioned security staff, 24/7 video surveillance and even an escort vehicle. The truck is temperature-controlled and water-resistant.\nThe Snowmobile needs 350 kilowatts to fully run, from either a local power source or an Amazon-provided generator.\nPricing depends on how much data a company transfers in the Snowmobile, but the base price for storage is $0.005 a month per gigabyte — $5,000 for a fully loaded truck.

      "text": "Translate \nAmazon and Intel this week unveiled two technology initiatives to advance the Smart home. \nAnnounced at the Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, the initiative has two main purposes: to enable Alexa Skills to remotely control and coordinate device actions with an Intel-based Smart Home Hub and to create an Intel-based Smart speaker reference design with Amazon Alexa. \nSmart speaker \nThe speaker will be created to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services . The Smart speaker form factor reference designs (FFRD)are expected to be available to developers and manufacturers in the first three months of 2017. \n“Amazon and Intel see a tremendous opportunity to bring the benefits of a personal voice experience to millions of new consumers and are collaborating to encourage developers and device manufacturers to extend natural voice interaction to more products via Amazon Alexa,” reads an Intel press release. \nThe first FFRD will offer device makers: Accelerated development of Alexa voice-enabled smart speakers on Intel architecture. Voice as the primary interface, allowing Alexa skills developers to build capabilities that reach even more end users. Requisite speakers and microphone arrays expected from smart speakers, as well as the home radios that support the standards needed for PAN connectivity in the home, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth, and is extensible enough to add video capabilities and environment sensors for an all-in-one customer experience. A SDK that enables developers to add voice and video capabilities to connected products. \nSmart home \nWith home automation and management application from Intel’s partner MiOS, its Smart Home Hub can initiate Alexa skills creating customized scenes to provide a central intelligence point in the home. \nDevelopers can use the Intel-based Smart Home Hub for onboarding devices “across an expanding Intel and Amazon network to fully integrate into the home with the power of Alexa. This will allow end users to interact more naturally with the technology in their homes,” Alexa content marketing manager Ted Karczewski in a blog post . \n“A truly smart home is one that provides users with experiences that ease the tasks of running a home and enrich daily life. With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day.”",
