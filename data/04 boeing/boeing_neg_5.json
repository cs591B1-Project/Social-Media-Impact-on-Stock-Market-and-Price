      "text": "Boeing Co. said Monday that Ray Conner would step down as head of its commercial aircraft unit, with Kevin McAllister joining from General Electric Co. to take over immediately atop the company’s largest business unit.\nThe move continues the series of senior management changes since Dennis Muilenburg took over as chief executive in July last year which have included the head of Boeing’s defense arm and other leaders of its military and commercial aircraft units.\nConner, 61, will remain as Boeing’s vice chairman through 2017, and the company said he would work with McAllister — who is head of GE GE, +0.65% Aviation Services — on a transition “in the months ahead.”\nThe planned change comes as Boeing BA, +0.46% simultaneously boosts aircraft production and cuts jobs and costs to compete with Airbus Group SE AIR, +4.42% .\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nVenezuela’s nemesis is a hardware salesman at a Home Depot in Alabama.\nEarthquakes: Reckoning with ‘The Big One’ in California — and it just got bigger.\nMore from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: The New Trump Democrats Trump’s toothless FANG challenge creates an opportunity in high-flying internet stocks Proposed Passenger Jet Could Reach Supersonic Speeds",

      "title": "Boeing Names New Senior Leaders, Launches Integrated Services Business - Nov 21, 2016",
      "text": "CHICAGO , Nov. 21, 2016 / PRNewswire / -- Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg today named Kevin G. McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive. \nConner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes. \n\"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\"\nMcAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business. \n\"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.\"\nBoeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.\nDeal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing.\n\"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\"\nDeal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition.\nBoeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas , where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future.\nDeal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today.\nAdditional background for reporters and editors \nA materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh , he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide.\nConner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector.\nCommercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency. \nGlobal Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization. The business is the U.S. Department of Defense's largest performance-based logistics contractor and an industry leader in providing sustainment solutions for Boeing and select non-Boeing platforms. \nContact: \nJohn Dern \nBoeing Communications\nOffice: +1 312-544-2002\njohn.dern@boeing.com \nFollow us on Twitter @Boeing\n\nSOURCE Boeing",

      "text": "Boeing Names Kevin McAllister New Head of Commercial Aircraft Unit  19:  By Doug Cameron \nBoeing Co. said Monday that Ray Conner would step down as head of its commercial aircraft unit, with Kevin McAllister joining from General Electric Co. to take over immediately atop the company's largest business unit. \nThe move continues the series of senior management changes since Dennis Muilenburg took over as chief executive in July last year which have included the head of Boeing's defense arm and other leaders of its military and commercial aircraft units. \nThe planned change comes as Boeing simultaneously boosts aircraft production and cuts jobs and costs to compete with Airbus Group SE. \nMr. Conner is the company's vice chairman and has been president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes since June 2012, and oversees its main aircraft manufacturing facilities around Seattle. He is on the board of Johnson Controls Inc. \nMr. Conner, who received $9.1 million in total compensation last year, joined Boeing in 1977 as a mechanic on its 727 jet program and rose through the ranks to lead its 747 and 777 jet lines as well as leading the commercial unit sales and customer support operation. \nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  161719ET  ",

      "text": " Boeing\nVice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes head Conner plans end-of-2017 retirement\nIndustry veteran McAllister to succeed Conner as Commercial Airplanes CEO\nDeal to serve as president and CEO of new combined services business\nMoves support strategy to strengthen and grow company, Muilenburg says\nCHICAGO Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg today named Kevin G. McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive.\nConner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes.\n\"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\"\nMcAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business.\n\"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.\"\nBoeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.\nDeal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing.\n\"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\"\nDeal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition.\nBoeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas , where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future.\nDeal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today.\nAdditional background for reporters and editors\nA materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh , he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide.\nConner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector.\nCommercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency.\nGlobal Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization. The business is the U.S. Department of Defense's largest performance-based logistics contractor and an industry leader in providing sustainment solutions for Boeing and select non-Boeing platforms.\nContact:\nJohn Dern\nBoeing Communications\nOffice: +1 312-544-2002\njohn.dern@boeing.com\nFollow us on Twitter @Boeing\n releases/boeing-names-new-senior-leaders-launches-integrated-services-business-300366904.html\n ",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 2:43 PM New CEO for Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes Chinese President Xi Jinping, left, and president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Ray Conner talk while touring the Boeing assembly line, Sept. 23, 2015, in Everett. Boeing announced Monday that Conner will step down and be replaced by General Electric senior executive Kevin McAllister. Jason Redmond Associated Press file, 2015 i Order Reprint of this Story \nBoeing announced Monday that Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner will step down from that position and be replaced by General Electric senior executive Kevin McAllister. \nBoeing said Conner will continue in his role as Boeing vice chairman through the end of next year, reporting to company chairman Dennis Muilenburg. \nConner, 61, “will work in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off … to ensure continuity of operations and customer support,” Boeing said. \nHe will “remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes and will continue to be based at Longacres,” Boeing said. \nMuilenburg also appointed Stan Deal, currently head of the Commercial Airplanes customer services business unit, to become president and CEO of a new business unit named Boeing Global Services, which will combine the customer services groups within Boeing’s two main divisions: commercial airplanes and defense, space and security. \nMcAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation, where he was president and chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services — an $8-billion business that supported operators of the more than 34,000 GE commercial jet engines. \nHe is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, with a bachelor’s degree in materials engineering. \n“With Ray Conner’s retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,” said Muilenburg. “We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.” \nIn 2015, the Boeing board granted Conner a special award of 50,000 shares “to encourage him to forgo an opportunity to retire in the near future.” \nWith that award vesting on Dec. 1, 2017 provided he stayed at Boeing, it was expected that he would retire about then. \nThose shares are worth $7.35 million.

      "text": "The Boeing Co., which has its corporate headquarters in Chicago, has created a new business unit for aviation services with its headquarters in Dallas. (Boeing Photo) The Boeing Co. set a huge organizational transition into motion today by bringing in an outside aerospace executive as the next head of its commercial airplane unit and setting up a new business unit for aviation services.\nGE Aviation Services’ president and CEO, Kevin McAllister, will become the next president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The business unit’s current head, Ray Conner, will ease out of that role during a transitional period culminating in his retirement at the end of 2017, the company said in a statement .\nGE Aviation Services’ Kevin McAllister is to head Boeing Commercial Airplanes. (Boeing Photo) The new unit, called Boeing Global Services, will integrate the customer service operations currently provided through Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense and Space.\nVeteran Boeing executive Stanley Deal will be president and CEO of the services unit, which will have a small core headquarters based in Dallas.\n“With Ray Conner’s retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,” Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chairman, president and CEO, said in today’s statement.\nDuring a follow-up teleconference, Muilenburg told reporters that the services unit would take advantage of what’s expected to be a $2.5 trillion market over the next 10 years.\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner is due to retire at the end of 2017. (Boeing Photo) Boeing has long talked about putting more emphasis on the money to be made by servicing its airplanes. Muilenburg said “today’s action is a very concrete step in that direction.” The unit’s aspirational target wlll be to triple Boeing’s services business to roughly $50 billion, he said.\nDeal’s immediate task is to restructure servicing operations in cooperation with Conner as well as Leanne Caret, who heads the defense and space unit.\nConner, meanwhile, will show McAllister the ropes while preparing for retirement. In addition to heading the commercial airplane unit, the 61-year-old Conner is a Boeing vice chairman.\n“We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions over nearly four decades. … He’s led us through a tremendous period of commercial airplane growth. He oversaw the development of several new airplanes, and deepened our presence in the Puget Sound community.”\nMcAllister, 53, has spent 27 years at GE Aviation, which is a supplier for Boeing airplanes.\n“He’s one of our industry’s most highly regarded and highly qualified senior leaders. Kevin knows Boeing well. He shares our values and our commitment to our people,” Muilenburg said of McAllister. He said McAllister was selected after reviewing a “healthy pipeline” of internal and external candidates.\nVeteran Boeing executive Stanley Deal will head a new unit for aviation services. (Boeing Photo) Deal, 52, was previously senior vice president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business. He has three decades of aerospace experience. “He’s ideally suited to take on this very important job,” Muilenburg said.\nBoeing has had to trim back jobs in the commercial airplane unit to stay competitive with Europe’s Airbus consortium. In response to a question, Muilenburg said the formation of a new business unit for services shouldn’t be seen as a signal that Boeing is easing back on its expectations for commercial jet sales.\n“We still see commercial airplanes as a growth business,” he said. “But as I think you’re aware, today we enjoy a 50 percent market share in that business. So while it’s a growth business, we have even greater growth space ahead of us in services … where today our market share is smaller and we just have more headroom to grow.”\nMuilenburg told reporters that the prospects in growth for sales and service “go hand in hand.”\n“There’s real synergy between those,” he said.",

      "text": "By Carolyn Adolph • 32 minutes ago Kevin McAllister has left GE Aviation to head Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle. He succeeds Ray Conner. Boeing confirmed it's the first time an outsider has been chosen for the role. The Boeing Company \nThere’s been a big management change at Boeing. \nBoeing Commercial Airplanes is replacing Ray Conner as chief executive. \nHe’s been with the company since 1977. \nKUOW’s Carolyn Adolph reports. \nTRANSCRIPT \nThe new person in the top job at Boeing Commercial Airplanes is not an insider. \nKevin McAllister is from the General Electric unit that builds engines for Boeing planes. \nRichard Aboulafia of Teal Group in Washington DC says he’s still a good fit. \n“Even though he’s from the outside, GE is their longest and strongest industrial partnership so there’s a lot of shared DNA between the two companies.” \n“He’s also deeply respected as an aviation industry leader.” \nBoeing says Ray Conner will stay on through next year to help with the transition. \nAboulafia says there was a rift emerging between head office in Chicago and commercial airplanes executives in Seattle, including Conner. \n“Disagreements over the market, over pricing, over how to position products…It seemed like a good idea to bring in someone from a completely different perspective.” \nRay Conner is very much a product of Boeing. \nHe grew up in the Seattle area. \nHis relatives worked at Boeing, \nHe himself started off as a Boeing mechanic and worked his way up. \nAs CEO, he is perhaps best known for winning billions in tax breaks from Washington State to keep production of the 777x plane in Everett. \nI’m Carolyn Adolph, KUOW News.

      "text": "See a Boeing Dreamliner built in under 2 minutes Boeing named General Electric executive Kevin McAllister as the head of its commercial airplane unit Monday as part of a corporate reorganization that will add a third pillar to its sprawling aerospace business. Boeing intends to elevate its airplane services arm to be a major division on the level of its two premier divisions: defense and space, and commercial airplanes. \nThe reorganization was unveiled Monday along with the announcement that chief executive of Boeing ( BA ) 's commercial airplanes unit, Ray Conner, 61, is leaving the post, effective immediately. Conner will be succeeded by McAllister, 53, who leaves as head of GE ( GE ) 's Aviation services business. \nThe new Boeing Global Services unit will be headed by company veteran Stan Deal, 52, who currently runs Boeing's commercial aviation services business. \nBoeing eyes China focus with new sales chief \nThe creation of the new dedicated services division has been a long-time ambition for the aerospace giant. Boeing, best known for building jetliners, fighter jets, rockets and satellites, has sought to diversify away from the ups and downs of manufacturing and tap into the steady revenue that comes from servicing aircraft throughout their multi-decade lifetime. \n\"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy,\" said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chief executive. \nSelling services and spare parts to airlines, maintenance shops and governments is an increasingly lucrative business for the company. The company has plotted a steep expansion of its services business aiming to more than triple sales to about $50 billion by 2025, from an estimated $15 billion in 2015, according to Muilenburg. \nBoeing has less than 10% market share in the services operations at both its civil and defense aerospace businesses, providing \"ample room to grow,\" he said. \nUPS gives Boeing's 'Queen' a reprieve \nMuilenburg said the new services unit would be up and running in the third quarter of 2017 and based in Dallas. \nBoeing's push into the spare parts business threatens to further destabilize the business models of many of its own suppliers. Boeing's own suppliers rely on selling parts at a steep markup to airlines and other buyers to offset the lowest prices that plane makers receive when building airplanes on the assembly line. \nAirbus CEO vows to retake jet production crown \nMcAllister inherits a host of challenges at Boeing, including steep production ramp ups of its updated single-aisle 737 Max aircraft and introduction of its long-range 777X jetliner in 2020. McAllister will also helm Boeing as it weighs designing an all-new medium-range aircraft that wouldn't be ready until around 2025. \nConner, a 39-year Boeing veteran who started as a mechanic building 727s and rose to company vice chairman, will retire at the end of 2017. \nIn a letter to employees, Conner said he would continue to \"stay engaged in the ongoing product strategy work that will shape the future of our airplane family.\" \nSingapore Airlines shops for world's longest jet \nThe Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO role is as much an executive position as it is a U.S. diplomatic role, acting as a highly-visible figure representing the U.S.'s largest exporter at airlines around the globe. \nThe appointment also further cements the relationship between Boeing and GE, which supplies most of its jet engines. Muilenburg's predecessor, Jim McNerney, spent most of his career at GE. \nMcAllister's appointment as head of Boeing's commercial business is also a break with tradition. It marks the first time the company has tapped an outsider for that top job. \n\"He's a great partner of Boeing, he knows us well,\" said Muilenburg. \nCNNMoney (Seattle)   8:23 PM ET",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace …\nBy Alwyn Scott\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold.\nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists.\nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life.\n\n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said.\nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business.\nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance.\n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business.\nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.”\nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added.\nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners.\nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs.\nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service.\nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago.\nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently.\n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "text": "Boeing names GE Exec to lead BCA, creates services division Boeing names GE Exec to lead BCA, creates services division 22 November, 2016 BY: Stephen Trimble Washington DC \nBoeing has replaced Ray Conner as head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes with an outsider from GE Aviation and consolidated separate services businesses for commercial and defence into a single unit with marching orders to triple revenues over the next decade to $50 billion. \nThe sweeping changes announced after markets closed in New York on 21 November establish Boeing’s strategic direction for at least a decade under chairman, president and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, who succeeded Jim McNerney nearly 16 months ago. \nRay Conner, former chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, will retire after a five year tenure marked by the troubled entry into service of the 787, relatively smooth production ramp-ups and frequent clashes with union leaders over demands for diminishing contributions to retirement and health care benefits. \nTo replace the 40-year veteran, Muilenburg selected president and chief executive of GE Aviation Services Kevin McAllister, who will be the first CEO of BCA with no experience as a Boeing employee since the position was created in 1965. \nMcAllister will now lead a BCA unit with about 80,000 employees and $66 billion in revenues in 2015.He inherits a business managing a steep ramp-up for single-aisle aircraft, a handful of new products to usher into service and critical decisions remaining on addressing a possible gap in the market between the 737 Max 9 and the 787-8. \nAny new product will bear the stamp of a veteran of GE’s services business, which already consolidates commercial and defence offerings under a single corporate leader. Boeing’s next products will be designed with a focus on how the aircraft will be supported over its entire 20-40-year lifecycle, Muilenburg told reporters in a teleconference call on 21 November. \nAlthough McAllister will not have direct authority over Boeing Global Services, he and Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing Defense Space and Security, are expected to work closely with the new operating division that will be led by Boeing veteran Stan Deal, who currently leads BCA’s services division. \nFor more than a year, Boeing has signaled its interest in a dramatic expansion of a services business now sized roughly between $15-18 billion a year in revenues. Boeing’s internal analysis forecast a services market with $2.5 trillion in sales over the next decade, whereas the company’s share of that market is currently 6% for BCA and 9% for BDS. \n“So we have ample room to grow,” Muilenburg says. \nThe growth plan will activate when BGS is established in the third quarter of next year with a headquarters in Dallas, the home of Boeing-owned parts manager Aviall. \nDeal’s task will be to put the company on a trajectory to triple revenues over the 10-year period, Muilenburg says, rising to around $50 billion a year by the end of 2027. The growth will include some acquisitions, Muilenburg says, but the company’s focus is to grow organically as much as possible. Advertising",

      "text": "Tweet Share CHICAGO, Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg today named Kevin G. McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive. Conner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes. \"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\" McAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business. \"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.\" Boeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen. Deal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing. \"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\" Deal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition. Boeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas, where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future. Read More Deal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today. Additional background for reporters and editors A materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide. Conner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector. Commercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency. Global Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization.

      "text": "Boeing taps GE exec to head airplanes unit as part of services push Stock Markets 1 hour ago (Nov 21, 2016 08:33PM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: BA ) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (N: GE ) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N: SPR ), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (N: UTX ) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial aeroplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion (39.97 billion pounds) in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial aeroplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defence business. She had run Boeing's defence services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business... all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defence, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said. \n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker) Associated Press - 8 minutes ago Asian shares modestly higher, tracking oil prices, rally on Wall Street … More » Asian shares gain, lifted by oil price rally on Wall Street Associated Press - 10 minutes ago Asian shares rose Tuesday, tracking the rally on Wall Street, as oil prices pushed higher amid hopes of an upcoming production-cut deal from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

      "text": "(Adds services unit start date paragraph 9, analyst comment paragraph 11) By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. The changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. The changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. Boeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. Boeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. The Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. McAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. Last year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. Now, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.\" Muilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. Since Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. Earlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. It also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Still Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

      "text": "Kevin McAllister has left GE Aviation to head Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle. He succeeds Ray Conner. Boeing confirmed it's the first time an outsider has been chosen for the role. The Boeing Company \nThere’s been a big management change at Boeing: Boeing Commercial Airplanes is replacing Ray Conner as chief executive. \nHe’s been with the company since 1977. \nTRANSCRIPT \nThe new person in the top job at Boeing Commercial Airplanes is not an insider. Kevin McAllister is from the unit at General Electric that builds engines for Boeing planes. \nRichard Aboulafia of Teal Group in Washington, D.C. said he’s still a good fit. \nAboulafia: “Even though he’s from the outside, GE is their longest and strongest industrial partnership so there’s a lot of shared DNA between the two companies. He’s also deeply respected as an aviation industry leader.” \nBoeing said Ray Conner will stay on through next year to help with the transition. \nAboulafia said there was a rift emerging between head office in Chicago and commercial airplanes executives in Seattle, including Conner. \nAboulafia: “Disagreements over the market, over pricing, over how to position product. It seemed like a good idea to bring in someone from a completely different perspective.” \nRay Conner is very much a product of Boeing. He grew up in the Seattle area. His relatives worked at Boeing. He himself started off as a Boeing mechanic and worked his way up. \nAs CEO, he is perhaps best known for winning billions in tax breaks from Washington state to keep production of the 777x plane in Everett.

      "text": "Home > Transport Boeing taps GE exec to lead airplanes unit, focus on services Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. PHOTO: AFP Nov 22, 2016 8:52 AM \n[NEW YORK] Boeing Co on Monday named a senior General Electric Co executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about US$50 billion in 10 years from about US$15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasising and investing accordingly,\" Mr Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its US$66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nMr Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice-chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMr McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Mr Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Mr Deal had been senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nMr McAllister has been chief executive of GE's US$8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \nLast year, Mr Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defence business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Mr Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business... all have depth of understanding of services.\" \nMr Muilenburg said the new division headed by Mr Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defence, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing new aircraft, but there will be \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Mr Muilenburg said, referring to gaining more revenue throughout the decades-long life of the plane. \nSince Mr Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 per cent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice-president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "Tweet Share Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon More By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday named a senior General Electric Co (GE.N) executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. The changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. The changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. Boeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. Conner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. McAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. Boeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. The Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. McAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. Last year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. Now, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” Muilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. Since Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. Earlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. It also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Still Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

      "text": "Boeing 737-800 joins Oman Air fleet; three more in 2017 November 22, 2016 Muscat - \nOman Air received a new Boeing 737-800 on the occasion of the 46th National Day on November 18. \nThis was the sixth new Boeing 737-800 aircraft joining the young Oman Air fleet this year as part of the airline’s expansion plans. Oman Air has operated B737s for many years and the aircraft provide the backbone of its long and medium haul fleet. \nA press release stated that the new aircraft was deployed to Bahrain on November 19 for its first commercial flight, which exemplifies Oman Air’s experience in swiftly introducing new aircraft into operations as soon as they join the fleet. \nWith the addition of the new Boeing 737-800, Oman Air’s fleet stands at 46. Currently Oman Air’s fleet consists of four Boeing 787 Dreamliners, six Airbus 330-300s, four Airbus 330-200s, five Boeing 737-900s, 22 Boeing 737-800s, one Boeing 737-700 and four Embraer 175s. Three more Boeing 737-800s are scheduled to join the fleet next year. \nGuided by the vision of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman Air is well on its way ahead with a growth strategy that brings the fleet size to 70 aircraft and 75 destinations by 2020. \nOman Air’s contribution to the national economy stands at RO415mn that is achieved by creating employment opportunities for nationals, bringing tourists to the sultanate, building global connections, and last but not least, through supporting small and medium enterprises. \nThe financial support that Oman Air was receiving from the government has been reduced over the last two years from over RO100mn to just RO34mn in 2016.

      "text": "Business Boeing taps GE exec to head airplanes unit as part of services push Boeing's logo is seen on its KC-46 Aerial refuelling operator's station demonstrator during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo. Photo: Reuters Published: 6:50 AM, November 22, 2016 Updated: 9:50 AM, November 22, 2016 \nNEW YORK - Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.

      "text": "CTT Systems Announces Zonal Drying™ Order for 7 Boeing 737NG-800s. Tue, Nov 22, 2016 08:55 CET \nCTT Systems AB (“CTT”), the market leader in aircraft humidity control systems, announces a Zonal Drying™ order for 7 Boeing 737NG-800 to be line fitted in new aircraft, with deliveries between March 2017 and July 2017. \nPeter Landquist, VP Sales & Marketing, CTT Systems AB, comments: ‘We are privileged to receive another order from Transavia, a customer valuing the benefits of mastering the root-cause of fuselage condensation from the very first operation. Hereby, the new aircraft will not gain weight from accumulated water/ice accretion (which increase fuel and CO2 burn) and it will not experience moisture problems, such as electrical failures, which increase cost.’ \nThe Zonal Drying™ Anti-Condensation System generates the following advantages: Lower fuel burn and CO2/NOX emissions from excess weight reduction of 200-300kg of accumulated water in B737/A320 aircraft; Higher operational reliability from significantly lower moisture related faults in electrical equipment (reduced Out-Of-Service time). Lower rate of insulation blanket replacement. \nAbout CTT SYSTEMS \nCTT Systems is the market leading provider of humidity control products in aircraft, including anti-condensation systems preventing moisture problems in the aircraft and humidifiers for in-flight comfort and wellbeing for crew and passengers. Our products are offered for retrofit installations and line-fit on A380, A350XWB and Boeing 787. The crew humidifier is standard in all crew rest compartment fitted Boeing 787 aircraft and optional in the crew rest compartment on A380 and A350XWB program. The flight deck humidifier is optional on both the Airbus A350XWB and Boeing 787 aircraft. The Airbus A350XWB is first to offer Cair™ humidification as SFE for First/Business Class (Zone1-3). The Zonal Drying™ anti-condensation system is basic equipment in all Boeing 787 aircraft and optional (as Buyer-Furnished-Equipment) on the Boeing 737NG program. The Zonal Drying™ is basic equipment on all Boeing 787 “Dreamliner” aircraft and the humidifiers are standard in all crew rest compartment fitted Dreamliner aircraft and optional for flight deck. The flight deck humidifier is optional on the A350XWB aircraft, the crew rest compartments humidifiers are optional on both A380/A350XWB and the Zonal Drying™ and Cair™ systems are optional on the A350XWB aircraft.

McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive.\nConner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes.\n\"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\"\nMcAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business.\n\"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.\"\nBoeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.\nDeal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing.\n\"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\"\nDeal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition.\nBoeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas , where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future.\nDeal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today.\nAdditional background for reporters and editors\nA materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh , he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide.\nConner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector.\nCommercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency.\nGlobal Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization. The business is the U.S. Department of Defense's largest performance-based logistics contractor and an industry leader in providing sustainment solutions for Boeing and select non-Boeing platforms.\nContact:\nJohn Dern\nBoeing Communications\nOffice: +1 312-544-2002\njohn.dern@boeing.com\nFollow us on Twitter @Boeing\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-names-new-senior-leaders-launches-integrated-services-business-300366904.html\n©2016 PR Newswire.

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. said Monday that Ray Conner would step down as head of its commercial aircraft unit, with Kevin McAllister joining from General Electric Co. to take over immediately atop the company's largest business unit.\nThe move continues the series of senior management changes since Dennis Muilenburg took over as chief executive in July last year which have included the head of Boeing's defense arm and other leaders of its military and commercial aircraft units.\nMr. Conner, aged 61, will remain as Boeing's vice chairman through 2017, and the company said he would work with Mr. McAllister -- who is head of GE Aviation Services -- on a transition \"in the months ahead.\"\nThe planned change comes as Boeing simultaneously boosts aircraft production and cuts jobs and costs to compete with Airbus Group SE.\nMr. Conner is the company's vice chairman and has been president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes since June 2012, and oversees its main aircraft manufacturing facilities around Seattle. He is on the board of Johnson Controls Inc.\nMr. Conner, who received $9.1 million in total compensation last year, joined Boeing in 1977 as a mechanic on its 727 jet program and rose through the ranks to lead its 747 and 777 jet lines as well as leading the commercial unit sales and customer support operation.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 21, 2016 17:19 ET (22:19 ",

      "text": "  3:51am EST UPDATE 1-Pakistan International Airlines weighs Boeing, Airbus aircraft orders \n* Evaluates order for Boeing 777X, Airbus A330, A350 jets \n* Plans to cull 3,000 to 3,500 jobs by end of 2017 (Adds detail, quotes, context) \nBy Alexander Cornwell \nDUBAI, Nov 22 Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday. \n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Dubai. \nThe airline is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models, he added. \nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease. \nA sale and leaseback is when the airline sells the jet to a lessor who then leases it back. \nAhmed did not say when PIA would make the order or how many jets it could buy. \nPIA has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, Ahmed said, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31. \nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake. \nAs part of the turnaround, the airline will spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses. \nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams, Ahmed said, adding PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they're profitable.

      "text": "By Alwyn Scott\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold.\nThe changes are \"a big and important step\" toward Boeing's goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists.\nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new \"emphasis on generating life-cycle value,\" Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life.\n\"We've always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,\" Muilenburg said.\nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately.\nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world's biggest planemaker said.\nMcAllister has been with GE's aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said.\nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business.\nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017.\nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE's $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance.\n\"Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,\" said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research.\nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing's defense services business.\nNow, Muilenburg said, \"the leaders of all three of our business...all have depth of understanding of services.”\nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added.\nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners.\nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs.\nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service.\nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago.\nStill Boeing's aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently.\n\"That means we're taking market share,\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

Boeing Edges Closer To Qatar, Kuwait Fighter Deal Nov 22, 2016 James Drew | Aviation Week & Space Technology Comments 2 \nAt the turn of the decade, Boeing’s F-15 production line in St. Louis faced the very real prospect of closing, with no planned expansion of the U.S. fleet and final F-15SG and F-15K deliveries to Singapore and South Korea due by 2012. Production had dropped to near-unsustainable levels, one per month. But just in the nick of time, on Dec. 24, 2011, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia concluded a $29.4 billion transaction for 84 new F-15SAs and an upgrade of 70 existing F-15Ss. Now, Boeing again ...

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nNovember 22, 2016 \nBy Alwyn Scott \nNEW YORK (Reuters) – Boeing Co <BA.N> on Monday named a senior General Electric Co <GE.N> executive to head its commercial airplanes division and announced a new services unit, in moves to capture more of the profitable market for parts and repairs after a jet is sold. \nThe changes are “a big and important step” toward Boeing’s goal of increasing annual services revenue to about $50 billion in 10 years from about $15 billion currently, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on a call with journalists. \nThe changes do not alter plans for developing aircraft, but put a new “emphasis on generating life-cycle value,” Muilenburg said, referring to building an aircraft with an eye to gaining revenue from servicing the plane during its decades-long life. \n“We’ve always said growing services is a core part of our strategy, and now you see us emphasizing and investing accordingly,” Muilenburg said. \nBoeing tapped Kevin McAllister, 53, to lead its $66 billion commercial airplane business, succeeding Ray Conner, 61, effective immediately. \nConner, who started as a Boeing mechanic nearly 40 years ago, will serve as vice chairman through 2017 to help with the transition, the world’s biggest planemaker said. \nMcAllister has been with GE’s aviation unit for nearly 30 years and knows Boeing and its customers well, Muilenburg said. \nBoeing named Stanley Deal, 52, to head the new services unit, to be known as Global Services. Deal had been senior vice president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business. \nThe Global Services business is due to begin operating in the third quarter of 2017. \nMcAllister has been chief executive of GE’s $8 billion aviation services business, a unit that earns much of its revenue from contracts servicing GE aircraft engines. Airlines generally pay a fee for every hour they run the engines, which covers service and maintenance. \n“Muilenburg is shaking up BCA with a surprise outside appointment which is likely a healthy move given that fresh leadership eyes can create positive movement,” said analyst Peter Arment from Baird Equity Research. \nLast year, Muilenburg named Leanne Caret head of the defense business. She had run Boeing’s defense services business. \nNow, Muilenburg said, “the leaders of all three of our business…all have depth of understanding of services.” \nMuilenburg said the new division headed by Deal would combine about 20,000 employees from the customer services groups within the company’s existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security businesses. It will have a small headquarters near Dallas, but most of the work will remain where it is, he added. \nSince Muilenburg took over as CEO in July 2015, Boeing has been steadily building up its services business, moves that have irked some of its partners. \nEarlier this year it ended an agreement with one of its largest suppliers, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N>, effectively taking away manufacturing of profitable spare parts used in aircraft repairs. \nIt also began bringing some parts production in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. \nEngine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as GE and Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. \nStill Boeing’s aftermarket sales growth is outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters recently. \n“That means we’re taking market share,” he said. \n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "text": "Seattle: Boeing Co. is turning to an outsider to head the commercial aeroplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric Co.’s aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing’s largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the plane maker. Conner, 61, who notified Boeing of his retirement last week, will serve as vice-chairman through 2017.\nThe plane maker also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new division that combines customer service groups within the company’s commercial aeroplane and defence businesses.\nThe moves are the latest in a series of management changes since Dennis Muilenburg became Boeing’s CEO last year. The Chicago-based company announced October 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace John Wojick in early 2017 as chief aeroplane salesman.\nDeal, 52, a deputy of Conner’s, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. Muilenburg had signalled earlier that Boeing would focus on expanding its high-margin services offerings, which range from providing spare parts to round-the-clock maintenance.",

      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons Monday was a busy day at The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Ray Conner is retiring, effective immediately, as CEO of Boeing’s commercial aircraft group, but will retain his role as vice-chairman of the company until December 2017. His successor, Kevin McAllister, was CEO of General Electric Co.’s (NYSE: GE) aviation services group.\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg also appointed company veteran Stan Deal as president and CEO of a new Boeing global services unit. Deal had been president of the company’s commercial aviation services group. The new group incorporates the defense division’s services unit and will total about 20,000 employees and current revenues of $15 to $20 billion.\nBoth appointments were announced after equity markets closed Monday afternoon. Both appointments also place Boeing’s services offerings front and center in Muilenburg’s growth plans for the company.\nMuilenburg has set a goal of tripling Boeing’s services revenues to around $50 billion over the next five years. The thinking is that the company’s services business is where future profitability and sales will come from and McAllister’s hiring, in particular, is significant proof of that. At GE, McAllister ran the aviation group’s services business for the engines that GE supplied to Boeing and other customers. It was a $9 billion business for GE and supported operators of some 34,000 GE commercial engines.\nInitial reaction from analysts was limited, but positive. Leeham News has posted some first reactions from analysts at J.P. Morgan and Canaccord Genuity. Here are some highlights:\nJ.P. Morgan \nCost cutting focus is unlikely to change \nAs an outsider and a product of GE’s lean culture, we assume McAllister will seek out more efficiencies, though we do not see his sole contribution being on the cost side since he once led sales for GE Aviation and we view him as well-prepared for the job overall.\nWe do not see this as a tipping point for narrow-body strategy \nThe head of [Boeing Commercial Aircraft] BCA will play a key role in executing whatever strategy management and the board select but we do not at this time view the leadership change as an indication of product strategy and Conner is expected to remain involved on this issue. Boeing intends to decide over the next several months and management has committed to flat commercial R&D dollars through the end of the decade, or ~$2.6bn, regardless of what development path it pursues.\nNew Global Services segment to launch in 3Q17 \nThe services move is consistent with a renewed Boeing effort to play a larger role in the commercial aftermarket, a change in the business that may—depending on how it is implemented—adversely impact Boeing suppliers that earn high margins on spares and support.\nCanaccord Genuity \nWe believe the appointment of Mr. McAllister is a strong move and will ensure continued customer focus within BCA, something Mr. Conner was known for. We also believe BA will benefit from an external perspective, and Mr. McAllister will bring a unique set of tools and perspective that should be valuable as Boeing looks to execute on its upcoming rate breaks, and drive FCF and margin improvement in the business. …\nWe believe the break-out of the services business, expected in Q3/17 for reporting purposes, will help with the focus on the services business, and is a positive step from a financial reporting perspective. …\n… [W]e believe BA’s commercial services effort has been under-delivering in terms of its potential. We view these moves as positive, as they reflect a change of strategy at Boeing, and a willingness to take a risk in areas where it sees opportunity, but we remain cautious on the stock considering additional production downside risk, and the challenges with hitting the margin and [free cash flow] long-term targets.\nBoeing’s stock traded up about 0.7% Tuesday morning at $148.00 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $150.09. The consensus 12-month target is $151.22.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": " Boeing\nVice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes head Conner plans end-of-2017 retirement\nIndustry veteran McAllister to succeed Conner as Commercial Airplanes CEO\nDeal to serve as president and CEO of new combined services business\nMoves support strategy to strengthen and grow company, Muilenburg says\nCHICAGO , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg today named Kevin G. McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive.\nConner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes.\n\"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\"\nMcAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business.\n\"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.\"\nBoeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.\nDeal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing.\n\"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\"\nDeal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition.\nBoeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas , where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future.\nDeal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today.\nAdditional background for reporters and editors\nA materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh , he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide.\nConner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector.\nCommercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency.\nGlobal Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization. The business is the U.S. Department of Defense's largest performance-based logistics contractor and an industry leader in providing sustainment solutions for Boeing and select non-Boeing platforms.\nContact:\nJohn Dern\nBoeing Communications\nOffice: +1 312-544-2002\njohn.dern@boeing.com\nFollow us on Twitter @Boeing\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-names-new-senior-leaders-launches-integrated-services-business-300366904.html\n ",

Christian Keller/Airbus Helicopters \nCanberra selected the combined Airbus Helicopters, Boeing and Thales team in November 2014 to provide the airframes, flight simulators and synthetic training devices, as well as instruction for army and navy pilots under its Helicopter Aircrew Training System programme. \nInitial flying activities have begun using the H135s at NAS Nowra in New South Wales. \nThe first of the Safran Helicopter Engines Arius 2B2-powered helicopters was delivered in July 2015.

November 22, 2016 03:37   \nNYKÖPING, Sweden- Regulatory News: \nCTT Systems AB (“CTT”) (STO:CTT), the market leader in aircraft humidity control systems, announces a Zonal Drying™ order for 7 Boeing 737NG-800 to be line fitted in new aircraft, with deliveries between March 2017 and July 2017. \nPeter Landquist, VP Sales & Marketing, CTT Systems AB, comments: ‘We are privileged to receive another order from Transavia, a customer valuing the benefits of mastering the root-cause of fuselage condensation from the very first operation. Hereby, the new aircraft will not gain weight from accumulated water/ice accretion (which increase fuel and CO2 burn) and it will not experience moisture problems, such as electrical failures, which increase cost.’ \nThe Zonal Drying™ Anti-Condensation System generates the following advantages: \n· Lower fuel burn and CO2/NOX emissions from excess weight reduction of 200-300kg of accumulated water in B737/A320 aircraft; \n· Higher operational reliability from significantly lower moisture related faults in electrical equipment (reduced Out-Of-Service time). \n· Lower rate of insulation blanket replacement. \nAbout CTT SYSTEMS \nCTT Systems is the market leading provider of humidity control products in aircraft, including anti-condensation systems preventing moisture problems in the aircraft and humidifiers for in-flight comfort and wellbeing for crew and passengers. Our products are offered for retrofit installations and line-fit on A380, A350XWB and Boeing 787. The crew humidifier is standard in all crew rest compartment fitted Boeing 787 aircraft and optional in the crew rest compartment on A380 and A350XWB program. The flight deck humidifier is optional on both the Airbus A350XWB and Boeing 787 aircraft. The Airbus A350XWB is first to offer Cair™ humidification as SFE for First/Business Class (Zone1-3). The Zonal Drying™ anti-condensation system is basic equipment in all Boeing 787 aircraft and optional (as Buyer-Furnished-Equipment) on the Boeing 737NG program. The Zonal Drying™ is basic equipment on all Boeing 787 “Dreamliner” aircraft and the humidifiers are standard in all crew rest compartment fitted Dreamliner aircraft and optional for flight deck. The flight deck humidifier is optional on the A350XWB aircraft, the crew rest compartments humidifiers are optional on both A380/A350XWB and the Zonal Drying™ and Cair™ systems are optional on the A350XWB aircraft.

      "text": "Sina ( SINA ) and Weibo ( WB ) topped forecasts late Monday, while Palo Alto Networks ( PAWN ) and Jack in the Box ( JACK ) gave weak guidance late Monday and Beacon Roofing Supply ( BECN ) missed estimates.\nMeanwhile, Boeing ( BA ) said the head of its commercial aircraft unit, Ray Conner, is stepping down and will be replaced by Kevin McAllister, who arrives at Boeing from GE ( GE ) Aviation.\nPalo Alto Networks Estimates: Analysts see the cybersecurity firm's earnings jumping 51.4% to 53 cents per share with revenue up 34.7% to $400.2 million.\nResults : EPS of 55 cents on revenue of $398 million.\nOutlook : Q2 EPS of 61-63, with the midpoint below consensus of 63 cents, on revenue of $426 million-$432 million, below views for $438 million.\nStock: Shares tumbled 13% after hours on the stock market today . Palo Alto broke out on Thursday past a 163.11 buy point, but pulled back to 161.35 on Friday.\nJack In The Box Estimates : Analysts expect the fast food chain's EPS to rise 42% to 88 cents with sales up 12.6% to $398.71 million.\nResults : EPS of 98 cents on sales of $398.4 million. System-wide same-store sales rose 2% for Jack in the Box and 0.8% for Qdoba.\nOutlook : Fiscal 2017 EPS of $4.55-$4.75, with the midpoint below consensus of $4.75.

      "text": "GE’s Kevin McAllister named president and CEO of Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit Kevin McAllister \nSEATTLE — Boeing named General Electric executive Kevin McAllister as the head of its Commercial Airplanes unit Monday as part of a corporate reorganization that will add a third pillar to its sprawling aerospace business. \nBoeing intends to elevate its airplane services arm to be a major division on the level of its two premier divisions: defense and space, and commercial airplanes. \nThe reorganization was unveiled Monday along with the announcement that chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit, Ray Conner, 61, is leaving the post, effective immediately. Boeing said Conner will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. \nConner will be succeeded by McAllister, 53, who leaves as head of GE’s Aviation services business. \nThe new Boeing Global Services unit will be headed by company veteran Stan Deal, 52, who currently runs Boeing’s commercial aviation services business. \nThe creation of the new dedicated services division has been a longtime ambition for the aerospace giant. Boeing, best known for building jetliners, fighter jets, rockets and satellites, has sought to diversify away from the ups and downs of manufacturing and tap into the steady revenue that comes from servicing aircraft throughout their multi-decade lifetime. \n“Substantial services growth is core to Boeing’s strategy,” said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive. \nSelling services and spare parts to airlines, maintenance shops and governments is an increasingly lucrative business for the company. The company has plotted a steep expansion of its services business aiming to more than triple sales to about $50 billion by 2025, from an estimated $15 billion in 2015, according to Muilenburg. \nBoeing has less than 10% market share in the services operations at both its civil and defense aerospace businesses, providing “ample room to grow,” he said. \nMuilenburg said the new services unit would be up and running in the third quarter of 2017 and based in Dallas. \nBoeing’s push into the spare parts business threatens to further destabilize the business models of many of its own suppliers. Boeing’s own suppliers rely on selling parts at a steep markup to airlines and other buyers to offset the lowest prices that plane makers receive when building airplanes on the assembly line. \nMcAllister inherits a host of challenges at Boeing, including steep production ramp ups of its updated single-aisle 737 Max aircraft and introduction of its long-range 777X jetliner in 2020. McAllister will also helm Boeing as it weighs designing an all-new medium-range aircraft that wouldn’t be ready until around 2025. \nConner, a 39-year Boeing veteran who started as a mechanic building 727s and rose to company vice chairman, will retire at the end of 2017. \nIn a letter to employees, Conner said he would continue to “stay engaged in the ongoing product strategy work that will shape the future of our airplane family.” \nThe Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO role is as much an executive position as it is a U.S. diplomatic role, acting as a highly-visible figure representing the U.S.’s largest exporter at airlines around the globe. The appointment also further cements the relationship between Boeing and GE, which supplies most of its jet engines. Muilenburg’s predecessor, Jim McNerney, came to Boeing from GE and retired in March. \nMcAllister’s appointment as head of Boeing’s commercial business is also a break with tradition. It marks the first time the company has tapped an outsider for that top job. \n“He’s a great partner of Boeing, he knows us well,” said Muilenburg. ",

      "text": "Business News   12:49pm EST Pakistan's PIA considers Boeing, Airbus jets for fleet upgrade Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo By Alexander Cornwell | DUBAI \nDUBAI Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus ( AIR.PA ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday. \n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models. \nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease. \nAhmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added. \nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake. \nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe. \nA meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, \"to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,\" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters. \nThe official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months \"to attain a clean balance sheet,\" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units. \nThe airline would spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses. \nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable. \n(Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad; Editing by Mark Potter and Alexander Smith) Next In Business News Trump's pullout of TPP opens way for China \nTOKYO/SYDNEY An Asia-Pacific trade deal stands almost no chance of working now that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pulled the plug on it, proponents of the pact said on Tuesday, opening the way for China to assume the leadership mantle on trade.

      "text": "Suddenly, Ray Conner is out as president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes . No announcement of a gradual glide path toward retirement. Just an unexpected move by Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Conner is gone, although he will be allowed to remain as vice chairman through the end of next year.\nIs Conner the first major executive casualty of the election of Donald Trump?\nDuring the campaign, Trump warned that Boeing would move American jobs to China. Conner hit back, including during a September interview with me .\n“Trump has made an issue about our involvement with the Chinese assembly center, saying we’ll move all these jobs to China,” he said. He emphatically denied it and also expressed concern over the candidate’s anti-trade rhetoric.\n  Trump said Boeing was “building massive plants in China.” Not true. As for Boeing’s finishing center for airplanes there, Conner said, it is “our largest opportunity for sales, creating an expanded relationship, but it will also create more jobs here. It’s lopsided on what we get and give — we get more. It’s being portrayed as the opposite.”\nRight up to Election Day, few gave Trump a chance of becoming president.\nMuilenburg declined to say if Conner’s departure was connected. But Boeing has enormous stakes riding on a good relationship with the new administration, not only in trying to temper its trade policies but also in keeping and gaining defense contracts. There’s also the behind schedule KC-46 tanker, a program worth $49 billion, as well as a replacement for Air Force One (up to three “presidential ready” 747s). And don’t forget the Ex-Im Bank (criticized by Trump) and Boeing’s deal to sell airliners to Iran, which is controversial with Republicans.\nAs for Kevin McAllister, Conner’s replacement, it’s noteworthy that he comes from General Electric’s unit that supports users of its commercial aircraft engines. With an outsider, Boeing steps further away from its engineering culture based in the Puget Sound. McAllister may be a nice guy and at least he has a degree in materials engineering rather than a finance-focused MBA. But he’s taking over a much larger and more complex organization.\nAnd he comes from the corporation molded by former CEO “Neutron Jack” Welch. The nickname came from the neutron bomb, which did in people but supposedly left most property intact. Welch led GE from 1981 to 2001, through two of the greatest economic expansions in American history. Nevertheless, he whacked nearly 100,000 jobs from the company. Former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was one of his proteges.\nIt may be that McAllister’s appointment and his charge to triple revenue from so-called aftermarket services: spare parts, modifications and flight-data analytics. With orders for airplanes slowing down, this is an important play. What it means for Puget Sound workers…stand by.\nAs for Conner, I’m sure I’m wrong. Boeing would stand behind everything he said. Maybe a bit quieter, though.",

It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added. \nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake. \nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe. \nA meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, \"to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,\" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters. \nThe official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months \"to attain a clean balance sheet,\" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units. \nThe airline would spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses. \nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable. \n(Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad; Editing by Mark Potter and Alexander Smith) Next In Business News OPEC to debate oil output cut next week but Iraq, Iran hesitate \nVIENNA/DUBAI OPEC will debate an oil output cut of 4.0-4.5 percent for all of its members except Libya and Nigeria next week but the deal's success hinges on an agreement from Iraq and Iran, which are far from certain to give full backing. Oil prices turn negative on worries over OPEC output cut \nNEW YORK Oil turned negative in volatile trade on Tuesday on worries Iran and Iraq were not ready to agree on an OPEC output freeze after prices earlier rose to the highest level this month on reports cartel members had overcome their internal disputes. \nNEW YORK Traders bet on Tuesday that an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve next month is a near lock following stronger-than-expected economic data and expectations of big tax cuts and federal spending under the Trump administration.

      "title": "Pakistan's PIA considers Boeing, Airbus jets for fleet upgrade",
      "text": "Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California Thomson Reuters\nBy Alexander Cornwell\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday.\n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models.\nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease.\nAhmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added.\nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake.\nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe.\nA meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, \"to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,\" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters.\nThe official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months \"to attain a clean balance sheet,\" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units.\nThe airline would spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses.\nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable.\n(Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad; Editing by Mark Potter and Alexander Smith)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "This Tree Top Hotel Converted from a Boeing 727 is AWESOME November 22, 2016 by Enoch Leave A Comment \nThere is just something special about being able to stretch out and enjoy a good night’s sleep in an airplane. That’s partially why I enjoy using my miles to fly First Class when I travel internationally. Of course, a great First Class seat still dwarfs specially configured private jets, with full-sized bedrooms and bathrooms, like the Boeing 787 Dream Jet . But what if you can experience most of this, while staying (basically) on the ground? \nHotel Costa Verde in Costa Rica is a tree top hotel that is converted from a Boeing 727. The airplane was originally built in 1965, and had been operated by South African Airways and Avianca Airlines. After its retirement, the airframe was transported from San Jose to the jungles of Manuel Antonio, where the hotel is located. The developers settled the airframe on a pedestal, which is 50 feet above the ground. They also completely renovated the interior of the plane, including the addition of teak paneling from Costa Rica, and furniture from Java, Indonesia. Hotel Costa Verde “727 Fuselage Home” in Costa Rica. Photo courtesy of the hotel. \nThe result is an awesome 2-bedroom suite with a total of 3 queen beds, 2 bathrooms, and a kitchenette. The bedrooms are air-conditioned, and one of the showers actually open to the back of the plane, where the tail used to be! The wings of the plane were creatively transformed into balconies, which boast gorgeous views. The suite also has a skylight, which was converted from the tail-mounted engine. View from one of the balconies. Source: Hotel Costa Verde \nThe rates are actually pretty reasonable, ranging between $260 in “Promo Season” (September – November) to $750 (Easter and Christmas) a night, plus taxes. But this is a one-of-a-kind experience that will make aviation enthusiasts super happy. I definitely hope to check it out if I’m visiting Costa Rica! \nThe hotel was featured on HGTV, and you can check out a walkthrough there. \nWould you stay at this repurposed 727?",

REUTERS/Canadian Forces Combat Camera, DND/Handout \nOTTAWA Canada said on Tuesday it would launch an open competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets and consider buying 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as an interim measure. \nThe fighter jet decision is among one of the most contentious facing the one-year old Liberal government. \nThe previous Conservative government said in 2010 that it would buy Lockheed Martin's F-35s, but during last year's successful election campaign the Liberals promised not to buy the planes on the grounds that they were too expensive. \nThe government said on Tuesday that, with the current fleet of CF-18 jets more than 30 years old, the country is facing a capability gap. In addition to the competition, the government will immediately explore the acquisition of the Super Hornets. \n\"As we promised, our government will be conducting an open and transparent competition to replace the long-serving CF-18 jets,\" said Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote. \nCanada is one of the nine original partner countries that helped fund development of the F-35. \n(Reporting by David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Bernard Orr) Next In World News",

      "text": "Canada to open fighter jet competition, may buy Boeing in meantime Tue Nov 22, 2016 6:35pm GMT \nOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Tuesday it would launch an open competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets and consider buying 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as an interim measure. \nThe fighter jet decision is among one of the most contentious facing the one-year old Liberal government. \nThe previous Conservative government said in 2010 that it would buy Lockheed Martin's F-35s, but during last year's successful election campaign the Liberals promised not to buy the planes on the grounds that they were too expensive. \nThe government said on Tuesday that, with the current fleet of CF-18 jets more than 30 years old, the country is facing a capability gap. In addition to the competition, the government will immediately explore the acquisition of the Super Hornets. \n\"As we promised, our government will be conducting an open and transparent competition to replace the long-serving CF-18 jets,\" said Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote. \nCanada is one of the nine original partner countries that helped fund development of the F-35. \n(Reporting by David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Bernard Orr) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved  ",

      "text": "​Canada pursues interim buy of Boeing Super Hornets ​Canada pursues interim buy of Boeing Super Hornets 22 November, 2016 BY: Leigh Giangreco Washington DC \nThe Canadian government will launch an open competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighter jets and plans to purchase 18 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets as an interim fix for its current capability gap. \nBut defense officials also attempted to placate F-35 prime contractor Lockheed Martin and the US defense industry, with the assurance that Canada will remain a member of the Joint Strike Fighter programme. \nThe 22 November press conference with Minister of National Defence Harjit Singh Sajjan and top Canadian defense officials was marked by politically charged comments blaming the previous conservative government of Stephen Harper for the failure to procure a replacement fleet for the CF-18 fighters. As a result of the drawn-out fighter procurement, Canada cannot meet its combined NORAD and NATO commitment, according to Sajjan. \nIn 2015, the liberal party campaigned on the promise to kill the procurement of 65 Lockheed Martin F-35s and launch an open competition. More recently, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the F-35, saying the jet was “far from working.” \n“Because they were not replaced, we now have a capability gap,” Sajjan says. “It is necessary to deal effectively with the situation this government has inherited.” \nThe full and open competition to replace the CF-18 fleet will begin once Canada’s defense policy review is completed early next year. The competition will take five years and the new fleet will be fully operational in the late 2020s, requiring a further life extension of the current CF-18 fleet along with the interim Super Hornet buy, Minister of Public Services and Procurement Judy Foote says. \nAlthough liberals railed against Lockheed during the campaign, Foote says any contractor who meets the criteria for the replacement fleet will have a shot in the open competition. \nCanada will enter into negotiations over the interim fleet with Boeing immediately, which will include discussions over price and the aircraft’s interoperability with NATO aircraft. Foote adds the government has a sense of the cost, but did not elaborate on a specific price for the 18 Super Hornets. Boeing deferred a request on cost to the Canadian government. \nWhen asked whether Canada’s move to sole source 18 Super Hornets from Boeing was also a highly political decision, defense officials responded Canada required a fully developed and interoperable aircraft. Based on analysis, the government is confident the Super Hornet meets both those requirements, Sajjan says. Foote also noted because the current fighter procurement involves American aircraft, the government is looking at a US jet for the interim requirement. \n“I think it’s important we respond to the needs right now,” Foote says. “We’re not stacking the deck in favor of Boeing any more than we’re in favor of Lockheed by staying in the fighter programme.” \nWhether Canada will eventually operate a mixed fleet of Super Hornets and next-generation fighters is to be determined. Sajjan did not directly address where the 18 Super Hornets would go once a new fleet is procured. \n“Hard to predict,” he says. “But there’s a need to fill this gap and an interim fleet is required. All of this will be taken into account down the road and the decision will be made at that time.” Advertising",

      "text": "DUBAI –   Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday. \n \n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models. \nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease. \nAhmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added. \nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake. \nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe. \n ",

      "title": "Boeing taps GE veteran for jet unit as CEO extends shake-up",
      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric 's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nA trip back in time, from the newest Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental to the original 747.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nJoe Sutter, father of Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, dies at 95 Julie Johnsson Joe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\nJoe Sutter, the Boeing engineer who ushered in the modern era of long-range travel by spearheading the 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, has died. He was 95.\n\"Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration - not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry,\" Ray Conner, chief...\n(Julie Johnsson) McAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nBoeing's 747 jumbo snags a $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso Boeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,...\n(Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) McAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.",

      "text": "Canada Taps Boeing''s Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul -- Update November 22, 2016, 03:08:  Canada Taps Boeing's Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul -- Update By Paul Vieira and Doug Cameron \nOTTAWA -- Canada plans to launch talks with Boeing Co. to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft as an interim measure in a planned overhaul of the country's legacy CF-18 fighter jet fleet, the minister in charge of defense said Tuesday. \nThe Liberal government also will launch a competitive process to replace the aging CF-18 program, Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference. \nHe added that the Liberal government, which came to power just over a year ago, inherited a fighter-jet fleet that was unable to meet its commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, and North American defense. An interim fleet provides the most effective way to help Canada to meet its obligations, he said. \nCanada's former Conservative government dropped plans almost four years ago to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets after political controversy about a lack of transparency over acquisition costs. However, the F-35 will be allowed to compete in the contest for more planes, expected to be launched early next year. \nCanada's plan to start talks about an interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet jets is the second boost to extending the life of Boeing's combat-jet production lines after the U.S. State Department last week approved of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth up to $31.2 billion combined. Canadian officials declined to provide an estimated cost for acquiring the Boeing aircraft. \n\"Boeing is honored to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force with the only multi-role fighter aircraft that can fulfill its immediate needs for sovereign and North American defense,\" the plane maker said in a statement. \nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It also is trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy. \nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. \nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar still could split any purchase between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet. \nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India in a proposed deal that could require it to build the planes there. \nThe planned Boeing purchase is a blow to Lockheed Martin, which had originally planned to sell its F-35 jets to Canada. Lockheed said Tuesday that the plane was combat-ready and available today. \n\"Although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesman said in a statement. \nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his election campaign that the Lockheed Martin F-35 was unnecessary for Canada's needs and too expensive. \nCanada's plan to hold a transparent bidding process for fighter jets is likely to include the F-35 as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Aviation SA Rafale, and the Saab AB Gripen. The bidding process could take five years, Canadian officials said Tuesday. \nMr. Sajjan said a range of measures will be implemented to extend the service of the current CF-18 fleet, including recruitment and training to address understaffing issues and an enhanced maintenance program. \nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com (END)  161508ET  ",

      "text": "Pakistan's PIA considers Boeing, Airbus jets for fleet upgrade Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California. Photo: Reuters   \nDUBAI - Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N> jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday. \n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models. \nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease. \nAhmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added. \nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake. \nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe. \nA meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, \"to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,\" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters. \nThe official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months \"to attain a clean balance sheet,\" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units. \nThe airline would spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses. \nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable. REUTERS",

      "text": "Canada may buy 18 Boeing jets on interim basis By ROB GILLIES The Associated Press First Published 1 hour ago • Updated 1 hour ago Share This Article Toronto • Canada's defense minister said Tuesday the country will enter into discussions with the United States and Boeing to buy 18 Super Hornet jet fighters on an interim basis and will hold an open competition to buy more planes over the next five years. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said Tuesday they need an interim fleet to replace Canada's aging fleet of CF-18s. Sajjan said Canada remains part of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The government previously said it would honor its campaign pledge not to buy the next generation F-35 fighter from Lockheed Martin's troubled program. Canada had previously talked about buying 65 jets from the program, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he wants a cheaper option. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, aiming to replace a wide range of existing aircraft for the U.S. and several partner countries. Judy Foote, Canada's Minister of Public Services and Procurement, said they have a sense of what the cost will be for the 18 Super Hornets, but won't know for sure until negotiations. Foote said the duration of the open competition for the remaining planes will take five years. The government said the interim addition of 18 Super Hornets is needed to meet its NATO and North American defense obligations. The current fleet of planes is 77, down from 138. \"We have a capability gap,\" Sajjan said. Australia bought 24 Super Hornet fighters to replace antiquated F-111 jets until newer F-35s were ready. Denmark recently announced it would buy 27 F-35 jets, which are equipped with radar-evading technology. If approved by the Parliament, Denmark would be become the 11th NATO country to buy the jet. The United States plans to spend close to $400 billion to buy nearly 2,500 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.",

      "text": "Canada Taps Boeing''s Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul November 22, 2016, 02:15:  Canada Taps Boeing's Super Hornets in Fleet Overhaul \nOTTAWA—Canada plans to launch talks with Boeing Co. to buy 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft as an interim measure in a planned overhaul of the country's legacy CF-18 fighter jet fleet, the minister in charge of defense said Tuesday. \nThe Liberal government also will launch a competitive process to replace the aging CF-18 program, Minister Harjit Sajjan said at a news conference. \n\"We need to move on this as quickly as possible,\" said Mr. Sajjan, a retired lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian forces. \"A modern fighter fleet is an essential tool for defending Canada and exercising Canadian sovereignty—especially in the northern skies.\" \nCanada's former Conservative government dropped plans almost four years ago to buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 fighter jets after political controversy about a lack of transparency over acquisition costs. However, the F-35 will be allowed to compete in the contest for more planes, expected to be launched early next year. \nCanada's plan to start talks about an interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornet jets is the second boost to extending the life of Boeing's combat-jet production lines after the U.S. State Department last week approved of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth up to $31.2 billion combined. Canadian officials declined to provide an estimated cost for acquiring the Boeing aircraft. \n\"Boeing is honored to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force with the only multi-role fighter aircraft that can fulfill its immediate needs for sovereign and North American defense,\" the plane maker said in a statement. \nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It also is trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy. \nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Eurofighter Typhoon jets. \nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar still could split any purchase between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet. \nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India in a proposed deal that could require it to build the planes there. \nThe planned Boeing purchase is a blow to Lockheed Martin, which had originally planned to sell its F-35 jets to Canada. Lockheed said Tuesday that the plane was combat-ready and available today. \n\"Although disappointed with this decision, we remain confident the F-35 is the best solution to meet Canada's operational requirements at the most affordable price,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesman said in a statement. \nLiberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during his election campaign that the Lockheed Martin F-35 was unnecessary for Canada's needs and too expensive. \nCanada's plan to hold a transparent bidding process for fighter jets is likely to include the F-35 as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon, the Dassault Aviation SA Rafale, and the Saab AB Gripen. The bidding process could take five years, Canadian officials said Tuesday. \nMr. Sajjan said a range of measures will be implemented to extend the service of the current CF-18 fleet, including recruitment and training to address understaffing issues and an enhanced maintenance program. \nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  161415ET  ",

      "text": "Boeing is turning to an outsider for the first time to head the commercial airplanes division, replacing Ray Conner with Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's aviation business.\nMcAllister, 53, the former chief executive officer of GE Aviation Services, assumed the leadership of Boeing's largest business on Monday, according to a statement by the planemaker. Conner, 61, will stay on as vice chairman through 2017.\nThe company also promoted Stan Deal to the role of president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, creating a third division that combines customer-service groups within the commercial airplane and defense units. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sees the potential to build a $50 billion business by bolstering service offerings, from providing spare parts to conducting round-the-clock maintenance.\n\"We've always said that growing services was a key part of our strategy,\" Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Monday. The latest leadership changes underscore that \"actions follow words,\" he said.\nMuilenburg, who took over last year, has made a series of management shifts that place the company's largest businesses under executives with backgrounds in services.\nThe latest move reshapes the manufacturer's largest business with new leadership amid a turbulent market for commercial aircraft. The Chicago-based company announced Oct. 14 that Ihssane Mounir would replace the retiring John Wojick, a key Conner deputy, early next year as chief airplane salesman.\nWith McAllister, Boeing gains an executive with deep ties to airlines worldwide, including some who are exclusively Airbus Group SE customers, and a reputation for using data to analyze airlines' wants and needs. He'd been viewed as a potential successor to David Joyce, who heads GE Aviation and is a vice chairman, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE.\nMcAllister has been GE's \"face\" to all of its airline customers for 15 years, first leading the sales team and more recently as the head of the unit selling long-term service contracts and spare parts. The business is a major source of profit for GE, accumulating a backlog of services worth more than $120 billion, Kennedy said.\nMcAllister is a \"very solid guy with a great background in aviation,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \"He's a big customer and part of their biggest industrial partner company, too. That's a unique combination.\"\nA materials engineer by training and University of Pittsburgh graduate, McAllister will be the first outsider to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes since the unit was formed in 1965. The company selected McAllister after considering a mix of external and internal candidates to succeed Conner.\nMcAllister has worked closely with Boeing over the years, Muilenburg said. \"I'm not sure I'd call him an outsider,\" the CEO said. \"He's been very, very close to us for a couple of decades.\"\nWhile McAllister masters the nuances of Boeing's culture and works to earn the respect of its factory workers and engineers, he also will face crucial product-strategy decisions. Perhaps the most critical is the call expected next year on Boeing's first all-new airplane since the 787 Dreamliner: a new plane family aimed at the market gap between Boeing's largest single-aisle and smallest twin-aisle jetliners.\nThrough his role at GE, McAllister \"saw both the challenges and failures of the 787,\" Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said by phone. \"So, he knows how hard it is to run an airplane company. He saw how hard it was to launch a new engine.\"\nMcAllister also will be under pressure to bolster margins as the planemaker slows production of the 777, its second-largest source of profit. He may also have to navigate potential fall-out from the economic penalties President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose on China, Boeing's largest overseas market.\nConner has served as corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of commercial airplanes since 2012. A 39-year Boeing veteran, he led the division during an era of historic jetliner sales, then warned workers that tougher times and cost reductions lay ahead. During his watch, record output at Boeing's factories boosted the segment's revenue to $66 billion, up 34 percent from 2012.\nHe is a throwback, known for close ties forged with customers as the planemaker's former sales chief. A native of Burien, Washington, a working-class suburb south of Seattle, Conner joined his father and brother at Boeing in 1977, landing a job as a mechanic building 727 jetliners.\nConner will help smooth the transition to a new generation of leaders, Muilenburg said, while helping Deal knit together the government and commercial services businesses. Conner will also stay \"engaged in our product development activities, including the production transformation under way,\" Muilenburg said.\nDeal, 52, who was rumored to be an heir to Conner, had served as senior vice-president of Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business since 2014. His new business will have about 20,000 employees and will maintain a headquarters staff of a \"couple dozen\" in Dallas.\nThe lines between Deal's new unit and Boeing airplane and defense divisions will be blurry in places, with some customer-facing groups staying in place inside the current business units.\nDeal's current operation has more than 12,000 employees and provides airlines and leasing companies with wide ranging support services, from maintenance training to digital crew scheduling. Another 13,000 employees support military and government customers worldwide.\n ",

      "text": "By Alexander Cornwell\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is evaluating an order for wide-body Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N> jets as it looks to upgrade its ageing fleet, an executive for the state-owned airline said on Tuesday.\n\"Boeing 777X would be a good option,\" the airline's executive director of human resources and works, Raheel Ahmed, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, adding that PIA is also looking at the Airbus A330 and A350 models.\nPIA would consider purchasing the aircraft directly from the manufacturer and financing the order through a sale and leaseback arrangement, when an airline sells a jet to a lessor who then leases it back. It would also consider a direct leasing agreement, known as a dry lease.\nAhmed did not say when PIA would order the jets or how many it could buy. It has a fleet of 38 narrow-body and wide-body Airbus and Boeing jets, with three A310s to be retired on Dec. 31, he added.\nAhmed also said PIA would cut its 18,000 workforce by between 3,000 and 3,500 employees by the end of 2017 as the Pakistan government looks to turn around the loss-making airline and sell-off a 49 percent stake.\nHowever, PIA later said Ahmed's figures were incorrect, and no decision had as yet been taken on how many jobs would be cut or over what timeframe.\nA meeting between Pakistan's Privatization Commission and PIA top management was also held on Tuesday, \"to determine the best suitable restructuring model to make PIA into a viable entity,\" a senior government official who attended the meeting told Reuters.\nThe official said restructuring would be done in two phases, carving out non-essential units within three to six months \"to attain a clean balance sheet,\" followed by the gradual carving out of other business units.\nThe airline would spin-off four \"special business units\" from January 2017, starting with its catering business and later its flight training, engineering and courier businesses.\nThe units are planned to operate independently of PIA with their own general managers and marketing teams. PIA would later look to sell a stake in the units if they are profitable.\n(Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad; Editing by Mark Potter and Alexander Smith)",
