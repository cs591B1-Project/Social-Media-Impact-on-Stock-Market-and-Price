Related Stories Ford open to deals with Trump to keep jobs in U.S., Fields says \nFord Motor Co. plans to lobby President-elect Donald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules that hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand. \n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said in an interview Friday. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nIt is not a formula for success, he said. “At the end of the day, you’ve got to have customers, so obviously, there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market,” he said. \nIn 2011 -- when Ford and other automakers agreed with President Barack Obama to double average fuel economy that’s now projected at 50.8 miles per gallon by 2025 and to work with California to sell more zero-emission cars -- the companies counted on a mid-term review starting this year to see if the rules were working out as planned. \nBut the EPA made a preliminary determination Wednesday that there’s no need to change the 2025 targets. In Friday’s interview, Fields warned that the agency’s action will disrupt the planned mid-term review. \n‘Eleventh-hour politics’ \n“What happened was through eleventh-hour politics, it short-circuited a data-driven development of regulations,” he said. \nFields said Ford would now turn to Trump to continue the dialog as planned. For instance, the auto industry may seek clean-air credits for self-driving cars, which could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by helping traffic move more smoothly. \nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Fields said Ford has made no change in its plan to invest an additional $4.5 billion in electrified vehicles by 2020, and to install the technology in 40 percent of its nameplates. \nFord wants to continue to help boost fuel economy and lessen the industry’s environmental impact, because the company acknowledges climate change as a serious threat, Fields said.",

      "text": "December Editor's Picks 1 of 12 \n\"T om Ford's new shade 'Jack' from the Lips & Boys collection is the perfect color to wear light during the day and apply heavier for evening.\" \n— Rachel Zoe, Editor in Chief Email 2 of 12 \"An oldie but goodie, the Bioré nose strip will always be an integral part of my skincare routine. There's something so satisfying (and disgusting, in the best way) about seeing all the gunk extracted from your pores. Just me?\" — Stephanie Montes, Senior Beauty Editor Email 3 of 12 \n\" I wouldn't exactly call myself a contour enthusiast in the Kardashian sense, but I'm a proponent of light sculpting (subtly playing up highlights and shadows can do really good things for a face). This MAC two-in-one stick takes most of the guesswork out of the process—the tawny hue is the perfect shade to add natural but impactful color to the forehead, jawline, eyelids and under the cheekbones, and the pearly highlighter adds a dewy glow to the high points of the face. The formula is super blendable, which is a huge plus. Dare I say I'm a contour convert!\" — Kristi Mikesky, Managing Editor Email 4 of 12 \"My skin has been breaking out lately (thanks to holiday food indulgences) so I've been religiously applying this clarifying oil to combat blemishes. A face oil might seem questionable on acne-prone skin, but this formula specifically treats pimples and clears congested pores. It doesn't feel harsh like most acne treatments and helps reduce the size and redness of pesky zits.\" — Amy Lee, Associate Fashion Editor Email 5 of 12 \"I recently got extensions to achieve the ultra-long, straight hair look seen on Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez lately. This flat iron is perfect for any texture, and it converts my naturally curly roots to pin-straight strands.\" — Andrea Navarro, Associate Beauty Editor Email 6 of 12 \"I've been using this Laura Mercier concealer nonstop ! It's super light, easy to apply and has amazing coverage—in other words, great for getting rid of dark circles.\" — Leah Benzie, Social Media Editor Email 7 of 12 \n\" I'm slathering on MAC's new strobe light moisturizer in Silverlite (a new color based on the beloved original Pinklite). It contains botanicals, vitamins and green tea—plus it's super hydrating—so it works wonders on my tired, dull winter skin.\" \n— Nicky Deam, Editorial Director Email 8 of 12 \n\" This serum always makes my skin look more awake and refreshed. It also helps impart the dewy look I love.\" \n— Alyson Fishbein, Senior Social Media Manager Email 9 of 12 \"Recently I was lucky enough to have my color done by hair god George Papanikolas, who introduced me to the new line of Biolage R.A.W. products. This clay mask totally rehydrated my strands after the color process, leaving them super soft and silky.\" — Laura Lajiness, Fashion Editor Email 10 of 12 \n\" I figured the temperature drop this season would mean less time blotting my face, but alas, one can only dream. Fortunately a half pump of this cult-favorite mattifying toner helps me achieve peak-moisture status without looking like a freshly Zambonied ice rink.\" \n— Samantha McDonald, News Editor Email 11 of 12 \"Once I turned 30, my skin totally dried out. This product is uber-moisturizing via a signature ingredient that delivers 25% more essential fatty acids than shea butter. Plus, the Ugandan women employed to produce it are paid three times the living wage for their work, which makes me feel good about indulging in it.\" — Erin Nicole, Lifestyle Editor ",

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) \nDETROIT (AP) – Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Share this: ",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

      "text": "10 hrs ago John J. Watkins, The Times \nA Ford Explorer under production at the Chicago Assembly Plant. Explorer sales rose in November for the first time in six months. \nFord Explorer sales had fallen for six straight months until the locally made sport utility vehicle finally rebounded in November. \nLast month, Ford sold 17,245 units of the SUV made at the Chicago Assembly Plant in Hegewisch, up from 15,141 in November 2015. That's a 13.9 percent year-over-year jump and the first since April for the vehicle. \nFord's overall U.S. sales rose 5 percent to 197,574 vehicles in November. It was a particularly good month for SUVs, which saw a 20 percent increase to 60,079. \n“Strong retail sales increases for both F-150 and our all-new Super Duty pickups drove F-Series above the 70,000 vehicle mark – a November threshold we have not seen in 15 years,” said Mark LaNeve, vice president, U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service. “Plus, strong consumer demand for well-equipped Super Duties helped boost Ford’s overall average transaction prices in November, which are up $1,000 versus a year ago – well ahead of the industry average of $32,000.”   \nFord's Chicago Assembly plant and its network of just-in-time suppliers in the Calumet Region make the Explorer; the Police Interceptor Utility, which is a souped-up version of the Explorer; the Taurus; and the Police Interceptor Sedan, which is a steroidal variant of the Taurus. \nExplorer sales have declined 4 percent so far this year to 197,264 units through the end of November. Police Interceptor Utility Units shot up 53.8 percent in November, and are up 32.6 percent so far this year. \nTaurus sales fell 22.5 percent in November to 1,926 units, and are down 12.9 percent so far this year. Police Interceptor Sedan sales soared by 20.8 percent last month but are down 2.1 percent through the first 11 months of the year.",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Don Buciak II \nDecember 2, 2016 9:56 am EST By Ashlee Kieler @akieler not holding you back recall ford national highway traffic safety administration Seatbelts fusion lincoln \nSeatbelts, they can save lives in the event of a crash. However, in order for that to be a possibility, the devices have to actually work, and that apparently isn’t a certainty in more than 680,000 vehicles being recalled by Ford. \nThe carmaker announced Friday that it would recall 680,872 vehicles — of which 602,729 are located in the U.S. — after determining that the front driver and passenger seatbelts may not function properly. \nThe recalled vehicles — which include model year 2013 to 2016 Fusion, 2015 to 2016 Mondeo, and 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MXZ vehicles — may be equipped with a seatbelt anchor that could prevent the occupant from being restrained in the event of a crash. \nTypically, a pretensioner tightens the seatbelt in the event of a crash, securing the passenger or driver from moving forward in their seats. Ford says this isn’t occurring in some of the recalled vehicles. \nInstead, according to Ford, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seatbelt anchor pretensioner could cause the device cables to separate. If this occurs during a crash, passengers and drivers may not be properly restrained, increasing the risk of injury. \nSo far, the carmaker says it is aware of two incidents and two injuries associated with the issue. \nFord says that to fix the issue, it will instruct dealers to inject a conformal coating into the front driver and passenger seatbelt anchor pretensioner to protect the cables from increased temperatures generated during deployment at no cost to the customer. \nIn a separate campaign on Friday, Ford said it would recall 27 model year 2017 Ford Fusion vehicles to replace the second-row left-rear seat back frame, which may have been built with improperly welded pivot pins. \nIn the affected vehicles, the seat backs with pivot pins that were improperly welded may not adequately retain cargo in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.

The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies will face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to move production of the Focus small car from a Michigan factory to a facility in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's margins increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan under way. He added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever.\"\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\"\nMr. Trump has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 16:41 ET (21:41 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 2nd Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 17:20 ET (22:20 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 4th Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 17:48 ET (22:48 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged that companies will face \"consequences\" for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to move production of the Focus small car from a Michigan factory to a facility in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars with profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming, amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers will keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's margins increase.\nMORE TO COME\n 02, 2016 16:28 ET (21:28 ",

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on Jan 18th, 2011 Share \nI had always assumed that the Fordillacs of hot rodding lore were all built with Cadillac’s groundbreaking OHV V-8 engine, not the Cadillac flathead V-8 engine, which is what appears in this 1949 Ford for sale on Hemmings.com. Then again, it’s not as if Frick and his partners built these as production-line automobiles; they were building custom cars however their customers wanted. Still, this one appears to be much more radical than any typical Fordillac we’ve come across. From the seller’s description: \nThis is a custom-bodied 1949 Ford with flathead Cadillac engine and accessories. The hood, front fenders and cowl have been brought back some 19 inches, there is no back seat, yet the car remains the same length as a standard 49 Ford. Thought to be built by Bill Frick and Alfred Momo, this car was constructed to satisfy the racing specifications of Mr. Thomas Campbell and an Argentine race driver, Ralph Onunyzia. The car is equipped with Stewart Warner gauges, and Edmunds intake. Mr. Campbell bought out his partner around 1952 and moved the car to his estate, “Louis Mountain,” in Charlottesville Virginia, where the car was seldom driven. Mr. Campbell’s widow, Julia, eventually sold the car in 1973 to The Vintage Car Store in Nyack, NY, where it underwent a partial restoration and color change. \nThe car eventually found its way to Tampa, Florida, by way of a Rolls-Royce dealership in St. Louis, where it has been garaged for the last 35-plus years. In all this time, it has accumulated less than 9,000 original miles.",

      "title": "CEO Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico",
      "text": "Ford Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products—zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "Buy Now Photos by Ford \nThe 2017 Ford Fusion Sport has an active damping system borrowed from Lincoln for tight handling. It dips in and out of corners more like a low-slung hatchback than a family sedan. Buy Now Ford \nThe 2017 Ford Fusion Sport can hit 60 mph in an estimated 5.3 seconds, according to Car and Driver. (Ford) Ford \nThe turbocharged V-6 EcoBoost engine is lifted from the Ford Edge Sport and Ford F-150 pickup. \nFord is injecting performance into the fading midsize segment with the 2017 Fusion Sport. With the revival of sports cars, and the rash of performance crossovers, the time is right to bring back the Fusion Sport for the first time since 2010. \nCarving out a more distinct look than the refreshed Fusion, the Fusion Sport gets sharp LED headlights, a unique black mesh grille, standard 19-inch dark wheels, a rear spoiler and quad tip dual exhaust. \nFord is going for subtlety with the Sport. It’s perfectly reserved for Sunday family drives or for PTA pickups, but once removed from watchful eyes it can open up a pleasing can of whoop eye. \nThe turbocharged V-6 EcoBoost engine is lifted from the Ford Edge Sport and Ford F-150 pickup and dropped in here to make 325 horsepower and a boastful 380 pound-feet of torque (with 93 octane gas) driving all the wheels. Its heavy weight of just under 4,000 pounds and less direct feel keeps it from topping the Germans but that’s not quite the point. \nIt’s one of the most powerful and well-equipped midsize sedans under $40,000, making it competitive if not better than the Mazda6 Grand Touring or the Nissan Maxima SR. (The new Maxima is closer in size to the midsize Altima than the full-size sedans with which it is historically compared.) \nIt’s a car that can do double duty as the daily driver or family hauler while providing enough performance to stop that jones for the impractical sports car. It’s a compromise semi-enthusiasts will be happy to make, and still hit 60 mph in an estimated 5.3 seconds, according to Car and Driver. \nSport mode is accessed with a button on the gear knob in the center console, which is otherwise empty, compelling the driver to push it. Once pressed, the shift points are delayed to let the V-6 rev higher, more engine purr is piped into the cabin and the pedal is more responsive, providing plenty of boost with little lag thanks to the twin turbo. It adds zing to the daily commute, and is dangerously tempting on winding single-lane country roads. \nAll of this power taxes fuel economy, but that’s why there’s a hybrid. \nThe handling is tight thanks to what Ford says is the only car in the segment with an active damping system, borrowed from Lincoln. It mitigates body roll so you don’t slide into the door or center console when aggressively hitting the on-ramp. It also dips in and out of corners more like a low-slung hatchback than a family sedan. And for highway cruising, the car is remarkably soft, smooth and quiet. It’s a car I wanted to drive, and made the forced train commute feel less like an opportunity to catch up on work and more like being withheld from the privilege of driving. \nThe six-speed transmission is supplemented with diminutive paddle shifters, though neither impressed. I defaulted to automatic; it felt less forced. \nThe interior gets some tweaks, including a black headliner, and some carbon fiber dash accents that are easy to overlook. The black leather and chrome combination of the Titanium trim might look better. The Miko gray suede seats were a curiosity; the kids loved the feel in the spacious back seats, and they were plenty comfortable up front. Without a flat-bottom sport steering wheel, or more heavily bolstered seats, it’s easy to be lulled into a more comfort-oriented ride. That’s not a bad thing for a midsize sedan, but may leave something to be desired if “sport” is the default instead of operative adjective. \nFord’s suite of available technology options, including self-parking ($995), the excellent adaptive cruise, which adjusts the speed to maintain the gap of the lead car ($1,190), and the beep ding yellow red alerts of the Driver Assist package ($1,625), all make for a safer, easier driving experience once acclimated to all of their capabilities. \nI was critical of Sync3 in the Ford Escape, largely due to the narrow shelf under the screen that makes a nuisance out of pressing icons, but the flat interface on the center stack in this iteration makes it easy to use. At a glance \n2017 Ford Fusion V6 Sport \nVehicle type: midsize sportish sedan \nBase price: $33,475 \nAs tested: $40,080 (excluding $875 delivery) \nMpg: 17 city, 26 highway \nEngine: 2.7-liter turbo V-6 \nTransmission: 6-speed auto to AWD \nParting shot: Get out of work/school, get on with life/fun faster, better, more More information ",

      "text": "The Dow retreated from records as banks reversed course after days of big gains. Dow components Goldman Sachs   ( GS ) and JPMorgan   ( JPM ) ended the day lower alongside fellow banks Citigroup ( C ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) . Crude oil ended with a weekly gain of 12% thanks to the OPEC deal secured earlier in the week. In domestic news, the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. rose by 3 to 477. And Ford   ( F ) fell after announcing a recall of 680,000 vehicles to correct a seatbelt issue. The bulk of the recall will affect vehicles sold in the U.S., including the Ford Fusion. Big Lots ( BIG ) was active after raising its anticipated full-year earnings forecast. The discount retailer kept its same-store sales target of 1% to 2% growth unchanged.

      "text": "DETROIT — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.\nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars.\nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

It plans to have 7,000 bikes in SF by the end of 2018. Users will also be able to rent their bike on the FordPass platform, launching next year.\nThe post Ford will test driverless cars in Europe next year appeared first on ReadWrite .\n",

      "text": "Ford recalls 680,000 cars; seat belts may not hold in crash 2016-12-02T17:35:55Z (Source: AP Images) DETROIT, MI (AP) - \nFord is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

An article that John Heitmann pointed out this week explores the reasons and the theories behind the phenomenon . \n* Finally, one of the world’s oldest four-wheel-drive compact vehicles, the Kurogane Type 95 “Yonki”– older than the Bantam Reconnaissance Car and the Willys Quad – was recently restored for museum display in Japan. JNC has more on the car’s history and restoration.",

      "text": "Ford Recalls 680,000 Cars Over Front Seat Belt Safety Posted: Connect DETROIT, Michigan - \nFord is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord Recalls \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two crashes and two injuries related to the problem, according to the Detroit News. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

      "text": "print \nFord CEO Mark Fields Ford \nThe year 2010 seems like a long time ago. That was when a bold future for electric cars appeared to be opening. \nTesla was about to roll out its first original design for an EV, the Model S, which would go on to be named Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2013. \nThere's were numerous electric-car startups aiming to join Tesla, and the major automakers were producing their first EVs since GM had killed it EV-1 in the 1990s. \nSince then, the promise of an electric-car revolution hasn't just failed to materialize — it's actually retreated. \nThe reason is simple: consumers don't want electric cars. It's the D-word — demand. And demand isn't there. \nThis market reality has collided head-on with an increase in federal fuel-economy standards, mandated by the EPA. Automakers want the government to ease up on the timetable, so that they can sell as many profitable pickup trucks and SUV in the US as possible, while sales are running at historically record levels and gas is cheap. \nThis is purely good business — carmakers want to bolster their balance sheets now, while the bolstering opportunity is good, ahead of the inevitable downturn. Trump to the rescue? \nAuto industry leaders are now seizing a chance to get President-elect Donald Trump's administration to give them a break, while at the same time not completely backing off the EV aspects of their product portfolios. \nHere's Bloomberg's John Lippert and Jamie Butters : \nFord Motor Co. plans to lobby President- elect Donald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules that hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand. “In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Mark Fields, chief executive officer of Ford, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Southfield, Michigan, office Friday . “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nFields is as committed as anyone to making sure that Ford is part of whatever revolution in transportation occurs in the coming decades, but he doesn't have the luxury of being a starry-eyed visionary. His job is to make sure that Ford is profitable, that it's balance sheet is strong, that it maintains or grows market share in critical parts of the world, and that it doesn't fall behind on innovation, in all areas of the business. \nAn electric Ford Focus. Ford \nIf you look at the simple math that Fields presented, it's not hard to see why he wants the EPA's expectations to be adjusted. There's been a more-than-fourfold increase in the number of EVs for sale in US, and yet the market for those EVs has grown by a negligible 0.5%. Compliance for its own sake \nThe billions being spent to develop and market EVs aren't being completely incinerated — these customer-less cars have value as \"compliance\" vehicles to meet government regulations. But building more of them for that goal is now officially running counter to the financial interests of the automakers. \nThis isn't a sustainable situation. Almost all of the planet's vehicles currently run on gas or diesel. That's unlikely to change for decades. Everybody knows that it would be good for the environment to get more gas and diesel cars off he road, but there has to be some kind of business value that the replacement electric vehicles provide. \nUntil consumer and carmakers can figure out how to make that happen, the automakers' case to have the government back off its fuel-economy requirements will be strong.

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:00 am Share \nAs he has for the last several years, artist Stefan Marjoram has taken on an auto advent calendar project , with a new piece of art each day until Christmas. \n* New Fiesta coming, so Adrian Flux’s Influx recently took a look at some of the more unusual variants of the Fiesta that Ford has created over the last few decades, including the Ghia-designed Tuareg of 1978. \n* On this week’s anniversary of Ford’s assembly line, Smithsonian took a look at the impact the innovation had on Ford’s workers , most of whom detested the demands it put upon them, both at the factory and away from it. \n* How did the auto industry start introducing new model year cars in the fall of the previous year? An article that John Heitmann pointed out this week explores the reasons and the theories behind the phenomenon . \n* Finally, one of the world’s oldest four-wheel-drive compact vehicles, the Kurogane Type 95 “Yonki”– older than the Bantam Reconnaissance Car and the Willys Quad – was recently restored for museum display in Japan. JNC has more on the car’s history and restoration.",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - This Feb. 11, 2016, file photo shows the Ford logo on display at the Pittsburgh International Auto Show in Pittsburgh. Ford is adding about 1.5 million cars, SUVs and vans to a recall for doors that can pop open while the vehicles are moving. The company says it's adding the vehicles at the request of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nDETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \n© 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "(Ford CEO Mark FieldsFord) \nThe year 2010 seems like a long time ago. That was when a bold future for electric cars appeared to be opening. \nTesla was about to roll out its first original design for an EV, the Model S, which would go on to be named Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2013.\nThere's were numerous electric-car startups aiming to join Tesla, and the major automakers were producing their first EVs since GM had killed it EV-1 in the 1990s. \nSince then, the promise of an electric-car revolution hasn't just failed to materialize — it's actually retreated. \nThe reason is simple: consumers don't want electric cars. It's the D-word — demand. And demand isn't there. \nThis market reality has collided head-on with an increase in federal fuel-economy standards, mandated by the EPA. Automakers want the government to ease up on the timetable, so that they can sell as many profitable pickup trucks and SUV in the US as possible, while sales are running at historically record levels and gas is cheap.\nThis is purely good business — carmakers want to bolster their balance sheets now, while the bolstering opportunity is good, ahead of the inevitable downturn.\nTrump to the rescue? Auto industry leaders are now seizing a chance to get President-elect Donald Trump's administration to give them a break, while at the same time not completely backing off the EV aspects of their product portfolios.\nHere's Bloomberg's John Lippert and Jamie Butters : \nFord Motor Co. plans to lobby President- elect Donald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules that hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand. “In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Mark Fields, chief executive officer of Ford, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Southfield, Michigan, office Friday . “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nFields is as committed as anyone to making sure that Ford is part of whatever revolution in transportation occurs in the coming decades, but he doesn't have the luxury of being a starry-eyed visionary. His job is to make sure that Ford is profitable, that it's balance sheet is strong, that it maintains or grows market share in critical parts of the world, and that it doesn't fall behind on innovation, in all areas of the business. \n(An electric Ford Focus.Ford) \n\nIf you look at the simple math that Fields presented, it's not hard to see why he wants the EPA's expectations to be adjusted. There's been a more-than-fourfold increase in the number of EVs for sale in US, and yet the market for those EVs has grown by a negligible 0.5%. \nCompliance for its own sake The billions being spent to develop and market EVs aren't being completely incinerated — these customer-less cars have value as \"compliance\" vehicles to meet government regulations. But building more of them for that goal is now officially running counter to the financial interests of the automakers. \nThis isn't a sustainable situation. Almost all of the planet's vehicles currently run on gas or diesel. That's unlikely to change for decades. Everybody knows that it would be good for the environment to get more gas and diesel cars off he road, but there has to be some kind of business value that the replacement electric vehicles provide. \nUntil consumer and carmakers can figure out how to make that happen, the automakers' case to have the government back off its fuel-economy requirements will be strong. \nNOW WATCH: Trump said he prevented a Ford factory from leaving the US — but the company says the move was never planned \n\n  \nAutomakers could be making a big mistake with their big bets on electric cars \nHere's a great all-in-one Martini recipe for the holidays \nHere's what a Trump presidency means for the US auto industry",

      "text": "(Ford CEO Mark FieldsFord) \nThe year 2010 seems like a long time ago. That was when a bold future for electric cars appeared to be opening. \nTesla was about to roll out its first original design for an EV, the Model S, which would go on to be named Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2013.\nThere's were numerous electric-car startups aiming to join Tesla, and the major automakers were producing their first EVs since GM had killed it EV-1 in the 1990s. \nSince then, the promise of an electric-car revolution hasn't just failed to materialize — it's actually retreated. \nThe reason is simple: consumers don't want electric cars. It's the D-word — demand. And demand isn't there. \nThis market reality has collided head-on with an increase in federal fuel-economy standards, mandated by the EPA. Automakers want the government to ease up on the timetable, so that they can sell as many profitable pickup trucks and SUV in the US as possible, while sales are running at historically record levels and gas is cheap.\nThis is purely good business — carmakers want to bolster their balance sheets now, while the bolstering opportunity is good, ahead of the inevitable downturn.\nTrump to the rescue? Auto industry leaders are now seizing a chance to get President-elect Donald Trump's administration to give them a break, while at the same time not completely backing off the EV aspects of their product portfolios.\nHere's Bloomberg's John Lippert and Jamie Butters : \nFord Motor Co. plans to lobby President- elect Donald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules that hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand. “In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Mark Fields, chief executive officer of Ford, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Southfield, Michigan, office Friday . “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nFields is as committed as anyone to making sure that Ford is part of whatever revolution in transportation occurs in the coming decades, but he doesn't have the luxury of being a starry-eyed visionary. His job is to make sure that Ford is profitable, that it's balance sheet is strong, that it maintains or grows market share in critical parts of the world, and that it doesn't fall behind on innovation, in all areas of the business. \n(An electric Ford Focus.Ford) \n\nIf you look at the simple math that Fields presented, it's not hard to see why he wants the EPA's expectations to be adjusted. There's been a more-than-fourfold increase in the number of EVs for sale in US, and yet the market for those EVs has grown by a negligible 0.5%. \nCompliance for its own sake The billions being spent to develop and market EVs aren't being completely incinerated — these customer-less cars have value as \"compliance\" vehicles to meet government regulations. But building more of them for that goal is now officially running counter to the financial interests of the automakers. \nThis isn't a sustainable situation. Almost all of the planet's vehicles currently run on gas or diesel. That's unlikely to change for decades. Everybody knows that it would be good for the environment to get more gas and diesel cars off he road, but there has to be some kind of business value that the replacement electric vehicles provide. \nUntil consumer and carmakers can figure out how to make that happen, the automakers' case to have the government back off its fuel-economy requirements will be strong. \nNOW WATCH: Trump said he prevented a Ford factory from leaving the US — but the company says the move was never planned \n\nMore From Business Insider \nAutomakers could be making a big mistake with their big bets on electric cars \nHere's a great all-in-one Martini recipe for the holidays \nHere's what a Trump presidency means for the US auto industry",

      "text": "by Ciprian Florea + \nIn 2016, Ford returned to Le Mans to celebrate 50 years since the GT40 won the 24-hour event for the first time by racing the second-generation GT. The race car won its class and became the second Ford to triumph at Circuit de la Sarthe. Now, Lego is paying homage to FoMoCo’s success at Le Mans with a two-car set that includes both the old Ford GT40 and the new Ford GT. \nBoth miniatures feature the same livery as the cars that won their races. For instance, the 1966 GT40 is finished in black with white stripes, gold wheels, and wears the number 2, just like the car that Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon drove to victory half a century ago. As for the 2016 victor, the GT sports the red, white, and blue livery of Chip Ganassi. However, unlike the GT40, the GT is presented with number 66, which finished fourth in class at the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. The winning car of Joey Hand, Dirk Muller, and Sebastian Bourdais used number 68. \nThe new LEGO Speed Champions set will also include racing driver figures for each car, a checkered flag, and even a trophy to recreate Ford’s history-making wins. \n“Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford’s history-making 1966 victory – and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,” said Dave Pericak, global director at Ford Performance. “This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.” \nThe new GT40 and GT set will be available to order on Lego’s official website starting March 1, 2017. The bundle will cost €34.99 in Europe and £29.99 in the U.K. Pricing for the U.S. market is not yet available, but we expect it to cost around $30 based on stickers for other two-car sets from the Speed Champions series. With the GT40 and GT, Lego’s Ford offerings will increase to six. A Ford Mustang set is on sale now, alongside a Ford F-150 Raptor with trailer, and Ford Model A hot rod. \nContinue reading for the full story. continue reading Why it matters \nThis Lego set is a great way to celebrate Ford’ s success at Le Mans if you’re a big fan of the Blue Oval brand, as well as own miniature replicas of the company’s most successful race cars. It’s also one of the very few ways in which you can purchase and own both cars. Not only are the original GT40 s are worth millions of dollars nowadays, but buying the 1966 Le Mans winner is actually impossible right now. My only complaitn with this set is that Lego should have made the Le Mans-winning No. 68 car instead of the No. 66 versions. On the other hand, the fact that racing number on the GT mirrors that of the original winning GT40 is nothing to sneeze at either. \nThe iconic Ford GT40 and new Ford GT that won Le Mans 24 Hours in 1966 and 2016 are being brought to life in LEGO® bricks. \nThe new LEGO Speed Champions set will include both cars as well as racing driver figures, a chequered flag and even a trophy to recreate those history-making victories. \n“Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford’s history-making 1966 victory – and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,” said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. “This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.” \nFord won at Le Mans earlier this year after returning to the scene of what was a historic 1-2-3 clean sweep 50 years previously. The LEGO Group worked closely with Ford’s design and licensing teams on every detail of the 1966 winning car, and the new Ford GT race car. \n“This was a dream project – with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible,” said Craig Callum, head of design, LEGO Speed Champions. “Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.” \nCallum, who in his spare time races a Ford Model A hot-rod, and started out as a designer of full-sized cars, helped develop ten prototypes before the final versions of each model were selected, all created from existing LEGO bricks. \nThe new 2016 Ford GT and 1966 Ford GT40 set will be available to order at LEGO.com/shop from March 1, 2017, with a recommended retail price of €34.99 (£29.99). A Ford Mustang set is on sale now, alongside a Ford F 150 Raptor with trailer and Ford Model A hot rod. What is your take?",

      "text": "Manufacturing PMI improves to 46.0 –CBN \n\nFord on Friday announced the recall of nearly 650,000 cars in North America over defective seat belts that can fail in a crash. \nThe automaker said two accidents and two injuries have been blamed on the defect, which involves overheating of the cables in the pre-tensioning system of the seat belts, which can prevent them from functioning correctly in an accident. \nOf the total recalled, 602,000 were sold in the United States, 35,600 in Canada and 8,600 in Mexico. \nThe recall covers the 2013-2016 Ford Fusion and the 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ, produced at plants in Flat Rock, Michigan and Hermosillo, Mexico. Some Ford Mondeos also have been recalled but they are not in North America, reports France 24. \nIn the United States, vehicle manufacturers are legally obliged to publicly announce recall operations to correct defects found on their vehicles.

      "text": "#2017 #f350 #ford #fseries #superduty #fordf350 #fordfseries #pickuptruck The Ford F-Series is one of the longest-running vehicle nameplates in history, having been introduced in 1948. The higher-duty F250 and F350 were split into the Super Duty line in 1999. The trucks feature more rugged construction and more powerful engines than their 1997 predecessors. They featured completely different styling than the F150. In fact, only the taillight lenses and the tailgate were shared with the F150. The F350 can be had with either single wheels on the rear axle or dual wheels on it (the Dually). The fourth-generation Super Duty entered production for model year 2017. It is the first completely new Super Duty since 1998. It features a high-strength steel chassis, aluminum body, a much larger, grille, new front end design, and much more. The 2017 model is the first heavy-duty Ford truck made since 1997 to share a cab style with the F150. Engine offerings are a 6.2L V8, a 6.8L V10, and the 6.7L Powerstroke turbodiesel V8. The Lariat is a mid-range model. Seen at a dealership in Prescott, AZ. No comments have been added yet. Add a Comment:",

      "text": "  At a recent city auction, the black-and-white 2008 Ford Crown Victoria was unmistakable. Stripped of its decals, radio, lights and siren, its glory days as a Minneapolis police cruiser were in the rearview mirror. But with fewer than 70,000 miles, it's still a bargain hunter's dream. Such is the fate of many of the once ubiquitous Crown Vics, for decades the brawny symbol of police agencies across the country. Minneapolis is one of several departments in the state that slowly are phasing out the vehicles. \"It's been a workhorse for us for 30 years,\" said deputy chief Travis Glampe. By the end of next year, the force's remaining 37 Crown Vics, which are bound for the auction block when they accumulate 70,000 to 80,000 miles, will be replaced by the larger — and environmentally friendlier — Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Officials are counting on the Explorers' reinforced frames to better withstand the rigors of police work, including long trips and high speeds. Renee Jones Schneider Public works mechanic Christopher Decker worked on both the old (Crown Victoria) and new (Explorer) police cars on Tuesday. Crown Vics are popping up on classified websites like Craigslist and AutoTrader. Some are enjoying second acts for taxicabs and private car services. Cmdr. Gerald Moore said that Minneapolis tested other makes and models popular with departments nationwide but had problems with certain performance categories such as the Chevrolet Caprice (interior was too cramped) and Dodge Durango (not \"pursuit-rated\"). The Explorers, from years 2013 to 2016, offer several advantages over previous police cars, officials say. The vehicles are slightly more fuel efficient than the predecessors and have raised cabs that are easier on officers as they clamber in and out of their squads. Officers also appreciate their roominess. Today, Moore said, the \"squad car is your office, where you spend anywhere from eight to 10 to 12 hours a day,\" with an onboard computer that lets officers look up the number of traffic tickets motorists have received or file an incident report — tasks that used to require a trip back to the police station. The SUVs cost the department about $28,000 apiece for the Police Interceptor edition, which comes with special brakes and tires, plus a better suspension and electrical systems. The department spends about another $12,000 per squad for police-specific extras like computer equipment, sirens, lighting and decals. Trading out a classic While some have questioned the Explorer's price tag, departments insist it will pay off in the long run. \"The better service and higher trade-in value offset the increase of cost,\" said Marshall, Minn., Police Chief Robert Yant, whose department will retire the last of its Chevrolet Impalas in the next budget cycle and drive only Explorers. In her proposed 2017 budget, Mayor Betsy Hodges suggested increasing the department's vehicle maintenance account to nearly $1.7 million. The money will be used to maintain a fleet of 185 marked vehicles: 132 of the souped-up, police Explorers, 15 Caprices and 37 Crown Vics. The cars are spread among five police precincts and are assigned to patrol officers in the traffic division and certain street supervisors. By the end of next year, they will be replaced by SUVs, painted black with white doors, which are adorned with black decals, the department shield and \"POLICE\" — a color scheme that officials returned to several years ago, partly out of nostalgia. Five years after Ford's decision to abandon production of the full-sized Crown Victoria, Glampe says that cops still romanticize about the car that to many will be synonymous with law enforcement. \"All you have to do is to be driving down the road, and if you see a Crown Vic in your rearview mirror, you immediately have to go in your mind, 'Oh, is that a police officer behind me?'\" Glampe said. But the fact that the Explorer lacks its predecessor's strong brand recognition — the SUVs were especially popular with families in the 1990s — might have an unexpected benefit at a time when a lot of departments are eager for a friendlier image. In Hermantown, Minn., officers switched to the 2012 Ford Interceptor Utility after decades of driving Crown Victorias and Caprices. They also briefly considered the four-door sedan version of the Ford Interceptor but decided it was too small. Police Chief Jim Crace said he prefers the Explorer to previous police vehicles for the most Minnesotan of reasons. \"Up here in the Twin Ports-Duluth area, that's been a huge advantage to have all-wheel drive, not having to worry about traction and slipping and sliding as much as you did have to with the Crown Vic,\" he said.",

      "text": "  Ford CEO Expresses Interest In Working With Trump; Says Less Regulation Is Key To Saving U.S. Jobs Dec 3, 2016 6:00 PM 0 SHARES \nWith Carrier setting the precedent for what future negotiations with the Trump administration may look like, Ford CEO Mark Fields has come forward to layout potential policy changes that would be important to preserving auto jobs in the United States. Not surprisingly, per an interview with Bloomberg , Fields' opening \"ask\" focused on less restrictive fuel economy standards, new currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade and corporate tax reform. \nFord Motor Co. was a target of Donald Trump’s criticism on the campaign trail for building cars in Mexico, and now that Trump will be president, Ford said it’s willing to work with him to keep jobs in the U.S. -- provided Trump puts the right policies in place, according to the automaker’s chief executive officer. \n\n“We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,” Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview Friday at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan. \n\nAmong them, according to Fields: currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade, tax reform and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles. \n\nFields said that Ford plans to lobby the new president to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules . They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said. \n\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Fields said in the interview. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.” \nOf course, Ford was a frequent target of Trump's during the 2016 campaigning cycle after they announced plans to move their small car production to a new facility in Mexico . That said, Fields noted that Trump's policies \" in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise\" have already gone a long way toward influencing Ford's decision to maintain the production of the Lincoln MKC at a plant in Louisville, KY. \nAfter the Nov. 8 election, Trump phoned Executive Chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker’s plan to move manufacture of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Fields said . The discussion helped convince Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the U.S. \n\nTrump influenced the decision “because of what he’s talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise,” Fields said. \n\nAs our readers are certainly aware, North American auto OEMs and their tier 2 suppliers have been in a race to move auto production across borders to low-cost countries (LCCs) for the past couple of decades as soaring wages, pension and OPEB obligations, high taxes and punitive regulations have made production in the U.S. all but impossible. \nOf course, the groundwork for the shift of auto production to Mexico was laid with the passage of NAFTA in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton (a fairly inconvenient fact that Hillary probably regrets pretty heavily right now). Since then, Mexico has been a huge beneficiary of automotive plant relocations with offsetting closures coming from the U.S. and Canada. A recent chart from the Wall Street Journal , perfectly illustrates the transition of production capacity to our southern neighbor. \n\nMeanwhile, with wages that are a fraction of those paid in the U.S. and an accommodative regulatory structure, it's no surprise that the U.S. has lost a substantial number of automotive manufacturing jobs to Mexico. \nFord is scheduled to open a new $1.6 billion small-car assembly factory in San Luis Potosí in 2018 and hire 2,800 workers . People familiar with the matter say Ford will produce its Focus there, which is currently built in Michigan. \n\nA contract reviewed by The Wall Street Journal puts factory wages at the facility at about $1.15 to $2.30 per hour , on par with what other auto-assembly plants currently pay in the region. The move to Mexico will yield cost savings of about $1,300 per vehicle, or about $300 million a year , according to manufacturing experts familiar with the Detroit car maker’s finances. \n\nAnd while Trump continues to engage in meaningful conversations with company CEOs that have already yielded positive results for Midwest manufacturing employees, here is another look back to just a few short months ago to when Obama said it was all impossible (well, impossible absent a \"magic wand\" anyway).

      "text": "2 hours ago by Jay Cole 18 Comments Ford CEO Mark Fields has some feelings about the EPA’s timing to lock up 2025 CO2/CAFE standards before President-Elect Trump takes offive \nFord CEOÂ Mark Fields publicly tipped his toe into the murky waters of using questionable statistics to prove that his company should be exempt from future C02 emission/fleet MPG standards, as a result of a recent EPA mid-term review to lock in 2025 emission standards before the Trump administration takes control in January. More full-size trucks for everyone! \nFields, for his part, says thatÂ Ford is being forced to build more plug-ins and hybrids than the consumer doesn’t want, and thatÂ those vehicles are hurting profits. \nBut before we get into the “quotes of annoyance” from the Ford boss specifically, here is a brief backstory/timeline of events that has prompted the public outburst from Fields: President Obama In 2017 Chevrolet Bolt At 2016 NAIAS 2012:Â Obama Administration introduces new CO2 emission standards along withÂ NHTSA CAFE standards for a fleet at 54.5 mpg Â ( works out to ~38 MPG in real world terms ), around the same time CARB introduces the start of minimium ZEV (zero emission vehicles) production requirements in California Through April 2018: timeline for the final “mid-term” review to be filed on EPA’s 2022-2025 mandate for tailpipe emissions of CO2/54.5 MPG – to make sure the planned benchmarks are “technically” possible November 8th, 2016: US has an administration change that will take office January 20th, President-Elect Trump widely expected to be less “ environmentally friendly ” when any such progress may also impair US prosperity November 10th, 2016: Â “Alliance of AutomobileÂ Manufacturers”– a shell entity made up of most of the major automakers ( General Motors, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, VW, Mazda, Volvo, Fiat, Jaguar, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota ) fires off a letter to the new Trump administration , basically ask to not only hold back on that mid-term review process before the administration change, but to also then “reform” the process – thereby rolling everything back, discontinuing the currentÂ emission standards for the future, and also “harmonize” and control CARB and its ZEV programs President Obama gets into an Ford Focus Electric Prototype In July Of 2010 during the groundbreaking ceremony For LG’s Holland Plant in July of 2010 November 30th, 2016: although the EPA’sÂ Janet McCabe, assistant administrator for the EPAâs Office of Air and Radiation, says the timing was unintentional, suddenly the EPA has completed its mid-term review wayÂ early ( ~17 months ahead of the deadline ) , and as a result, we now enter a 30 day comment/review period before seeking a “final approval” on or around December 30th, 2016 from the Obama government – just three weeks before President-Elect Trump takes over. December 30th and onward : Â if the EPA mandate is approved (and it will be), it is then no simple thing/magic wand for the Trump administration to undo. Â As to do so would start over the full ( and complicated ) NHSTA review process on any newÂ standards, as well the effort to contest/over-turn all the science in the currently filed review. Â From there, the process would have to withstand the myriad of legal challenges from environmental groups that would surely come, and also wind its way into the Senate (who will be busy working on rolling back all sorts of other programs) . Â Basically, it will be a huge pain, and it will take a heck of a long time. …then after all that fight is over, add in the fact California (CARB) still has its own special legal rights (enacted by the Supreme Court) to enforce transportation regulations to control air-quality standards, so gaining control over CARB is even a step further still. Â And if you can’t defeat CARB, the whole rest of the process is essentially meaningless. \nGot all that? Â Good. Â Back to Fields. Ford CEO Mark Fields posing with a decidedly “not” fuel/CO2 efficient Ford GT \nThe Ford CEO, as part of the “Auto Alliance” wants the Trump administration to be affronted by the EPA’s ‘rushed’ review, and turn the whole thing on its head,Â regardless of the challenge it will present. \nâWhat happened was through eleventh-hour politics, it short-circuited a data-driven development of regulations,â Fields said in an interviewÂ at Bloombergâs Southfield, Michigan, office Friday \nAnd like any good (and self-serving) CEO, he came armed with some loose facts to support his position – that the consumer doesn’t really want any of those highly efficient vehicles his company will be forced to build. \nâIn 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry. Fast forward to 2016, thereâs 55 models, and year to date itâs 2.8 percent.â \nThis is not a formula for success, he said. âAt the end of the day, youâve got to have customers, so obviously, there would be pressure on the business if thereâs not a market.” \nNot withstanding the CEO’s opinion of what the public “wants” ( or that the current demand that is mostly a reflection of the incongruent offerings the auto industry has presented of late – thus self-fulfilling any prohecy ), the actual reviewÂ filed by the EPA was not done so toÂ judge what the future US consumer wants , it was there to assess whether or not it was technically possible …of which the EPA said the industry is prepared. Yay for more trucks! \nVia the EPA: \n“Based on extensive technical analysis that shows automakers are well positioned to meet greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for model years 2022-2025, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy today proposed leaving the standards in place, so the program that was established in 2012 will stay on track to nearly double fuel economy, dramatically cut carbon pollution, maintain regulatory certainty for a global industry, and save American drivers billions of dollars at the pump.” \nSee? Nothing about if the US consumer in 2025 really wants a circa 2016 hybrid or not. Â Just that they have the know-how/ability to do it. A rare opportunity for us to break into our “Politician with EV” stock footage files (President Obama seen here with 1st gen Chevrolet Volt) \nFord CEO Fields said he still looks to Trump to “continue the dialog as planned”, and offered that the automakers may look for clean-air credits for self-driving cars. \nAnd why would this be helpful if they those vehiclesÂ still burning petrol at a higher/dirtier rate than the current future standards would allow? Â Fields says that fuel emission would be reduced as self-driving tech would help traffic move more smoothly . /seriously Despite Ford’s stance to halt the progress of electrified vehicles, the company still lead all US automakers in November with 2,604 plug-in vehicle sales \nMr. Fields also said he has no plans to change or rollback Ford’s $4.5 billion worth of planned investment into electrified vehicles by 2020; which makes a lot of sense as the emission standards are set in stone between today and 2022, and if anything, the road to killing the 2022-2025 standards just got a lot tougher. \nBloomberg also added a little after-the-fact, green-washing noteÂ from the Ford CEO” \n“Ford wants to continue to help boost fuel economy and lessen the industryâs environmental impact, because the company acknowledges climate change as a serious threat, Fields said.”",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 4th Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 17:48 ET (22:48 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 17:33 ET (22:33 ",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products—zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 17:33 ET (22:33 ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline direct injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 17:48 ET (22:48 ",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 2nd Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to close another factory in the state and send roughly 1,300 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 17:20 ET (22:20 ",

Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n(END) 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "  Ford Plans To Defy Trump By Moving Small Car Production To Mexico by Michael Hines   The good news is that more profitable cars will replace Focus and C-Max on the production line. President-elect Donald Trump has been giving Ford a hell of a hard time for its plan to move production of two small cars, the Focus and C-Max, to Mexico. The move is designed to save the automaker money as both are slow-sellers in the US, a market currently obsessed with pickup trucks and SUVs. Trump had threatened to put a 35% tariff on automakers who make cars elsewhere and import them into the country, but according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (paywall) Ford is planning to continue on with its Mexico plans despite the threat. Ford CEO Mark Fields stood by the Mexico factory, telling the WSJ that no jobs would be lost in the process. “When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that’s to make room for new products—zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted,” Fields declared. Workers in the United Automobile Workers union would keep their jobs and could potentially make more via profit-sharing. The plan is to replace the lost small cars with hotter-selling and pricier trucks and SUVs. These new would most likely be the revived Bronco and Ranger , although the company hasn’t officially confirmed the return of either model yet. Ford’s plan certainly sounds reasonable, although the Donald may still have a hard time accepting it. Technically, Ford is still moving production of two cars (the last small cars it makes stateside) out of the US. What if Trump tells Ford to build a new factory in the US? Would the automaker be willing to call the soon-to-be president’s bluff? It seems likely, with the Blue Oval’s CEO saying, “We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we’re making that investment now.” That Mexico plant has a price tag of $1.6 billion, making it a hard investment to just up and walk away from. Ford has been one of Trump’s favorite corporate punching bags during his recent political turn. It remains to be seen if the automaker will continue to be a target once the former host of “The Celebrity Apprentice” takes up residency in the White House.",

      "title": "Ford CEO Expresses Interest In Working With Trump; Says Less Regulation Is Key To Saving U.S. Jobs",
      "text": "With Carrier setting the precedent for what future negotiations with the Trump administration may look like, Ford CEO Mark Fields has come forward to layout potential policy changes that would be important to preserving auto jobs in the United States. Not surprisingly, per an interview with Bloomberg, Fields' opening \"ask\" focused on *less restrictive fuel economy standards, new currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade and corporate tax reform.*\n\n\n\nFord Motor Co. was a target of Donald Trump ’s criticism on the campaign trail for building cars in Mexico, and now that Trump will be president, *Ford said it’s willing to work with him to keep jobs in the U.S. -- provided Trump puts the right policies in place, according to the automaker’s chief executive officer.*\n\n\n*“We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,”* Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview Friday at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan.\n\n\nAmong them, according to Fields: *currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade, tax reform and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles.*\n\n\nFields said that Ford *plans to lobby the new president to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules*. They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said.\n\n\n*“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” *Fields said in the interview. *“Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.”*\n\n\n\nOf course, Ford was a frequent target of Trump's during the 2016 campaigning cycle after they announced plans to move their small car production to a new facility in Mexico. That said, Fields noted that Trump's policies \"*in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise\"* have already gone a long way toward influencing Ford's decision to maintain the production of the Lincoln MKC at a plant in Louisville, KY. \n\n\n\nAfter the Nov. 8 election, *Trump phoned Executive Chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker’s plan to move manufacture of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Fields said*. The discussion helped convince Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the U.S.\n\n\nTrump influenced the decision *“because of what he’s talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise,”* Fields said.\n\n\n\n\nAs our readers are certainly aware, North American auto OEMs and their tier 2 suppliers have been in a *race to move auto production across borders to low-cost countries (LCCs)* for the past couple of decades as soaring wages, pension and OPEB obligations, high taxes and punitive regulations have made production in the U.S. all but impossible. * *\n\nOf course, the groundwork for the shift of auto production to Mexico was laid with the passage of NAFTA in 1993 by former President Bill Clinton (a fairly inconvenient fact that Hillary probably regrets pretty heavily right now). Since then, Mexico has been a huge beneficiary of automotive plant relocations with offsetting closures coming from the U.S. and Canada. A recent chart from the Wall Street Journal, perfectly illustrates the transition of production capacity to our southern neighbor. \n\n\nMeanwhile, with wages that are a fraction of those paid in the U.S. and an accommodative regulatory structure, it's no surprise that the U.S. has lost a substantial number of automotive manufacturing jobs to Mexico.\n\n\n\n*Ford is scheduled to open a new $1.6 billion small-car assembly factory in San Luis Potosí in 2018 and hire 2,800 workers*. People familiar with the matter say Ford will produce its Focus there, which is currently built in Michigan.\n\n\nA contract reviewed by The Wall Street Journal puts *factory wages at the facility at about $1.15 to $2.30 per hour*, on par with what other auto-assembly plants currently pay in the region. *The move to Mexico will yield cost savings of about $1,300 per vehicle, or about $300 million a year*, according to manufacturing experts familiar with the Detroit car maker’s finances.\n\n\n\n\nAnd while Trump continues to engage in meaningful conversations with company CEOs that have already yielded positive results for Midwest manufacturing employees, here is another look back to just a few short months ago to when Obama said it was all impossible (well, impossible absent a \"magic wand\" anyway).

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nzerohedge.com / by Tyler Durden / Dec 3, 2016 6:00 PM\nWith Carrier setting the precedent for what future negotiations with the Trump administration may look like, Ford CEO Mark Fields has come forward to layout potential policy changes that would be important to preserving auto jobs in the United States. Not surprisingly, per an interview with Bloomberg , Fields’ opening “ask” focused on less restrictive fuel economy standards, new currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade and corporate tax reform.\nFord Motor Co. was a target of Donald Trump’s criticism on the campaign trail for building cars in Mexico, and now that Trump will be president, Ford said it’s willing to work with him to keep jobs in the U.S. — provided Trump puts the right policies in place, according to the automaker’s chief executive officer. “We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,” Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview Friday at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan.\nAmong them, according to Fields: currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade, tax reform and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles.\nFields said that Ford plans to lobby the new president to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules . They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said.\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Fields said in the interview. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.”\nREAD MORE\nThe post Ford CEO Expresses Interest In Working With Trump; Says Less Regulation Is Key To Saving U.S. Jobs appeared first on Silver For The People .",

      "text": "View photos\nDespite ending the year without a loss, George Ford insisted there is still room for improvement from England. More Fly-half George Ford has warned the rest of the world that England are nowhere near their best, despite ending the year unbeaten on Saturday.\nEngland were forced to dig deep against Australia, rallying in the second half to beat the Wallabies 37-21 at Twickenham.\nThe result marked a 14th match unbeaten - equalling an England record set during Clive Woodward's time in charge.\nDespite England's undefeated streak, Ford insisted there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\"I think that's the frustrating thing,\" Ford said. \"We are nowhere near our best.\n\"There is loads of improvement in us. If we can get anywhere near we think we can, we will be a dangerous team.\n\"We are going in the right direction for sure and that is the exciting thing, we are still winning games along the way.\"\nEngland's transformation under head coach Eddie Jones has been evident.\nThe English have not lost since losing to the Wallabies at the Rugby World Cup in 2015, which spelled the end for former boss Stuart Lancaster.\n\"It's been great. You always want to be part of winning teams,\" Ford said.\n\"Over the past year, we have done that. We have come a long way, our game has development. There are still some areas of improvement so to be part of that is great.\"\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Ever since we have been working, it was about winning every game.\n\"We haven't had much of a focus on records, never spoke about it, so we are just thinking about the next job now.\"\nAsked if setting a record for 15 games undefeated was high on the agenda, Marland Yarde added: \"Not at all. Ever since we have been working, it was about winning every game.\n\"We haven't had much of a focus on records, never spoke about it, so we are just thinking about the next job now.\"",

And for good measure he caught a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Nick Carpenter. \n“Devaun Ford wants to be here,” Mashpee coach Matt Triveri said. “He believes he belongs here. He has a lot of talent. I know people pull him in different directions but he’s in a real good place. \n“He gets after it. He wants the football. He wants to be the guy that the pressure’s on. That’s what winners are. That’s what big-time players are and he’s a big-time player.” \nWhen the final whistle blew, Ford had finished the season with 162 total points, 25 rushing touchdowns and nine touchdown receptions. \n“I’ve always had confidence in myself but I never thought as a sophomore I would end the season with so many touchdowns and win a Super Bowl,” Ford said. “That’s unreal especially after winning one last year (in Division 6). \n“I did not think we were going to win one again.” \nCarpenter also did his part to ensure Mashpee (12-1) would earn consecutive titles. \nA senior, Carpenter completed just 3 of 9 passes for 43 yards, but one went for a touchdown. He ran for 47 yards and one touchdown on only four carries and he also ran for a two-point conversion. \n“He has 35 career wins,” Triveri said. “I don’t know where he ranks, but he has to be one of the top 10 winningest quarterbacks in the state’s history. \n“He was playing quarterback for us at 5-6 and 140 pounds as a freshman. The only thing he does is win games.” \nCarpenter made his presence felt on both sides of the ball late in the first quarter. \nAfter the Warriors (10-2) had driven to Mashpee’s 20, Carpenter intercepted a Will Geneway pass and returned it 24 yards. Carpenter then sprinted 47 yards and Ford covered the last 15 yards for a 6-0 lead. \n“That was a huge momentum shift,” Ford said of Carpenter’s pick. “Nick came up and made a great play. We were in our red zone. When he made that play it turned the whole intensity around. \n“That’s what led us to this win. He’s a leader.” \nMashpee maintained its 6-0 lead until the latter stages of the second quarter when Geneway dashed 47 yards around right end and Pat Butler kicked the PAT. \nThe Falcons countered with a drive of their own which featured two of three roll-the-dice calls by Triveri. \nOn fourth and nine from the Wahconah 39, Carpenter completed a 10-yard pass to Dominick Fellini, which gave Mashpee a first down at the 29. \nThen, on fourth-and-five from the 7, Carpenter threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Ford for a 12-7 lead at halftime. \n“You have to make plays,” Triveri said. “In those situations you have to come through. These guys have done nothing but come through their whole careers. \n“As for this senior class, we weren’t really sure where they were going to be at the end of last year. There wasn’t a lot of leadership and there wasn’t a lot of effort at times in the offseason. But they absolutely have come through in the greatest way.” \nThe Warriors tested the Falcons leadership when they received the second half kickoff and covered 73 yards in nine plays with Geneway bolting nine yards up the middle for a 13-12 lead. \nBut that margin lasted only 6.5 minutes, which was the amount of time it took for Mashpee to regain the lead. \nWith Ford and Jack Rodriguez leading the way, Mashpee marched 67 yards in 13 plays with Carpenter wedging over from the 1 on fourth-and-goal, which marked the third time the Falcons executed on a key fourth-down play. \nWahconah’s first drive of the fourth quarter was stymied by Mashpee’s defense, which included a sack of Geneway by Jake Johnston. \nThe Falcons eventually took over on their 33 and Ford started left, cut to his right and sprinted 36 yards for a touchdown and a 28-13 lead. \nWahconah made an attempt to reduce its deficit when it marched from its 35 to the Mashpee 20. But on fourth-and-7, Geneway’s pass fell incomplete. \nFellini then applied the exclamation point by sprinting 61 yards for a touchdown for the final score. \n“I can’t say enough about these kids,” Triveri said. “I don’t think anyone understands that we’ve won three state titles with less than 40 kids in different divisions. They had 90 kids on the field. \n“It is unbelievable what these kids have done. It’s something I don’t know how many people are going to duplicate with numbers like this.”",

      "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. Virginia Tech wide receiver Isaiah Ford didn’t need a tour Saturday of Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla., where his Hokies took on Clemson in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. He was familiar with the place from his high school days.\nFord already had some hardware from games played in the stadium. He was the only player on Tech’s roster trying to win a third championship in Orlando.\nIn his freshman and senior seasons at Trinity Christian Academy in Jacksonville, Fla., Ford played in high school state championship games in the stadium. Trinity Christian won both state title games.\nFor the ACC championship game, he was facing an issue he didn’t have to deal with in his previous two visits to the stadium. He didn’t know early in the week exactly how many tickets he needed for the championship game, but with a slew of family and friends planning to attend, he wasn’t turning down any teammates who offered to give him tickets.\n“I don’t really have a set number, to be honest,” Ford said Monday.\n“Everyone wants tickets, so I’m in a hassle right now trying to ask as many of my teammates and coaches as I can to try to get as many tickets as possible. Just trying to make sure that everyone can come to the game and watch me, because this is the closest that they’ll all be able to get for me probably, so to get as many people there would be really special.”\nIt turned out tickets likely weren’t difficult for his supporters to obtain.\nWith the ACC moving the game in late September from Charlotte, N.C., to Orlando as a result of North Carolina’s HB2 laws, ticket sales for the championship game were slow. Disney employees were offered free tickets to the game.\nNO INTRO NEEDED\nGrowing up in Mauldin, S.C., Tech right tackle Jonathan McLaughlin got his share of exposure to Clemson’s football program. He wasn’t offered a scholarship by the Tigers, but he has a loose connection with one of their best players.\nMcLaughlin remembers playing in high school against Clemson linebacker Ben Boulware, who attended T.L. Hanna High in Anderson, S.C., about 35 miles southwest of Mauldin. Boulware, a 6-foot, 235-pound senior, was a first-team All-ACC pick this season.\n“I know he’s a physical guy,” said McLaughlin, a senior who earned third team All-ACC honors this season. “He was a good player in high school, and after I watch the film, he’s a good player on film, as well.”\nANOTHER CITY, ANOTHER ACC TITLE GAME\nTech holds the distinction of being the only ACC team to play a football conference championship game in all four cities that have hosted the title game – Jacksonville, Fla., Tampa, Fla., Charlotte and Orlando.\nIn 2005, unranked Tech lost 27-22 to No. 5 Florida State in Jacksonville in the inaugural ACC title game. Two years later, No. 6 Tech gained redemption in Jacksonville with a 30-16 conference title game victory against No. 12 Boston College.\nIn 2008, unranked Tech met No. 18 BC again, with the Hokies coming out on top 30-12 in Tampa to claim the ACC title. Tech was again in the ACC championship in 2010, and No. 12 Tech beat No. 20 FSU in Charlotte 44-33.\nVIRGINIA CONNECTIONS\nClemson has three players from Virginia on its roster. All have played significant roles this season.\nRedshirt freshman Clelin Ferrell from Richmond starts at defensive end. He came into the championship game with 37 tackles, including 6.5 for losses and four sacks.\nTrue freshman free safety K’Von Wallace from Richmond is No. 2 on Clemson’s depth chart. He had played 108 snaps and recorded six tackles, including one for a loss, entering the title game.\nRedshirt freshman linebacker Chad Smith from Sterling played in 11 games in the regular season, leading Clemson with nine tackles on special teams. He had 18 tackles total before Saturday night.\n– Norm Wood, The Daily Press",

The result is the same even when you start with an already cool car, as evidenced by Germany's new Polizei Ford Mustang.\nResearch 2017 ford mustang See Full Specs See Pricing The special Ford Mustang GT is the German police force's new \"Tune it! Safe!\" demo car that will be used as an outreach tool to promote safe vehicle modification. The car was commissioned by the Verband der Automobil Tuner (VDAT), essentially Germany's equivalent of the Specialty Equipment Market ( SEMA ), and is sponsored by Germany's Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, among other organizations. The car was built by Wolf Racing, which tuned the Mustang GT's 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 engine to 440 hp and added custom 20-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Hankook Ventus S1 Evo tires, a height-adjustable coilover suspension, a body kit with front splitter, side sills, rear diffuser, a rear wing, and unique bumpers, and a sports exhaust system.\n© Motor Trend Staff Ford Mustang GT Polizei front three quarter 03 The modified Mustang cop car will serve as a sort of liaison to the tuner crowd in Germany, which may otherwise not be all that receptive to a police presence at their events. Though this Polizei pony car won't chase down bad guys on the Autobahn, S550 Mustang interceptors do exist. Mustang tuner Steeda has offered a police package for law enforcement agencies since early this year.\nSource: Tune it!
