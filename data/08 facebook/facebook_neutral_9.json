      "text": "A A- “Adventures of the Crazy Yellow Kia.” That’s how a Facebook post called Friday night’s incident at Rockwell. —VIDEOGRAB FROM KITT LAPEÑA’S FACEBOOK PAGE The driver of a yellow Kia compact car who held off pursuing security personnel in Makati City for over an hour by ramming into their vehicles, leaving four of them injured, has received a subpoena from the Land Transportation Office (LTO). The subpoena sent on Monday ordered Jamie Camille Brojan to attend a hearing today on her possible liability under Republic Act No. 4136 or the “Land Transportation and Traffic Code.” “Your failure to appear … shall be construed as a waiver of your right to be heard and contravene the allegations made against you, leaving this office to resolve the complaint based on available evidence,” LTO intelligence and investigation division chief Martha Fortades said. According to Fortades, this may lead to the revocation of Brojan’s license. Depending on the agency’s findings, penalties may also be meted out against the 28-year-old resident of San Juan City. On Friday afternoon, Brojan was approached by Rockwell security personnel for illegal parking on Amorsolo Drive, Makati City. A chase which lasted for more than an hour ensued after she tried to flee. Before Brojan was cornered, she hit a barangay service vehicle and several other cars on Kalayaan Avenue. She also struck the motorcycles of her pursuers, leaving four of them injured. A portion of the incident was captured on video by Kitt Lapeña who was walking on Rockwell Drive at the time of the commotion. The video titled “Adventures of the crazy yellow Kia” posted on Facebook has since been viewed over four million times. However, charges were not filed against Brojan after she agreed to shoulder the medical expenses of the injured security personnel. She also promised to pay for the damage she caused to all the vehicles she hit. – Jovic Yee  ",

      "text": "About Hard News: The Vaccine for Propaganda... Articles: 774 Seeds: 4484 Comments: 8814 Since: Oct 2013 Fake News on Facebook? In Foreign Elections, That's Not New Current Status: Blessed (1) ! \nNYT reports; HONG KONG — Facebook rumors force a well-known politician to publish proof of his heritage. Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman’s noose. A politician’s aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl’s corpse — an image that turns out to come from another country. Another day on social media for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump? Think again. Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media’s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States. Well before last week’s American election threw Facebook’s status as a digital-era news source into the spotlight, leaders, advocacy groups and minorities worldwide have contended with an onslaught of online misinformation and abuse that has had real-world political repercussions. And for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news. Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late. “They should have done this way earlier,” said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook’s fastest-growing markets. “We already saw the warning signs of this years ago.” On Thursday, President Obama, speaking in Berlin and standing alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel, criticized Facebook and other social media for disseminating fake news. He became so impassioned that at one point he lost track of the question he was answering. “If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect,” Mr. Obama said. The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook’s global reach — roughly a quarter of the world’s population now has an account — is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say. \nFull story in article. keyboard shortcuts: V vote up article J next comment K previous comment In these nations:",

      "text": "NSP: WITH THE PAP ELITES OUT OF TOUCH, HOW TO MAJULAH SINGAPURA?   \n<Facebook post by National Solidarity Party> Advertisement \nIn the wake of growing world disaffection with all things Global that benefit only the few at the top will the PAP stop to think about this in the Singapore context?. Will the team that pushes the TTP (A Globalist Trade Pact), that thinks you can live on $1,000 a month while themselves drawing Million dollar salaries and, so far, is only contributing to increased financial pressures and costs of living with raised prices, mismanaged investments and breaking down services etc actually recognizes that they too are on the same path? \nAt some point token gestures like a few cents off a bus fare or a few hundred dollars for a pensioner can't paper over the cracks. You need concrete policies for a balanced society and be prepared to truly invest in your people for the country to move forward in a meaningful way. That requires a change of thinking which focuses on the people and not self protection and adopting a servant mentality and not a master one. \nThe old PAP had a young country and internal struggles to contend with but now we have grown the new PAP should be changing with the times and the maturity of the nation. Sadly the elected president issue is just another example of how an out of touch self focused government thinks it can mollify the ground with lame justifications while ramming through policies clearly with its own and not the peoples interests at heart so the prognosis is not good. \nHowever I still hope that the more progressive and the younger PAP members can talk some sense in to the fearful elders but failing that then Singaporeans will have to start taking more self responsibility and build a true alternative to replace the current administration if it refuses to change and continues to have policies to control everything for its own ends rather than grow the nation for the benefit of all.

      "text": "I began chatting with a woman from Pune a few months ago on Facebook. We shared a lot of information about each other, she told me about her life and I also showed her photographs of my home and family members. We discussed a lot of things that I had never shared with anyone before, simply because I felt comfortable chatting with her. We decided to meet last week because we thought it would be nice to catch up in person after having had all those conversations. We fixed a date at a restaurant and she didn’t show up. When I decided to send her a message, I found that she had blocked me on Facebook. I didn’t have her phone number so I couldn’t call to find out where she was. I am worried about her. Could something have happened to her? I don’t know what to do and can’t tell anyone about her because my family and friends are unaware of her existence. \nIf something were to happen to her, I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t have had the time or inclination to block you from her Facebook friend list. Relax. In all probability, she probably decided not to meet you because the idea freaked her out. Maybe she wasn’t comfortable meeting you because she didn’t know how to face you. Alternatively, maybe she wasn’t a woman from Pune to begin with and you may have been chatting with some guy from Jamshedpur for all you know. These things happen online. Anonymity is a good thing, but can also be a problem because it allows people to do or say things they wouldn’t normally do openly. Let this be a lesson to you, so, the next time you decide to chat with a stranger, you don’t open up about your life before first meeting that person offline.\nEver since my relationship ended, I have had headaches that leave me numb. What should I do? \nStart by seeing a doctor.",

      "text": "What's New in Civic Tech: Government Portals on Facebook, Spreading City-Startup Partnerships A look at highlights and happenings in the world of civic tech. by Ben Miller / November 17, 2016 0 San Rafael-Richmond Bridge Shutterstock/Michael Warwick Startup in Residence Philosophy Spreading? \nIn 2008, the city of San Jose, Calif., started tinkering with the idea of partnering with clean tech companies to get their ideas off the ground. In 2014, San Francisco launched its Startup in Residence program where tech firms got the chance to work on civic issues from inside the municipal government. The idea was to spread — and it has, to three other cities in Northern California. \nNow Region Technology , a business advocacy group in the Sacramento, Calif., region, has started pushing three more city governments in the area to consider following in the footsteps of San Jose and San Francisco. According to the Sacramento Business Journal , the group has asked the cities to look for ways to enable entrepreneurs to demonstrate their products without necessarily going through a procurement cycle or signing a ream of contracts. \nSuch partnerships have become increasingly important for startups working on civic tech. For example, OpenGov, a budget and open data management company, got its start demonstrating its product with Palo Alto, Calif. RELATED This Week in Civic Tech: Civic Engagement Tools for Election Officials, White House Honors Makers This Week in Civic Tech: Chicago Launches Civic Tech Startup 101, U.S. Department of Commerce Data Service Completes Major Projects What's New in Civic Tech: Uncertainty in the Age of Trump, Open Source Projects Abound \nRegion Technology approached the cities of Sacramento, Elk Grove and Rancho Cordova with the idea, according to the article. Sacramento, in particular, has been pushing to aid its tech startup culture. This year the city hired its first chief innovation officer and set up an $8.2 million fund for the role to draw from — all with an eye toward working with startups to create jobs and nurture a tech culture in the area. Putting a City Portal on Facebook \nSan Rafael, Calif., now has two portals — one on its website and one on its Facebook page . \nThe city is an early adopter of the just-launched ProudCity Service Center, a tool that can be embedded directly into Facebook, a mobile app or as a widget on any website. The center acts as something of a how-to guide, using iconography to direct citizens to the services they’re looking for and then directing them on how to get what they need. \nUsers can also send feedback, including attachments, directly to the city through the service center. \n“Data from the ProudCity Service Center application is pulled from the same content management system used to manage core digital operations, so there’s no need to manage or configure the display multiple times,” a press release reads. “Once the service center is configured, it’s just a simple embed that can be placed anywhere.” Naperville, Ill., Votes for Open Data \nOn Nov. 15, the City Council of Naperville, a Chicago suburb, embraced open data. The council adopted a formal open data policy, and then staff promptly announced the first project under the new policy: a public safety incident map. \nThe open data policy, which Naperville identified as a result of its participation in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ What Works Cities program, calls on the city to: Make funding available for open data projects. Conduct a data inventory and prioritize data sets for release. Identify data champions in each department. Set up an open data portal. Publish an annual open data report. Support innovative uses of the data. \nThe first project, the public safety map, will plot out incidents reported by the fire and police departments on a map. Users will be able to customize the map based on time frame, incident type and location, according to a city press release . \n“This map will give residents the ability to view and analyze data, spot patterns or trends, and simply be more informed,” Naperville Fire Chief Mark Puknaitis said in the statement. \nThe map will launch Nov. 28.

      "text": "Facebook boosts efforts to 'do good' with new tools   6:23 PM Nov 17, 2016 at 10:00 PM Barbara Ortutay,   \nNEW YORK (AP) \" Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others \" or asking for help \" after a natural disaster. \nThe social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \n\"The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. \"And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.\" \nUSER POWER? \nA tool called \"safety check\" lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that's a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. \nAt first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like \"was that an earthquake?\"), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. \nDISASTER AID \nBeginning early next year, a tool called \"community help\" will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year's attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. \nBut it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. \nCHARITY HELP \nFacebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money \" but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation. About Us",

      "text": "Evicted. Photo courtesy of the band via Facebook. The Rise of Zimbabwe’s Punk Bands 11.17.16 by Aude Konan \nD uring the war for independence in the 1970s, a heavy rock movement appeared in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. \nOne of the bands at the forefront of this musical movement was Wells Fargo . Inspired by musicians like Jimi Hendrix and James Brown , they mixed afrobeat with psychedelic rock to create music that would soon be synonymous with hope amidst the bloody war for independence. \nDespite their success back then, Wells Fargo struggled to release their music as they were blocked by racist distributors. The group was heavily political, at one point launching a call to arms for Rhodesia to get their independence from the British empire. Alongside other bands such as Eye Q and Gypsy Caravan , they created their own music festival. That action got them strong backlash from the police, who beat them down and used tear-gas to stop them from performing. \nThe shining idea of 1970s Zimbabwean rock was the fusion of African and Western sounds to create a new genre of rock music that felt a hundred percent Zimbabwean—it was revolutionary. \nMore than 40 years later, Wells Fargo’s impact on the rock scene remains, as they built the foundation of Zimbabwean rock by fighting against racial segregation, colonialism and towards a resurgence of national culture. \nIn recent years, the rock scene’s gone through its own resurgence in Harare with a new wave of bands. \nEvicted is the most well known, having gained mainstream recognition since they first came out with their debut album Place Called Home . The group blends Zimbabwean genres such as Sangura and Chimurenga with with rock, punk, reggae and funk. \nAmong the new wave of Zimbabwean punk groups, Evicted is the closest to having reached mainstream recognition. The band was formed in Harare by four high school friends. Although their sound nowadays is an afro punk fusion with a clear metal influence, at the beginning, their music was undoubtedly punk. \nHailed as “the Chimurenga punk band,” they toured abroad in Australia and South Africa, before relocating to Zimbabwe. Chimurenga is a shona word that means “liberation” and also the name of a political movement formed in 1894, when the Shona and Ndebele began to revolt against the white colonizers and settlers in the region. \nThe reason why Evicted is called “Chimurenga punk” is due to their politically-loaded lyrics tackling subjects their audience can relate to, such as poverty and corruption. The group aims to spread awareness and a belief that things can change. \nAnother band, Chikwata.263 , is one of the most unique punk outfits in the country. \nFormed in Harare in 2011, they’re Zimbabwe’s first Mbira punk band. The band hijacked the traditional use of the Mbira to mix it with contemporary Western punk sounds and make a new brand of Zimbabwean punk music, both haunting, peaceful, yet angry and fast paced. Influenced by a myriad of artists such as Miles Davis, Thomas Mapfumo and The Sex Pistols , they released their first album, Chauya, in 2014. \nThe new Zimbabwean rock scene is small, which is both a blessing and a curse. The ability for groups to grow and be challenged is relatively small, but it’s easier for fans and bands to interact with each other. There are however, a few homegrown platforms for them to thrive and Rock Down Harare is one of them. \nOne of the main music festivals in the country, Rock Down Harare was created in 2003 to give local bands a proper platform to reach their audience and give the public an opportunity to discover new national bands. \nThe Facebook group Rock Music Zimbabwe is also regularly updated by fans and musicians alike. They post events like rock festivals, gigs and even guitar workshop for the scene to thrive, even on a smaller scale. \nIn Harare, The Book Cafe is the go-to music venue for many rock bands. After all, this is where Chikwata.263 was formed and where every single one of the bands mentioned in this article have performed at least once. Macy and The Red. Photo via the artist’s Facebook. \nGroups like the indie band formerly known as Retrospex frequently set up events in local bars to play for free for their fans. The band, formed in 2011, is a part of this new wave of fusion punk Zimbabwean bands. \nTheir music mixes punk, hip-hop and jazz as heard in their album Greetings from Crater was released in 2014. They sing in English but add some Shona when covering traditional Zimbabwean songs. After their lead singer Alex left the group, the band went through a bit of change. They know have a new singer and go by Utopia . \nMacy and The Red is a female-fronted band formed in 2012 whose music is a mix of reggae, punk and afro pop. They’re signed to the label XTM Nation Jamaica. \nWith the new scene thriving and clearly being inspired from the past one, one question remains: among these groups, which ones are the true successors of Wells Fargo? \nWells Fargo never reached a mainstream appeal and most people have forgotten about them, but Now-Again Records recently re-released their album, Watch Out! , with the aim of documenting the heavy rock scene of 1970s Zimbabwe. \nTo be fair, none of the bands who are part of the new wave of Zimbabwean rock are the true successors of Wells Fargo. The times are different and the challenges that both generation are facing are different, the music is different, and the bands goals are different. \nBut one can see how some things remain at the heart of Zimbabwean rock: a will to create music that respects the traditional sound and culture of Zimbabwe, while also taking inspiration from the West. And an urge to make music that forces their audience to open their eyes and fight for what is right.",

      "text": "Home » News » Us News » Now users can launch Facebook's 'Safety Check' Now users can launch Facebook's 'Safety Check' 28   IANS New York, Nov 18 : Facebook will now allow its 1.2 billion users to automatically launch its crisis response tool, \"Safety Check\". According to a report by cnet.com on Thursday, this change will allow the community to decide the urgency of the nearby danger, something Facebook has struggled to grasp. In the areas of immediate danger, Safety Check allows people to notify their family and friends that they are safe. This feature of Facebook has been used during natural calamities and terrorists attacks across world. \"When Facebook had control of Safety Check, it had a high standard of what counted as a disaster. A typhoon in the Philippines might have six inches of water in your house, and in California, that'd be a big deal. But in the Philippines, we did research there, and people said this wasn't a big deal,\" cnet.com quoted Peter Cottle, Facebook's lead engineer on crisis response. \"In the past two years, Facebook turned on Safety Check 39 times. Compare that to 335 dangerous events flagged by its community-based Safety Check tool since the company began testing it in June. One of the first instances of a community-generated Safety Check was the Orlando nightclub shooting in June,\" the report said. Facebook considers an event as not being an emergency if the users ignore the Safety Check, which then fades itself. \"We can tell how many people are spreading this and marking themselves safe, and how quickly it's growing. There's a real strong measure of urgency based on the rapidness of the people who are using the tool,\" Cotte said. However, Facebook has been criticised for being selective when it comes to launching Safety Check tool during a crisis. In November 2015, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had responded with a facebook post saying, \"\"We care about all people equally, and we will work hard to help people suffering in as many of these situations as we can.\" Reports said that Facebook was also testing out a Community Help page that \"users can access after checking in as safe. There, users can post if they need shelter, food or supplies, or if they can provide any of those resources\". The Community Help feature is expected to be available by January 2017. -- IANS",

      "text": "Chetan Bhagat’s detailed Facebook post explaining demonetisation is a must read! Chetan Bhagat’s detailed Facebook post explaining demonetisation is a must read! The author tries to make it easy for people to understand the government's move with his detailed Facebook post. By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Published:November 17, 2016 12:02 pm The author tries to clarify people’s doubts about the government’s demonetisation process with his Facebook post. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) \nEveryone, or at least every Indian, has been losing their minds over demonetisation of late. People have been rushing towards the nearest ATMs and banks they can, resulting in long, never-ending queues starting from early morning hours. \nIn the midst of all this chaos, many took to social media to debate and discuss the issue. Among them, was author Chetan Bhagat, who first took to Twitter with his long rants against demonetisation. He called the government out for its poor execution of what is in fact, a well-meant plan for the people of the country. \nALSO READ | Chetan Bhagat’s long rant against demonetisation of Rs 500, Rs 1,000 is a must read \nSoon he took to Facebook too, but this time, with a detailed, point-by-point deconstruction of what the move is about, the benefits, the disadvantages and the execution. His intention was to give the people a lot more clarity about the unexpected move that was introduced by the PM recently. \nRead his entire post here. \n“My Take on Demonetization Many have asked me to give my views on demonetization, suggest any positive ideas and explain the benefits and issues in simple terms. Since it is not possible to do it all in a few tweets. Here is my take on it., both the MOVE itself as well as the EXECUTION of it. THE MOVE: Benefits: 1) It shows government’s seriousness to tackle black money. This signaling effect alone is a huge benefit to the nation where many evade taxes. 2) It will ensure a significant part of the black money gets back to the government. It’s not true that nobody gains from the money burnt/thrown away. (See next point) 3) The old money not swapped in banks is effectively the government’s Profit. Say 17 lakh crs of total money existed in old notes, and only 13 lakh crores comes back. For remaining 4 lakh crores, the government can print new notes, and keep it themselves. Hence, the government does stand to make a lot of money in this (which can be then used for people) 4) It’s nice to see a PM who works, has innovative ideas and wants to make a change. We have had leaders who sat quietly and did little. It is good to see a man of action. At the same time, like any policy, there are some issues. Issues: 1) Execution of such an exercise in India is no joke. We just aren’t technically ready to do this in a smooth manner. (That is why we are facing some execution issues, which I get into later.) 2) There are some tricks still people can use to swap black money into new money. It will reduce the amount of black money recovered. 3) There is a huge cash economy in India. It isn’t ‘black’. It’s just cash. To suck up so much liquidity will lead to a slowdown and losses for a lot of people, for no fault of their own. The slowdown in economic activity will cause lower profits, and in turn lower taxes for the government. 4) A potential crash in real estate prices. While some want property prices to fall, a huge drop can cause an economic shock, reduction in bank collateral values etc., again leading to a recession. 5) The exercise by definition involves everyone swapping their money after showing their credentials. In effect, everyone has to prove they are innocent and have clean money. This is somewhat invasive to citizens, and while there is no other way, it remains an issue. 6) The exercise would be expensive, and that cost needs to be taken into account. 7) It’s a jolt to our stable monetary system. Doing it again and again will cause people to lose confidence in our currency. It’s really a one-off, and even that destabliizes things. 8) The tax department may use it as an excuse to harass people later, with endless questioning about the extra bank entries. Net Effect: Overall, demonetization is a good move. Given the extent of black money in the country, and the tiny taxpayer base, something had to be done. It had to be drastic. It has been done now. We should now do what it takes to make it succeed. THE EXECUTION: As important as an idea is it’s execution. There clearly have been execution issues, causing pain to a lot of Indians who have wasted a lot of productive time in queues. While doing things for the nation is good, one need not have to suffer because of bad planning or someone not thinking things through. The good and bad of the execution are: Good: 1. It’s happening, and still the country is chugging along. Banks across the country are slow, but doing their bit. There is no mass hunger, or calamity so far. Thank God. 2. Government is taking steps to ease the pain. The change in limits helps. The banks are also devising ways to manage the crowds. 3. People in India are on the whole, taking it well. Bad: 1. Someone didn’t plan the logistics well – it is one thing to make an excel spreadsheet of number of bank branches and the people involved. It is quite another to when you deal with India’s reality on the ground. There are bottlenecks galore in this exercise – whether printing of notes, uncaliberated ATMs, or limits to the number of cash vans. One can say whatever about the secrecy required, but it seems that while finance professionals sat and spoke up in the meetings, industrial engineers and operations research experts probably did not to the extent required. We are seeing the fallout now. 2. Citizens do not have to take so much pain. Inconvenience is one thing, suffering quite another. To say bear it in the name of patriotism is not listening to the issue – the execution is not efficient. It is the same as how people say –“Oh, the temple is dirty, bear it in the name of God.” Sorry, God had nothing to do with it. The temple management didn’t keep the temple clean. Same ways, patriotism has nothing to do with the fact that someone didn’t plan the ATMs better or didn’t make the new 500-Rs note available early. FINAL CONCLUSION AND IDEAS FOR SMOOTH EXECUTION: In final analysis, we should support demonetization, but keep reminding the government to iron out the execution issues. Some ideas: 1. Online appointment booking for banks. 2. Easy forms, which can be pre-filled. Faster check-outs at banks. 3. Hiring interns at banks for short term, supervised by existing employees. 4. Opening banks 24 X 7 after new hires come in. 5. Supplying enough notes to banks as fast as possible. 6. Fixing the ATMs 7. Declaring one or two holidays (not for banks!) for people to get their finances in order 8. Removing withdrawal limits as fast as possible. 9. Having empathy for people in lines, from the highest levels of government. 10. Giving an incentive to people to come to the bank. A meal coupon would go a long way too. I hope the above helps you understand demonetization better. I also hope you focus on the making the exercise work, which means supporting the idea and yet demanding better execution. It also means not to get sucked into any propaganda or political drama. Do share with others if you think this will help people get some clarity on what is going on and what needs to be done. God bless. Thanks, love and Jai Hind, Chetan Bhagat” \nThis is his Facebook post. \n\nBhagat’s Facebook post received quite a bit of engagement, with some users agreeing with his point-by-point deconstruction of demonetisation, while others correcting him that “first of all, it is not demonetisation.” \nOthers had bigger concerns to address. \nDo you think the writer deconstructed the issue for people to understand?

      "text": "FRIDAY, NOV 18, 2016 | 1 comments A Facebook timeout? Some say they need a break Some members of Facebook Nation are taking time off from the social network, or leaving it outright, after a contentious election that has left nerves frayed and tempers short.\nâI need a breather for my personal sanity,â says Beth Swinson, 40, a stay-at-home mom of four in Charlotte, N.C., who voted for conservative third-party candidate Evan McMullin. Scathing comments from both sides and wide-scale misinformation left her \"angry and frustrated.\" She plans to take a month off from the social network. \nâNone of it is positive. Itâs exhausting, and the election seemed to last forever,â says Donald Trump supporter Lydia Fielder, 49, who manages a social-media platform for paper crafting in Austin. Sheâs unfollowed all but 50 of her 2,033 Facebook friends. ...",

      "text": "In what could be the biggest stock market event in a couple of sluggish years, the parent company of Snapchat, the app that allows people to send photos and videos that quickly disappear, reportedly has filed for an initial public offering (IPO).\nThe Ventura, Calif.-based Snap Inc. recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under a law that allows companies with less than $1 billion in revenue to file paperwork confidentially to keep their financial records concealed from public review while they sort out the transaction, according to Reuters , which spoke with anonymous sources familiar with the filing on Tuesday.\nIf Snap decides to go public – 75 percent of companies that file for an IPO do not – it could complete the process by March. Valued between about $20 billion and more than $30 billion, the app company’s share offering would be the biggest US tech IPO in the United States since Facebook’s public debut in 2012, when that company was valued at $81.2 billion. Chinese company Alibaba Group Holding went public in the US two years ago, when it was valued at $170.9 billion, in the largest IPO ever.\nRecommended: Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! This year saw so far has seen the fewest IPOs since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports that 103 companies listed their shares in the US this year, compared to 165 last year.\nTest your knowledge Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! Snapchat makes money from one source: ads shown to its 100 million daily users, who include 41 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds in the US, according to Snapchat.\nThough it has only one source of revenue, a concern for investors, the company’s two-year old advertising business could reach $1 billion in sales next year , up from approximately $350 million expected this year, as The New York Times reports. Specific financial data about the company will be available when its IPO filing is made public.\nSnapchat was founded in 2011 by Stanford University students as a service that delivers text messages that disappear within seconds. Today it has grown into a sophisticated communications platform that offers a comprehensive and fun way to talk to friends, which has it poised to compete for online advertising domination with companies such as Facebook, which recently reported that its third-quarter revenue shot up by 56 percent to $7 billion , and its profit for the same time period nearly tripled to $2.38 billion.\nIn September, Snap expanded into the technology hardware category with the launch of sunglasses that can shoot video , called Spectacles.",

      "text": "0 A poster of BBC TTV series \"The Last Kingdom.\" Facebook/ The Last kingdom \nFilming of “The Last Kingdom” Season 2 has wrapped and it is now in the post production phase of development. The cast and crew members appear to have had a good time on the set. A new video has been posted online, showing how some cast members spent their time when they were not filming their scenes. \nTo be a part of the action-heavy TV series has meant the cast members had to endure cold nights on the set, training at the gym, and working on their stunts on the set. For some cast members it has been a challenging experience, but that doesn’t mean it was all work and no play. \n‘The Last Kingdom’ Season 2: Dancing on the set \nActor Arnas Fedaravicius has posted a video of the cast members having fun in the makeup room. One actor can be seen dancing in the background to music, while the camera pans around the room to give the fans a glimpse of what it is like to be there. \nThe other actors in the background are still in their chairs, either getting ready to film their scenes or removing their make-up. The production crew was able to deliver stunning visuals in the first season in terms of the attention to detail to the costume, makeup as well as the sets. The popularity of the show has the fans now eagerly waiting for the next installment.",

(AP) — Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

      "text": "How can Facebook and its users burst the ‘filter bubble’? Bubble trouble: we need to break out Aminart/getty By Sally Adee \nIn the wake of the US election, concerns are surfacing over the filter bubbles that mediate the information people see in their social media feeds. \nFilter bubbles are formed by the algorithms social media sites like Facebook use to decide which information to show you, based largely on your own tastes. The idea is to keep you engaged, but the result may be a worldview skewed to fit your own preferences and biases. With 62 per cent of Americans getting their news from social media at least occasionally, the fear is that filter bubbles could affect how you make decisions in real life. \n“If this window is filled with highly partisan and, in some cases, false news, then many people will be assessing political candidates and information on the basis of distorted and misleading information,” says Martin Moore at King’s College London. Advertisement \nSo what can social media sites – and their users – do to burst these bubbles ? \nYou can take control of your own feed. You don’t need to go to extremes, says Philip Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute – there’s no value to wading into the fever swamps of white nationalism or climate denialism, for example. But equally don’t unfriend people just because they didn’t vote like you. Friend or foe? \n“Your context is shaped by who you friend and unfriend,” he says. “Every time you tailor your feed to get rid of people whose opinions you don’t like, you add more boundaries to your reality.” \nPeople who support losing political parties, he says, are particularly vulnerable and their bubbles may shrink further if they retreat into like-minded safety. \nHow to break out? It isn’t easy. Network effects reward extremists and drown out moderate views, says Cesar Hidalgo at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The problem is not so much the extremists on the other side of the political spectrum, but those on your own. “If you say something moderate, you might get chewed out,” he says. “Social network filter bubbles create an environment in which moderates have incentives not to speak. There’s a lot of enforcing going on.” \nThe filter bubble phenomenon is largely a design problem, says Hidalgo. Facebook and Google have already moved to restrict advertising on fake news sites, but this does not stop users sharing false information, and bubbles are made of more than just falsified news reports. \nHidalgo has other suggestions. Facebook, he says, ought to design a “flip feed” button. Its algorithms could identify your bias, then show you stories selected from the other end of the political spectrum. An alert could pop up when an algorithm detects that your feed is getting too closed off, and it could suggest people to friend or pages to follow with a view to widening your perspective. Confirmation bias \nSocial networks might also introduce random, high-quality news stories into feeds, he says, or a Rotten Tomatoes-style reputation meter – an icon placed near the like button that could crowdsource people’s ratings on a story’s trustworthiness. Even if people manipulated it by scoring stories highly if they fit their confirmation bias, the button may serve as a reminder that not everything you read on the internet is true – something that’s easily overlooked in the rush to confirm your beliefs. “Unfortunately, we still have the problem of over-believing things,” says Hidalgo. \nHoward says part of the problem is that all sources are presented in the same way, whether you’re looking at The New York Times or your neighbour’s blog. He thinks Facebook should divide and label content into news and other posts. That way, opinions and false information are not misinterpreted as legitimate news. \n“It’s time for us to treat Facebook as a media firm,” says Howard. “They need to get a public editor and curate their content.” \nIf social media sites are unwilling to do that, he suggests that regulation could hold them to similar standards as journalists and broadcasters. \nBut Nathan Matias at MIT’s Center for Civic Media thinks we should avoid giving social networks even more authority over our reality. “Do we really want them to have even more control over our online existence?” he says. “Do we actually want to give Facebook the power to decide what’s true and what’s false?” \nThere’s another caveat. “We are still so early in our understanding of how social networks really work,” Matias says. We don’t know how much impact filter bubbles have on our views – in fact, “the idea of the filter bubble has never been empirically proven”. \nAnd regardless of the effect of filter bubbles, Matias is sceptical about how useful “bursting” them would be. Filter bubbles don’t only exist in social media, after all, and how far outside your own worldview would you have to look in order to gain an unfiltered perspective – presuming such a thing is even possible? \nIn fact, maybe this new obsession with the filter bubble is itself viewed through a filter bubble. “In 2008, we celebrated when Obama used Facebook in creative ways to win the election,” says Howard.",

      "title": "Lessons We Can All Learn From Jim Bakker's Fall and Rise",
      "text": "All Other Social Networks I appeared on the Jim Bakker Show earlier this year. ( Facebook ) Pain is a part of life. The infilling of the Holy Spirit helps us deal with pain but is no guarantee Christians will be immune to our share of it. The question is not whether you will experience pain, but how you will respond when the pain comes. It's been said the heat that melts the butter hardens the clay. Too many Christians, I've observed in my six decades on Earth, melt at the slightest problem. They've been led to believe following Christ means a life of joy and fulfillment. That's absolutely true, but the way that message has been preached, at least in America, has left some with an unhealthy expectation that the Lord only allows smooth sailing in our lives. On top of this, an overemphasis on the so-called prosperity gospel based on a mistranslation of 1 John 3 that God wants you to prosper has caused many a shipwreck for Christians who bought into it without understanding being a Christian is more than living like you won the lottery. Jim Bakker should know. He told me he got off base partly because of an overemphasis on the prosperity gospel. And he has experienced far more pain in his life than almost anyone I know. In this month's cover story of Charisma magazine, I tell how Jim Bakker lost everything—his ministry, his reputation and his wife, and even his home burned to the ground. In addition, he lost his freedom and was in prison for almost five years. Despite it all, he has come back—in some ways stronger than ever. Sometimes I will write an editorial about our cover story in Charisma . You can click here to read the digital version of that issue about Bakker, who I have covered since before the infamous \"fall\" in 1987. Here I share my own thoughts and conclusions on his life and I ask how you'll respond when the inevitable crises in life cause you to despair. You may never experience the depth of what Jim Bakker experienced. But all of us will experience loss, whether it's the loss of a dream or a job or one's health. Maybe it will be the loss of a marriage. And even if it's not the loss of any other of these things, each of us will experience the loss of a loved one because no one can escape the inevitability of death. We can all learn valuable life lessons from how Jim Bakker fell and how the Lord raised him up in this hour: advertisement Humble yourself. If Jim Bakker was haughty before the fall, he is humble today. What happened to him was unjust in my opinion. Maybe he couldn't help being humiliated as he lost everything as the world press covered every twist and turn. Read how low he was when he came out of prison. Yet I've known others who were humiliated by lesser \"scandals,\" and they tried to justify themselves and remained prideful. Whatever your pain is, embrace humility and ask God what He is trying to teach you. Learn something new. While Jim was in prison cleaning toilets, he took time to get a doctorate degree by correspondence. But more than that, he did an in-depth study of the words of Jesus and also the book of Revelation. It was unplanned and unwanted, but it was like a five-year sabbatical, and he took advantage of every moment to study Scripture. So if you are bedridden due to your health or out of work, what creative way can you spend the time learning something new or growing spiritually? Realize the Lord may be preparing you for something you can't anticipate. Most of us don't change unless we go through a difficult time. If this is happening to you, realize God has a bigger plan and allow your trial to shape your character. In Jim Bakker's case, it was becoming an expert on end times so he could help ready the body of Christ for whatever difficulties may be ahead. If PTL had continued to go and grow, would he have learned that? No. But look at the people he has been able to help. What is the equivalent of this in your life? Finally, never give up. As long as there's life, there's hope. Nothing will continue as it is now—either very good or very bad. So you may feel overwhelmed, but that doesn't mean the sun won't rise tomorrow. Meanwhile, remember the words of Winston Churchill: \"Never give up.\" One of the things I admire about Jim Bakker is that he didn't give up. Instead, he started over, built a great organization and a great legacy, and served as an example for us all. You can read my article on Jim and the entire November issue of Charisma by clicking here for the digital edition . A few months ago, I interviewed Jim while I was on a visit to Morningside. I made it into a podcast which had the most downloads up to that time. Plus, I wrote about it in my newsletter which you can read here if you missed it. Take time to listen to the podcast again and to share it with others. Take time to like my Steve Strang page on Facebook. During this election season, my audience has really grown! And as usual, share this with others you think would enjoy it. \n3 Reasons Why you should read Life in the Spirit. 1) Get to know the Holy Spirit. 2) Learn to enter God's presence 3) Hear God's voice clearly!

      "text": "\nImage source: Facebook.\nA couple of sentences from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) CFO Dave Wehner scared a lot of investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call. \"We expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully,\" Wehner said, explaining the impact of saturating the platform's ad load. He went on to say, \"We anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year.\"\nIt doesn't take a financial genius to understand slower revenue growth and accelerating expenses mean earnings results could suffer considerably. But sussing out what exactly Wehner meant from those comments could help investors determine if the market overreacted to the earnings call, providing a buying opportunity.\nContinue reading ",

Tech columnist Kim Komando shows you how to do it. Simple steps in your settings can keep your secrets safe, from viewing preferences to search history. (Photo: Getty Images/Ingram Publishing) \nWhen a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. \nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? \nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) \nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. \nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again. \nLet’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. \nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? \nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube. \nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual. \nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. \nYour significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. \nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. \nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you . \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. \nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. \nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories . \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings.

      "text": "Topics: black lives matter , Facebook live , Philando Castile , Police brutality , News , Politics News Memorial of Philando Castile (Credit: AP/Jim Mone) \nOn July 9, 2016, Philando Castile was driving in a car with his girlfriend and her child. He was stopped by Jeronimo Yanez, a Minneapolis-area police officer. Yanez questioned Castile. Castile answered all of officer Yanez’s questions politely and fully complied with his instructions. Castile, also informed Yanez that he was a licensed gun owner and had said weapon on his person. Yanez panicked, shooting and killing Castile while his girlfriend recorded and broadcast the horrific events to the world live, via Facebook. For Yanez, the mere sight of a black man legally exercising his 2nd amendment rights caused — as it too often does with America’s police — an instinctively reflexive moment of violent and lethal “negrophobia.” \nCastile’s death was as predictable as it was avoidable. Minneapolis and its surrounding communities are among the most racially segregated in the United States. The police enforce that literal version of the color line. In that role, Minneapolis-area police routinely harass and violate the civil rights of African-Americans. Castile himself had actually been stopped 52 times by Minneapolis area police before that final encounter. In many ways, racism combined with the rules of probability ended Castile’s life that day in July. \nWednesday, Ramsey County Attorney John Choi decided to charge Jeronimo Yanez with manslaughter. The StarTribune explains : \nIn an extraordinary move by a Minnesota prosecutor, authorities said the officer, not the civilian, is to blame for the tragic events that turned a traffic stop in a Twin Cities suburb into a flash point in the national debate over racial profiling and police use of force. \nYanez pulled Castile, a 32-year-old, over at 9:05 p.m. July 9 on Larpenteur Avenue near Fry Street in Falcon Heights. By 9:06 p.m., the young officer had fired seven shots into Castile’s car, killing him as his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter looked on. \nFor those actions, Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said at a news conference Wednesday morning, Yanez will be charged with three felony counts — second-degree manslaughter and two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm. He’s the first Minnesota officer charged in an on-duty killing in modern memory. \n“To those of you who may say this incident was Philando Castile’s fault, I would submit that no reasonable officer — knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time — would have used deadly force under these circumstances,” Choi said. “I have given officer Yanez every benefit of the doubt on his use of deadly force, but I cannot allow the death of a motorist who was lawfully carrying a firearm under these facts and circumstances to go unaccounted for.” \nChoi’s decision is extremely uncommon. In the United States police are rarely held accountable when they abuse and harm the public — this is especially true if the victim is not white (police violence against the poor, the mentally ill, undocumented residents, and the poor is also rarely punished). \nUltimately, being a police officer in America is one of the few jobs where someone with a high school degree can be given a gun, a uniform, a pension, and the power of life and death over another person — a power they all too often exercise with carte blanch and near immunity/impunity under the law. \nJeronimo Yanez’s being charged with manslaughter is far from a guarantee that he will be convicted for killing Philando Castile: police are rarely found guilty of misconduct . But this small victory should be savored by those of us who care about civil rights and human dignity because in Donald Trump’s world and presidential administration such moments will likely be very few and far between. \nWhy is this? \nDonald Trump will be not only the Chief Executive but also the Chief Law Enforcement agent of the United States of America. While a president is not responsible for enforcing the law on a local and state level, he does set the tone for the nation. The president does this through words and actions, policies, and through nominees and appointments to key positions. This should fill those of us who value civil rights and civil liberties with dread. \nUnder his “law and order” agenda, Donald Trump has promised to make unconstitutional harassment of blacks and Latinos under “stop and frisk” a national priority. He has also promised to put more police in America’s “inner cities.” This will increase what is known as “over policing” and lead to more instances of violence and yes, death, as people of color are disproportionately and unfairly victimized by the country’s cops. \nDonald Trump has described members of the Black Lives Matter movement and others who are struggling for the full and equal rights of all Americans in the face of police brutality and violence as “thugs” and “bad dudes.” \nDonald Trump placed full page ads in all of New York City’s major newspapers calling for the de facto lynching of the five young black and Latino men charged with rape in the infamous 1989 Central Park rape case . These men were later found innocent of all charges after serving almost thirty years in prison. Despite their have been exonerated, Donald Trump still insists that they are guilty and should be punished. Trump also refuses to apologize for publicly calling for their deaths. \nDonald Trump’s administration is a rogues gallery of people who are hostile to the civil rights, dignity, equality, and freedom of African-Americans and other people of color. \nTrump’s chief adviser will be Stephen Bannon . Bannon is a white supremacist and white nationalist who formerly ran the Right-wing propaganda website Breitbart.com. \nKris Kobach will also be involved at a senior level in Trump’s administration in the role of Attorney General. Kobach served as Kansas Secretary of State and has advocated laws that allow police to demand “citizenship papers” from people who look like “illegal aliens” and is also an advocate of racial profiling. Kobach also supports creating a national registry for Muslims and has been instrumental in voter suppression laws that target African-Americans and other communities. \nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is likely to be part of Trump’s administration. During Giuliani’s time as mayor, the New York Police Department established its unconstitutional stop and frisk program . Giuliani’s police department was also involved in numerous high profile incidents of harassment and violence against blacks and Latinos in New York. Giuliani is also an avowed enemy of the Black Lives Matter Movement. \nTrump is also rumored to be considering Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke for a position as Head of Homeland Security. Police under Clarke’s command denied an inmate, Terrill Thomas water and other assistance for six days. He would soon die. Thomas is one at least ten people who have died in the custody of the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office between 2008 and 2012. Clarke is also extremely hostile towards African-Americans. Clarke is also a recurring guest on the right-wing news media where in his designated role as a black conservative he routinely demeans black Americans and provides excuses and cover for white racism. \nIt is clear that protecting the civil rights of African-Americans, people of color in general, those of gays and lesbians, or other marginalized groups will not be a priority under Donald Trump’s administration . \nAmericans are in the streets protesting the election of Donald Trump because his presidency represents a horrific deviation from basic norms and standards of democracy, decency, and civility. The stakes are especially high for Hispanics, Latinos, African-Americans, Muslims and Arabs, gays and lesbians, and women, groups who quite literally have skin in this political game as Trump’s Terrordome will include all of them. \nThe recent killings of black and brown Americans such as Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd, Laquan McDonald, Walter Scott and so many others by America’s police are painful reminders of how justice is neither colorblind nor fair in the United States … and I worry that such tragedies are a preview of what is to come under Donald Trump’s presidency.

      "text": "During the Republican primaries, Facebook's powerful data told those working to get Ted Cruz elected which ads could win over Donald Trump voters. × Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections During the Republican primaries, Facebook's powerful data told those working to get Ted Cruz elected which ads could win over Donald Trump voters. \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — During the Republican primaries, Facebook’s powerful data told those working to get Ted Cruz elected which ads could win over Donald Trump voters. \nOne video highlighted Trump’s coziness with politicians over the years. The other featured an impassioned Cruz speech about being an outsider who could fix Washington. \nThe ads were largely informed by and distributed through Facebook. Tommy Swanson, CEO of a digital marketing agency called Stripes, used Facebook’s advanced advertising tools to target specific demographics and measure the impact. \n“Going into Iowa, we already knew which creative was going to turn 40+ year-old female Carson supporters into Cruz supporters,” says Swanson, whose agency worked with a super PAC supporting Cruz’s candidacy. \nCruz won Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries, and would go on to win three states on Super Tuesday. One of those was Texas, where Swanson’s Facebook campaign led to an “increase in intent to vote for Ted Cruz” among those who had previously leaned Trump. \nThat point is one of many included among a group of “success stories” for political advertising on Facebook’s official marketing page. The stories highlight how political campaigns have used Facebook advertising tools to drive increases in voter registrations, boost support among Hispanics and get voters to pick one candidate over another. \nIn short, these stories show how Facebook pitches itself as a platform to influence voting decisions just as it does with buying decisions. But you might not know that from listening to its CEO deny that rampant fake news on Facebook could have changed the way people voted in the presidential election. \n“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook — of which it’s a small amount of content — influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” Mark Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference last Thursday. \nZuckerberg’s point, as he elaborated on later in a Facebook post, was that “only a very small amount” of what shows up in Facebook News Feeds is fake news. “More than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote. So how much impact could it really have on the election? \nTo some who’ve worked at Facebook, however, Zuckerberg’s comments contradict Facebook’s pitch to advertisers. \n“In 2012, we were pitching political advertisers saying precisely that Facebook could influence voters,” says Antonio Garcia-Martinez, who worked as an ads targeting product manager at Facebook until 2013. “Now Zuck is going and saying, ‘No that’s impossible.'” \n“Facebook understood that it could throw an election as far back as when I was there,” says Garcia-Martinez, author of Chaos Monkeys, about his time working in Silicon Valley. \nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg’s public statements. \nFacebook now finds itself striking a tricky balance. Its core business is built on the premise that advertisers can use Facebook’s targeting tools to show the right users the right message at the right time leading to the right outcome. \nThe same dynamic applies to political ads. Citigroup said last month that Facebook and Google would be the “largest recipients of political digital ad spend” from the 2016 election cycle. It even suggested Facebook could top Google for the first time. \nOn the other hand, Facebook doesn’t want to be seen as powerful enough to tip elections, deliberately or not. \nThere is certainly a difference between influencing a few voters through ads or fake news and single-handedly deciding an election. The problem, according to former employees, is that Facebook employees don’t always know the full impact that every little tweak to its platform may have on voters. \n“This is a very powerful product that can have effects that we didn’t imagine it having,” says one former Facebook employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nGarcia-Martinez recalls one rumor that some Facebook employees were nervous about rolling out a voting prompt to iPhone users first in 2012 because it could have benefited Obama. The reason: iPhone owners might be more likely to live on the coasts and be more liberal. \nThat might sound ridiculous — it probably is ridiculous — but the fear speaks to Facebook’s tremendous reach and influence in all things, including voting. \nJudd Antin, a former research manager at Facebook, urged the company to do more surveys and analysis into the fake news problem rather than rely on broad data points like the sweeping 99% figure cited in Zuckerberg’s post. \nAs Antin pointed out in a Medium post this week, that final 1% can still be quite large when you consider more than one billion people check Facebook every day. \n“Mark and his leaders seem to have applied their own intuition with a hefty dose of bias and self-interest,” Antin wrote. “He jumped to conclusions about what it means and why, likely in the absence of good information about how fake news can matter.” \n“When data-driven becomes data-myopic, we all suffer,” Antin added. “I worry that Facebook’s decision-making has lost its humanity. And that’s frightening given the central role it plays in our world.” ",

      "text": "(CNN) Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true . It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit. \nIt doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide. NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars , an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis , the head of the International Fact-Checking Network at the Poynter Institute. First, know the different types of misleading and false news 1. Fake news \nThese are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real. \n2. Misleading news \nThese are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article. \n3. Highly partisan news \nA type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda. \n4. Clickbait \nThe shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised. \n5. Satire \nThis one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate. \nSecond, hone your fact-checking skills Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a \"healthy amount of skepticism\" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news. \n\"If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,\" he told CNN. \nMelissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content. \n\"People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,\" she told CNN. \"I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.\"\n\nFor starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake: \n1. Does the story come from a strange URL? Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like \".co\" or \".su,\" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales. Read More 2. Does the headline match the information in the article? Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through . Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. \"Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',\" trumpeted one such headline. However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to \"take their business elsewhere.\" 3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed? Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney. A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry. It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015 . It had nothing to do with the election results at all. 4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable? Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 \"bathroom bill\" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. \"IT BEGINS,\" read the headline. However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the \"bathroom bill\" was to be passed. In fact, according to Snopes , the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy. 5. Does the article cite primary sources? It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral. One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a \"clear parasite\" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel . Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company . Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake. 6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable? A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998: \"If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific. \" This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it : People.com has extensive archives, and this quote is nowhere to be found in them. 7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story? During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as \"reported\" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as \"reported\" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton! In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source , and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt. 8. Is your own bias getting in the way? Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest. Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence. \"We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,\" says Zimdars. \"If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.\" So if you find an outrageous article that feels \"too good to be true,\" use caution: It just might be. 9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization? Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know you're getting the real deal . View the whole list here . 10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites? This is where things can get tricky . There's obviously a big difference between \"misleading\" news, which is usually based in fact, and \"fake\" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list . While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as \"fake\" is not accurate. \"I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,\" she says. \"It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.\"",

      "text": "At 1 in the afternoon of Nov. 9, the day after the election, the Wallingford mom started a Facebook page with a special theme.\nThere was no publicity other than the link that Molly Spence Sahebjami forwarded to friends.\nIt is called, “ Dear President Trump: Letters from Kids About Kindness .”\nIt features images of letters like this, sometimes written in that chicken-scratch lettering and only occasional use of correct grammar that young kids use: “kids in my class are very scared. PLEase don’t kick them out. In my school we get sent to the wall when we’re in trouble. My friends did not do anything wrong. Don’t send them to the wall. Love, Abby … ”\nMost Read Stories Trump supporter in state Senate says some protests are ‘economic terrorism,’ should be felonies Flesh-eating bacteria traced to tilapia bought from Bellevue market Earl Thomas, Rob Gronkowski have cool Twitter exchange about hard hit in Sunday's game Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West Coast Cheap Eats: Some of Seattle’s greatest food isn’t found at the priciest places | PNW Magazine  WATCH Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Sahebjami decided on the Facebook page after her son, Calvin, 5, told her about how the election turned out, “Oh, the mean man won.”\nWith her advertising and marketing background, Sahebjami thought the Facebook page could get social media traction.\nBut not quite like this.\n“Hi, folks! Pretty cool that we broke the 1,000 member mark in less than 3 hours …,” Sahebjami posted later that day.\nBy Thursday, 5,000 people had joined up. As of Thursday night the group stood at more than 10,000 members. It’s a closed group but any member can approve you.\nSo the interviews are lining up and parents are sending in photos of letters their kids wrote, and sometimes videos of the kids reading the letters.\nThe site is bona fide viral.\nAngela Taylor Hyland, a Seattle writer and editor, sent a video of her 6-year-old daughter with a letter the girl wrote, “Dear Mr. President, be nice to things. Don’t say mean things. This helps me calm down: Meditation, reading, and resting. Good luck with your new job! Let me know if I can help. Szaba.”\nThe letter included a drawing of the daughter fighting with her younger brother over a toy, and then hugging. If they can do it, why not politicians?\nHyland says the family has a lot of relatives in the Midwest who are Trump supporters. She hopes a posting such as the one from Szaba “creates something positive between us.”\nSo far, says Hyland, some of the relatives have clicked on the thumbs-up sign on the Facebook posting. That’s progress.\nSahebjami says she knows the page has been drawing a largely liberal audience. \nIt started in Seattle, after all.\nShe says she and her husband, Dara Sahebjami, an attorney for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, “don’t shield our child from political conversation. He sits around with a lot of adults.”\nSahebjami told her son, “If you have a problem with somebody, talk to them.”\nShe asked what he’d write to Trump. A kindergartner, Calvin dictated this letter: “Dear President-elect Trump, please be a good president. Be kind to all people. Some people in my family are a special religion and they are not bad guys.”\nSahebjami grew up in Vancouver, Wash., the daughter of Republican parents. His family came to the U.S. from Iran in the 1960s. “We have people in our family who are Muslims,” she says.\nOn Facebook, Sahebjami asks those sending in kids’ letters to have the letters be “positive,” “kind” and “nonpartisan.”\nSome are turning out that way, others not:\n“Dear president-elect trump, please be kind and let the love shine through. Love Avery age 6.”\n“How to be nice! From Kela age 7.\n1. Say kind things like well done.\n2. don’t blame other people when it is you doing the bad thing.\n3. don’t lie.\n4. Don’t scream at people.\n5. behave”\nThe list went on to No. 12, the last one: “Being different is COOL!!!!”\n“From Hadley, age 13.\n“I hope, since many people dislike you, you can prove us wrong. I hope you can help everyone of every race, not just white men with the same beliefs … The country is counting on you, respectfully… ”\nAmong the videos posted on the site was one featuring Annie Rose, 9, a Chicago fourth-grader. \nShe says, “We have to stay strong. We have to control our anger … And remember not to speak with hate …”\nAnnie Rose’s mom, who preferred the family name not be used, says her daughter is an Abraham Lincoln fan. That happened when the family was on a vacation road trip and visited the Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. \nThe daughter now has the Gettysburg Address posted above her bed.\nOn the Facebook page, Sahebjami has listed the street address in Manhattan for the Trump Tower.\nShe hopes those posting on Facebook also send the letters by regular mail to Trump and his wife, Melania.\nSahebjami also suggests that the high-school kids she saw demonstrating on TV this week with their f-word Trump signs try writing him a more tempered letter. The signs’ wording is “not a very productive discourse,” she says.\nSo far, there has been no response from the president-elect, says Sahebjami.\nBut she says she also knows that Trump is a big social media user. “We’d like to catch his attention,” says Sahebjami.\nAnd, who knows, maybe some morning soon at 4 a.m., there will be that tweet from @realDonaldTrump .\nErik Lacitis: 206-464-2237 or elacitis@seattletimes.com Twitter @ErikLacitis Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

      "text": "Gotham Coyote Project Like us on Facebook \nTen years ago, Jessica Carrero was walking in the Bronx’s Van Cortlandt Park when what looked like a dog burst out of the woods and ran down the trail in front of her. But as she watched the animal, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation ranger could tell that it was no dog. “It didn't have a collar and it didn't move in a way that dogs move,” she says. “It wasn't nervous or excited—it seemed to move with a sense of purpose, knowing exactly where it was going.” A year earlier, she’d very briefly seen a similar looking animal in Pelham Bay Park. At the time, she wondered, Could that be a coyote? Then she second guessed herself. Back then, “it wasn’t confirmed that [coyotes were living] here,” she says. “I thought, ‘That had to be a stray dog. Coyotes just aren’t in New York City.’” But with this sighting, there could be no doubt: Though the animals' presence in the Bronx had not yet been confirmed, Carrero was looking at a Canis latrans . \nSince that day 10 years ago, coyotes have firmly established themselves in New York City; they’ve been spotted everywhere from the Upper West Side to Battery Park City, from the rooftop of a Queens bar to Rikers Island , and they’re breeding in the Bronx’s parks. And Carrero—who was born and raised in the Bronx and has been with the park service for 15 years—has had plenty of confirmed encounters with the animals. She isn’t just on call to help relocate coyotes from residential backyards to wooded park lands—she’s also spotted them on the trails of parks in the Bronx. Once, she saw three pups playing in Pelham Bay Park; another time, she and two workers scared two coyotes away from a rabbit the canids had likely been hunting. “We saved the rabbit’s life,” she says, chuckling. \nMany of her colleagues haven’t ever spotted a coyote, but Carrero estimates that she’s seen the animals nine times during her tenure with the park service. “I just have good luck,” she says. \nNine might not seem like all that many given the fact that Carrero and her colleagues spend most of their time walking the parks, but it suddenly becomes a lot when you compare it to the number of sightings scientists Mark Weckel and Chris Nagy have had between the two of them: five. (Two for Weckel, three for Nagy.) Which is a shame, considering that the pair spend their time studying New York City’s burgeoning coyote population as co-founders of the Gotham Coyote Project . \nFounded in 2011, the project started with a simple question: Where are coyotes? The scope has expanded since then, says Weckel, whose day job is manager of the Science Research Mentoring Program at the American Museum of Natural History . Nagy is director of research at the Mianus River Gorge . \n“From that time,” Weckel says, “we’ve expanded to questions like: How many are there? What are their genetic relationships? What impact could they have on the ecology of New York City?” \nTo answer those questions, the project has recruited scientists from universities and museums and enlisted the help of interns and volunteers. They’re in constant communication with Carrero and the Parks Department, and twice a year, they set up trail cams in New York City parks where coyotes have been sighted in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the elusive animals. But eyewitness reports and trail cam photos can only tell scientists so much—namely, where coyotes are. To answer the tougher questions—how the animals are related, and what they’re eating—the scientists rely on poop. Gotham Coyote Project \nUp to about 200 years ago, the coyote inhabited the western part of North America, from southern Canada to northern Mexico and from the Mississippi west to California. But as humans cleared forests for fields and eliminated apex predators like the eastern wolf and eastern cougar, the coyote expanded its range in all directions, adapting to, and thriving in, every new environment. Their new territory, stretching from Alaska as far south as Panama and to the eastern seaboard, marks a range expansion of at least 40 percent . \nBy the 1980s, the animals were breeding in New York State—everywhere except New York City and Long Island. And in the mid-’90s, coyotes made their move. \nNew York City consists of five boroughs: the Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens. Staten Island and Manhattan are islands, and both Brooklyn and Queens are located on Long Island; the Bronx is the sole borough attached to the mainland United States, so it makes sense that first modern coyote sighting in New York City would be there. It occurred in February 1995, when the animal—a female—ran out onto the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx and was hit by a car (a statue was later erected in her honor). Another coyote was found shot in Van Cortlandt Park the next week, and yet another popped up not long after in Woodlawn Cemetery . By 2011, the coyote had established breeding populations in the Bronx, and these days, they pop up around the city to major fanfare. \nNow, there’s just one last large landmass left to conquer: Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens). Individuals have made the journey—either crossing bridges, using tunnels, or swimming across bodies of water to get there—but there aren’t currently any breeding populations in the area. Yet. \nThat fact, which came to Weckel’s attention when he was a graduate student at the City University of New York, directly inspired the Gotham Coyote Project. When the native New Yorker realized that no one was studying these coyotes, he jumped at the chance to do it: “You very rarely get a chance to understand what the first few individuals of a new population are doing.” \nThe group decided to find out as much about the animals as possible using one resource that was readily available to them. To find coyote poop, you have to go to where the coyotes are—so on a hot July morning, mental_floss headed up to Van Cortlandt Park to help Nagy and four interns in the search. Potential coyote poop picked up in Van Cortland Park. Photo by Erin McCarthy. \nFrom far away, coyote scat doesn’t look all that different from dog poop. But get closer, and you’ll start to see some discrepancies. Dog poop is homogenous, but coyote scat might contain sticks and stones, seeds and broken bones—and it might be more than a little fuzzy thanks to the fur from its kills. \nWe meet up with Nagy, the interns, and Nagy’s dog, Ethan—a small black-and-tan pup that he and a friend trained to sniff for scat—near Van Cortlandt’s horse stables, then take a short car ride to the section of the park Nagy wants to search. We walk in together, then split up into pairs to cover more ground. \nCoyotes often poop right next to the trails people use—no need to tromp off into the woods to find scat—and most people who walk by piles in Van Cortlandt Park aren’t giving them a second glance. But we walk with our eyes trained on the ground, closely examining every brownish lump we find. It rained the night before, making soft objects indistinct; more than once, the potential poop turns out to be a rotten stick. \nIn theory, when Ethan picks up the right scent, he dwells over the spot. He usually finds at least one scat while on the hunt. “If I was doing this from scratch, I’d go to the pound and just get the most hyperactive OCD dog,” Nagy says. “Usually you just run a tennis ball up and down a fence, and if they go absolutely crazy for it, that’s your dog. My dog’s a little harder to please. He knows what we’re there for, and he does it—as long as there’s not a squirrel around.” \nAs temperatures soar into the 90s, it becomes too hot for Ethan to do his work. He’s panting, not sniffing with his nose, and every chipmunk (there are a lot of them in the Bronx) is a distraction. No amount of treats will get him back on task. After four hours of searching—during which we cover more than five miles—we pack it up and head back to the park entrance. \nNagy and Ethan came up empty, but one of the interns has a good eye for poop; she finds two samples. (Nagy has calculated that it takes around eight human hours to find a single scat, as compared to a dog’s four.) On a paper bag, she writes the park’s initials, the scat’s GPS coordinates, and her initials. After some discussion about how to scoop up the poop—Nagy has forgotten plastic gloves—another intern uses a second paper bag to pick it up and deposit it in the marked-up bag. Finally, she drops in a couple of packets of dessicant, which will dry the sample out. \nNagy puts the samples in his backpack. From here, he’ll deposit them in a cool, dry area under his porch until he has time to take them up to the lab. Then he calls it a day; it’s simply too hot to search anymore. In the lab at Fordham University, Carol Henger adds lysis buffer to a test tube containing fecal material. Photo by Linelle Abueg. \n\nWhen any creature defecates, it leaves behind cells on the surface of its waste. In those cells is DNA, which will reveal to researchers how New York City’s coyotes are related. This is where Carol Henger comes in. The Fordham University Ph.D. student can often be found in the lab, carefully scraping cells off coyote poop and analyzing them for DNA. \nA former zookeeper—she cared for primates at the Bronx Zoo for 10 years—Henger had no idea there were coyotes in New York City when she decided to pursue a doctorate in biology. During the course of researching schools, she came across the website of her current advisor, Jason Munshi-South. “He had a clip where he was giving a TED Talk and he mentioned coyotes were in New York City,” she says. “I was surprised. And I was like, ‘I have to study this.’” Munshi-South was helping the Gotham Coyote Project collect scat to analyze it for DNA. Henger wanted in. \nThe scat comes to Henger in paper bags marked with details of where the samples were collected. If the scat is frozen—as it might be if the sample was moist when it was collected—it goes in the freezer. If it’s dry, she pops it into the filing cabinet she has converted for that purpose. “You really want to make sure a sample is dried out before you store it, or else it can get moldy,” she says. \nWhen it’s time to process a sample, Henger removes it from storage and, using disposable plastic forceps, takes it out of the bag and places it on a sterilized petri dish. Next, she uses a scalpel to scrape off a tiny area of the outside of the scat. “I look for darker portions of the scat,” Henger says. “Anything furry will be prey DNA; dark areas have high fecal content,” which is where the coyote’s cells would be. She puts the scraping in a small test tube and fills it with lysis buffer, a solution that breaks open cells so scientists can analyze their compounds. After shaking the sample a bit, she puts it in an incubator and waits for the cells to open up—a process that, depending on the age of the specimen, can take anywhere from one to 12 hours. (To guard against contamination, everything from the petri dishes to the scalpel is single use and either thrown away or sterilized after it touches the scat. Henger also wipes down her work bench between processing scats.) \nOnce the cells are broken open, Henger adds Proteinase K, an enzyme that degrades the protein. “It can get in the way of extracting DNA,” she says. Centrifuging the sample will allow her to remove the liquid containing the proteins. \nFinally, she adds an elution buffer, a solvent that binds to the DNA, and then stores that sample until it’s time for analysis. “I take a little bit of DNA from the tube, and then I add primers to it,” Henger says. “Primers are short segments of DNA, and they’ll bind to other strands of DNA in the coyote samples.” Next, she adds polymerase, an enzyme that starts a chain reaction. The primers will amplify 11 different markers—two of which indicate the sex of the animal—in the DNA (she uses another set of markers to determine whether the scat came from a coyote or just a domestic dog or red fox). “Those markers are variable among individuals,” Henger says, “and that gives me a unique genotype for each coyote.” \nHenger has processed approximately 200 New York City scat samples since summer 2010, and the research is still ongoing; some of the processed samples, for example, didn’t reveal enough genetic information to identify individual coyotes. Still, she says, there are some preliminary findings. “Looking at 2010 to 2016, the samples that were collected those years, I have 20 individual genotypes,” she says. “Most of those—around 14—came from Pelham Bay Park, which is our most heavily sampled park just because it’s the biggest.” There are 35 identified individual coyotes in all: Most come from parks in the Bronx (Pelham Bay, Riverdale, Van Cortlandt, Ferry Point Park, Pugsley Creek), one sample comes from Inwood, and the rest come from Queens. \nAccording to her DNA analysis, the coyotes are highly related. For example, the sole coyote resident of a small park in Queens—a male the researchers have nicknamed Frankie, who was first spotted in the park in 2009—shares DNA with male coyotes whose scat was collected in Pelham Bay Park and Pugsley Creek (around 16 miles and 18 miles from the park in Queens, respectively). “He is second-order related (shares 25 percent of his DNA) to two male coyotes,” Henger says. “First-order relatedness indicates a parent-offspring or full sibling relationship—we can’t tell if it’s parent/offspring or sibling. Second-order relatedness indicates a half-sibling, an aunt or uncle to a niece or nephew, or a grandparent-grandchild relationship.” \nThere is a lot of first-order relatedness within parks and across parks, “which makes me think of offspring dispersing to a different park, trying to set up their new territory,” Henger says. “The fact that we’re seeing them moving through the city to get to different parks is a good sign, because it means they are able to move—they’re not getting stuck in this high level of urbanization.” They have high genetic diversity, too, which indicates that outside coyotes are coming in and keeping the gene pool fresh. \nThese coyotes are hybrids that carry wolf genes, although Nagy and Weckel prefer the term “Northeastern coyote” over the more popular “coywolf” portmanteau. That phrasing “makes it seem very simple, as if the animal you’re talking about is half coyote, half wolf, and it’s not,” Weckel says. But the animals aren’t a subspecies of wolf: According to The New York Times , a recent study confirmed that the gray wolf is the only true wolf species in North America. The “two other purported species, the Eastern wolf and the red wolf, are mixes of gray wolf and coyote DNA.” \nIn the future, Henger would like to collaborate with researchers outside of New York City to figure out where the coyotes came from. “My hypothesis,” she says, “is that a lot of these guys came from an initial population that settled in Pelham Bay, probably from Westchester”—more than 20 miles north of Pelham Bay—“and then they’ve been dispersing from there to other parks.” She also plans to use the data she’s compiling to create a landscape model that will help her determine which corridors the coyotes are using to get around. “That would be important in terms of conservation,” she says. “We may want to conserve that area of connectivity from development.” \nWhen Henger is finished with the scat, its journey isn’t over. Next up is an hour-long subway ride to the American Museum of Natural History, where scientists and their interns will process the poop. They start by making what they call scat tea. Hair, bone, and other prey items isolated from coyote scat in test tubes at the American Museum of Natural History. Photo by Erin McCarthy. \nPoop can give us DNA, which shows coyote relatedness—but that’s not all it can tell us. Analyzing the contents of poop also reveals what this new population is eating. Figuring that out falls to Neil Duncan , collections manager of the mammalogy department at AMNH, and four high school students with the museum’s Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP). “They’re spending hours and hours that I don’t always have,” he says. “With four people working, it’s an extra day every week of research that I wouldn’t get to do.” \nThe students—all of them young women—were not aware they’d be dealing with poop when they signed up for the program, but it didn’t freak them out. “I thought it was cool because it was about coyotes in New York City,” 18-year-old Olivia Asher tells mental_floss when we pop by the museum to take a look at their research. “The unpleasant part doesn’t outweigh the cool part of it.” \nAnd so they've spent the school year donning latex gloves and processing poop. First, they place the scat—each of which has an identifying number that corresponds to a data sheet—in the foot of a nylon stocking. (Asher pulls out a box of L’eggs Everyday Knee Highs. “They can’t be the leg, they have to just be the foot,” she explains; cutting the stockings would fray them and make them difficult to use.) Next, the stocking scat is dunked in a bucket of water, massaged to break up the poop, and “steeped” by placing it in a bucket of water, where it's left to soak overnight, creating the so-called “scat tea.” The next day, they remove the prey matter from the stocking and put it in a sieve to run it under water, which, according to 17-year-old Rita Rozovskiy, “isolates the prey items and eliminates the fecal matrix.” Translation: The poop melts away, leaving just what the coyote ate behind. \nThe team separates classes of prey items into separate vials—hair in one, bone fragments in another, and so on—numbered to identify which scat it came from. They then try to identify the prey items; to do it, they rely heavily on AMNH’s collection of study skins and skeletons. Looking at the scale (exterior) and medullary (interior) patterns of hair helps them identify some species, while looking at the incisors and molars in the scat helps them ID others. Bone fragments help them narrow down the size class of the species they are looking for. But just one identifier wouldn’t do; they can't declare a prey item identified until they have multiple lines of evidence. \nIt is difficult, painstaking work. Identifying scale patterns, for example, requires the students to slather nail polish on a slide, drop in a hair, and wait for a moment; after carefully removing the hair, they look at the scale pattern under a microscope and use a guide to figure out what animal it is. Asher spent nearly a month trying to identify a single hair that turned out to be from a coyote. But, according to Duncan, her time wasn't wasted—it was all part of the scientific process. He said that the students asked each other, “Yes, it’s coyote, but do you think it ate a coyote?” The answer: probably not. “Look at the evidence: It’s a single hair,” he says. “It wasn’t a clump of hair. Whether it was play, grooming behavior—who knows.” \nThe team processed 49 scat samples over the course of the school year, and although their results are preliminary, and by no means complete, so far they’ve found that New York City’s coyotes enjoy a very diverse diet. Mostly, they’re eating small mammals like squirrels, muskrats, meadow voles, and rabbits, which make up 19 percent of what was found in the scat, followed by birds (17 percent) and deer (14 percent; deer was only found in scat collected in Pelham Bay Park, which has a robust deer population). Fruit and seed were found in 13 percent of the scats. \n“Surprisingly, trash was not a big portion of the diet, [which] we expected because there’s a lot of trash in New York,” 17-year-old Sandra Lewocki explains. But analysis of diet studies conducted in other urban areas reveals that anthropogenic items aren’t a big part of any urban coyote’s diet. The comparison also revealed that New York City’s coyotes appear to eat more birds than other urban coyotes do. \nThe team hasn’t found any rats, either, but as Duncan points out, “it certainly doesn’t mean that they’re not in there.” He told the students that, once they positively identified the hair of one species, they should go through all of their samples and pull out similar looking hairs. “So these large numbers of muskrats or squirrels are part of our surveying technique,” he says. “I think rats will come, we just haven’t found any yet.” \nDuncan will continue to do prey analysis with Asher—who stayed on after her internship ended last summer—and two new SRMP students. “What’s going to be interesting is, as we find out the diet of these coyotes in Queens, and if they move into Brooklyn and thereon to Long Island, [we’ll see] how the diet is going to differ across these more urban geographic areas,” he says. “I think that’s going to be a significant part of the story.” Gotham Coyote Project \n\nMake no mistake: Though Long Island has not yet been colonized by coyotes, colonization is inevitable. (T here is currently one resident; a family pack that once lived there has since dispersed.) Thanks to high birth rates and their incredible ability to adapt to situations and landscapes, attempts to eradicate the animals end in failure. We couldn’t get rid of them if we tried—and Americans have tried. According to National Geographic , in the 1920s, the Bureau of Biological Survey—which had pretty much gotten rid of wolves—began a campaign to eradicate coyotes using poison. Between 1947 and 1956, the agency killed about 6.5 million coyotes in the West. As Dan Flores, author of Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History , explained, “When they’re persecuted, they tend to abandon the pack strategy and scatter across the landscape in singles and pairs. And the poison campaign was one of the things that kept scattering them across North America.” Normal litter sizes, he said, are five or six pups, but “When their populations are suppressed, their litters get up as high as 12 to 16 pups. You can reduce the numbers of coyotes in a given area by 70 percent but the next summer their population will be back to the original number.” \nThere are already five coyote breeding sites in the Bronx—again, the only part of New York City connected to mainland New York—which was the easy part. What’s ahead is much harder: They’ll have to traverse train tracks, scamper over bridges, and swim rivers and the Long Island Sound to settle new territory and begin breeding. But it’s just a matter of time until one (or more) of them completes the odyssey. “It’s just a numbers game,” Nagy says. “It’s hard enough for one coyote to make it. Then it needs to find a suitable place to set up territory, and then another coyote has to do [the same thing], and that coyote has to be the opposite sex and find its way to the exact same place that that first coyote went to. So it’s tricky, but it will happen. This is the story that’s been played out across the whole continent.” \nWhen it does happen, the scientists will look back at all the data they’ve gathered to see how things change. “As coyotes eventually make their way into Long Island, we’ll see, presumably, some sort of change in the whole community,” Nagy says. \nTake, for example, how the coyotes will affect the red fox population. Foxes eat small rodents that harbor Lyme disease; if the coyotes push the smaller foxes out, will there be more rodents and more Lyme disease? “Queens and Long Island give you a pretty good experimental setup in the field,” Nagy says, “where you can measure all sorts of things before coyotes got there and afterwards and in the future and see what changes.” Gotham Coyote Project \nAs the coyotes conquer more and more territory, we’ll have to learn to live alongside them—and educating the public about how to do that falls to Carrero and her colleagues at the Parks Department. “People think they’re dangerous, or that they’re a lot bigger than they are,” Carrero says. “We explain to people that they’re predators, [but] they’re not going to pick a fight they’re not going to win. You explain that they’re maybe 40 pounds at most. You explain that research has been done for stomach content analysis, and most of it is rodents. Once the fear goes away, people usually just want to see one and ask me where they can.” \nSome people are surprised when they see a coyote in an urban environment, but others display that very New York attitude: indifference. On a recent call, Carrero supervised the release of a coyote that had been trapped in someone’s backyard. After it was tranquilized and cleared by a vet, Carrero and crew took the coyote to a park for the release, angling the cage toward a wooded area. “With their coloration, they just need to go in 10 yards, and they vanish,” Carrero says. “We pointed him at this beautifully camouflaged forest, and he just went right through a small patch of trees where there was an obvious open area on the other side and ran between the only two groups of people in the park!” \nWhen Carrero went over to see if they had any questions about what had just happened, the people did have one question: Why did she have handcuffs? “That’s the only thing they asked me!” she says, laughing. (Park Rangers are also Special Patrolmen; they’re deputized by the NYPD to make arrests.) “I don’t know if maybe they thought it was a stray dog”—perhaps like she did, all those years ago—“or maybe they’re used to seeing them in the area. But nobody said anything.” \nThe Gotham Coyote Project has relied on the public’s help to track coyotes. If you think you’ve seen one of these animals, report it here . More from mental_floss... ",

      "text": "“Mom, not everything you read on Facebook is real,” I said to her in Spanish.\nShe was insistent that a remake of Forrest Gump was going to be filmed in our small town of Beaumont. She even knew that Channel 18 reported it.\nI quickly reminded her there’s no local news outlet called Channel 18 News in southeast Texas. But I was still curious, so I logged on to Facebook and found that many of my hometown friends, too, were sharing the article.\nIt was entirely false.\nYet the article still lives online and may make yet another round on the internet.\nThe false news epidemic is getting a lot of attention, especially after an election where many false or misleading articles led Facebook’s trending list. It’s worrisome in an age where 6 out of 10 Americans use social media platforms to consume news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.\nOn Monday, Google and Facebook announced plans to combat the problem through restrictions on advertising, Reuters reported.\nBut some are taking the matter of media literacy into their own hands. Melissa Zimdars, assistant professor of media studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, has created a list called “False, Misleading, Clickbait-y and Satirical ‘News’ Sources. “\nI love my mother dearly, but she could use some tips on verifying news sources. Zimdars’ list helps break down the red flags. Here are her tips, reprinted in full:\nAvoid websites that end in “lo” (example: Newslo) . These sites specialize in taking a piece of accurate information and then packaging that information with other false or misleading “facts.”\nWatch out for websites that end in “.com.co” — they are often fake versions of real news sources.\nWatch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes, lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.\nOdd domain names generally equal odd and rarely truthful news.\nLack of author attribution may, but not always, signify that the news story is suspect and requires verification.\nSome news organizations are also letting bloggers post under the banner of particular news brands; however, many of these posts do not go through the same editing process (example: BuzzFeed Community Posts, Kinja blogs, Forbes blogs).\nCheck the “About Us” tab on websites or look up the website on Snopes or Wikipedia for more information about the source.\nBad web design and use of ALL CAPS can also be a sign that the source you’re looking at should be verified and/or read in conjunction with other sources.\nIf the story makes you REALLY ANGRY, it’s probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn’t purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.\nIt’s always best to read multiple sources of information to get a variety of viewpoints and media frames. Some sources not yet included in this list (although their practices at times may qualify them for addition), such as The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post and Fox News, vacillate between providing important, legitimate, problematic and/or hyperbolic news coverage, requiring readers and viewers to verify and contextualize information with other sources.",

      "text": "In Hillary Clinton’s concession speech last Wednesday, she thanked supporters, activists, community leaders — and called upon the members of secret Facebook groups to speak out. “I want everybody coming out from behind that,” she said. “And make sure your voices are heard going forward.”\nIt was a small change to a personal message she had sent to Pantsuit Nation, an invite-only Facebook group, the week before. “For some of you, it’s been difficult to feel like you could wear your support on your sleeve,” that note read in part. “And that’s why this community has been such a special place.” The group was designed as a space to celebrate the first woman president, but it was particularly appealing to people who felt uncomfortable telling people in their real-world circles that they were voting for Clinton — ”blue dots” in the red seas of conservative states, as Chamberlain called them in a New York Times profile. In her pre-election confidence, Clinton appeared fine with that. But now the game has changed. \nLibby Chamberlain, who lives in the tiny coastal town of Brooklin, Maine, started Pantsuit Nation about three weeks before Election Day. It quickly racked up 3 million members despite its secrecy. Many in Pantsuit Nation have started referring to themselves as the “silent majority,” a term popularized by President Nixon to describe Middle Americans that didn’t receive the media attention the counter-culture forces of the time did. It was dredged up again most recently by Trump supporters, who while not literally the majority (Clinton won the popular vote) certainly were more widespread than polling suggested. But some of the women of Pantsuit Nation want to redefine the term to mean people who, out of politeness, apathy, or fear, didn’t say enough before Trump was elected, and now find themselves with a lot more to say. \nPantsuit Nation / Facebook Chamberlain posted a message to the group just hours after Clinton conceded. “This is just the beginning. Pantsuit Nation is MORE important today than it was yesterday,” she wrote. “Secretary Clinton called on us in her incredible, gracious speech this morning. We need to make our voices heard.” The reaction was swift: after a massive influx of activity, the moderators of Pantsuit Nation briefly shut off the ability to add new posts to the page due to the overwhelming response. Many of the posts were mournful, personal stories; others were efforts to connect emotionally. Some members posted Thanksgiving invitations for those who will find it hard to face their pro-Trump families for the holidays. But most of the posts were suggestions for next steps, a sort of rapid-fire spitball session, with one idea building off the next. \nThere’s an emerging push for Pantsuit Nation to become a super PAC, or another sort of official organization in which 3 million members paying even modest dues could quickly amass a fortune to be leveraged politically. In a phone interview with The Verge , however, Chamberlain emphasized that that option was not being considered. \nChamberlain herself says the group will remain primarily a safe space to share stories, and that storytelling “can be just as powerful in making a difference in the trajectory of our country” as more “visible or traditional” forms of activism like protesting and grassroots organizing. Chamberlain says she and a leadership team of volunteers are working on setting up a website that directs members to like-minded nonprofits and other places to donate money, and that they’ll follow Clinton’s directive to come out of hiding by setting up public Instagram and Twitter accounts. As for whether Pantsuit Nation’s national chapter is working on anything else, Chamberlain said “No, that’s about it.” \npantsuit nation will go public, as secretary clinton asked But some Pantsuit Nation members see a path forward in smaller, state-run chapters. Dozens of localized groups have popped up around the country — many in liberal areas like New York City, Ventura County, and Atlanta, but also in areas where Clinton struggled, like Florida, Central Pennsylvania, North Texas, and South Dakota. Over 30 more local chapters have sprung up for regions around the country; there’s even a group based in Germany. \nOne member points out that with a coalition of 3 million people, the group should easily be able to fund “watchers, moderators, platforms, buses to DC for protests.” “What about a voter relocation program for future elections?” another asks, adding that she might be willing to participate if some moving costs were defrayed. \nSome women offer up professional services, like a brand marketing executive who says “I would like to talk with you about organizing as a non-profit (or possibly for-profit) women’s leadership foundation. This is a pivotal time as you say. I have a 15-year-old daughter.”\nDona Murphey, an organizer from Texas, told The Verge in an email that she values the work the national group has done, but implied that local groups shouldn’t be waiting on marching orders. “Across the country, it seems many were waiting, and continue to wait, for specific direction from Pantsuit Nation,” she explains. “We decided early on to harness that energy and to move forward… even prior to the election, we focused heavily on how to channel positive energy into discrete change.” Murphey says the Texas group is referring to itself as the Pantsuit Republic, and will conduct polling this week to decide on three to four specific issues behind which they can mobilize.\nMurphey says one early priority for the group is to identify which groups of Texans voted for Clinton and why, and then figure out how to serve them with a unified political platform. They’ll focus grassroots political efforts, she says, on “catapulting Pantsuiters and our allies into public office.” The Texas group is also interested in creating economic pressure by supporting businesses with progressive worldviews and avoiding those that fall in line with Trump’s platform. To that end, they’ve established a database of small businesses owned by Pantsuit Republic members — which they’re calling “Pantsuit Yelp” — and are seeking developers interested in expanding the database into a nationwide tool.\nPantsuit Nation / Facebook Even in the week since the election, however, these broader ambitions are running up against logistical constraints. Elizabeth Rosen, an organizer in the Southwest Florida Pantsuit Nation group, told The Verge that she has started dedicating about three hours per day to the group: “Those are three very broken hours — respond to inquiries while running errands, adding group members between rushes at my family’s restaurant, banning trolls from my driveway.” Kasey Greenshaw, a registered Republican with some political experience from her time fundraising for a gubernatorial candidate in Oklahoma, wants to offer up her skills to a new, wide-ranging anti-Trump movement by creating voter guides and a grading system for politicians. But she’s also a mother with a full-time job and expresses concern about finding the time. \nIt’s a theme among the local and state-level page administrators: they’re not politicians. They have jobs, children, and full plates already. Like many of us, they have never been called upon to be this doggedly political in their lifetimes. We’ve seen online activists rally around a candidate or cause successfully (Bernie Sanders had a powerful coalition throughout the primaries), but many fizzle, and this one will be facing a particularly bleak landscape — one set to last at least four years. \nhow political do americans remember how to be? The group also finds itself serving as a microcosm of the struggle for inclusivity that came to the forefront in the 2016 campaign. The main Pantsuit Nation is largely white (at least in part because the invite-only structure encourages a homogenous group), and some women of color worry that their voices may get lost in the shuffle. “I’m a black woman living in Oregon. I’m concerned that there are no women of color in Pantsuit Nation,” writes one member. “Black women supported Hillary yet were excluded from these types of groups. If you are out there, would be good to know.”\nMurphey emphasized that the Texas page will not “censor” any of this conversation, adding “more so than has been explicit in the national organization, we believe it to be critical to engage in difficult dialogue.” \nEven with Clinton’s concession speech directive, some women still feel concerned about stepping out of the safety of a private Facebook group. Two women from Texas whom I reached out to told me that they weren’t comfortable having their names on the record as Clinton supporters. Rosen acknowledged that the secrecy of the groups is a tricky situation — it gives Pantsuit Nation an aura of being “exclusive,” but “maybe a blue dot on a red field doesn’t want everyone in his or her social media sphere to know about these affiliations.” \nShe did, however, concede that it’s more powerful to talk to people in person, noting that when Trump supporters read your posts on Facebook “they don’t see you as human, it’s just more words and more information.” \nPantsuit Nation / Facebook Something like Pantsuit Nation is what we were promised Facebook and Twitter and myriad forums would be for, and in a twisted way, the fact that it operates using the same structures as this election’s right-wing, often virulently racist groups should make us optimistic about its chances of success. \nThese tools were built with optimistic assumptions about humanity at their core, but whether out of neglect or because they were designed mostly by men who did not foresee that they would be used to carry out dogged harassment, they’ve become places for trolls to thrive and launch hateful attacks. This election has already shown that grassroots online communities can be a powerful political force, in the form of largely white men coming together on the internet to collectively embolden each other, on places like Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan. Facebook also provided a place to gather, and its mechanics helped radicalize people who were not already radical , pushing them to places where they felt safe to express hatred and resentment. \nthis is what we were promised social media was for Pantsuit Nation also started as a space for people who didn’t feel like they had a place to affirm their beliefs — it swelled and convinced them that like-minded people exist and are everywhere. In some of the conversations on the page, you can see people going from individually sad to collectively emboldened to action. It may be the first liberal American political movement to experience such a wild leg up — taking less than a month to nab millions of loyal adherents. Black Lives Matter, the obvious precursor, has leveraged Twitter and Vine to get news coverage of protests and police violence but has never been gifted quite so unwieldy a crowd in one place. \nThree million people looped together is an activist jackpot, but the question now is whether Pantsuit Nation’s offshoots are willing to do something more than support each other on the internet. (They already have an advantage over trolls by way of using their real names). This online behemoth could be galvanized into a real political force, and if it does it will be fascinating to watch. But nearly half of the US didn’t participate in this election. When future generations write term papers about it, they’ll discuss the danger of sitting things out. If Pantsuit Nation doesn’t take real action, it will become yet another failure of the many to opt-in for democracy.",

Show Caption Previous Next \nSARASOTA, Fla. - The day after ABC Action News spoke to a parent whose child was enrolled at Kinderhouse Preschool in Sarasota, the director kicked the child out. \nThe parent told us she was penalized for exercising her right to free speech and raising awareness about the daycare. \nThe dismissal of Erica Baldwin’s daughter, 3, stems from comments posted on a Facebook page regarding the staff’s decision not to let parents know they were under investigation by the state of Florida for leaving a 4-year-old child in a van during a field trip. The child was left in the van for two hours while under the care of the Director Laura Marrone and two other staff members, according to a letter released by the Florida Department of Health. \n“A lot of anger comes from this, a lot of anger. Because, I feel like they were trying to cover something up,” Erica Baldwin said. \nBaldwin said after she talked to ABC Action News on Tuesday, the director approached her the next day with a quote from our report questioning her for talking to the media. Baldwin says the director then handed her other Facebook posts her husband made asking questions about why parents didn’t know the daycare where their child was enrolled was under investigation by the Department of Children and Families for allegations of abuse or neglect. \n“What if it was a longer field trip? What if that child was left in there for more than two hours? There could've been serious consequences and they are not looking at that side of it. He was ok, so the situation is ok, and it's not,” Baldwin said. \nAccording to the report the Director of Kinderhouse Preschool, Laura Marrone, was involved in the incident. \nThe report states, \"You and the two staff members involved in the incident confirmed the incident. During the investigation we discussed the importance of compliance with the supervision and transportation rules. Technical support was provided in order to bring the facility into compliance and to prevent any future non- compliances.” RELATED: Daycare left 4 year old in hot van for two hours during field trip \nMarrone would not comment only telling ABC Action News reporter Michael Paluska to leave the property as she called the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office. \nThe daycare paid a $250 fine and according to the report had to complete a Corrective Action Plan. Marrone and the two other unnamed staff members were also required to “complete the DCF (2) hours online Transportation Safety class within 15 working day of the receipt of this letter.” \nBaldwin said they planned to find a new daycare for their daughter because of how the owners handled what happened. She also thinks the punishment handed down by the Department of Health was lenient compared to what a parent might have faced if they found themselves in the same situation. \n“A parent might go to jail,” Baldwin said. “I feel like they were trying to defend themselves more than to have compassion for the situation and sympathy for the parents and the child. I just feel like they were trying to defend themselves.” \nThe investigative report for Abuse/Neglect is still pending by the Department of Children and Families. \nThere are a number of resources online for parents searching for the right preschool or daycare facility.

      "text": "SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Image People use computers at an internet cafe in the Tondo district of Manila, the Philippines. Facebook rumors force a well-known politician to publish proof of his heritage. Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman's noose. A politician's aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl's corpse — an image that turns out to come from another country. \nAnother day on social media for Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump ? Think again. \nThose incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media's outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States. \nMore from New York Times: \nSocial media's globe-shaking power \nChange Safari's search engine under the hood \nHow not to overpay on Black Friday? Let the web be your guide \nWell before last week's American election threw Facebook's status as a digital-era news source into the spotlight, leaders, advocacy groups and minorities worldwide have contended with an onslaught of online misinformation and abuse that has had real-world political repercussions. And for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news. \nNow Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late. \n\"They should have done this way earlier,\" said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook's fastest-growing markets. \"We already saw the warning signs of this years ago.\" \nOn Thursday, President Obama, speaking in Berlin and standing alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel , criticized Facebook and other social media for disseminating fake news. He became so impassioned that at one point he lost track of the question he was answering. \n\"If everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect,\" Mr. Obama said. \nThe impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook's global reach — roughly a quarter of the world's population now has an account — is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say. \nSome governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. Ms. Merkel has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia's government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons. \nFacebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards. \n\"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" Mark Zuckerberg , the company's chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. \"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\" \nFacebook's power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself — but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news. \nOne such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte's bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts. \nFacebook users in the Philippines shared an article that reported NASA had voted the country's leader, Rodrigo Duterte, \"the best president in the solar system.\" \n\nTens of thousands of Philippine Facebook users also recently shared a story claiming that NASA had voted Mr. Duterte \"the best president in the solar system.\" While many commenters on the Facebook post took it as a joke, some appeared to take it seriously. And an image of Leila de Lima, a local lawmaker and a critic of Mr. Duterte, depicted her facing a hangman's noose. \n\"Facebook hasn't led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,\" said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. \"Voices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse.\" \nIn Indonesia, where Facebook is so popular that some people confuse it with the broader internet, the service has considerable sway. \nWhen Joko Widodo, Indonesia's president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist — severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn't Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting. \n\"The fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,\" said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election. \nThe online misinformation has not been limited to elections. In Colombia, Facebook users widely shared a crudely altered photo of a pop singer, Juanes, wearing a T-shirt suggesting he opposed a peace deal with the country's largest rebel group. On Twitter, Juanes denied it. Colombia's voters narrowly rejected the deal in a referendum last month. \nTwitterJuanes \nWhile Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus. \nEven in long-established democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up grass-roots populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support. \nNow, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary — so far — standards to police hate speech online. \nIn Germany, Ms. Merkel's push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online. \n\"Algorithms must be more transparent,\" Ms. Merkel has said, \"so that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others.\" \nOther politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further. \nIn some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections. \nChristian Echle, director of the Sub-Sahara Africa media program at Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, a German political foundation, said such actions were heavy-handed and that social media had played a role in helping voters — many located far from urban centers — to gain access to much-needed information and interact with political candidates. \nBut, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust. \n\"There's a big, big threat — that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,\" said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. \"People are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes.\"",

Once we checked in, we were greeted by engineering director Jeff Reynar and corporate communications manager Jamil Walker. Sarah Jacobs The first thing that jumped out at us on the tour was this physical embodiment of a Facebook \"wall.\" Reynar told us New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker recently stopped by to sign it. “What’s kind of fun about this is that there’s a wall at most of our offices,\" Reynar says. \"It’s kind of temporary. At some point, we’ll probably do some kind of construction and this will go away and we’ll start a fresh one with new signatures.\" Sarah Jacobs Across all of its 66 offices and data centers worldwide, Facebook — which has a market cap of $280 billion as of mid-November — employs almost 16,000 people. About 1,000 of them work in the Frank Gehry-designed Manhattan location, which also houses members of the company's Instagram team. Facebook occupies four floors of the building, which was once a Wanamaker's department store. Sarah Jacobs Source: Markets Insider\nBecause the office is huge and employs so many workers, it can be easy to lose track of people. This screen allows you to type in a employee's name and it will show you where they sit. Sarah Jacobs Early on in our tour, we spotted the famous \"tiny room.\" This space includes a miniature deer head mounted on the wall, a little couch, and smaller versions of posters actually hanging in the office. Celebrities like singer Selena Gomez and model Ashley Graham have snapped photos in this spot and posted them to their Instagram pages. Sarah Jacobs Our next stop was the office's new media space, used for filming Facebook Live interviews. The spot features a fully-lit stage and a classic view of New York City. Reynar says celebrity sightings aren't rare around the Facebook office. Recently, the cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" swung by for an interview. Sarah Jacobs The Facebook New York office — home to the engineering, sales, and HR teams, among others — features an open layout. Sarah Jacobs \"Though everybody has a desk in the middle of the floor, you’ll also see that there are lots of quiet, tucked away corners where you can go sit on a couch, sit on a chair, and get some work done away from the hustle and bustle of your team,\" Reynar says. Sarah Jacobs Like this one ... Sarah Jacobs ... and this one. Sarah Jacobs \"It’s a nice, high energy place to work,\" Reynar says. Sarah Jacobs If you're looking for an especially quiet place to escape, the office library offers just that. Sarah Jacobs We asked Reynar about the culture. As we passed this sign, he explained that traditions like \"hackathons\" are crucial for helping the company to maintain its startup feel as it grows. Sarah Jacobs Another thing Facebook is famous for: the food. Sarah Jacobs We saw several snack bars around the office throughout our tour. All food and drinks are completely free (and unlimited!) for employees. Sarah Jacobs Facebook staffs a culinary team that works out of a fully-equipped commercial kitchen. Favorites include the pizza station, the salad bar, and the frozen yogurt, which is made in the office. The office even employs a pastry chef. Sarah Jacobs \"The food is great and the menu is different every day, which is really nice,\" Reynar says. \"We get breakfast, lunch, dinner and coffee. You don't always have to go out to a restaurant.” However, he notes that Facebook also encourages its employees to get out and explore the surrounding neighborhood establishments. Sarah Jacobs Facebook is in the process of building a second cafeteria in their New York office. Until construction is done, Facebook employees are enjoying meals from these subway-themed food trucks. Sarah Jacobs The perks aren't limited to the food. Employees can also enjoy board games or virtual reality sessions in the office. Sarah Jacobs Employees can also hit up this free vending machine if they ever need batteries, a new mouse, or a new keyboard. Sarah Jacobs But this office's defining trait is its art. There are creative works scattered throughout the floors, created by visiting artists and employees alike. Sarah Jacobs Employees can design and print their own posters to decorate the walls at the office's analog research laboratory. Sarah Jacobs There are also murals and posters around every corner. Much of the art reflects Facebook's values. These posters demonstrate the tech giant's support of gay pride ... Sarah Jacobs ... as does this colorful flower wall. \"There’s a lot of art that’s influenced by openness, connectedness, and the company mission of connecting the world,\" Reynar says. Sarah Jacobs “Rather than just going out and buying cool art and hanging it up somewhere, we get the artist to come in and make the art here,\" Reynar says. \"It’s kind of fun because not only do the employees get to hang out and chat with the artist about what they’re doing and why, but Facebook sort of gets to influence the theme somewhat.\" Sarah Jacobs Sometimes, decorating the office also allows for teams to collaborate on fun projects. These \"space hacks\" involve figuring out creative ways to design or utilize spaces. This purple electrical display on the left is one space hack. Sarah Jacobs Here's another space hack, where employees set up a costume wall. Sarah Jacobs Reynar says he watched from his desk as an artist painted this mural, which is a physical manifestation of the crowdsourced \"Manhattan Memories Map\" — a global project that asked New Yorkers to share memories on Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag #manhattanmemoriesmap. Sarah Jacobs Source: Facebook\nOne of the most remarkable pieces of art hangs in the staircase between the eighth and seventh floors. This piece incorporates thousands of strands of thread connecting the ceiling to the floor. As you walk up the stairs, it shimmers and appears to move. Sarah Jacobs \"I think both the kind of colorful nature of the space and all the comfortable seating and the art in particular would surprise a lot of people,\" Reynar says. \"It's a little more vibrant than you might expect.\" Sarah Jacobs Before we left, we checked out one final perk: a fantastic view of New York City. Reynar says that the Manhattan office's eclectic, industrial look is meant to both provide employees with a positive, vibrant workspace and reflect the motto, \"this journey is 1% finished.\" \"It’s supposed to look like a work in progress,\" Reynar told Business Insider. \"We're only getting started.\" Sarah Jacobs SEE ALSO: A look inside $23 billion LinkedIn's New York office, where employees enjoy perks like free gourmet meals and a speakeasy hidden in the Empire State Building DON'T MISS: A look inside Uber's Manhattan office, where employees of the $66 billion company have wine on tap and can bring their dogs to work DON'T FORGET: A look inside the New York office of Yelp, a $3 billion company that offers its 4,000 employees around the world some of the most incredible perks More: Features Facebook Office Tour Manhattan",

(Photo: The Arizona Republic/ City of Chicago) \nThis much has always been true: When you’re a kid, the experience of moving to a different city and leaving behind friends and familiar places can feel like something approaching death. But in the 21st century, there’s a new twist: It’s easier to take your old hometown with you. \nI didn’t know that when, at 11 years old, my world was rocked by a series of events. My parents got divorced. My mom decided to get remarried. And to accommodate my soon-to-be stepdad and his stable pre-Great Recession job, my mom, my two younger sisters, and I left my hometown of Chicago and moved to Phoenix. Phoenix and Chicago can feel like neighbors \nThose two places are more than 1,700 miles apart. But I would discover that at this moment in U.S. history, two big American cities, both full of people from someplace else, can feel like neighbors, no matter the distance between them. And so, nine years after arriving in Phoenix, I still identify as a Chicagoan. It’s not just because that’s where I was born — it’s because Phoenix has reinforced that identity. \nI arrived, of course, kicking and screaming. Before I moved here, my preconceived notions of Phoenix were similar to what I had seen in old Western movies that I watched with my grandfather: a barren wasteland of desert, filled with nothing more than tumbleweeds blowing in the hot wind, and shootouts between John Wayne-esque cowboys. I can still feel the uncomfortably hot breeze on my face as I stepped off the plane in July 2007. (For the lucky ones who are unfamiliar, a Phoenix breeze in July feels like the strong whisper of a hot breath in your ear — only one that encompasses your entire body.) It was nearly exactly how I had pictured it, only instead of cowboys there were middle-class, white Americans who felt the need to open-carry into the local Walmart. Because, Arizona. 'It's a dry heat,' and 4 other popular myths about Phoenix's high temperatures Adjusting to a desert city \nAt first, I didn’t care much for the desert urban reality. I hated it. I despised it. I loathed it. Phoenix is a difficult city to relate to. How can you relate to a city? I know you’re thinking. Take one stroll through Chicago and you’ll understand. The city is full of life, echoing with the sounds of street performers and rumbling under the rush of the Loop train. Chicago is one of the biggest cities in the nation, but everyone seems to know one another. It’s a major city that feels like a small town. \nI missed it. But the more time I spent in Phoenix, the more I realized that Chicago’s roots extended well outside the Windy City. Phoenix is rich in expats like me. Many people moved here from someplace else, so all kinds of Midwestern transplants like me were looking for new friends and communities where they belonged. I was especially lucky that many Phoenicians are originally from Chicago, and came here to escape the cold, find more affordable living, or find work.

The Mesa ballpark is home to the Chicago Cubs. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nMy family and I slowly connected with other Chicagoans, both in person and online. Some of our neighbors turned out to be from Chicago as well, creating a familiar feel within our neighborhood. My family joined Facebook forums focused on uniting Chicagoans in Phoenix and we used the sports cultures to keep connected. We watched or attended Chicago Cubs vs. Arizona Diamondbacks games, Chicago Bears vs. Arizona Cardinals games, and, ahem, Stanley Cup Champions Chicago Blackhawks vs. Arizona Coyotes games. \nAfter I began my freshman year at Arizona State University, the connection between the city that I loved and the city that I was thrust into only grew stronger. I ran into more and more students or faculty who were from Chicago, coming for the academics (or the parties) and bringing their Windy City pride with them. I was no longer a lone outsider struggling to find an identity in this new home. My identity as a Phoenix resident was molded by my love and pride for my old home, one that I could share with other, like-minded Chicagoans around me. \nA taste of Chicago with deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in Phoenix. (Photo: Lou Malnati's Pizzeria) \nThroughout the nine years I’ve lived in the Valley, I watched the Windy City get blown across state lines. The market of Chicago-themed sports bars boomed. The Cubs established a new spring training stadium in Mesa. Often, more Chicago sports fans showed up to Arizona games than home-team fans. Wearing your team’s gear would inevitably get you a “Hey, go Cubs!” or “Da Bears!” as you walked down the street. Classic Chicago food joints such as Portillo’s began popping up. Chicago wasn’t just housed within the confines of Chicago anymore. Slowly but surely, Chicago subsumed itself into Phoenix, giving the city an entirely new identity. \nRELATED: Cubs craze boosts metro Phoenix businesses \nWhile Phoenix still isn’t, and never could be, as beloved to me as Chicago, I’ve grown to accept and rejoice in the merging of my two cities. I can take a shuttle to Sloan Park and sing along to “Go, Cubs, Go” as the Cubs take on the Los Angeles Angels . I can go down to Lou Malnati’s and grab a classic, deep-dish pizza. I can impress my friends and total strangers with an occasional slip into my accent. I can fend off jokes about being too cold in 60-degree weather. \nYou can take the girl out of Chicago, but you can never take Chicago out of the girl — thanks to the welcoming arms of a Sun Belt city like Phoenix. \nJessica Suerth is a sustainability fellow at Zócalo Public Square and a journalism student at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nNorwegian Air Shuttle is currently offering incredible prices on trips to Scandinavia from tons of different cities across the US. Fly from New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), Fort Lauderdale (FLL), Los Vegas (LAS), Oakland (OAK) and Orlando (MCO) to Copenhagen (CPH), Oslo (OSL), Stockholm (ARN) and Helsinki (HEL) from just $274 round-trip! Though availability varies per itinerary, these fares are generally available for departures from January through April 2017.\nNote that Norwegian will add fees for just about everything from checked bags to in-flight food, so your fare could be a little higher than what you see when you go to book. If you’re looking for more perks included in the ticket price, you can try out Norwegian’s premium product , which includes larger seats, lounge access, free checked bags, seat assignment and meals.\nAirline: Norwegian\nRoute: JFK, LAX, SFO, FLL, LAS, OAK, MCO — CPH, HEL, OSL, ARN\nCost: $247+ round-trip in economy\nDates: January — May 2017\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nNew York (JFK) to Oslo (OSL) for $146 + 1,099 NOK = $274 round-trip in February: \n\n\nNew York (JFK) to Stockholm (ARN) for $136 + 1,299 SEK = $276 round-trip in February: \n\n\nOakland (OAK) to Stockholm (ARN) for $166 + 1,199 SEK = $296 round-trip in February: \n\n\nFort Lauderdale (FLL) to Copenhagen (CPH) for $189 + 1,080 DKK = $343 round-trip in January: \n\n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship\nThis Is The Most Significant Time In Human History! Commentary On Prime Creator Prophecies: 2.5 Million Spaceships Arrive Via Portal! Divine Intervention Update Over Next Two Months, Meat Eaters Will Have Many Problems From Now On, Many Will Have Extensive Flu-Like Symptoms, Extraction Of Souls Leaving Planet Has Begun I hope this message finds you in good spirits, there APPEAR to be lots of fear in the world, however the reality is that THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR.\nThere are very significant implications as a result from the following news update from Prime Creator.\nFirst of all here are the messages from Prime Creator to REVIEW:\n 2.5 Million Spaceships Arrive Via Portal! Divine Intervention Update Over Next Two Months, Says Prime Creator!!! Meat Eaters Will Have Many Problems From Now On, Many Will Have Extensive Flu-Like Symptoms, Extraction Of Souls Leaving Planet Has Begun\nLast Phase of Ascension Revealed by Prime Creator! Six Weeks Left of 3D Earth Matrix! Divine Intervention Timeline, Matches Ascension Timeline! This Means Major Inner Reality Shift Around December 21, 2016\n1. Messages from Prime Creator are the HIGHEST IMPORTANCE… what news source knows more Hmmm???? Got your head screwed on properly on this, because if you don’t, you’re gonna miss the boat.\n2. Messages of the highest importance, are for you to share… compare how many bits of information you share, that DISTRACT away from PRIME CREATOR, and you’ll get an idea where you actually are at.\n3. Prime Creator says 2.5 million ships are now in our sector, and are ready to help us out. Because this is a FREEWILL UNIVERSE, this situation requires that HUMANITY CONTACTS OUR SPACE VISITORS FIRST, not the other way around!\n4. The dialogue with our visiting extraterrestrial family, must be guided by us… how do we want this to unfold? Do we want them to just be floating around out there, or do we give them direction? Do we INVITE THEM TO OUR SHORES? Do we invite them to invite us aboard their ships? Do we request help with cleaning up our lives? The list here is endless? This is the fun part… imagine working with millions of spaceships… who take direction from we, the ground crew.\n5. Prime Creator has talked about the three waves of ascension, of those who desire to RAISE THEIR FREQUENCIES, to embody soul, and not ego.\n6. Those earthlings who are not ready for ascension, are being removed from this planet. Some will go to a hologram, some will die, some will cease to exist.\nAndromedans: New Earth Approaching Fast… Many Will Be Leaving! 7. Those earthlings who choose ascension, will be helped by galactic visitors, to raise our frequencies, do final dna upgrades, energy clearings, galactic mentorship… so we can learn how to manage live on RESTORED GAIA, who has a new name.\nMother Earth (Gaia) Has A New Fifth Dimensional Name… Be One Of The First Humans To Find Out What It Is 8. Essentially, the light is flooding earth, more and more, and then… more. Many humans are stuck in 3D living, which involves eating poisonous food, that blocks out light. Humans are addicted to eating glue (gluten), eating animals that are inflammed, monoculture toxic foods void of minerals… living as if emotions don’t matter, and neither do thoughts… and these are the ones that will greatly stuggle to the end of their lives, not because they are not worthy because we all are, but because they choose to live with blockages to Light, and thus, to soul.\n9. Prime Creator says much of the 3D matrix no longer even exists… it’s gone! No more illuminati controlling the ley lines, no more are artificial lifeforms, dictating our lives… however, keep in mind and heart, that many of us are addicted to limited thoughtforms… and have no real practice in this lifetime, of living as an UNLIMITED BEING. Many humans are actually controlled by their bodies, and don’t even mind… except for that nagging feeling of constant dissatisfaction.\n10. If you choose soul… tell Prime Creator…. choose something, that is not a facade, and that actually feels good… your constant search for your next fix, will cease.\n11. If you are choosing to mess with other humans, your life will not be much more chock full of lessons, that you have asked for… don’t blame anyone but yourself.\n12. The third grand experiment is ending, if you don’t know what that means… you are not alone, but that in and of itself, is no excuse to live in ignorance.\nEnd Your Experiment In Duality With This Main Ascension Manual\nThird Grand Experiment Ends With World Population Becoming Rich (NESARA/GESARA), And Nibiru Witnessed By Masses In December! Golden Age Created Now By Lightworkers!\nSeptember 26-29 Third Wave Of Ascension Portal Opens, And Closes In December, Then The Third Grand Experiment Comes To Close… Forever! We Have Just Entered Most Significant Time In Human History!\nIs it possible to be in the most signficant time in human history, and have most of humans not be aware of that fact?…. yup.\nWe are very powerful, however that inner power often goes unacknowledged, because we expect others to see it, to confirm it for us….\nWhat if we are powerful, and we do not need others to confirm it for us… if they don’t, are we still powerful?\nDo think the Pleiadian mothercraft occupants have been smoking too much spaceweed, or do they know something? Great Pleiadian Mothercraft Holds Ceremony to Honour Great Event… Third Wave of Ascension Doorway of Immortality Opens September-December, First Requirement Is to Reblend With Higher Self, Only Incarnations of Higher Self, Will Be Born After December 21, 2016\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship crap.\nDump Trump and replace his administration with a Marxist totalitarian regime which will kill America once an d for all.\nWill Trump be impeached? Will he be forced resign? Neither event is going to happen. First of all, Trump cannot be impeached, he has not even taken office. What is going on in America today is history in the making. The United States is witnessing an overt attempt to perpetuate a Marxist-socialist revolution led by the youth, and many of the them are being paid as evidenced by various Facebook posts and advertisements. As I reported yesterday, this new horizon in American politics is being ushered in by Obama, Soros and Hillary. Hillary seems happy with these riots as she called for people to never give up. In other words, don’t accept the will of the people and create as much mayhem and madness as possible.\nHuey Long and the Great Depression This has only happened in American history one time before. These Marxist revolutionary events transpired in the early days of the Great Depression. A socialist rebel named Huey Long, who reminds me of Bernie Sanders, posed a credible threat to the FDR. He wanted a 100% tax on all incomes of over $1 million per year. Long wanted to redistribute the wealth downward, as opposed to upward. He wanted term limits on politicians. Long was gaining political momentum when he was assassinated. One has to understand that Long, an avowed socialist, was opposing FDR, an avowed socialist with a twist. FDR was taking money from the middle class and giving it to the wealthy. There were two flavors of socialism and the establishment candidate prevailed because of an assassins bullet. The implication for Trump is obvious.\nToday, the populist Trump, has more free-market ideas than any politician has expressed in a very long time. Trump’s capitalist ideas run contrary to Marxist Socialist views and actions of today’s establishment. We must fervently pray that Trump does not suffer the same fate as Huey Long.\nThe Democrats Are Trying to Destroy America George Soros, on behalf of the Marxist socialist establishment, is perpetuating a rising tide of civil unrest. The Democrats are absolutely intent on burning down democracy and installing traditional Marxist polices since they do not win the election. There is no question that Soros is a domestic terrorist and he is clearly behind the rising tide of violence. However, America has become so lawless that Soros, like Clinton, is untouchable, no matter how many people die.\nAs I have previously demonstrated, there is no shortage of evidence surfacing showing that these protesters are being paid by organizations which are bankrolled by Soros and these ads are increasing in number on Craig’s List and this is taking place all around the country. America is sitting on a powder keg that has already been lit.\nConclusion There can be no doubt that this movement is attempting to supplant a legitimate political victory and produce a state of violent anarchy which will culminate in regime change. Again, the mastermind of this purposeful movement, George Soros, needs to be arrested for domestic terrorism and treason.\nIt is clear that America is heading towards civil war if this is not stopped. From the position of the Marxist establishment, they will soon be on the outside looking in after Donald Trump is sworn in. However, you can count on one thing, they are not going away without their revolution.\nWe are spiraling toward civil war if this is not stopped. Soros/Obama/Clinton led cartel of Marxists cannot allow Donald Trump to take office for if they do, the foreign (UN) troops will no longer be at their disposal with regard to employing the military option to maintain control over the people. It is for this reason that I believe we are headed towards a major false flag incident. Rioting alone will not produce regime change. However, rioting can become a catalyst to an even bigger set of events that will allow Obama to not leave the White House.\nThe Marxists are poised to strike. They are gathered in Chicago and they plan to congregate at noon on November 18th. We won’t have long to wait before we see what direction this “occupy Trump movement” is going to take.\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship crap.",

      "title": "Here Is How A Minister Contradicted Garba’s Famine Statement",
      "text": "Chacha Wabara November 18, 2016 0 Share on Facebook \nThe confusion and lack of coordination between the Presidency and the Executive Council was put on display again yesterday when the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, came out to say that Nigeria is in no danger of a famine and that there was no cause for alarm. \nEarlier in the week, the Senior Special Assistant to the President had said that Nigeria was in danger of a famine as early as January next year due to the sharp spike in export of the country’s grains to other countries. However, Lokpobiri during a visit to Diezengoff/Phinada Farms at Tafa, Niger State and Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), noted that the Federal Government had begun the process of buying enough grains and store for the rainy day. \n“There are no statistics that there is going to be famine in January. What I heard in the news was that he (presidential aide, Shehu Garba) said that people are coming from other countries to buy our grains in bulk. As a government, we are also buying. Government doesn’t just come into the market to buy; government only buys to ensure guaranteed price so that our farmers are not discouraged by low patronage. Government has to buy because for now all our silos are virtually empty. We are part of a global community; it’s a free trade, we need dollars. We can’t, as a country, stop people from coming to Nigeria to buy grains,” Lokpobiri stated. \nGiven that the Ministry of Agriculture is expected to coordinate matters such as these, how did Shehu Garba come to his conclusion that the quantity of exports was becoming alarming to the extent of saying that the nation risked a famine. And if that is actually the case, is it not the prerogative of the Ministry of Agriculture to make this known. Why Shehu Garba? Now, his statements have been countered by those in charge. Who should we believe? When will Mr President’s appointees get things right and come out with a unified voice Nigerians can trust? Related",

      "text": "Can we put the fake news genie back in the bottle? First and foremost, Facebook needs to take its role in disseminating news seriously. Save Reuters/Carlo Allegri \nThe 2016 presidential campaign has definitively shown us that you shouldn't rely on Facebook for all of your news. Even at its best, you're likely to be exposed primarily to viewpoints and stories you already agree with. Being ensconced in a internet belief bubble takes away a lot of the nuance that exists in the real world -- while that lack of nuance likely helped Donald Trump become the next President of the United States. \nBut beyond the narrow viewpoint that comes from getting news through Facebook is a bigger problem: Fake news has been proliferating on the site at a rapid pace . In August, Facebook made some changes to its \"trending news\" section , removing human editors and replacing them with an algorithm. Ironically, the move seemed like a response to reports that those human editors were biased against conservative news. Without those editors patrolling the trending section, it became much easier for false stories to slip through. Indeed, a false report about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly being fired spread like wildfire just days after the change was announced. \nThings have gotten worse since then -- over the last week and a half, fake news on Facebook has been widely cited as a potential difference-maker in the elections results. And Facebook continues to duck its responsibility even as reports circle about the company's dysfunctional process for flagging and removing false news stories. It's a topic that's inescapable right now -- Google Trends shows searches for \"fake news\" spiking in the last month . \nAnd now President Obama has addressed the issue, speaking out against it in a press conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel as well as in an excellent, wide-ranging interview just published by the New Yorker . \"If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not,\" he said yesterday, \"and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\" \nThe fake news genie is most definitely out of the bottle -- so what do we do next? Alexios Mantzarlis, the head of Poynter's international fact-checking network , admits it's a big problem but thinks the first place to start is by distinguishing between fake news and misleading news and pushing back against the complete fabrications. \"I've seen lists of fake news sites going that [incorrectly] included some alt-right sites,\" he says \"I'm not suggesting that those sites are 100 percent accurate -- but there's a difference between a story that is misleading and a story that is outright fake. The battle that we can win is against 100 percent fake stories, so let's start there.\" Read this by @snopes founder David Mikkelson, who knows something or other about fake news on the internet https://t.co/bkk1YzqyQk pic.twitter.com/1zD9zCTkSc — Alexios (@Mantzarlis) November 17, 2016 \nMantzarlis mostly focused on what Facebook can do to stem the tide, a reasonable position given that about a quarter of the world's population uses the platform. \"If there are humans at Facebook, they can fact check -- at least let's keep fake news out of trending,\" he says. \"And if the team sees fake news, tag it so everyone knows. The Megyn Kelly hoax is shocking to me -- it kept getting engaged with after Facebook itself apologized for it being a hoax!\" While Facebook says it got rid of the team working on trending news, the company still has humans reviewing posts that get flagged, as NPR reports . \nWhile it sounds like coming up with standards that Facebook can quickly and consistently apply presents a major challenge, it's clearly something the company needs to get serious about. \"[Mark] Zuckerberg has said that determining what is true is hard, and I agree with that,\" says Mantzarlis. \"But when you have fake stories that have been yanked out of trending, they should clearly flagged [as fake]. If you don't want to delete content, at least annotate it -- don't let it go on more News Feeds afterwards!\" \nThe challenge facing Facebook is walking the line between letting people share whatever they want with their friends -- what the platform was originally built for -- and cracking down on misinformation. \"I'm aware of a strong backlash that is ready to surge as soon as Facebook pushes back too hard... they are walking a tightrope, and I wouldn't want to be them,\" Mantzarlis says. \"They make decisions about how to curate the News Feed all the time -- if quality of the News Feed is important, I don't see why they can't be more particular about this stuff.\" \nUnfortunately, with the ball so firmly in Facebook's court, we're going to be dependent on them to put the genie back in the bottle, and the question remains how interested the company will be in taking this challenge on. Zuckerberg is clearly irked by the suggestion that fake news shared on Facebook influenced the election. He claims that over 99 percent of content on the site is authentic. But despite his skepticism, the company has gone on record saying it would fight fake news -- though it didn't say how. Some aren't waiting to find out, as reports indicate dozens of employees are privately investigating how the company deals with such matters. \nWhile Facebook bears a significant burden here, the problem extends beyond what it can control -- all the way to the White House, in fact. President-elect Donald Trump himself has long played fast and loose with the truth (to put it lightly), and some in the media are noting that they're essentially competing against his Twitter feed in an effort to tell the truth. It's a tendency that fake news maven Paul Horner successfully exploited throughout the campaign. \"[Trump] just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it,\" Horner told The Washington Post . \"His followers don't fact-check anything -- they'll post everything, believe anything.\" 1. New reality for the press: the president-elect's Twitter account is a competing media outlet spreading fake news. https://t.co/VPvjKnW5PI — James Poniewozik (@poniewozik) November 18, 2016 \nTrump can crow about keeping a Ford planet from moving to Mexico, the media can investigate those claims and prove them false -- but at this point, the truth can quickly become secondary to the narrative Trump has created. His statements are out there, and his army of supporters won't accept an alternate viewpoint as the truth. It's no wonder the horrible phrase \"post-truth\" was the Oxford dictionary's word of the year. \nSo the war on fake news has really just begun -- but anyone using Facebook or otherwise reading the internet can do their part to hold sources accountable. Reporting bad stories on Facebook isn't a perfect solution, but it's what we can for now. Venturing far outside of Facebook directly to reliable outlets that aren't algorithmically served to you is a smart idea, as well. If you're wondering what's real and what isn't, this document is a great place to start. Perhaps the most important thing you can do is read as many sources on a particular bit of news as you can: if one site claims Trump won the popular vote and 50 others say otherwise, common sense will tell you which one is lying.",

      "title": "Here’s what companies like Google, Facebook and Apple lost when Trump’s win killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership",
      "text": "share Win McNamee / Getty The giant international trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership died last week . It was supposed to be the largest regional trade deal in history . The TPP itself was a massive 30-chapter lawbook that would have freed access to markets for things like car manufacturing, data storage, online commerce, intellectual property and medicines. Hoards of technology and media companies supported the trade deal. Google was pro TPP . As was Microsoft , Apple and Facebook. The Motion Picture Association of America supported it too. The deal would have allowed them to make it easier to store user data across borders, offer stricter copyright protections and clamp down on digital pirating. President-elect Donald Trump positioned his opposition to the trade deal as one of the defining issues of his campaign. He compared the TPP to the North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s that allowed U.S. manufacturers to move jobs to Mexico. President Obama, on the other hand, was betting on the trade accord to be a part of his foreign policy legacy, refocusing the American economy toward Asian countries and hedging against China’s growing power. But after Trump’s unexpected win, there are no hopes for the Republican majority Congress to ratify it. China, meanwhile, has a trade deal of its own the country is hoping to pass in the wake of the TPP’s failure. Now that deal is off the table, the large companies that supported it will have to go back to the foreign policy drawing board. Here’s what American technology companies would have gotten had the deal been finalized. The TPP’s e-commerce chapter included the world’s first set of international trade rules that would have barred governments from blocking how companies share data across national borders . The internet works by freely moving data across the world. It’s how an artist in Mexico is able to have a fanbase in the U.K. just by posting a video on YouTube. Now governments can impose laws on how data is ferried outside of their country, potentially blocking content and balkanizing the internet. On the flip side, technology companies cooperate with digital surveillance operations across borders too, and the TPP would have muddled the way countries would have been able to pass national privacy laws. In many of the participating countries it is not currently illegal to break the digital rights management, a digital lock that technology companies can add to their products to prevent piracy, tinkering and repair. But DRM is easy to circumvent, and hackers as well as media pirates have found ways to break to digital locks to make pirated copies of movies and music. In the U.S., it’s illegal to break DRM under copyright law, and the TPP would have expanded that internationally. Several countries would have had to make bans for repairing or tinkering with software or devices if DRM was circumvented, which would have been a win for the digital music and movie industry’s battle against piracy, as well as device manufacturers. Six of the twelve participating countries would have expanded their copyright terms an additional 20 years. Under the TPP, it would have taken over 70 years for a copyrighted work to enter the public domain, which is what happens when a song or film is so old that it’s legal to access it for free. Tech companies also were in favor of the TPP’s ban on “forced localization,” or laws that require a company to keep its citizens’ user data stored within its borders. Technology companies oppose these statutes on the grounds that they inhibit their increasingly cloud-based business models. When a country requires that data generated in the country stay stored within its borders, tech companies are forced to build data centers there in order to do business. Forced localization could also open a technology company or website to being compelled to follow a country’s censorship laws by dint of operating servers there. recode_divider",

      "text": "Share James Gunn is putting his money where his mouth is. On Facebook Thursday, the Guardians of the Galaxy director fielded a question about a much sought-after Easter egg in the 2014 Marvel film, with a fan asking if he plans on ever revealing it. Gunn responded that he had no plans on revealing the Easter egg, which the director first teased two years ago and so far nobody has found. This answer prompted another fan to cry foul: \"He won't reveal it because it doesn't exist. The ultimate troll.\" Gunn brought out the big guns in his response, vowing to pay the commenter $100,000 if there is no Easter egg. \"If there is no Easter egg I will give you a hundred thousand dollars,\" Gunn wrote on Facebook. News of the mystery Easter egg first came to light in November 2014, when Gunn was doing press for the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu-ray. \"There's definitely one really big thing that people haven't seen, but they may never see it - we'll see. There's other things, too,\" Gunn told ComicBook.com (which also spotted the $100,000 offer.) Some fans have misunderstood what the $100,000 offer entails, thinking Gunn will pay money for people who spot the Easter egg. Gunn has tried to dispell this incorrect interpretation: I never offered anyone 100k for the Easter Egg. I told a guy I'd give him 100k if it doesn't exist (which I would, but it does). https://t.co/K37UZCoM1Z - James Gunn (@JamesGunn) November 18, 2016 NO I DID NOT. I said I'd give 100k if there was no Easter Egg (there is). This is gonna haunt me… https://t.co/HEEPnq9pzk - James Gunn (@JamesGunn) November 18, 2016 Gunn maintains a close relationship with fans thanks to his active social media accounts, where questions about this Easter egg pop up often (though not as much as requests to know when the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer will arrive.) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 will hit theaters May 5, 2017. Follow Heat Vision on Facebook and Twitter for the latest from the MCU. Nov. 18, 3:15 p.m. Updated with Gunn's tweets. Reblog",

      "title": "Trap of Exposing Fake News: Eroding Trust in Real Reporting - New York Times",
      "text": "During the months I spent talking to partisan Facebook page operators for a magazine article this year, it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication, it contained much, much more of something else. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story I recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story, posted on a pro-Trump website and promoted on a pro-Trump Facebook page — and, incidentally, copied from another pro-Trump site by overseas contractors. It tried to cast suspicion on Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier, who had spoken out against Donald J. Trump. The overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying; the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new, sinister one; its insinuating mention of “Muslim martyrs,” in proximity to mentions of Mr. Khan’s son, and its misleading and strategic mention of Shariah law , amounted to a repulsive smear. It was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them. This was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election, clearly designed to function well within Facebook’s economy of sharing. And it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of “fake news.” Stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up “fake news” as a broad media offensive position, especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of Mr. Trump’s supporters, and by the candidate himself. As the campaign progressed, criticism of Mr. Trump was instantly projected back at his opponent, or at the critics themselves. “No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet.” This tactic was used on the language of social justice, which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically, in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained. Anti-racists were cast as the real racists. Progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms. This was not a new tactic, but it was newly effective. It didn’t matter that its targets knew that it was a bad-faith maneuver, a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason. The referees called foul, but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds. Or maybe they could, but realized that nobody could make them listen. “Fake news” as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold. The fake news narrative, as widely understood and deployed, has already begun to encompass not just falsified, fabricated stories, but a wider swath of traditional media on Facebook and elsewhere. Fox News? Fake news. Mr. Trump’s misleading claims about Ford keeping jobs in America? Fake news. The entirety of hyperpartisan Facebook? Fake news. This wide formulation of “fake news” will be applied back to the traditional news media, which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true, even when they are. Facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem, the clearly fabricated posts. Facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one, to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform. But the worst identified defenders make their money outside Facebook anyway. Another narrow response from Facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces. Facebook tried this, to a very limited extent, with Trending Topics. Members of the company’s editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories, accompanied by links they deemed credible. This initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear. But it is easy to imagine a system in which a story, upon reaching some high threshold of shares, or a source, upon reaching some cumulative audience, could be audited and declared unreliable. This could resemble Facebook’s short-lived experiment to tag satire articles as such. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope, for example. But where would that leave the rest of the media? Answered and rebutted, and barely better positioned against everything else that remained. It would be a still-dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact, the main difference being that it would have all been declared, implicitly, not fake. Facebook is a place where people construct and project identities to friends, family and peers. It is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities. It is a system built on ranking and vetting and voting, and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely possible, and where conflict is resolved with isolation. (Not that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy alternatives: For Twitter, it has been a source of constant crisis.) Fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the Facebook economy — more closely, perhaps, than most of the organizations that are identifying them. Their removal will be an improvement. The outrage at their mere existence, and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the world, will have been justified. But the outrage is at risk of being misdirected, and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial “fake news” — the newslike media, amateur and professional, for which truth is defined first in personal and political terms, and which must only meet the bar of not being obviously, inarguably, demonstrably false — will continue growing apace, gaining authority by sheer force, not despite Facebook but because of it. The company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate them, and with any luck it will. But the system stands to remain intact. Media companies have spent years looking to Facebook, waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns despite, or perhaps because of, its being credited with causing those concerns. Some have come to the realization that this was mistaken, even absurd. Those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our time, in response to getting caught promoting lies, to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise.",

I touched his face, his face was cold and his hands were turning pale.\" \nEddie saw two men passed out and thought they were joking at first. He said he started recording because he didn't know what would happen, what he didn't know was that the two men had overdosed on drugs. Eddie Wimbley \n\"It's just hard seeing that,” said Wimbley. “I've never seen anybody passed out or on drugs.\" \nThe overdose incident is just one of many that has been happening in the Sandusky area and residents are worried. \n\"It's sad really,” said Willette Brow, a resident in Sandusky. “Because you don't know what might happen in your neighborhood.\" \nPolice say in the past 30 days they have had 30 drug overdoses with four suspected overdose deaths. \nTheir squads have administered Narcan about 170 times already this year compared to just 80 last year. \nThe Facebook live video filmed by Eddie shows the reality of these situations police encounter daily. \n“It gets out to real folks the atrocity and the epidemic that is going on,” said Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech. “I think although some people might view it as a negative thing, it just put a picture worth a thousand words out and the reality of what is going on not only locally, but throughout the county.\" \nPolice say both men in the video were treated at a local hospital and they are talking with prosecutors about future charges. \nChief Orzech says they are working with the Erie County Sheriff's Department to increase drug enforcement across the city and county. \n“Yes, we’re not going to arrest our way out of it. Yes, there will be somebody else coming in, but people are poisoning our citizens,” said ChiefOrzech. \nEddie and two other bystanders took action on Thursday, for the two men who apparently overdosed, one called police, another, a nurse, administered medical aid. \nSince the incident, several have reached out to Eddie, including one of the men's family to say thank you. \nWhile this isn't his first time helping someone, his mother remains just as proud. \n\"He showed me [the video] and it was just devastating and I just told him, he's just an angel how he saved two lives,\" said Sheryl Seavers, Eddie’s mom. \nEddie gives credit to the other bystanders who jumped into action and says he hopes this video will help the community work towards a solution in the future. \nFollow WTOL:",

      "text": "Photo: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images Sure, maybe Facebook puts you in a filter bubble and helped make Donald Trump president , but you and a billion other people dutifully sign on every single goddamn day. If you have a feeling that getting away from all those fruitless political arguments and insipid food videos would be healthy, I’ve got just the study for you.\nRelated Stories Here Are the Feels That Make Internet Things Go Viral The ‘Filter Bubble’ Explains Why Trump Won and You Didn’t See It Coming Published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking and highlighted by the canny and pseudonymous Neuroskeptic , Danish researcher Morten Tromholt recruited 1,095 participants (by way of Facebook, naturally) and put them into two groups. One pledged to not sign onto the social network for a full week (87 percent made it) and a control group used the platform the same way as they always did.\nAs anyone who has seriously used the phrase “social media detox” would be eager to tell you, the intervention group reported higher happiness than the control group — though it was just a difference of 0.37 between the two groups on a scale from 1 to 10.\nTrue to their name, Neuroskeptic isn’t convinced by the findings: There’s probably a strong placebo effect, since the only people who would sign up for a “quit Facebook!” study were probably already contemplating the idea. Also, a week is short — it would be better to see the effects of self-imposed social-media exile over the course of months or years or decades.\nStill, given that Facebook’s algorithm favors the content that baits your emotions , it’s easy to see how withdrawing might lower your drama level. And with the way everybody is on several dozen group texts these days, you’re already cracking jokes and sharing memes with the people you really care about anyway.\nTags: facebook social media happiness S h a r e o n F a c e b o o k T w e e t t h i s S t o r y Top Stories If You’re Annoyed by Overly Cheerful People, You’ll Like This Study Yes, Quitting Facebook May Make You Happier How Little Kids Figure Out Who’s in Charge Most Viewed Stories An Overlooked Weapon Against the Flu Is Also the Most Effective One This Revolutionary Parenting Insight Will Help Your Love Life Yes, Quitting Facebook May Make You Happier You Can Write Your Way Out of an Emotional Funk.

      "text": "Froma Harrop: Goodbye, Facebook. You’re Evil. By Froma Harrop Creators Syndicate Twitter \nDear Facebook friends, \nIf you don’t see me gushing over the pix of your Thanksgiving pies, take no offense. It’s not that your pie is a bore (though, frankly, it is). And it’s not because I unfriended you. It’s because Facebook has become a platform for the sort of fake news stories that helped elect Donald Trump. In doing so, Facebook undermines our civic culture – its creepy smile floating overhead. \nI’m so out of there. I’ve wanted to quit for a long time, having wearied of friends’ pictorials of their idyllic family and personal lives. I know for a fact that some of the most glowing portrayals come from (mostly) women who couldn’t make it to noon without a fistful of meds. I still love them, and if they wish to connect, they have my number. \nThough hyperpartisan fake news stories have come from both the left and the right, Facebook entrepreneurs know that the money is in plowing the Trumpian fields. And for all the patriotic memes, foreigners are behind much of the manipulation of the American public. \nKids in a town in Macedonia (that’s near Greece) created over 100 pro-Trump websites, spreading phony reports such as FBI plans to indict Hillary Clinton. The Make America Great page outsources the writing of fraudulent news to a couple in the Philippines. \nCompounding the evil, Facebook’s design makes fake stories from fake sites such as the nonexistent Denver Guardian look like stories from the very real Denver Post. And no, blocking fake news sites from ad revenues is not going to stop politically motivated lying. \nFacebook further degrades the national conversation by creating echo chambers. Its algorithm directs the “news” people like to their like-minded friends. \nNo chains shackle us to Facebook. \nAleks Krotoski, a technology journalist for BBC, saw a wave of Britons leaving Facebook after the Brexit vote – mostly people opposed to leaving the European Union. “They were shocked by the fact that they had found themselves in an echo chamber, in a bubble,” she told me. \nAdding to my disgust with Facebook’s amoral business model is founder Mark Zuckerberg’s excuse for it. Facebook is not a media company; it’s a technology company, he explained. \nSo why has Facebook been so joyfully ravaging the advertising base of real news media companies, which put sweat, pride and dollars into reporting? As just one example, Facebook last year siphoned about $27 million in digital ads from The Guardian, according to a former editor. \nZuckerberg says he doesn’t want Facebook making judgments on what “news” is acceptable for its site. Funny, Facebook bans pictures of female breasts in the name of decency but sees nothing indecent about putting lies into the mouth of Pope Francis. We refer to the total falsehood, seen almost a million times, that the pope had endorsed Trump. \nPublic-spirited Trump voters should object to such corporate dereliction. But Clinton supporters have more reason for rage at Facebook for letting con men poison Clinton’s candidacy – at a profit to both Facebook and the cons. \nI know quitting Facebook would be hard for many. It has something of a lock on group communications. But there’s something of a monkey-see, monkey-do element of Facebook that when someone announces she’s leaving, others do likewise. \n“If you have a critical mass of people who get fed up and leave, Facebook would be in trouble,” Krotoski said. \nAn alternative would push that day closer. We need something to challenge the nature of the commitment and the connections that people have to one another on Facebook. Surely, there are innovators working feverishly on a replacement. If they succeed, they’ll make a fortune. I will help them in my microscopic way. \nIn the meantime, I’m leaving Facebook. Follow me.

      "text": "Shares 6K Twitter is a great tool for connecting with customers. Unlike Facebook, which can be limiting for businesses because of its algorithm , there is literally no limit on your ability to connect with current and potential customers online. That’s why we love Twitter for eCommerce! Twitter provides a prime opportunity to increase customer engagement and sales. This article covers the basics of why Twitter for eCommerce stores works so well and how it can for your eCommerce store as well. Twitter Drives Website Traffic. Believe it or not, I actually spent almost four years working in eCommerce, managing the social media and content for a number of niche eCommerce websites, including the company’s flagship site, LabelValue . What we found was that Twitter worked EXTREMELY well for driving traffic to our website. And, as we all know, more website traffic means more sales. It was more than just driving website traffic though; Twitter was an opportunity to connect with potential customers and really share ourselves as an authority figure in our space. Tweeting links to blog posts as well as images with creative ideas of how you could use labels (there are actually a ton of different ways you can use labels, believe it or not) proved to be a great way to provide additional, often unexpected, value for our Twitter followers. When done for your own eCommerce business, this will not only helps you get more Twitter followers and drive traffic back to your site, but it will also help paint you as an authority figure and resource for great content. Establish a Reputation for Great Customer Support. You should probably think of Twitter as a customer complaint department. <wink> However, the reality is that Twitter is the first place most people go to when they want to lodge a complaint about a business. If you aren’t monitoring Twitter for mentions, you’re missing out on a chance to provide a fast solution for customers and there are many Twitter tools you can use to help you. If you ARE monitoring closely for mentions, you have the opportunity to turn those customer complaints into big wins for your company because of your excellent customer support. In addition to winning lifetime customers through your speedy customer support, you are also demonstrating to ALL your followers (and anyone else watching) that you have a customer-centric mentality. Remember: someone is ALWAYS watching you on social media. Make sure you’re there and participating in the conversations happening around your brand. Also, be sure to respond to positive tweets as well as negative ones. For positive tweets, retweet the original post and thank the Twitter user. You can even let them know if you have any upcoming sales or new products, if relevant. Perform market research. Because it’s so easy to reach current and potential customers on Twitter, it’s one of the best places you can get information for new products people are interested in. If you were looking for a new flavor for one of your products, you could start by polling your audience on Twitter, asking your current followers what they would like the most. Note: you definitely want to give them options and not ask an open ended question here. You could also perform Twitter searches to find out what Twitter users are already talking about in order to better predict what products they would be most interested in. Promote Your Products with Product Cards. Have you ever heard of Twitter cards ? Twitter cards allow you to pull rich information directly into your tweets…and for eCommerce companies, Product Cards are particularly useful. These Twitter cards allow you to include not only the title, description, thumbnail image, and Twitter handle, but also other relevant details that your followers will want to know, such as price and availability. Final Thoughts For eCommerce companies using Twitter, the opportunities to spread the word about your brand and drive traffic to your site are virtually limitless. However, if you do nothing else, embrace Twitter and Social Media as a way to provide superior customer service . Remember, conversations are happening online about your brand every single day. The question is, will you be there participating? ",

      "text": "BuzzFeed News. BuzzFeed News. \nBuzzFeed has another in-depth look at the fake news problem Facebook has, even though Zuckerberg continues to deny. Some of the fake news was from a site called Ending the Fed . Ending the Fed. \nOne example is the remarkably successful, utterly untrustworthy site Ending the Fed . It was responsible for four of the top 10 false election stories identified in the analysis: Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump, Hilary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS, Hillary Clinton being disqualified from holding federal office, and the FBI director receiving millions from the Clinton Foundation. These four stories racked up a total of roughly 2,953,000 Facebook engagements in the three months leading up to Election Day. \nEnding the Fed gained notoriety in August when Facebook promoted its story about Megyn Kelly being fired by Fox News as a top trending item. The strong engagement the site has seen on Facebook may help explain how one of its stories was featured in the Trending box. \nThe site, which does not publicly list an owner or editor, did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. \nLike several other hyperpartisan right-wing sites that scored big Facebook hits this election season, Ending the Fed is a relatively new website. The domain endingthefed.com was only registered in in March. Yet according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis, its top election content received more Facebook engagement than stories from the Washington Post and New York Times . For example, the top four election stories from the Post generated roughly 2,774,000 Facebook engagements — nearly 180,000 fewer than Ending the Fed’ s top four false posts. \nA look at Ending the Fed ’s traffic chart from Alexa also gives an indication of the massive growth it experienced as the election drew close: \nThe full story is at BuzzFeed . This is absolutely shameful. As I noted in the previous FB post , it’s not at all difficult to choose one reliable, reputable news source, and check it every day. It’s not at all difficult to check out and verify stories passing as news. People should be unwilling to look like ignorant fools. As it turns out, that does not deter repubs in the least. \nWant to check the veracity of a story? You can go right to Google news , and search. There’s always Snopes . Also, beware any newsource under Liftable Media . They have a large FB presence, and are known for publishing fake news . \nh/t to Kengi.",

      "text": "Cops Behaving Badly: Fluent in Ghetto. Former Talladega police officer Joe Husk (Facebook). \nYet another bigot just couldn’t control himself, and posted his bigotry to FB: \nReally? I have to wonder if this asshat ever listened to the First Lady speak. What’s ironic is that Husk is the exact type of idiotic bigot who would have been denouncing Ms. Trump in other circumstances, for being so damn foreign. Husk waved his bigotry, and he’s been fired. Full story here . John Livingston of North Carolina was shot to death by Deputy Nicholas Kehagias in Nov. 2015 (Family handout via NYDN) \nThe New York Daily News reported Thursday that the family of John Livingston, 33, of Lillington, North Carolina is suing six members of the Harnett County Sheriff’s Department over Livingston’s shooting death at the hands of Deputy Nicholas Kehagias in November of 2015. \nAccording to the lawsuit — which has now been joined by five other parties — Kehagias, Deputy Brandon Klingman and Deputy John Knight called themselves “The KKK” and formed a kind of “fight club” gang that terrorized citizens and frequently broke the law. \nLivingston’s death was the subject of a grand jury investigation which declined to bring charges against Kehagias, in spite of a long record of violations of police procedure on the deputy’s part. \nVia Raw Story . Not in the least surprised. Police never manage to police their own until someone dies, and even then they don’t do a good job. Cop punches woman in the face (CBS/Screengrab). \nThe Arizona cop who was caught on video punching a woman has been placed on leave while his assault is, um, investigated. I was pretty sure cops weren’t legally allowed to punch someone in the face, but that seems to be the case. Naturally, the defense is “she started it!” Full story here . Share this:",

      "text": "By Nat Ives . Published on November 19, 2016 . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the social network is considering efforts such as 'better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.' Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Most Popular \nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Friday night that the company was exploring new ways to fight the spread of \"misinformation\" on its social platform amid criticism of its role in amplifying so-called fake news during the presidential campaign. \nIt is \"technically and philosophically\" difficult to determine what is fake and what to do about it, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. \"We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible,\" he wrote. \nBut many observers have also attacked the prevelance of made-up headlines on Facebook, arguing that they swayed votes in the election Nov. 8 and are continuing to distort reality. This Facebook trending story is 100% made up. Nothing in it is true. This post of it alone has 10k shares in the last six hours. pic.twitter.com/UpgNtMo3xZ \nMr. Zuckerberg said new steps might include : \n- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \n- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \nThe company earlier this week said it will stop serving ads to sites it decides are misleading or deceptive. \nOthers have agreed with Mr. Zuckerberg that it would be troubling for Facebook to take a stronger hand in deciding what counts as legitimate news and what should be hidden from users.

We have proof of child exploitation of children in Haiti and the U.K. by the Clinton Foundation. Child exploitation in EVERY COUNTRY is run by the same people at the top. We have proof that the drug rnarket is controlled by intelligence agencies to fund black projects. We received these leaks from several sources including the NSA, FBI. NYPD, France’s DGSI, Interpol. Scotland Yard, and Switzerlands MND. Our Podesta leaks were automated and they decided to let them continue because they knew the contents and did not deem them a threat to national security, and they wanted to keep up the charade that WikiLeaks was still operational. Phase 3, the Clinton Foundation mails, were also automated, however, they shut these leaks down due to national security (U.S.) security.\nThe destruction of WikiLeaks was an unprecedented global effort.\n• wikileaks,UsENR,, 11/17/16 (Thu)\ndue to public outrage. The CIA is at war with the NSA due to an exponential rise in technology and surveillance capabilities. The NSA became aware of the CIA’s global governrnent manipulation, especially the manipulation of the U.S. and U.K. governments, and their global child exploitation and blackmail network. The CIA and the people they protect are the old power structure. Phase 3, the Clinton Foundation email, would have dealt a huge blow to the old power structure which is why they prevented the release of the emails at all costs. If there was a, question about Julian’s safety, he would immediately appear at the balcony window to the public. He would not want the reputation and credibility of WikiLeaks to be in question.",

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. (Christian Dobratz via AP, File) More Photos See all photos \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: “I wasn’t reaching for it.” \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile’s girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n“No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would’ve used deadly force under these circumstances,” Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez’s unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown’s death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile’s relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n“It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,” she said. “We don’t want any protests to get outrageous.” \nCastile’s shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor’s mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read “No Justice, No Peace” and “Black Lives Matter.” The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n“We haven’t won the war, but we won a battle,” activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted “Don’t pull it out” as Castile insisted he wasn’t, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez’s partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile’s weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n“His dying words were in protest that he wasn’t reaching for his gun,” Choi said. “There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.” \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi’s decision. \n“Without my recording,” she said, “we wouldn’t be here today.” \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul. \nCopyright © The Associated Press.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nDo you dream of owning a flock of chickens but are restricted by local ordinances or the dictates of your homeowner’s association?\nIf so, I recently updated the article written awhile back on “City Farming with Backyard Quail: An Alternative to Raising Chickens”. In an effort to bring some of the timeless Backdoor Survival content forward, I share it with you again for your learning enjoyment.\nQuail require less space and less work than chickens and rabbits plus they are quiet and easy to raise. They do not eat a lot, convert feed into protein efficiently, and are much more congenial creatures than even the sweetest-tempered chicken. Many cities allow quail when chickens are forbidden and given their quiet nature and modest space requirements, they can even be raised on the balcony of an urban apartment.\nWhen it comes to eating, quail eggs are nearly identical in taste and nutritional quality to chicken eggs although it takes about five quail eggs to equal one chicken egg. The meat is tender and can be broiled, baked, roasted, stir-fried, or stewed – the same as chicken.\nPerry has been very gracious in answering my questions about quail and has allowed me to share his expertise with my readers. In turn, he has updated the information on his website, Backyard Quail , so that the rest of the world can also learn from his experience raising quail.\n10 REASONS WHY QUAIL ARE THE PERFECT BACKYARD ANIMAL Reason #1: City ordinances do not allow or restrict keeping chickens\nMore and more cities are allowing residents to keep chickens. A lot of the times they place such restrictions on having them that it becomes impossible to comply.\nIn my case you had to have at least three acres which my small city lot was not even close. When I checked the city code it specifically listed several types of birds (chickens, guineas, ducks, etc.), but did not include or exclude quail. In addition to making sure you follow city and county ordinances, some states have restrictions. My state requires a permit if you are keeping more than 50 bob white quail.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you follow the law, but “pet” quail may just what you need.\nReason #2: Low cost to start and maintain\nIt is easy to get started with quail. For literally a couple of bucks you can get a mating pair of birds.\nStart in the spring when breeders are selling them or try late fall for a deal when breeders don’t want to keep the birds over the winter. Depending on how many birds you have a small cage and ratio of daily food is the only real cost involved.\nLive birds will cost you $1-$5 each depending on their age and the time of year. A cheaper route is to purchase eggs. They can be purchased 50+ for under $20 depending on the species of quail.\nThe price of feed like everything else has been increasing, but a 50lb bag is currently about $23. I prefer to use the Purina Game Bird Layena. I have had the best egg production using this brand.\nReason #3: Simple habitat requirements\nIf you are not raising the birds to train hunting dogs, then you don’t need a flight cage. A simple cage that allows the waste to fall out the bottom to be collected and 1-2 square feet of space per bird and you are all set.\nReason #4: Simple care requirements\nQuail need access to food and water at all times. I\nfeed and freshen water once a day, same time as I collect any eggs. Then I keep straw below the cages to collect the waste and keep down the flies. Once a week I move the straw to the compost pile and add a fresh layer.\nThat is really it. The exception might be in the winter months. When it gets cold they need to be protected from wind and drafts. You can completely cover the cages with a tarp or if you have an out building move them inside. Keeping unfrozen water becomes the biggest chore. They can be kept outdoors all year round as long as they have protection from the wind and the elements. If you decide to move them indoors, like any other bird or small pet, they will need to have their cage cleaned often to keep down the odors.\nReason #5: The eggs!\nThe fresh eggs are great during the laying season. Yes quail eggs are smaller than chicken eggs, but for my family it has been about a 5/6 to 1 ratio. If you assume each bird averages 5-6 eggs a week, then get enough birds to cover your normal egg consumption times 5.\nTo extend the laying season, in the spring or fall you can provide a total of 15-16 hours of light during the day the birds will keep laying. I placed a string of inexpensive Christmas lights around the cages and use an outdoor timer to make sure they get at least 15 hours of light.\nThey taste no different than chicken eggs, just about 1/5 the size. Our favorite uses are egg poppers (bite sized hard boiled eggs) and crème brûlée.\nReason #6: Quail meat\nSo maybe you weren’t looking to eat your “pets”, but quail meat it both good tasting and nutritious. They are mainly dark meat. They mature quickly, 6 weeks, so they are economical as well if you consider chickens mature in 8 plus weeks depending on breed and size desired. Plus raising them versus hunting makes sure your finished meat is buckshot free.\nReason #7: Quiet and clean, especially if female only\nCompared to chickens and guineas, quail are extremely quiet.\nSome make a sound similar to crickets or the distinct “bob white” call. Even when the male birds crow it is nothing to draw attention. If you have females only, which is all that is needed for eggs, then no crowing at all. Males are only needed if you want fertilized eggs for hatching. When they are raised on wire with the droppings being contained with straw they are both clean and have little if any undesired smell.\nReason #8: Many varieties for your taste\nThere are many varieties in both size and color of quail to fit your taste. Please remember to check your state and local ordinances because some types require permits. Otherwise, do your research and pick something you like.\nI prefer Large Brown Coturnix quail as they are in abundance supply, hardy, and good egg layers.\nReason #9 Possible money making venture\nI say possible because it will require some work and maybe an increase in space requirements.\nThere are several sellable products with quail: live quail, eggs, meat and manure. Once again check state and local ordinances for details on what you can or cannot sell. You may not be able to sell the meat due to FDA or USDA restrictions, but I have heard of people giving away live birds and charging to have them butchered. Live birds and fertile hatching eggs can be sold easily on Craig’s List and E-bay.\nFinally the manure is high in nitrogen and makes for many a happy local gardener.\nReason #10: Useful for barter purposes.\nI was able to trade 15 chicks for a pair of mated rabbits. Of course the sky is the limit when it comes to bartering options.\nREAD MORE\nThe post How to Raise Quail When Chickens Are Out of the Question by Gaye Levy first appeared on Backdoor Survival .",

In that vein, Facebook is working on \"better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,\" he wrote.\nThe company is also working on new reporting tools that will make it easier for users to report fake news when they see it, which will also help improve Facebook's ability to reliably recognize misinformation.\nHe also said the social network is experimenting with more prominent warning labels that will make it clearer to people when they come across misinformation. \"We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \nElsewhere in News Feed, Facebook is planning on \"raising the bar\" for what types of articles can appear in the \"related articles\" module, which appears after you click on a link in your feed.\nThe company is working with 'respected fact checking organizations' and journalists and media organizations \nNoting that many of the perpetrators of fake news and Facebook are driven by the promise of ad dollars, Zuckerberg highlighted the company's announcement this week that it would ban fake news sites from its ad network and added that it's looking into other ways of \"disrupting the economics with ad policies.\" \nHe said the company is working with \"respected fact checking organizations\" and journalists and media organizations \"to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.\"\nZuckerberg emphasized that these efforts may not be entirely effective but that Facebook is \"committed to getting this right.\" \nYou can read his full post here .",

So here’s how to use it. ID: 10013917 1. When you see false information like this hoax, click on the “v” menu in the upper right corner of the post. View this image ›\nFacebook ID: 10013921 2. That pops up a menu. Choose “Report post.” View this image ›\nFacebook ID: 10013924 3. Then choose “I think it shouldn’t be on Facebook.” View this image ›\nFacebook ID: 10013925 4. Now select “It’s a false news story.” View this image ›\nFacebook ID: 10013926 5. Great job, you just told Facebook that they need to help stop that story from spreading. You then have the option to hide all future posts from that person or page, or to permanently block them. View this image ›\nFacebook ID: 10013928 Now you know how to fight fake news on Facebook. It’s also important to closely read links and posts before you share or like them. Ask yourself: Have I seen this source/website before? Are they pointing to credible sources to back up their claims? Are other sites I trust also reporting this? ID: 10013930 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!\nCraig Silverman is the founding editor for BuzzFeed Canada and is based in Toronto.

      "text": "  Fake Company, Facebook, to Battle Fake News? Nov 19, 2016 2:57 PM 0 Via The Daily Bell Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news … Fake news sites designed to trick you … Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a series of measures that should help prevent fake news from being shared on Facebook. The planned controls, which were announced in a late night Facebook post, follow accusations that a flood of fake news stories influenced the U.S. presidential election. -CNN Facebook is taking steps to counteract “fake news” but in many ways Facebook is a fake company. We wrote about it here, quoting an article entitled, “Behind Facebook—A New World Order Agenda?” Facebook’s first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome ‘The Diversity Myth’, he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC. The second round of funding into Facebook ($US12.7 million) came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1999. One of the company’s key areas of expertise are in “data mining technologies”. Breyer also served on the board of R&D firm BBN Technologies, which was one of those companies responsible for the rise of the internet. Dr Anita Jones joined the firm, which included Gilman Louie. She had also served on the In-Q-Tel’s board, and had been director of Defence Research and Engineering for the US Department of Defence. She was also an adviser to the Secretary of Defence and overseeing the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is responsible for high-tech, high-end development. We can see that Facebook’s initial funding came from individuals affiliated with US government/intel facilities: the CIA and DARPA. There is no doubt the US government has promoted Facebook around the world. It is an affiliate of the Deep State far more than it is a “private company.” And what about CNN, excerpted above? CNN is in a sense a fake news organization just as Facebook is a fake social media facility. CNN reportedly receives payments to promote stories that governments want publicized. For instance, former CNN reporter Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winner exposed CNN in 2015 for receiving payments from the US government and foreign governments to pick and choose news items, see here . More from CNN: “The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,” wrote Zuckerberg. “We take this responsibility seriously. We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.” The CEO said that Facebook (FB, Tech30) is working to develop stronger fake news detection, a warning system, easier reporting and technical ways to classify misinformation. … Zuckerberg did not say how quickly the measures would be in place. But they should make it much easier for users to flag misleading content — similar to the way cyberbullying can be reported with a single click on some social media. The idea that users can flag “fake” news content would be more credible if the US government along with other governments had not already created squads of Internet monitors, see this article entitled, “US Government Using Trolls To Attack Conspiracy Theorists, here. These monitors will surely be able to click articles that are in some sense inimical to various vested globalist interests. The entire fake news controversy is suspect, starting with the idea that fake news “helped” Donald Trump get elected president of the US. As we recall, there was a good deal of fake news, but most of it seemed to emanate from the mainstream media. This mainstream resolutely would not investigate or report on the worst of the Clintons’ apparent criminality – including potential rape, mishandling of classified data and “pay-to-play” donations to the Clinton Foundation. Additionally, the mainstream reported a steady stream of polls favorable to Hillary by using tactics that exaggerated her voter endorsements. We arrive at the justifiable conclusion that the “fake news” controversy is itself a fake one, that outfits such as CNN that are reporting on it are fake and that Internet facilities charged with identifying fake news items like Facebook are also fake. Those behind this gambit obviously intend to use it to attack the alternative media, which has been very effective in puncturing the propaganda of the Deep State. The very largest irony is that this fake news meme is aimed at truth-telling in the alternative media. Conclusion: Whether or not this will work is a separate question, as we wrote here . But the idea is to create such a large lie that people will believe it. This has happened before.

      "text": "*Via The Daily Bell *\n\n\n\nZuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news … Fake news sites designed to trick you … Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a series of measures that should help prevent fake news from being shared on Facebook. The planned controls, which were announced in a late night Facebook post, follow accusations that a flood of fake news stories influenced the U.S. presidential election. -CNN\n\n\n\nFacebook is taking steps to counteract “fake news” but in many ways Facebook is a fake company.\n\nWe wrote about it here, quoting an article entitled, “Behind Facebook—A New World Order Agenda?”\n\n\n\nFacebook’s first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome ‘The Diversity Myth’, he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC.\n\nThe second round of funding into Facebook ($US12.7 million) came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1999. One of the company’s key areas of expertise are in “data mining technologies”.\n\nBreyer also served on the board of R&D firm BBN Technologies, which was one of those companies responsible for the rise of the internet. Dr Anita Jones joined the firm, which included Gilman Louie. She had also served on the In-Q-Tel’s board, and had been director of Defence Research and Engineering for the US Department of Defence.\n\nShe was also an adviser to the Secretary of Defence and overseeing the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is responsible for high-tech, high-end development.\n\n\n\nWe can see that Facebook’s initial funding came from individuals affiliated with US government /intel facilities: the CIA and DARPA. There is no doubt the US government has promoted Facebook around the world. It is an affiliate of the Deep State far more than it is a “private company.”\n\nAnd what about CNN, excerpted above?\n\nCNN is in a sense a fake news organization just as Facebook is a fake social media facility. CNN reportedly receives payments to promote stories that governments want publicized.\n\nFor instance, former CNN reporter Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winner exposed CNN in 2015 for receiving payments from the US government and foreign governments to pick and choose news items, see here.\n\nMore from CNN:\n\n\n\n“The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,” wrote Zuckerberg. “We take this responsibility seriously. We’ve made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.”\n\nThe CEO said that Facebook (FB, Tech30) is working to develop stronger fake news detection, a warning system, easier reporting and technical ways to classify misinformation.\n\n… Zuckerberg did not say how quickly the measures would be in place. But they should make it much easier for users to flag misleading content — similar to the way cyberbullying can be reported with a single click on some social media.\n\n\n\nThe idea that users can flag “fake” news content would be more credible if the US government along with other governments had not already created squads of Internet monitors, see this article entitled, “US Government Using Trolls To Attack Conspiracy Theorists, here.\n\nThese monitors will surely be able to click articles that are in some sense inimical to various vested globalist interests.\n\nThe entire fake news controversy is suspect, starting with the idea that fake news “helped” Donald Trump get elected president of the US. As we recall, there was a good deal of fake news, but most of it seemed to emanate from the mainstream media.\n\nThis mainstream resolutely would not investigate or report on the worst of the Clintons’ apparent criminality – including potential rape, mishandling of classified data and “pay-to-play” donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAdditionally, the mainstream reported a steady stream of polls favorable to Hillary by using tactics that exaggerated her voter endorsements.\n\nWe arrive at the justifiable conclusion that the “fake news” controversy is itself a fake one, that outfits such as CNN that are reporting on it are fake and that Internet facilities charged with identifying fake news items like Facebook are also fake.\n\nThose behind this gambit obviously intend to use it to attack the alternative media, which has been very effective in puncturing the propaganda of the Deep State. The very largest irony is that this fake news meme is aimed at truth-telling in the alternative media.\n\nConclusion: Whether or not this will work is a separate question, as we wrote here. But the idea is to create such a large lie that people will believe it. This has happened before.\n\n*Editor's Note: The Daily Bell is giving away a silver coin and a silver \"white paper\" to subscribers.

      "text": "Where to NeXT?: Samoa Joe By TonyM4C on Nov 18, 2016, 6:00pm EST 27  Share Share on Facebook 27 Comments ⋆ Rec Recommend this Post 1 \nWelcome to \"Where to NeXT?\" \nThis is a series of articles where we'll discuss the main roster futures of NXT's brightest stars. Here I'll go through a brief summary of a star or tag team's stint in NXT, mull their main roster potential, and then choose the brand that will utilize their talents the best in the near future. \nSomething to keep in mind : My projections are mostly my own subjective opinion and are merely meant to begin the discussion I hope will continue in the comment section. Feel free to disagree with my summation of what I believe each NXT star is capable of, I'm looking for as many perspectives as possible! \nFirst up is the top contender for the NXT Championship, a star many have speculated will be the next call up to the main roster; Samoa Joe. \nLooking to make his mark on the hottest show in wrestling Joe debuted at NXT Takeover: Unstoppable, and has been a staple of the brand ever since. He began his NXT career as a babyface fighting bullies like Kevin Owens and Baron Corbin. But where he really excelled was in his role as a heel. \nAfter winning the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic with Finn Balor he was denied an opportunity to become the top contender to NXT Championship despite months of success. He would soon take matters into his own hands by turning on the Demon and feuding with him over his NXT championship. \nDespite losing their first few title matches he would ultimately have the last laugh after he successfully defeating Balor at a house show in Massachusetts and once more at NXT Takeover:The End. His reign was defined by his seething rage, sense of entitlement and great distaste for NXT general manager William Regal. He would later lose the title to Shinsuke Nakamura (who we'll be discussing next week) at NXT Takeover: Brooklyn II. \nJoe projects as a mid to upper-mid carder on the main roster. At worst he's a stable presence in the mid-card that gets occasional secondary title pushes, much like Rusev. At best he becomes a brand's top heel and earns a Universal/World title run. \nHaving main evented five NXT Takeover's in a row it's not far fetched to believe he can earn a spell in the main event on Raw or Smackdown. However there are many more established heel acts on the main roster ahead of him, so it will take time for him to earn that opportunity. It's best to think of Joe as a mid-carder with a high ceiling to start with. \nHe was acceptable as a face in NXT but flourished as a heel. Seeing as how there is currently a shortage of heels on both brands its probably for the best if he begins his main roster career working rudo. And with that we move on to big question; which brand should he join once he leaves NXT? \nRaw feels like a great fit for the Southern California native. The Red Team will soon be having a mid-card heel vacancy due to Chris Jericho's impending extended absence. Samoa Joe would be a worthy replacement in Raw's mid-card and there is a bevy babyfaces for him to feud with including Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, and United States Champion Roman Reigns. \nIn the opinion of this viewer there is much less space for him to reach his potential on tueday's. Between the women's segments, tag segments and those given to Smackdown's top four heels (Styles, Wyatt, Miz and Corbin) I'm uncertain he would receive the necessary time to properly shine on the two hour program. Smackdown needs a few more heels in its singles scene (there's about 6 to 8 of them as of the time of this writing) but I feel as though they should be used as true carpenter's, like Curt Hawkins. Joe doesn't fit this description. \nAnd so my vote is for Samoa Joe to sign with Monday Night Raw. He's needed more there in the near future and will have plenty of time to establish himself. The show's big moment booking style should be able to make Joe a major player in no time at all. \nWhat say you Cagesider's, where should the Samoan Submission Specialist go to NeXT? Poll Which brand should Samoa Joe sign with NeXT? 47% Monday Night Raw (55 votes) 53% Smackdown Live (62 votes) 117 votes total The FanPosts are solely the subjective opinions of Cageside Seats readers and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cageside Seats editors or staff.

      "text": "Facebook could make or break Israel’s democracy Facebook could make or break Israel’s democracy What about your right to type what you want on social media? Who should decide what to censor? Facebook. (photo credit:FACEBOOK) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nAugust 25, 2016, was just another day on Israelis’ Facebook feeds: pictures of last days of vacation, mixed with the usual political quarrels and some heated debates about the role of religion in Israel. But then something happened. The former rapper and current extreme right-wing activist Yoav Eliasi – aka The Shadow – went one step further than ever before. On his page, he equated Palestinian terrorism to the common cold and the Israeli Left to AIDS, noting that “it can be easy to fight a cold, if you do not have AIDS.”In 2016, Israel’s Facebook website is the second most clicked on in the country, overshadowing all news agencies. The Shadow’s page has a quarter of a million followers. He has become a powerful voice, spreading his venom and reshaping the public debate. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Nevertheless, Israeli users that submitted complaints to Facebook against The Shadow’s post received automated reply messages that it “does not violate community standards.” The post was deleted only after it got significant exposure and surely left a mark on many Israelis, myself included. Similar posts have remained online.While protecting discriminatory posts by high-profile figures, Facebook began deleting activists’ posts that criticized tycoons, and more disturbingly that criticized Facebook itself. But let’s start with the racism.The Shadow’s bigoted social-media activism is not the exception to the rule in Israel. The liberty of expression Facebook provides makes the amount of hateful comments on Israeli pages overwhelming. An Israeli page dedicated to exposing this atmosphere, called “Racists that depress me,” posts thousands of screen shots of such commentary on a regular basis.As the media has been reporting, Facebook is changing the political discussion in America. So too in Israel. However, Israel’s democracy is much younger and therefore more fragile. Our press is facing an existential crisis, and Facebook’s role in influencing the public debate in Israel, for better or for worse, cannot be overstated.(Full disclosure: Facebook has been the main platform for my own independent journalism, exposing conflicts of interest and promoting government transparency. Via the page “One Hundred Days of Transparency,” a dedicated team of volunteers and I have been able to elevate these key issues into the Israeli public sphere.) There are many other examples. But as good as they may be in promoting civic engagement, they are drowned out by the poisonous debate that Facebook permits on its Hebrew pages. This problem was further aggravated recently when it became clear that Facebook not only lets this poison linger on its website, but in addition silences the activists and journalists who fight corporate interests.A case in point is the page “Coming to the Bankers” established by the somewhat virulent activist Barak Cohen. Its demands for transparency and accountability by the banking system was backed by many in the Israeli society, but was silenced by Facebook, which repeatedly shut down the page. Reporters in Israel claim this is due to the efficient lobbyist the banks hired for that purpose. In any case, the page evaporated with no explanation.True, the approach of these activists may have been distasteful. But whatever one might think of Cohen’s activism, the double standard is clear when compared to the freedom Facebook gives to The Shadow’s hatred, whose page flourishes.This is just one case. More and more activist pages are being censored when they publish controversial posts. The most recent example is a feminist page that exposes comments made by prostitutes’ customers. Another is the right-wing activist Yotam Zimri, whose account is blocked again and again because of his use of certain words. There is no appeal process.The duplicity is omnipresent. While activists need to fight for their freedom of speech, even our politicians get away with biased shaming. Moreover, an increasing number of journalists, including myself, who cover Israeli politics have reported being blocked from the pages of leading politicians. This includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition member Yair Lapid. We were blocked after posting polite yet challenging questions regarding “facts” published by them.If we cannot comment on these pages, we lose access to a key venue – where most Israelis are. Nevertheless, many politicians choose “clean” profiles with strict positive commentary. This is particularly concerning since Netanyahu very rarely gives interviews to the Israeli press (he has rebuffed interviews since the elections in March 2015), and instead interacts with the public through his Facebook page without the “interruption” of journalists.Furthermore, Israeli politicians are using security concerns to justify further supervision of Facebook, allegedly in an effort to limit incitement by Palestinian users. Indeed, a trend seems to be emerging of a cozy relationship between Israel’s politicians, tycoons and Facebook. This was further confirmed when Facebook appointed a confidant of Netanyahu’s to the position of director of government relations earlier this year.The gravest concern however, is that Facebook might be actively marginalizing voices criticizing its own policies. As reported by Haaretz , a number of journalists have been censored after they posted comments critical of Facebook’s policies. These posts simply disappeared.In one case, when prominent Israeli journalist Shay Golden called for demonstrations against Facebook’s censorship, his post was deleted.The youthful days of the once open social network and its great promise for enhancing democracy and empowering citizens is at risk. Facebook is slowly experiencing what has increasingly bedeviled the traditional Israeli media – a tangled relationship with politicians and corporate interests. I have made my career thanks to its vibrant platform. But its recent lack of transparency and the preference it seems to give to certain interests, playing favorites, risks breaking the progress our free society had made.Democracy is strong only inasmuch as its institutions are accountable. Facebook has fast become a key institute in the Israeli public sphere. We all should heed its transformations. The author is an independent journalist and author.

Post to Facebook DeAndre Jordan, Jimmy Butler trash talk on IG Good jokes, guys.  //usat.ly/2g91eqK   Join the Nation's Conversation To   DeAndre Jordan, Jimmy Butler trash talk on IG Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 5:35 p.m. EST November 19, 2016 \nUSA's centre DeAndre Jordan (L) and USA's forward Jimmy Butler celebrate after the final of the Men's basketball competition at the Carioca Arena 1 in Rio de Janeiro on August 21, 2016 during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nBefore the Clippers-Bulls game on Saturday, DeAndre Jordan and Jimmy Butler hilariously traded shots on Instagram. \nWith a photo of Jordan as a kid, Butler wrote, \"This how I'm smiling tonight when you switch out on to me.\" Then, Jordan used a photo of Butler in college and answered, \"Jimbo is going to be so stressed tonight about me locking him up that his hair gon fall out … AGAIN!\" \nThese two guys, both from the Houston area, were clowning around on Team USA in Rio this past summer too, so it's no surprise that the jokes are still rolling. And Jordan has engaged in IG trolling wars before. \nUnfortunately, it looks like the Butler-Jordan IG back-and-forth stopped with those two photos, but they probably have to, you know, prepare for the game that's later on in the day. This was fun, though. Good jokes, guys. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g91eqK Most Popular",

      "text": "By Quentin Fottrell, MarketWatch\nWant to understand Trump voters? Maybe you should make new Facebook friends\nAmerica is split down the middle on social media.\nMany voters still wonder how Donald Trump, a former TV reality star, won the U.S. presidential election. That's because they were all reading news handpicked to reinforce their existing opinions. Social media news feeds are increasingly personalized to a user's preference. As a result, advertisers get to market to their target audience, and consumers get more of the news that interests them. The problem with this tailor-made information is that we often only see one side of a story. \"There is an echo chamber phenomenon, which creates a misleading sense of reinforcement,\" says Brad Davis, associate professor of marketing at Lazaridis School of Business in Waterloo, Canada.\nThere is little overlap in the news sources that people on social networks turn to and trust, according to recent research by the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/25/political-content-on-social-media/), an independent nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C., and when discussing politics online or with friends, they are more likely to interact with like-minded individuals. Roughly half of Facebook (FB) users (53%) and less than half (39%) of Twitter (TWTR) users say that there is a mix of political views among the people in their networks. And, of the rest, only 5% of Facebook users and 6% of Twitter users indicate that most of the people they associate with in these spaces hold different political beliefs from their own.\nThe U.S. is a country divided both politically (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/want-the-american-dream-move-to-these-10-cities-2014-01-30) and economically (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-decades-long-post-war-growth-of-americas-middle-class-is-at-an-end-2016-07-20), and the division on social media is a reflection of that, says Susan Krauss Whitbourne, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Those who voted for President-elect Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton rarely interact online and, compounding that, members of each political party tend to share real (and false) news amongst themselves that reinforces their own worldview. \"If a person lives in their own world of friends and that world and their news sources are the liberal or conservative media, they are insulating themselves in a little bubble,\" she says. \"Either way you get a false sense of security.\nPodcast: \"Trump appealed to a more complicated ecosystem of voters.\" Listen to the latest episode (http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/did-trump-disruptive-brand-win-the-election/79509237-23D9-4F77-8A64-B2029FB28A5F.html) of our podcast, \"Money, Markets & More\" on Trump's \"disruptive\" marketing campaign (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marketwatch-money-markets/id157123762?mt=2)or subscribe on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marketwatch-money-markets/id157123762?mt=2).\nDemocrats appear to be even more insulated: Political liberals who use social media are more likely than conservatives to change their settings to see less of someone (41% versus 26%) as well as to block or unfriend someone (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-are-already-voting-on-facebook-by-unfriending-political-foes-2016-11-05) (35% versus 26%) because of something related to politics, Pew found. In addition, social media users under the age of 50 are more likely to take these steps than older users. So the two sides rarely meet, and when they do, it's often not pretty. When asked about the political interactions they see on social media, many politically engaged users are dismayed at the negativity and tone of political discourse. For instance, some 53% of people agree that the statement \"people say things when discussing politics on social media that they would never say in person\" describes social media very well.\nFacebook disagrees. \"While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information -- and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views,\" a Facebook spokesman says. But the social media company's own research (https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/05/news-feed-fyi-exposure-to-diverse-information-on-facebook/shows) suggests that there is some divergent content in its users' News Feeds, but even lower than the Pew Research estimates. On average, 23% of people's friends claim an opposing political ideology. Of the hard news content that people's friends share and see in News Feeds, some 29% on average cut across ideological lines.\nDon't miss: Master salesman Donald Trump won the election with disruptive marketing (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/by-winning-the-election-donald-trump-proved-that-he-is-a-master-of-branding-2016-11-09)\nFacebook has also had problems with fake news appearing on its News Feed recommendations (thanks to the site's algorithms) and, obviously, shared by other users. This story alleging that Pope Francis \"shocked the world (http://www.sharedcount.com/#url=http%3A%2F%2Fendingthefed.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement.html)\" by endorsing Donald Trump was false, but was shared nearly 97,000 times on the social network. \"The barrier of entry is so low,\" says Ari Zoldan, chief executive of technology and media company Quantum Networks in New York. \"It's all interpretation wrapped in opinion, which produces material that is in tune with your own worldview and you share it and believe that to be true. Everything after the hard news reported on social media is the Wild West.\" Facebook also took some heat about slanting news feeds (http://www.forbes.com/sites/nelsongranados/2016/06/30/how-facebook-biases-your-news-feed/#32abe5995bc7). (On Thursday, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said claims that the site's fake new influenced the election result was a \"crazy idea (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-zuckerberg-crazy-idea-that-fake-news-posts-influenced-election-2016-11-10).\")\nThese two Americas, blithely unaware of what the other was saying, were convinced that their candidate would win, Susan Krauss Whitbourne says. \"Building these walls around yourself where you're not listening to the other side is happening more and more. We need to overcome this inability to talk to each other, now probably more than ever.\" While Facebook grapples with the proliferation of fake news, social networkers need to speak to each other, says Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor at American University's School of Communication in Washington, D.C. \"The problem is not that our media divide us, but rather that we have an underlying impulse to divide ourselves.\"\n-Quentin Fottrell;\nRELATED: Could Donald Trump overturn marriage equality?

      "title": "NUGENT: ‘To Make America Great Again – Job #1 Is To DE-PUSSIFY Entitled Pussies’",
      "text": "Nugent lowers the boom on Facebook. \nHere is the post in full: \nPussies on Parade are bad for America \nWe’ve got a lot of work to do in America to make it great again. \nJob #1 is to de-pussify all of the entitled, arrogant, ignorant, spoiled pussies created during the last eight years. That won’t be easy. \nThese entitled little rose pedals [sic] didn’t get their way in the election so they’re now whining, crying, protesting, bitching, squawking, complaining, walking-out of school, and demanding their sniveling, spoiled pussy voices be heard instead of manning up, putting on their big boy pants, and wading into the white-water rapids of life where pussies get swept away and drowned. \nInterestingly, I don’t recall any young people on the right-hand side of the political aisle throwing temper tantrums like these crying pussies after Mr. Obama won the White House in 2008 and 2012. \nWhat kind of parents raised these whining, spoiled, entitled pussies? Did they actually raise these little pussies to believe that when something doesn’t go their way that acting like a pussy will make people feel sorry for them and to let them get their way? \nIn addition to parents (and I use that term lightly) our colleges coddle these spoiled pussies instead of toughening them up and getting them ready for the rough and tumble world of the highly-competitive private sector where only the smart and tough get promoted. \nWhat parents, colleges and our culture have done to these spoiled pussies is a disservice to them and our great republic. What America needs are tough, hungry, competitive and smart young people to make it great again. \nNote to pussies: Hillary lost. Get over it, and get in the game of life. Quit being pussies. You’re embarrassing yourselves & America. \nYes, Pussies. You really are embarrassing yourselves and America. \nDo both of us a favor and get this. It’ll help. We promise. \nClashDaily.com’s, Editor-In-Chief, Doug Giles addresses our nation’s abysmal Pussification in his NEW book … PUSSIFICATION: The Effeminization Of The American Male by Doug Giles \nPUSS-I-FI-CA-TION*: The act, or process, of a man being shamed, taught, led, pastored, drugged or otherwise coerced or cajoled into throwing out his brain, handing over his balls and formally abandoning the rarefied air of the testosterone-leader-fog that God and nature hardwired him to dwell in, and instead become a weak, effeminate, mangina-sporting, shriveled up little pussy. \n* From The Doug Giles 2016 Dictionary of Grow the Hell Up, You Pussy! \nDoug Giles, best-selling author of Raising Righteous And Rowdy Girls and Editor-In-Chief of the mega-blog, ClashDaily.com, has just penned a book he guarantees will kick hipster males into the rarefied air of masculinity. \nThat is, if the man-child will put down his frappuccino; shut the hell up and listen and obey everything he instructs them to do in his timely and tornadic tome. \nIn PUSSIFICATION: The Effeminization Of The American Male , Giles takes ‘Crispin’ from the unaccomplished, prissy and dank corridors of ‘Pussville’ up the steep, treacherous and unforgiving trail that leads to ‘Mantown.’ \n“Secretly, everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a pussy generation.” – Clint Eastwood \nChapters include: \n– Four Signs You’ve Been Pussified \n– Bullies Love, And I Mean LOVE , Pussies (especially Big Government goons and Islamic radicals!) \n– Dear Christian: You Might be a Pussy … but Jesus Ain’t \n– Business Owners Should Avoid Pussies Like the Plague \n– Real Women Hate Pussies \n– How Parents Can Avoid Raising a Pussy \n– Four ‘MUSTS’ For Males To Move From Pussville To Mantown \nThis is definitely one of the most politically incorrect books to ever hit the market. \nIt will most certainly offend the entitled whiners, but it will also be a breath of fresh air to young males who wish to be men versus hipster dandies. \nShare if you are tired of Pussies embarrassing themselves AND America 579 shares Post navigation",

(WGN) -- A suburban man has been charged with murdering his roommate and family members say it may have been a revenge killing over a Facebook post. \nBoth the victim, 39-year-old Jason McCullough and the accused killer, 34-year-old Josiah Clark lived in a home on Arcadia Street in Park Forest. They'd been best friends and roommates for years but family members say the victim had recently learned of some disturbing allegations facing his old friend. McCullough took those allegations to police. But he also did something investigators believe may have directly led to his death. McCullough went on Facebook and posted the allegations. He called Clark a brother but said he wanted to warn the world about him. \nA short time later, police say, Clark went to the house and shot and killed his friend of 27 years. \nClark was picked up this week in the Twin Cities area. He was charged with First Degree Murder. Three other Chicagoland residents are charged with helping him try to evade justice. \nPolice say Clark should be back in Illinois to face that murder charge and likely additional charges by the beginning of next month.",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nhat tip: Fred Burks of www.wanttoknow.info (best overall site for ~100 topics of game-changing importance, including here on this topic )\nReality Calls’ 9-minute introduction to breaking evidence:\nTruthstream Media’s 11 minute focus on Hillary’s links to pedophilia and satanism:\nPlease take a look at VigilantCitizen’s dating pictures from whistleblowers of .01% pedophilia.\nThis emerging evidence continues what I last reported on in 2015 , and will repost:\n3-minute video from Invisible Empire with President Bush, Jr. kissing, fondling and embracing gay male prostitute, Jeff Gannon:\n2-minute video: connecting both presidents Bush to Jeff Gannon:\n10-minute 2005 Countdown segment on Jeff Gannon acting as a reporter to toss only softball questions:\nPresident George Bush, Sr. used one crisis actor and two outrageous lies for his unlawful war on Iraq in 1990:\nCrisis actor Nayirah , the daughter of Kuwait’s ambassador to the US, lied that she was a hospital volunteer and saw Iraq soldiers murder 312 infants by stealing incubators and throwing the infants onto the floor. Papa Bush and then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney lied that US satellite photos showed Iraq military massed at the Saudi Arabian border ready to attack. These photos have never been shown due to claims of “national security,” while commercially available satellite photos show zero Iraq military presence. President George Bush, Jr. used a crisis actor as a very friendly White House reporter to pretend the US War on Terror was legitimate policy to a crisis rather than obvious unlawful War of Aggression all began on lies known to be false as they were told .\nAs I wrote in 2010 , George Jr. used gay male prostitute, Jeff Gannon, to act for two years that the US faced a crisis of terrorism in front of the world’s media.\nThis is the most ridiculous use of a crisis actor : a US president’s gay male prostitute lover with zero press credentials entering the most elite media assignment at the White House to act that the “War on Terror” is real rather than staged.\nMost Americans are unaware that this gay male prostitute was allowed over 200 visits to the Bush White House between 2003 and 2005 with a “press pass” issued by White House leadership . According to Secret Service public records of check-in and check-out dates and times ( here and here ), most of the prostitute’s visits included several hours of time before and/or after press conferences, 32 times on days without press conferences, and 14 visits without checking-out in apparent overnight stays at the White House residence of Mr. Bush.\nSecret Service would ordinarily declare a security emergency and conduct a full search of the White House if their records indicated a person hadn’t checked-out at the end of a press conference. Apparently, this protocol wasn’t enacted because Mr. Gannon had permission to spend the night.\nJeff Gannon’s employment was gay male prostitution; he had no previous experience as a journalist and no association with any media when he began attending White House press conferences. Jeff Gannon’s gay male website had multiple photos of his fully-naked shaved body, and advertises to prospective clients that his penis is eight inches in length and circumcised.\nThe White House is the most difficult press conference in the world to attend, and only open to the most credentialed professionals from major media, yet Mr. Gannon received special White House permission without any connection to any media.\nMr. Bush’s history provides circumstantial evidence of homosexuality. He was a male cheerleader in high school, with reports of rooming in college with another male cheerleader, Victor Ashe (also here , here ), who would also rise in political influence with reports of his homosexuality . Mr. Bush is on the record telling other men they “have a pretty face” and are “good-looking,” uses the word “fabulous” frequently (and here ), and kisses and touches other men’s faces .\nI’m fine with consenting adults doing whatever they wish with each other. We the People , however, reject criminal lies of treason from crisis actors to support ordering US military into unlawful Wars of Aggression to war-murder and become legitimate targets of people defending their nation from an invading and unwelcome military.\nDespite this damning evidence of Mr. Bush engaged in prostitute sex during White House business hours on our tax money, and just five years after President Clinton’s impeachment for lying about consensual sex with a non-prostitute, Congress refused to investigate .\nThe bigger picture of pedophilia: Fully documented and called “The Franklin Affair,” the CIA ordered that a child prostitution ring involved with political “leadership” of both parties not to be investigated , despite damning evidence.\nThe Franklin Affair was headlined in the Washington Times in 1989 (photo of headline here ):\nHomosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush\n“A homosexual prostitution ring is under investigation by federal and District authorities and includes among its clients key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, military officers, congressional aides and US and foreign businessmen with close social ties to Washington’s political elite. Reporters for this newspaper examined hundreds of credit-card vouchers, drawn on both corporate and personal cards and made payable to the escort service operated by the homosexual ring.“\n— Washington Times, 6/29/1989\nFrom wanttoknow.info’s documentation of The Franklin Affair , with additional information at the link, including the 55-minute documentary censored from The Discovery Channel:\nFeaturing intrepid investigator John DeCamp , a highly decorated Vietnam war veteran and 16-year Nebraska state senator, Conspiracy of Silence reveals how rogue elements at all levels of government have been involved in systematic child sex abuse and pedophilia to feed the base desires of key politicians.\nBased on DeCamp’s riveting book, The Franklin Cover-up , Conspiracy of Silence begins with the shut-down of Nebraska’s Franklin Community Federal Credit Union after a raid by federal agencies in November 1988 revealed that $40 million was missing. When the Nebraska legislature launched a probe into the affair, what initially looked like a financial swindle soon exploded into a startling tale of drugs, money laundering, and a nationwide child sex abuse ring. Nineteen months later, the legislative committee’s chief investigator died suddenly and violently. A dozen others linked to the Franklin case investigation died strange and mysterious deaths.\nSo why have you never heard of the Franklin cover-up? Originally scheduled to air in May of 1994 on the Discovery Channel, Conspiracy of Silence was yanked at the last minute due to formidable pressure applied by top politicians.\nThe even Bigger Picture beyond pedophilia and prostitution: We the People already have abundant and irrefutable evidence to demand arrests for Emperor’s New Clothes obvious crimes of:\nUnlawful and lie-began wars . So-called “money” that is actually debt to create accelerating and unpayable total debt. Destruction of nearly all rights lawfully guaranteed in the US Bill of Rights within the US Constitution , and in Orwellian inversion of limited government . Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy that has poverty-murdered over 400 million human beings just since 1995; more than killed from all wars in Earth’s recorded history. The massive crimes end whenever we say we’re ready.\nAnd hey, just from me to you: What kind of American do you call yourself if you’re not demanding arrests to lawfully stop obvious crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions?\nAre you an American defending limited government under our Constitution , or a subject of dictators to continue these crimes with your submission?\nWhen will you reject these ridiculous crisis actors as your “leaders”?!? I mean, if we asked you to imagine a more tragic-comic story than what you just read, I doubt you could, true?\nTrue?\nJust who do you say you are demonstrated in thoughts, words, and actions???\n**\nNote: I make all factual assertions as a National Board Certified Teacher of US Government, Economics, and History, with all economics factual claims receiving zero refutation since I began writing in 2008 among Advanced Placement Macroeconomics teachers on our discussion board , public audiences of these articles , and international conferences .

      "text": "Zuckerberg offers plan for Facebook to fight fake news sites Video Photo Mark Zuckerberg gestures while addressing the audience during a meeting of the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) CEO Summit in Lima, Peru, November 19, 2016. (REUTERS/Mariana Bazo) By Geoffrey Mohan, Los Angeles Times Nov 19, 2016 at 8:14 pm | Print View \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a seven-point plan to combat fake news sites that played a role in the recent election. \nThe social media site will attempt to hit the fake news purveyors where it hurts, by interrupting the way these users generate revenue through advertising. Also, the company will devise algorithms based on users’ flags of false content to help detect content likely to be fake, and then remove it. \nZuckerberg said Facebook employees were not trying to be “arbiters of truth,” but instead would rely on users to moderate the vast content on the site. \n“We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible,” Zuckerberg said in a post published on the site late Friday night. “We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content.” \nThe company will make it easier for users to report and flag fake stories, and explore ways to include warnings to future readers of that content. It also will reach out to additional third-party organizations to help vet claims made in stories, and will “raise the bar” for how stories are displayed as “related content.” \nThe announcement came as Zuckerberg flew to Peru to address an Asian-Pacific trade summit in Lima, where he told world leaders Saturday that more connectivity would help raise people out of poverty. \nZuckerberg has been under public pressure since the election, as some observers have suggested that fake news circulated through Facebook may have influenced voters who chose Donald Trump for president. President Barack Obama has said the wide dissemination of false news presents a threat to democratic institutions. \nZuckerberg initially dismissed the notion that misinformation drove voters’ choice, calling it a “crazy idea” and saying that 99 percent of the content on the site was reliable. He changed course, however, soon after Google announced it would ban fake news sites from using its advertising services. \nZuckerberg’s subsequent proposal to ban such users from its own advertising network drew criticism from analysts, who argued that most false news sites don’t use the service. \nFake news organizations usually run ads on their own sites, using marketing services such as Google AdSense, to place those ads around their articles. They then steer readers to their stories through Facebook. \nMost of the fake news services have little or no name recognition and rely on social media to find an audience and generate the clicks that help generate ad revenue. Facebook’s algorithm acts as a catalyst, spreading the content to other users’ news feeds as it rises in popularity. \nOne such ad scheme generated lucrative revenue for a group of young people in the Macedonian town of Veles, who had launched more than 140 fake news sites, BuzzFeed reported. \nAmong the false stories from that network was a report that candidate Hillary Clinton would be indicted in 2017. It generated more than 140,000 shares, comments and reactions on Facebook, BuzzFeed reported. \nAnother false story suggested that Clinton in 2013 had said she thought Trump was “honest” and should be elected president. It drew more than three times that activity on Facebook. \nAmong those who praised Zuckerberg’s moves was Jeff Jarvis, director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York. Jarvis co-wrote his own plan, published Friday on Medium, that cautioned against censorship by the platform itself, including creation of blacklists of suspect sites and “whitelists” of reliable ones. \nJarvis urged Facebook to make it easier for readers to scroll over an article to see pop-up content that refutes its claims, and to provide a path for reputable news agencies and fact-checking groups to post that refuting information and its source. He also suggested that Facebook more prominently display reliable media “brands,” such as large-circulation newspapers, and offer simple ways to track back to the original source of content.

      "text": "While Facebook is great for many things; reliving memories of your more care-free days at college, watching hilarious videos of pugs and remembering your friends' birthdays, being just a few, it can also be a little awkward in other ways thanks to its \"On This Day\" feature.\nThe daily feature acts like the TimeHop app, in that it brings up photographs you uploaded or were tagged in on the same day over the past few years for you to hopefully reminisce over. But unfortunately that doesn't always happen, because sometimes it's bad memories you're reminded of. Like ones containing ex-partners. Ain't nobody got time for that.\n But thankfully, the folks over at Metro have discovered there's a way to ensure your memories don't contain certain people or certain dates. GENIUS.\nHere's how it's done:\nOpen Facebook in an internet browser On your news feed, look down the left-hand side for the Apps section and click on \"On this Day\"\nThis will open up your Memories page, where you'll see the 'Preferences' button in the top right-hand corner\nThere, you can choose to \"filter\" as many people or dates as you wish from displaying. And just like that, they're out of your life again. It's great that Facebook can be so understanding about these awkward situations.\nFollow Cat on Twitter\nFrom: Cosmopolitan UK\n ",

      "text": "By Froma Harrop, Creators Syndicate \nDear Facebook friends, \nIf you don’t see me gushing over the pix of your Thanksgiving pies, take no offense. It’s not that your pie is a bore (though, frankly, it is). And it’s not because I unfriended you. It’s because Facebook has become a platform for the sort of fake news stories that helped elect Donald Trump. In doing so, Facebook undermines our civic culture — its creepy smile floating overhead. \nI’m so out of there. I’ve wanted to quit for a long time, having wearied of friends’ pictorials of their idyllic family and personal lives. I know for a fact that some of the most glowing portrayals come from (mostly) women who couldn’t make it to noon without a fistful of meds. I still love them, and if they wish to connect, they have my number. \nThough hyper-partisan fake news stories have come from both the left and the right, Facebook entrepreneurs know that the money is in plowing the Trumpian fields. And for all the patriotic memes, foreigners are behind much of the manipulation of the American public. \nKids in a town in Macedonia (that’s near Greece) created over 100 pro-Trump websites, spreading phony reports such as FBI plans to indict Hillary Clinton. The Make America Great page outsources the writing of fraudulent news to a couple in the Philippines. \nCompounding the evil, Facebook’s design makes fake stories from fake sites such as the nonexistent Denver Guardian look like stories from the very real Denver Post. And no, blocking fake news sites from ad revenues is not going to stop politically motivated lying. \nFacebook further degrades the national conversation by creating echo chambers. Its algorithm directs the “news” people like to their like-minded friends. \nNo chains shackle us to Facebook. \nAleks Krotoski, a technology journalist for BBC, saw a wave of Britons leaving Facebook after the Brexit vote — mostly people opposed to leaving the European Union. “They were shocked by the fact that they had found themselves in an echo chamber, in a bubble,” she told me. \nAdding to my disgust with Facebook’s amoral business model is founder Mark Zuckerberg’s excuse for it. Facebook is not a media company; it’s a technology company, he explained. \nSo why has Facebook been so joyfully ravaging the advertising base of real news media companies, which put sweat, pride and dollars into reporting? As just one example, Facebook last year siphoned about $27 million in digital ads from The Guardian, according to a former editor. \nZuckerberg says he doesn’t want Facebook making judgments on what “news” is acceptable for its site. Funny, Facebook bans pictures of female breasts in the name of decency but sees nothing indecent about putting lies into the mouth of Pope Francis. We refer to the total falsehood, seen almost a million times, that the pope had endorsed Trump. \nPublic-spirited Trump voters should object to such corporate dereliction. But Clinton supporters have more reason for rage at Facebook for letting con men poison Clinton’s candidacy — at a profit to both Facebook and the cons. \nI know quitting Facebook would be hard for many. It has something of a lock on group communications. But there’s something of a monkey-see, monkey-do element of Facebook that when someone announces she’s leaving, others do likewise. \n“If you have a critical mass of people who get fed up and leave, Facebook would be in trouble,” Krotoski said. \nAn alternative would push that day closer. We need something to challenge the nature of the commitment and the connections that people have to one another on Facebook. Surely, there are innovators working feverishly on a replacement. If they succeed, they’ll make a fortune. I will help them in my microscopic way. \nIn the meantime, I’m leaving Facebook. Follow me. \nFollow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

      "text": "\nFollow the Buckeyes on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Snapchat \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) – Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said his team accomplished what it set out to do Saturday in a blowout win over less-talented NIU Brooklyn: The Buckeyes improved. \nSierra Calhoun scored 22 points and Kelsey Mitchell added 21 as No. 7 Ohio State routed the Northeast Conference team 113-54. \n''Obviously, today was going to be more about us, and how we handled this game and this situation,'' McGuff said. ''Because we're really trying to focus on ourselves and getting better, and we did that. If we were going make it about the score or something like that, then we were going to get distracted and caught up in some things that we shouldn't be doing.'' \nThe more aggressive Buckeyes had 18 steals and with a size advantage inside, outrebounded the Blackbirds 56 to 30. \nMakayla Waterman added 15 points and nine rebounds for Ohio State, and Kiara Lewis had 12 points. Tori McCoy had nine points and 12 rebounds. \n''I think we played good as a team,'' Calhoun said. ''I felt like the ball was moving a lot more than it normally does. I feel like we're getting better as a team gradually as the games go on.'' \nDrew Winter led LIU Brooklyn with 12 points, and Brianna Farris Drew had 10. The Blackbirds are winless in their first three starts. \nMitchell, an All-American and arguably the Big Ten's best player, was her usual hot-shooting self, going 8 for 11 from the floor, hitting four 3-pointers and dishing five assists. \nWith a front-court size advantage of a couple inches, Ohio State (3-1) dominated under the basket, logging 62 points in the paint compared with zero by the Blackbirds. Ohio State shot 50.4 percent from the floor, while LIU Brooklyn made just 31.5 percent of its shots. \nOhio State's 11-0 run to begin the game set the tone. The Buckeyes led 32-8 after the first period on the strength of Duke transfer Calhoun's 5 for 5 shooting from beyond the arc. The Blackbirds played better in the second period but still trailed 59-20 at the half. Ohio State led by 53 after three quarters. \n''My team did a great job of finding me after they saw I was hitting all those 3s,'' Calhoun said. ''Once that first shot goes in your confidence goes up, and I just kept shooting.'' \nLIU Brooklyn coach Stephanie Oliver said there were bright spots for her team. \n''It prepared us for our conference,'' she said. ''Look, we can score 54 points on a good basketball team. Our out-of-bounds plays work, our offense works. If we can execute against them and get better against them, it's really going to help us down the line.'' \nBIG PICTURE \nLIU Brooklyn: After their third straight loss by double-digits to open the season, the Blackbirds have much room for improvement. \nOhio State: The Buckeyes' lighter preconference schedule continues, giving them a chance to work out the bugs before the tougher games begin. They did what they were supposed to do against a less-talented team. \n''Playing teams like this helps us out executing plays, doing the little things, making nice passes, posting up well,'' McCoy said. ''It was a learning experience for all of us.'' \nINJURY REPORT \nOhio State forward Stephanie Mavunga got the day off because of what McGuff described as ''general soreness.'' \nPOLL IMPLICATIONS \nOhio State likely will stay put at or around No. 7. \nUP NEXT \nLIU Brooklyn: Plays University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Friday night at the TD Bank Classic in Burlington, Vermont. \nOhio State: Travels to Fort Myers to play Florida Gulf Coast. \nOhio State Postgame Notes \nEvery Buckeye that played scored at least four points The Buckeyes made a season-high 10 three-pointers and shot 50 percent from beyond the arc Ohio State had 62 points in the paint and held LIU Brooklyn to zero points in the paint Ohio State had a season-high 56 rebounds and have had 50 or more rebounds in three of the first four games The Buckeyes forced a season-high 28 turnovers and scored 29 points off those miscues The 113 points were tied for the fifth-most in a game in school history and the most since 117 points in the Senior Day win over Illinois last season Kelsey Mitchell was 4-of-6 from long range and is now just one three-pointer away from the OSU career three-point mark Sierra Calhoun scored a career-high 22 points on a career-high 5-of-6 from long range. She also had a career-high four steals \n",

(Photo: Anthony Rizzo, Instagram) \nAnthony Rizzo is showing off his musical skills again. \nOn Friday night, Rizzo shared a video of himself playing The Scientist by Coldplay on the piano with his dad on the drums. It's quite lovely, even if it's not perfect. A video posted by Anthony Rizzo (@arizz_44) on Nov 18, 2016 at 5:59pm PST \nThere's a part where his dad gets off beat a little, but Rizzo simply smiles and laughs it off. The mistake only makes the performance more endearing. \nRizzo's past performances have included Adele's Hello and the national anthem . \nLet's all hope that Rizzo father-son duets become thing this offseason.
