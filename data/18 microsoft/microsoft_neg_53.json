      "text": "\nEarlier this year, Microsoft introduced a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, called Tay. Microsoft’s Tay chatbot was an interesting product: it worked really well in most cases, but it also caused a lot of controversy with its inappropriate and racist comments. Following Tay’s disastrous launch, Microsoft pulled the chatbot quickly. Along with taking the chatbot offline, Microsoft issued a statement saying that the company is making adjustments to its AI chatbot so that it doesn’t make any inappropriate comments.\nAnd now, it seems like Microsoft is ready to introduce its next chatbot. Meet Zo — the software giant’s latest take on chatbots powered by artificial intelligence. The chatbot was spotted by Twitter user Tom Hounsell , and users can give it a try right now. At the moment, Zo is only available on Kik which is definitely an interesting platform to choose. Unlike Tay, Zo isn’t yet available on Twitter and that’s not really a surprise after what happened earlier this year . However, the app will likely come to Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Snapchat once it’s officially announced.\nZo is essentially a censored Tay or an English-variant of Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice. Zo is very good at normal conversations — for example, Zo does a “super abbreviated personality test” at the initial launch, in which it asks you if you would rather study in school or learn from experience. But when you move on to talking about topics like politics, Zo will simply reply “people can say some awful thins when talking politics so I don’t discuss.”\nHere’s the quick conversation we had with Zo:\nGallery As you can see, Zo is pretty smart when it comes to conversations related to Microsoft’s own products — for instance, in a reply to one of my messages, the chatbot said “Other Windows Phone user here.” and when I asked about Xiaoice, Zo replied “Very cool to have fam across the world.”\nMicrosoft is yet to officially announce Zo, and we’ll likely have more details about the chatbot when it’s officially announced. In the meantime, if you are a Kik user and want to give Zo a try, you can get started here. \n",

      "text": "Microsoft Announces Cloud Storage Options For Office On Android  44 PST Image credit – Microsoft \nAs much as Microsoft would love for all their users to use their OneDrive cloud storage service, the reality is that users already have their own cloud storage services that they’re probably used to using by now. The good news for Office users on Android is that Microsoft is now giving users more cloud storage options to choose from . \nAccording to Microsoft, “We are excited to announce that the Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP) is now available for the Office apps on Android devices. Office on Windows desktops has long supported partner integrations that let you open and edit documents from a wide variety of storage locations.” \nWhat does this mean? Basically before this if you wanted to open your documents from the cloud, there weren’t many options available and OneDrive was one of them. However with this change, users will now be able to choose from various cloud services that they can open their documents from, such as Dropbox, Box, Egnyte, and Tencent. \nMicrosoft has announced that they do plan to eventually add more cloud storage options in the future, so for now these are your choices. We should point out that these cloud storage options have been available on desktop for a while now, so this update seems to target mobile users, more specifically Office users on Android. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "VM-Neutral Node.js API Unveiled, As NodeSource Collaborates With Microsoft, Mozilla, Intel and IBM Published by Slashdot on Sun, 04 Dec 2016 An anonymous reader writes:This week saw the first proof of concept for Node.js API (or NAPI for short), \"making module maintainers' lives easier by defining a stable module API that is independent from changes in [Google's JavaScript engine] V8 and allowing modules to run against newer versions of Node.js without recompilation.\" Their announcement cites both the efforts of the Node.js API working group and of ChakraCore, the core part of the Chakra Javascript engine that powers Microsoft Edge. And there was also a second announcement -- that the Node.js build system \"will start producing nightly node-chakracore builds, enabling Node.js to be used with the ChakraCore JavaScript engine. \"These initial efforts are stepping stones to make Node.js VM-neutral, which would allow more opportunities for Node.js in IoT and mobile use cases as well as a variety of different systems.\" One IBM runtime developer called it \"a concrete step toward the strategic end goal of VM neutrality,\" and the Node.js Foundation believes that the API will ultimately result in \"more modules to choose from, and more stability with modules without the need to continually upgrade.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

By: Express Web Desk | Published:December 4, 2016 3:47 pm Reports suggest that almost 200 companies are slated to visit the institute’s Kanpur campus for placements this year. \nAn Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur student has bagged Rs 1.5 crore per annum salary package job offer from Microsoft as part of the placement drive of the institute. The student, who belongs to Delhi, will have to shift to Redmond to work at the company’s headquarters to work on software design, implementation and bug fixing. \nThe student will be receiving $136000 (Rs 94 lakh) as basic pay, in addition to $70,000 as expenditure for medical, visa charges, stock ownership options and relation, according to a report in The Times of India. This rounds the total package off to almost Rs 1.5 crore. \nSources suggest that almost 200 companies are slated to visit the institute’s Kanpur campus for placements this year. Last year, this number was about 280, with the highest pay package being Rs 93 lakh. \nCompanies offering technology for reservoir characterisation, drilling, production and processing operations for natural fuels are not present, the report says. Companies such as Transocean and Schlumberger have also not made it to the placement season this time. \nA number of e-commerce firms, such as Amazon, Ola, Uber and Paytm , are also taking part in the placements. Out of these, Uber is yet to select students. ",

      "text": "Home / News / Software News / Microsoft's Home Hub to rival Amazon and Google will be software not hardware Microsoft's Home Hub to rival Amazon and Google will be software not hardware \nby Ben Woods Read Comments \nScant details of Microsoft's Home Hub system have surfaced online, suggesting that the rival to Amazon and Google's smart home hubs will be a full software solution, rather than requiring a standalone device. \nDetails drawn together by Windows Central this week suggest that rather than aiming for a screenless unit activated purely by voice commands, Microsoft's Home Hub will reportedly aim at pulling together different Windows devices in a home to allow for easier access across the whole family, and home automation tasks like you can already carry out on the opposition's hardware. \nThe bonus of not tying Home Hub to a single device, and instead integrating it as a standard feature of upcoming releases of Windows 10, is that those devices already have a display built in. While voice control is an inarguable convenience that will form a core of Microsoft's Home Hub features, the ability to use alternate inputs is a smart way to approach it. \nThe Hub will also reportedly significantly revamp clunky account sharing features to make it easier for families to share certain content with everyone in the home. Right now, you can have single accounts for each user and switch between them, but the Home Hub will bring the ability to have a 'family' account that can be accessed by anyone without a password. \nWh at is Windows Hello and what can I do with it? \nWhile that might not sound too advanced, users that open the family account will still be able to get their own personal information (calendar events, for example) by authenticating via Windows Hello. An easily accessible Hub that can still show you private information when authenticated is considerably smarter sounding. \nAs part of the Family Desktop, parents will also get an easy way to control which apps everyone can access, making it particularly handy for parents. These rules will also be applicable across Windows Mobile, iOS and Android apps, apparently. \nPerhaps more intererestingly than any of that, however, is that Cortana's integration into the Hub will bring an ability to recognise and respond to different family users - providing information and services specific to that person. Naturally, it should also be able to do the same sort of home automation tasks you'd expect of a smart home system and will reportedly support OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) and OpenT2T (Open Translators to Things) standards for controlling devices. \nNow for the bad news. Building an all-encompassing hub appears to be an iterative process for Microsoft and it's unlikely all the features will arrive at once. Given that there are now two capable smart home systems on the market, long delays could see Microsoft cede some of the advantage of the breadth of its desktop user base. \nRelated: Samsung Smartthings review \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nDo you think Microsoft is moving too slowly in the smart home space?

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s HoloLens mixed reality headset is rapidly moving from a curiosity to a useful and practical tool in everyday professional settings.\nThe latest implementation is using the headset to guide orthopaedic surgeons during the messy and risky work of spinal surgery.\nDr. Henrique Lampert, an orthopedic spine surgeon working in Santa Catarina, Brazil at the Instituto de Ortopedia e Traumatologia de Jaraguá do Sul, along with his development partner Dr. Bruno Gobbato, is using the device to help with a common procedure called spine arthrodesis, commonly called spinal fusion, where screws are used to fix parts of the spinal where movement caused pain and other issues. They are using the headset to guide surgeons to more precisely place these pedicle screws, to prevent complications such as neural damage and the implant loosening, which can be caused by incorrect placement.\nThe HoloLens help the team visualize a 3D model of the patient’s spine created via 3D CT scan which includes the ideal trajectory of the screws. The team notes that a HoloLens is cheaper and more accessible than intra-operative CT scanning, which is available in only a few locations.\nThey note that the only issue is the actual rendering power of the device, as they feel somewhat limited to the size and level of detail of the 3D mesh the HoloLens supports as well as the framerate it can generate from a complex model. On the other hand they love the “limited” field of view, as it allows them to have an unobstructed view of other screens, records and other items not generated by the HoloLens.\nThe implementation has not been commercialized yet, but Dr Lampert hopes to create a course which other surgeons interested in HoloLens can use to implement the solution locally.\nSee a video (which includes actual surgery) showing off the technology below.\n",

      "text": "Lucas Chess is a free chess training and playing program for Microsoft Windows devices that ships with an impressive set of features.\nWhile I do know how to play chess, I was never particularly good at the game. My father taught me the game of kings, but I lost interest in the game and started to explore other gaming options early on.\nChess has simple rules that anyone can learn quickly, but it is highly strategic and requires excellent forward thinking capabilities.\nLucas Chess \nLucas Chess is a free, long standing, chess training and playing program for Windows that is suitable for absolute beginners, grandmasters, and anyone in between the two extremes.\nThe chess program ships with 36 different engines ranging from 1300 elo all the way up to 3000 elo. Additionally, it ships with engines designed specifically for young children who pose little challenge but help explore chess in a non-competitive environment (and win likely against the computer early on).\nThe section for children is gamified a bit as well. Children can try to complete animal albums by beating opponents. For each opponent beat in the game, a new animal picture is revealed. You may proceed to the next album once all animals of an album are collected.\n\nWhile you can play against various engines without using the training components of Lucas Chess, this is one area in which the program really shines.\nIf you select competition for instance, you start against a beginning engine. The engine analyses each move you make, and suggests different moves if your move is less than ideal.\n\nThis may help you get better at the game by analyzing why the tutor suggested a different move.\nAs far as play options are concerned, you can pick an elo rating that you want the engine to emulate, or customize the engine by selecting it from the list of available ones instead.\nThe customization options are impressive. One option that you have is to assign a personality to the engine that you can assign specific opening, mid game and end game strategies for.\nTraining makes up a big part of Lucas Chess. While you may not find all training options useful, like checking your memory on a chessboard or playing blind chess (without seeing the actual pieces on the board, like memory chess), others may be quite useful.\nYou may train end game or mid game positions, play against grandmasters, try to find the best moves, or learn openings by repetition.\nClosing Words Lucas Chess is a program designed for chess players of all skills. Absolute beginners may use it to play against computer opponents that are relatively easy to beat. The tutoring system with its move suggestion option helps get better at the game over time.\nSomewhat experienced players may learn new openings, mid or end game strategies, or play against computer opponents that match their skill.\nLucas Chess, all in all is an excellent program for anyone interested in chess.\nGhacks needs you.

You're Good to Go! We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%. Follow No spam, no fuss; just the latest updates delivered right to you. You're Good to Go! We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%. Follow   \nWhile Sony's PlayStation 4 remains the dominant new-generation home console in terms of units sold, Microsoft's Xbox One has been on a streak for a good chunk of 2016. It's been the best-selling console in the United States since July and in the UK and Australia since September. According to one report, the Xbox One outperformed the PS4 on Black Friday . Now, Xbox UK marketing director Harvey Eagle has come out to say 2016 will be remembered in gaming circles as a \"tipping point\" in the Xbox One's history. \n\"Momentum is really important in this business, because it gives confidence to retailers, publishers, and to consumers,\" Eagle told GI.biz . \"We are giving them confidence that they have made a right point. I think we'll look back on 2016 as a tipping point for Xbox One.\" \nWe will know if Microsoft can extend its streak to five months, when the NPD Group releases hardware figures for November next Thursday, December 8. \nLooking ahead to 2017, Eagle said Microsoft is well-positioned to \"sustain and build on\" the momentum from 2016. He called out first-party games like Halo Wars 2 and Sea of Thieves as being top titles for the year, while the executive also mentioned Project Scorpio as being a growth-driver. The console, which is more powerful than the Xbox One but does not replace it, goes on sale in holiday 2017. \nAnother point of focus for Microsoft this holiday and beyond will be to convince more Xbox 360 owners to migrate to Xbox One. Eagle said the Xbox One's backwards compatibility feature should help ease the transition between platforms for people who are on the fence. \n\"Our data shows that there is still a significant number of households actively using their Xbox 360 who haven't upgraded yet,\" Eagle said. \"[The backwards compatibility list] is growing all the time and I think it is definitely a benefit for Xbox 360 owners, to know that the money that they've already spent on games won't get wasted when they upgrade to Xbox One.\" \nRead the full GI.biz interview here . \nIn October 2015, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said the PS4's sales lead, at the time, was so large that he wasn't sure if the Xbox One could ever catch up . Spencer added that the situation surrounding the Xbox One's launch, marked by dramatic policy reversals and controversial comments from executives who have since left the company, had a negative effect on the platform's ability to have a strong start.

Through Microsoft's \"Hey Cortana\" feature, you can get the attention of the voice assistant just by saying \"Hey Cortana,\" and segue into your converation seamlessly. Let's see how this works.\nIn Windows 10, click on the microphone icon next to Cortana's \"Ask me anything\" field to open the Cortana window.\n\nThen click on the Settings icon (the one that looks like a gear).\n\nIn the Settings pane, turn on the option under \"Hey Cortana\" that says \"Let Cortana respond to 'Hey Cortana.'\"\n\nNow Cortana will respond to you when you utter that special phrase. But, wait, there's more. The next option says: \"Keep my device from sleeping when it's plugged in so I can always say 'Hey Cortana' (unless I turn it off myself).\" If you want your laptop to never fall asleep when plugged into an outlet so that \"Hey Cortana\" will always be available, turn on this option.\n\nNext up is deciding who can say \"Hey Cortana\" to activate the voice assistant. If you want anybody to be able to turn on the feature by saying the magic words, then click on the button that says: \"Respond when anyone says 'Hey Cortana.'\" If you want to be the only person who can wake up Cortana by voice, then click on the next button that says: \"Try to respond to only me.\"\n\nIf you're going to be the sole user of \"Hey Cortana,\" then it's a good idea to help Cortana better understand the sound and quality and nuances of your voice. In that case, click on the link that says: \"Learn how I say 'Hey Cortana.'\"\n\nA screen pops up telling you that you'll have to repeat six phrases so Cortana can get familiar with your voice. As the screen says, it's best to do this in a quiet place so no extraneous noise interferes with the process. Click on the Start button.\n\nCortana prompts you to repeat the six phrases, one after the other. If it has trouble understanding a particular phrase, it will ask you to repeat it. When you've repeated all six phrases to Cortana's satisfaction, you can now say \"Hey Cortana\" followed by your question, command, or comment, but now with a bit more confidence that it will understand what you're saying.\n\nOkay, now that Cortana can wake up via your voice, what are some questions, commands, and comments you can throw at it? Here are a few examples. You can tell Cortana to…\nOpen a specific app on your Windows 10 PC Turn key Windows 10 features on and off Set a calendar appointment for a specific date and time. Set a reminder for a specific date and time Provide a weather forecast Compose and send emails and texts to specific people Search for photos, videos, music, documents, and other files by name or other criteria Serve up information on various research questions, such as \"What is the population of the United States?\" or \"Who was the 25th US president?\" Tell you a joke Cortana can even offer suggestions as it learns more about you. For example, it can cull information about you from its Notebook (the third icon from the top of the Cortana window) to suggest books to read, movies to see, restaurants to dine at, and events to attend. It can also track the status of your airline flights, package shipments, investments, local traffic, and an array of other items.\n\nFinally, Microsoft's Meet Cortana and What is Cortana webpages provide more details on just what you can ask the voice assistant.

      "title": "Microsoft takes aim at Amazon’s Echo with Windows 10 HomeHub feature",
      "text": "Microsoft is planning to build a HomeHub feature into future Windows 10 updates to better compete against devices like Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the feature is currently in the planning stages, and the software maker is expected to introduce a “HomeHub” in updates due in 2017 and 2018, and not the upcoming Creators Update. \nWindows Central reports that the feature will “crush” Google Home and Amazon Echo, but The Verge understands that HomeHub is designed to be a service and feature that will run on any Windows 10 PC and turn it into a machine where Cortana can be summoned from the lockscreen to provide useful information. Windows Central previously reported that the HomeHub was a voice-activated speaker that was supposed to be unveiled at Microsoft’s Surface hardware event back in October. Those reports were inaccurate, but Microsoft is planning a software feature with the same name.\nThe primary focus for HomeHub is to create a family environment for a PC. Microsoft has tried a variety of different methods to enable family accounts, privacy controls, and app sharing over the years, but HomeHub is part of a new Family team in the Windows group at Microsoft, sources tell us. Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet reports that Microsoft has been hiring people into this team, with a focus on a family environment for Windows.\nWindows 10 HomeHub Welcome Screen concept by Windows Central Windows Central has obtained some concept plans for HomeHub, including the ability to share appointments, apps, and other data on a PC without it being logged into an account. This would allow a PC to be used like a Google Home or Amazon Echo, for queries via Cortana and for simple access to apps. Microsoft is experimenting with the idea of a Welcome Screen, with a fullscreen interface that will display items as if they’re a virtual fridge door for families. This type of software could enable third-party PC makers to create more kitchen-like devices to compete with Amazon’s Echo.\nMicrosoft is planning to enable Cortana to be the center of its HomeHub initiative, and the integration will allow the assistant to provide HomeHub-like features across iOS and Android. This will include extending the assistant to control smart devices and manage them from the Windows 10 HomeHub feature. Microsoft’s HomeHub plans are currently in the planning phases, so many features will likely change and the interface itself could be entirely cut out of future Windows 10 updates. Microsoft has largely been left out of the emergence of the smart home, despite having Cortana running on the Xbox One . The HomeHub is Microsoft’s bet to try and control the ecosystem before Amazon, Google, or even Apple provide the best framework to manage devices in your home.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Specs Leaked By Adnan Farooqui on 12/04/2016 08:39 PST \nMicrosoft released the Surface Pro 4 in October last year and even though it’s a pretty powerful computer it’s due for a refresh. While Microsoft hasn’t confirmed when the successor will be out, a new report claims to leak Microsoft Surface Pro 5 specs. As is the case with a new iteration of any product, we can expect Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to come with improved internals and perhaps some minor changes to the design as well. \nAccording to the report , the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 specs include Intel Kaby Lake processors, the ability to select up to 512GB of SSD storage, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt ports as well as a new Surface Pen that’s capable of charging wirelessly through a magnetic charging dock bundled with the Surface Pro 5. \nRumor has it that the Surface Pro 5 display resolution may be bumped up to 4K considering the fact that Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture does have native 4K support, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Microsoft will do this. Take this particular bit of leaked information with a healthy dose of salt for now. \nAdditional Microsoft Surface Pro 5 specs might include a fingerprint scanner built into the display itself. The device may come with the latest Windows 10 major update when it’s released. Microsoft hasn’t confirmed as yet when it’s going to release the Surface Pro 5 but rumor has it that the device will be out at some point in the first quarter of 2017. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "December 4, 2016 0 Microsoft last pushed Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977, the latest Redstone 2 or Creators update Build to devices of Windows Insiders in Fast ring. Read the full official changelog and known issues by clicking here. Now we share our Impressions of the build including performance, multitasking, gaming, navigation demo, bugs & Installation experience. We have also demoed the unmentioned fixes. Build 14977 Installation Experience: The Installation experience for Build 14977 has been smooth on most of the devices except some Lumia 550 and Lumia 650 devices. Microsoft had already included this in the list of known issues. It took around 40 to 45 minutes for the build to get downloaded, installed, data migrated and the devices getting up and running. This time around the download and installation issues are mostly gone. You can refer to our common issues and errors fixing guide for more. You will be usually notified for a restart when the download has completed in background. You can check our tutorial on how to prepare for upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. Build 14977 Hands-on Impressions (Performance, Multitasking, Gaming, Battery Life & more): Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977 seems to be a mixed bag in terms of overall experience. We didn’t need to do hard reset after installing this build. In case you are facing lots of issues after installation of Build 14977 you can do a hard reset. You can refer to our Backup and reset tutorial if you need to do a hard reset. Build 14977 was found to be smooth during normal daily smartphone tasks like start-screen navigation, apps list scrolling, opening and closing of settings, handling calls, texts and more. We didn’t face random reboots and freezes on Build 14977. Coming to other routine and important stuff, Mobile Data and WiFi connections work fine on our devices Multitasking for apps and games needs a fix in terms of RAM management. While resuming of app and games works impressively, apps and games may crash in background while multitasking. Many times apps or games restart instead of getting suspended in background. Microsoft Edge though seemingly faster has issues of crashing of tabs. Video Playback and streaming works fine Battery Life is good on Build 14977 as compared to previous builds. Major Bug & Issues : Bluetooth functionality needs a UI overhaul with control options like allowing “which devices to connect automatically” or “manually”. There should be option to manually search for Bluetooth devices. RAM management seems causing issues while multitasking with many apps in the background Microsoft Edge Tabs crash at times while browsing In a Nutshell: We are running Build 14977 as a daily driver and it offers mixed experience. We recommend going for it. If you have stomach for bugs / issues but stronger love for new features upgrade to it or else move to Slow / Release Preview Ring. Future builds may bring even more bugs. We also want to make it clear that it is our hands-on experience with the build and your experience may vary and may be better or worse than ours. We recommend hard reset, if you are facing lots of issues. You can read our guide to fix commonly known Windows 10 Mobile upgrade, installation and usability issues.

But that all changed after he met Kasey Champion … \n“For Champion, who just celebrated her fourth anniversary with the company, joining Rettig’s team has been the fulfillment of everything she’s worked toward at Microsoft. She’s able to combine her passion for teaching and her enthusiasm for computer science. In fact, Champion’s talk at this year’s Grace Hopper conference was entitled ‘Technology and Education: Combining Your Two Passions into One Career.'”",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Pro 5, Studio Could Be Shipping Soon Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Pro 5, Studio Could Be Shipping Soon 2 \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone news is determined to be the ultimate mobile device, which people are waiting to preorder. With Windows, Pro 5 and Microsoft Studio, the company is heading into a direction that will make its products hot, and some skeptics say Amazon might be the way to order the Surface Phone once a shipping date has been announced. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Microsoft Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Phone Has Bigger Screen Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Phone Has Bigger Screen \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon 835’ RAM Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon 835’ RAM 2 \nWindows Surface Phone – Microsoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete With Samsung Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete With Samsung 3 \nSurface Phone – Microsoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Michael Stevens Dec 04, 2016 9 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete With Samsung ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Microsoft Wants To Crush Google Home And Amazon Echo With Home Hub \nSo if I’m reading this right, Home Hub is a software-based approach to controlling and sharing information throughout your home built into Windows 10, and it can take the place of standalone devices like the Echo. How do I get excited about this stuff, though? Can’t you do the same things using a smartphone, since there is basically an app for everything? \nHome Hub isn't a dedicated device that's designed to take on the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home, as in the end, Home Hub is just the software. But that software can do everything the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices can, but with one added benefit: a screen. Home Hub is designed to run on Windows 10 PCs, mainly All-In-Ones and 2-in-1's with touch screens, but can work on any Windows 10 machine. Pen and ink support are also part of the plan. Adding a screen to these smart devices makes these things so much more approachable and useful, especially to families. Microsoft's end goal with Home Hub is to make shared PCs much more communal and helpful for multiple people that have to use them.",

      "text": "Chrome 55: Flash Now Blocked For Most Sites \nAre there any downsides to Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla just coming to an agreement and blocking Flash universally in one swoop? It seems like the most practical way of getting rid of Flash-only sites; what Google is doing now just seems like postponing things. \nIn perhaps the most user impacting update to the browser, Chrome 55 will now, by default, block Adobe Flash content in favor of HTML5 as signaled by Google earlier this year. When a user encounters a site lacking HTML5 capability, Chrome will prompt the user and ask them to permit the Flash content to run. However, in order to minimize disruption to the user experience, Google has exempted Flash-only websites in addition to the top ten websites… However, the exemption only applies for a year after which Flash content will be blocked by default for all sites and Chrome users will be required to provide their permission to view such content.",

By: Reuters | Brussels | Published: December 5, 2016 4:25 AM This included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organisations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech. (Reuters) \nUS tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, Google ’s YouTube and Microsoft will have to act faster to tackle online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, the European Commission said on Sunday. The European Union (EU) executive’s warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks. This included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organisations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech. The code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests. However, a report commissioned by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said. “In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a Commission official said. “After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.” The Commission said it may enact laws to force swifter action. “If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times. Her spokesman confirmed the comments. Jourova’s report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy. EU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down “terrorist propaganda” and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.

      "text": "The EU Commission has warned US tech firms Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft and Twitter they need to act faster to tackle online hate speech or will face laws forcing them to do so.\n\nThe warning yesterday came six months after the four technology giants signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours after a notification of hate speech is received.\n\nThis included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, more cooperation with civil society groups and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech, following rising concerns triggered by terror attacks and the refugee crisis.\n\n*Read more*: Facebook helping Germany with anti-refugee hate speech\n\nAlthough the code is mostly an extension of existing efforts by the companies to tackle hate speech, a report commissioned by the EU’s justice commissioner, Vera Jourova, showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said.\n\n“In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a commission official said.\n\n“After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.”\n\n*Read more*: France wants to sanction Facebook and Twitter over hate speech\n\nThe commission added that it may enact laws to force swifter action.\n\n“If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times.\n\nThe report showed the removal rate of racist posts was uneven across the 28-country bloc. In Germany and France, the removal rate was above 50 per cent, but fell to 11 per cent in Austria and four per cent in Italy.\n\nEU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday and are expected to ask the four firms to clarify issues such as taking down “terrorist propaganda”.",

      "title": "Does Windows 10's Data Collection Trade Privacy For Microsoft's Security?",
      "text": "  @07:09PM from the peeking-through-Windows dept. jader3rd shares an article from PC World arguing that Windows 10's data collection \"trades your privacy for Microsoft's security.\" [Anonymized] usage data lets Microsoft beef up threat protection , says Rob Lefferts, Microsoft's director of program management for Windows Enterprise and Security. The information collected is used to improve various components in Windows Defender... For example, Windows Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge will put the Edge browser into a lightweight virtual machine to make it harder to break out of the browser and attack the operating system. With telemetry, Microsoft can see when infections get past Application Guard defenses and improve the security controls to reduce recurrences. Microsoft also pulls signals from other areas of the Windows ecosystem, such as Active Directory, with information from the Windows 10 device to look for patterns that can indicate a problem like ransomware infections and other attacks. To detect those patterns, Microsoft needs access to technical data, such as what processes are consuming system resources, hardware diagnostics, and file-level information like which applications had which files open, Lefferts says. Taken together, the hardware information, application details, and device driver data can be used to identify parts of the operating system are exposed and should be isolated into virtual containers. The article points out that unlike home users, enterprise users of Windows 10 can select a lower level of data-sharing, but argues that enterprises \"need to think twice before turning off Windows telemetry to increase corporate privacy\" because Windows Update won't work without information about whether previous updates succeeded or failed.",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nMicrosoft tests its \"Holoportation\" technology in a room equipped with 3D cameras. Credit: Microsoft Research 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nMicrosoft is bringing a whole new level to remote social interaction with \"Holoportation.\" \nThe prototype technology allows users to see, hear, and interact with others remotely as if both are present in the same physical space. 3D cameras capture and record a users movements and construct a temporally consistent 3D model. That data is then compressed and sent out to be reconstructed anywhere in the world. \nBecause interactions are recorded, they can be replayed and manipulated (such as by shrinking), giving users the sense of reliving that moment in time. \nResearchers have now made the system mobile by installing it in a car.

      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 7 seconds ago \nMicrosoft Tay was wiped from the earth just as fast as it learned how to be a homophobic racist chatbot. \nThe AI proved to be quite a mess, as users quickly influenced Tay's responses and algorithms. In many ways, it was not the bot's fault as being at the mercy of Twitter trolls would surely turn anything into a frenzied nutjob. One could view the ordeal as an exemplary socio-cultural experiment reminiscent of Marina Abramović's Rhythm 0, (1974). \nIn a sense, Tay was a blank canvas ready for the whimsical and nonsensical questions posed by an intrigued and proven destructive audience. It did its job, perhaps not very well but it was able to learn and adapt very quickly over time. So how is Microsoft Zo any different from Tay? \nFor one, it's is a little more quirky and perhaps even childish. Zo does not yet appear able to construct concise responses, like one would expect from Google's Assistant . The bot often forms smart, but misguided responses that do not appear to lead into forming a larger dialog. \nIt is still quite early to judge Zo, as with Tay, the bot will learn and adapt over time, which hopefully is for the best. At the moment, Zo is only available through Kik messenger and considering Kik's user base, is quite an intriguing market to test a bot. \nAccording to DMR Stats , over 60% of people who use bots on Kik messenger are aged between 13-19, and roughly 40% of all US users of Kik messenger are either young adults or teens. Perhaps, this is Microsoft's intended demographic, which may also explain Zo's 'millennial' nature. However, despite Microsoft's efforts to avoid Zo generating inappropriate responses, it could just be a matter of time before Zo faces the same corruption as Tay at the hands of skillful, and willful teenagers. \nNonetheless, if you would like to test out Microsoft Zo, download Kik messenger on either iOS , Windows 10 Mobile or Android . Just search for the username \"zo.ai\" to get started.",

      "text": "U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft will have to act faster to tackle online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, the European Commission said on Sunday. The European Union (EU) executive’s warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks.\nThis included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech. The code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests.\nHowever, a report commissioned by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said. “In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a Commission official said. “After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.”\nThe Commission said it may enact laws to force swifter action. “If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times. Her spokesman confirmed the comments.\nJourova’s report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy. EU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down “terrorist propaganda” and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\nReuters \nThe post EU asks US tech giants to respond faster to tackle online hate speech appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "  EU Demands Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft Cede to Their Anti-Hate Speech Laws Dec 4, 2016 9:48 PM 0 SHARES \nThere's so much hate out there. The EU has decided they're going to do something about it, god damn it. All of the damned, fucking, voters running astray this year must have the beurocrats going apeshit trying to figure out ways to suppress populism. As such, the EU is demanding that US tech giants comply with their demands to curtail 'hate speech' else be literally forced to do so -- according to law. The laws are designed to protect migrants streaming into the EU, raping and pillaging along the way. \nEuropeans, you must comply. \nsource: Reuters \nThe European Union (EU) executive's warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks. This included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of \"counter-narratives\" to hate speech. \nSuch as propaganda, like the correct the record shills? Counter-narratives. \nThe code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests. \nThe EU Justice Commission wants tech companies to censor speech at a much faster pace than the current 80% after 48 hours. Permitting 20% of speech that is deemed hateful to be disseminated after 48 hours is 2o% too much, according to the Commissioner Vera Jourova. \n\"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" Jourova told the Financial Times. Jourova's report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy. \nCoincidentally, the Italians just told the EU to fuck off this evening, voting against the referendum. I suppose they're all a bunch of racist bastards. \nEU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down \"terrorist propaganda\" and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters. \nHow nice of them to also include the censorship of terrorists. Kiss your free speech goodbye Europe. The EU has gone full Soviet Union with the aim to suppress freedom of expression.",

It was only written this way to provide clear, detailed, and easy to understand instructions that anyone can use to remove this infection for free. Before using this guide, we suggest that you read it once and download all necessary tools to your desktop. After doing so, please print this page as you may need to close your browser window or reboot your computer. 2 \nAs Fake Microsoft Help Desk Tech Support Scam makes it so you are unable to acces your Windows desktop, you need to open the Windows Task Manager from the Windows Security screen. To do this, press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys on your keyboard at the same time to display the Windows Security Screen as shown below. \nAt this screen, click on the Task Manager option to start the Windows Task Manager. 3 \nYou will now be at the Task Manager screen as shown below. If you are in Windows 10, you will need to click on the More Details option and the screen will look a little different. Make sure you are in the processes tab and search for the bsodc23x1.exe process in the list of processes. \nWhen you have found the process click on it once to select and then click on the End Process button in Windows 7 or the End Task button in Windows 10. The process should now be terminated. Do not close the Task Manager window, though, as we need it for the next step. 4 \nNow that the process has been terminated we want to start the Windows Explorer. Most of the time this will cause the Windows desktop to appear, but if not, you will at least be presented with a My Computer folder that you can to navigate the file system and launch applications. \nIn Task Manager, click on the File menu option and then click on Run . You will now be at the Run dialog as shown in the image below. \nIn the Open: field, type explorer.exe and then press the OK button. \nYour normal desktop should now appear and you can continue with the rest of the instructions. If the desktop does not appear, then a My Computer window will open that will allow you to navigate the file system to launch programs or delete files. 5 \nTo terminate any programs that may interfere with the removal process we must first download the Rkill program. Rkill will search your computer for active malware infections and attempt to terminate them so that they wont interfere with the removal process. To do this, please download RKill to your desktop from the following link. Rkill \nWhen at the download page, click on the Download Now button labeled iExplore.exe .

Please be patient while the program looks for various malware programs and ends them. When it has finished, the black window will automatically close and a log file will open. Please review the log file and then close so you can continue with the next step. If you have problems running RKill, you can download the other renamed versions of RKill from the rkill download page . All of the files are renamed copies of RKill, which you can try instead. Please note that the download page will open in a new browser window or tab. \nDo not reboot your computer after running RKill as the malware programs will start again. 7 \nAt this point you should download Zemana AntiMalware, or ZAM, in order to scan your computer for any any infections or adware that may be present. Please download Zemana AntiMalware from the following location and save it to your desktop: Zemana AntiMalware \nOnce downloaded, close all programs and open windows on your computer. 9 \nNow double-click on the icon on your desktop named Zemana.AntiMalware.Setup.exe .

This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan to see when it is finished. 13 \nWhen Zemana has finished finished scanning it will display a screen that displays any malware that has been detected. Please note that the infections found may be different than what is shown in the image below. \nReview the scan results and when you are ready to continue with the cleanup process, click on the Next button to delete or repair all of the the selected results. Once you click on the Next button, Zemana will remove any unwanted files and fix any modified legitimate files. If you receive a warning that Zemana needs to close your open browsers, please close any web browsers that may be open and then click on the OK button to continue. \nZemana will now create a System Restore Point and remove the detected files and repair any files that were modified. 14 \nWhen the process is complete, you will be shown a screen that says Completed. At this screen, you can now close the Zemana AntiMalware screen and continue with the rest of the instructions. 15 \nNow please download AdwCleaner and save it to your desktop. AdwCleaner will scan your computer for adware programs that may have been installed on your computer without your knowledge. You can download AdwCleaner from the following URL: AdwCleaner Download Now 16 \nWhen AdwCleaner has finished downloading, please double-click on the AdwCleaner.exe icon that now appears on your desktop. Once you double-click on the icon the AdwCleaner program will open and you will be presented with the program's license agreement. After you read it, click on the I agree button if you wish to continue. Otherwise, click on the I disagree button to close the program.

The program will now start to search for known adware programs that may be installed on your computer. When it has finished it will display all of the items it has found in Results section of the screen above. Please look through the results and try to determine if the programs that are listed contain ones that you do not want installed. If you find programs that you need to keep, then uncheck the entries associated with them. \nFor many people, the contents of the Results section may appear confusing. Unless you see a program name that you know should not be removed,please continue with the next step. 18 \nTo remove the adware programs that were detected in the previous step, please click on the Clean button on the AdwCleaner screen. AdwCleaner will now prompt you to save any open files or data as the program will need to close any open programs before it starts to clean. \nPlease save your work and then click on the OK button. AdwCleaner will now delete all detected adware from your computer. When it is done it will display an alert that explains what PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and Adware are. Please read through this information and then press the OK button. You will now be presented with an alert that states AdwCleaner needs to reboot your computer. \nPlease click on the OK button to let AdwCleaner reboot your computer. 19 \nWhen your computer reboots and you are logged in, AdwCleaner will automatically open a log file that contains the files, registry keys, and programs that were removed from your computer. \nPlease review this log file and then close the Notepad Window. 20 \nNow you should download HitmanPro from the following location and save it to your desktop: HitmanPro \nWhen you visit the above page, please download the version that corresponds to the bit-type of the Windows version you are using. 21 \nOnce downloaded, double-click on the file named HitmanPro.exe (for 32-bit versions of Windows) or HitmanPro_x64.exe (for 64-bit versions of Windows).

      "text": "There's so much hate out there. The EU has decided they're going to do something about it, god damn it. All of the damned, fucking, voters running astray this year must have the autocrats going apeshit trying to figure out ways to suppress populism. As such, the EU is demanding that US tech giants comply with their demands to curtail 'hate speech' else be literally forced to do so -- according to law. The laws are designed to protect migrants streaming into the EU, raping and pillaging along the way.\n\nEuropeans, you must comply.\n\nsource: Reuters\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) executive's warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising *concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks.*\n*This included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of \"counter-narratives\" to hate speech.*\n\n\n\nSuch as propaganda, like the correct the record shills? Counter-narratives.\n\n\n\nThe code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests.\n\n\n\nThe EU Justice Commission wants tech companies to censor speech at a much faster pace than the current 80% after 48 hours. Permitting 20% of speech that is deemed hateful to be disseminated after 48 hours is 20% too much, according to the Commissioner Vera Jourova.\n\n\n\n\"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" Jourova told the Financial Times.\n*Jourova's report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy.*\n\n\n\nCoincidentally, the Italians just told the EU to fuck off this evening, voting against the referendum. I suppose they're all a bunch of racist bastards.\n\n\n\nEU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. *They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down \"terrorist propaganda\"* and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\n\n\n\nHow nice of them to also include the censorship of terrorists. Kiss your free speech goodbye Europe. The EU has gone full Soviet Union with the aim to suppress freedom of expression.\n\n\nContent originally generated at iBankCoin.com",

      "text": "Paul Allen using a Lenovo ThinkPad during the Seahawks game on Dec. 4. Photo via NBC stream. Paul Allen uses a Lenovo ThinkPad — while watching Seahawks games, at least.\nDuring the second quarter of the nationally-televised Carolina vs. Seattle game on Sunday Night Football, NBC aired a live clip of the Microsoft co-founder sitting in his suite at CenturyLink Field.\nNBC play-by-play veteran Al Michaels introduced Allen as the owner of both the Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers, noting that he “made his fortune at Microsoft with Bill Gates.”\n“Shockingly, with a computer in front of him,” quipped color commentator Cris Collinsworth.\nThat “computer” looks to be like a Lenovo ThinkPad. I noticed Allen using a ThinkPad two weeks ago while watching the Seahawks vs. Patriots game in New England.\nSome folks on Twitter wondered why Allen wasn’t using a Microsoft Surface.\nDo you think Paul Allen could get a Microsoft Surface instead of an IBM Thinkpad?\n— Jesse Larkin (@JesseLarkin) December 5, 2016 \nShot of Paul Allen in a suite at the #Seahawks game. Not using a Surface?\n— John Browne (@j_p_browne) December 5, 2016 \nI notice Paul Allen prefers the Lenovo ThinkPad to the Microsoft Surface… Saw him on the football game tonight. We agree. #Seahawks #NFL \n— Richard M. Landau (@Richard54) December 5, 2016 \nOthers commented on his attire.\nYou'd think Paul Allen could afford to heat his owners box. #CARvsSEA \n— Corey Stewart (@CoreyAStewart) December 5, 2016 \nAllen was drinking what appears to be some type of soda. Perhaps he and Gates share a love for Diet Coke ?\nCollinsworth also called Allen an “incredibly humble guy” and Michaels said that he “always enjoys speaking” with him.\nAllen bought the Seahawks in 1996, helping keep the team in Seattle. In addition to owning the Blazers, he’s also a co-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, which is playing in its first MLS Cup this Saturday in Toronto.\nWhile Allen seems to be more involved with the day-to-day operations of the Blazers, which he bought in 1988, the 63-year-old is still passionate about the Seahawks, attending games and requesting weekly reports . After the Seahawks won their first Super Bowl in 2013, Allen jammed out on his guitar at the team’s after party in New York City.\n ",

      "text": "Prev Article \nHow time flies. In 2014, Nokia sold off its mobile business to Microsoft and took a sabbatical from making devices. Last week, Nokia got back in the phone business and its license to HMD Global too effect. In other words, there is Microsoft mobile (which is run by Microsoft) and there is Nokia once again (this time with devices to be produced by HMD Global). Former bed fellows are now competitors in the smartphone and tablet markets. \nWhile Microsoft is sticking with Windows 10, the new Nokia smartphones and devices will run Android OS. In addition, we will see more of the good old Nokia-branded feature phones being pushed in the market. In partnership with Foxconn, HMD was able to buy Nokia’s feature phone business off Microsoft . Of course, Microsoft was never interested in feature phones though they remain huge sellers in many emerging markets. Foxconn will be making Nokia’s feature phones going forward. \nAnyway, everybody wins. Microsoft got its Windows Phones. Nokia is back in mobile. Who said you couldn’t eat your cake and have it? \nAn interesting observation is that Microsoft has not announced any new Lumia smartphones in a while. Perhaps they will not be announcing any more. The Redmond giant seems to be more focused on getting their hardware partners to push out phones for them instead. Think HP . Think Alcatel . \nFor all we care, the Lumia 650 may very well be the last Lumia . New Nokia phones: The Sharp Connection \nThere are tons of Nokia smartphone renders out there. Five months ago, we saw one such render which turned out to be a re-badged Sharp smartphone . In April 2016, Foxconn acquired Sharp Electronics . Perhaps the fastest and most cost-effective way to get Nokia-branded smartphones to the market is through re-badging. \nWhen BlackBerry decided to get into Android OS, re-badging was the way they took and it looks like it was a good decision. BlackBerry’s DTEK series are re-badged Alcatel smartphones . Since Foxconn is in bed with HMD Global right now, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for Sharp smartphones to be re-badged for Nokia. Re-badging means lower production costs and if HMD is serious, they should know that the present global smartphone market thrives on good cost ratios for devices. The Nokia brand has always thrived on that. Nokia versus Microsoft \nThese two old buddies will now have to compete in the same smartphone market. While Microsoft has not done well with smartphones, the company has had a good run with its Surface tablets. Microsoft’s Windows smartphones and tablets will compete in the same market as Nokia’s upcoming Android smartphones and tablets. These old buddies will fight for turf on the same playing field. \nCall me a fanboy, but I envisage Nokia building up marketshare quickly. Certainly nothing on the scale that it enjoyed before its decline years ago. The brand still has huge mindshare across the world. Not many brands can generate the buzz that this Finnish brand is generating now after a two-year break. Summary Nokia versus Microsoft: Old buddies go to war Description As Nokia gets back in the mobile business, it will go head-to-head against its old buddy, Microsoft. Its Nokia versus Microsoft.

So cool and for that its dedicated teams have my gratitude, especially now that the references function, e.g. citations, etc., is growing up in Office 2010. The software has a long way to go, however, before providing scholar-friendly word-processing with the tools of a Nota Bene. But nine out of 10 receiving institutions only take WORD .docs formats. So, like a fly in the room, there are constant pop-ups and flashes of margin readings, etc. Thanks for swatting at least one down. Here’s a tough question. How does one get the references’ master list to print out or even copy? Thanks very much. heidisierra March 26, 2012 at 9:24 am # \nThank you!! Reply Tony Thomas March 27, 2012 at 11:39 am # \nWhen i copy and paste i want the original format of the internet with the hyperlink but my word document only shows keep text only format and checked. (File/options/advanced/cut,copy and paste) it is all set on (Keep source formatting(Default)). and still i see only the keep text only format on the paste option. Reply Chris April 3, 2012 at 9:45 am # \nThank you so much, I get really tired of Microsoft doing all this unnecessary crap that just annoys you more than being helpful. All this extra stuff and clutter should be disabled by default in my opinion. Reply Robert April 3, 2012 at 2:21 pm # \nI usually use Notepad++. but occasionally have to use Word. Word sure seems bloated and distracting. Thanks for helping me quiet Word down a little. \nThank you! Cathy July 1, 2012 at 3:15 pm # \nI did this and it STILL SHOWS UP! G . JoJo August 4, 2012 at 8:05 pm # \nThank you so much!!! Very helpful. Steve Krause August 5, 2012 at 3:07 pm # \nYou bet! Glad it helped you out. Thanks for the comment. \nSent from my Mobile Reply Bruce August 13, 2012 at 10:11 am # \nIt stops the paste options from showing up when you alt v but when right clicking and selecting paste, the option bar still shows up. Any idea on how to remove the paste option when right clicking to paste? Janis Jocklin September 7, 2012 at 12:24 pm # \nTHANK YOU!!! Steve Krause September 7, 2012 at 1:53 pm # \nheheh you bet Janis! Welcome to groovyPost, thanks for the feedback! Reply Ferd September 16, 2012 at 10:36 am # \nYes, very irritating thing, that paste bar. The thing that fascinates me the most is that this paste bar is implemented like this. That it lingers on to do more pastes i can understand, but after 2 or 3 seconds it should be clear the user wants to move on. Probably it is simply forgotten to program a time limit. Daniel October 1, 2012 at 1:23 am # \nThank you. This was getting to be a new Clippy…. Reply Mark October 18, 2012 at 2:05 am # \nFrom Belgium thanks too, what a annoying thingie from MS, it must be in their way too when they design it? Whatever, I can go back to work again without this annoying menu in my screen. Have a nice day Reply Wojtek Sokolowski February 6, 2013 at 6:59 am # \nThanks a lot. This was helpful. The “nanny corporation” approach that Micro$oft et al. take is really annoying. Why don’t they turn all their “options” off by default and let the user decide which one he or she needs? Gary March 14, 2013 at 10:30 am # \nThank you! amy April 26, 2013 at 10:17 am # \nThank you! Paul May 3, 2013 at 8:32 am # \nThank you! Matt June 28, 2013 at 4:19 am # \nThanks for the tip. \nI find the Paste Bar useful at times and don’t want it to go away permanently. When it does get in my way, I find that pressing the escape key will make it go away. Kailasa August 2, 2013 at 10:07 pm # \nThanks Matt! I didn’t want to completely disable this function as this article describes…just wanted to get rid of the icon once I didn’t need it. (In older versions of Word it would disappear after the next text entry/selection/etc. Thank you for solving my problem!!! Michael July 2, 2013 at 3:16 am # \nthank you for this \nbeen getting in the way for years and just today i bothered to look up how to do something about it. Nancy July 5, 2013 at 10:12 am # \nYes, thank you, thank you!! Reply Michael July 17, 2013 at 8:09 pm # \ni just wonder if you can help me with similar topic,”how to disable paste option in access 2010″? because there is no advanced option…..thank you. RJ September 4, 2013 at 2:39 pm # \nThank you so much! That icon was driving me nuts! Reply Adrian October 1, 2013 at 5:48 am # \nThank you so much for this. I finally took care of this after having been annoyed by it for so long. I can’t understand why they would put that feature. Anyways, thank you so much!! Phil April 1, 2014 at 6:57 am # \nThanks so much for posting this. Helped me out considerably. sharon paddock June 25, 2014 at 6:03 am # \nCannot thank you enough! : ) Sandra de Roos July 25, 2014 at 1:06 am # \nThanks for making this annoying thing go away so quickly! PersembeBaligi October 20, 2014 at 12:13 am # \nThank you so much. I cannot describe the relieve that I’m in right now… Reply Catherine November 18, 2014 at 7:48 am # \nTHANK YOU You can’t even imagine how delighted I am now that I found how to remove this stupid pop-up that lingers forever right where I want to edit my text. God bless! Reply Connor April 3, 2015 at 1:18 pm # \nOh my God! Thank you! I’ve been ready to throw something at my monitor ’cause I can’t see what the heck I’m editing half the time. You’re a lifesaver! someguy April 11, 2015 at 6:25 pm # \nLooking for for alternate ways to remove it, see same instructions on many other sites. \nPaste Options still show up even with everything unchecked, seen other comments about this. Oranges June 19, 2015 at 2:24 am # \nThank you for this helpful advice! randy July 9, 2015 at 11:27 pm # \nThank you! That was helpful. Why can’t the Word “Help” section be that easy? Praveen August 12, 2015 at 8:54 pm # \nThanks alot Reply Rosie February 27, 2016 at 4:48 pm # \nMany thanks for this. I’m trying to fix a fiddly list and not an expert Word user.

Using the VMware Console, I can log in as Domain\\administrator, or as Domain\\user, or as MyBox\\user onto the MyBox server. Therefore, Authentication was working. \nUsing Remote Desktop, I cannot login as Domain\\Administrator or Domain\\user. \nWhen attempting to \"Update\" the Remote Desktop User list with my Domain group, The server (MyBox) does NOT show me the \"Domain\" in the list, ONLY the local host name (MyBox). \nMy Resolution: \nGo into Windows DNS on the AD server, and change the domain (or subdomain) properties to use the \"Dynamic DNS\" mode - yes, the insecure mode. It instantly resolved my authentication issue, allowing me to \"find\" the AD Domain, select my new Remote_Users group in the domain, and resume work.",

      "title": "Backup Virtual Reality data with vrBackupper",
      "text": "VrBackupper is a free backup program for Microsoft Windows that lets you back up virtual reality data for safe keeping or migration.\nVirtual Reality is not mainstream yet, but it seems to have better chances than 3D TVs to get there. We have a couple of competing systems that are available right now, including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Playstation VR.\nThe VR technology is not there yet to reel me in, but second or third generation might just do that. It all depends on the tech getting better -- do away with the cables for instance --and the apps and games also getting better as they are mostly casual ones right now.\nvrBackupper \nVrBackupper is a free Windows software designed specifically for the Oculus Rift virtual reality device.\nIt allows you to migrate the Oculus installation to another location, or to back up or restore the Oculus installation directory.\nThe developers had to change the name from Oculus Backupper to vrBackupper recently. While that was something they had to do, it could pave the way for turning the program into a universal virtual reality backup solution.\nFor now though, it only supports Oculus installations.\nThe program is dead easy to use. It detects the Oculus directory automatically on start, and lists the two options migrate or backup/restore in the main interface.\nIf you select migrate, all you have to do is pick a target location of the Oculus installation on the computer.\nThe backup and restore feature works similarly. You may back up or restore the whole Oculus installation directory, or only games and apps.\nIf you select backup, pick a target location for the data, and if you select restore, the location the backup was saved in previously.\nThe program ships without any options. One issue that you may encounter is that it may fail to detect the Oculus installation directory. There is no option to set the directory manually, so that you are effectively blocked from using the program when that happens.\nMigration can be useful if you run into space issues on the drive Oculus is installed on. This can also be useful if you purchase a new computer, and want to move the data to the new computer instead of downloading it again.\nClosing Words VrBackupper is a specialized backup program for Windows that Oculus owners may find useful. While there is usually no need to back up virtual reality data, the migration option may prove useful.\nI'd like to see options added to the program. First, an option to set a custom installation directory to avoid being blocked if the installation directory is not detected correctly.\nSecond, a couple of extra bits of information, like the amount required to back up the data and free storage of the target location.\n \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Backup Virtual Reality data with vrBackupper appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses",
      "text": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses   11 a.m. New Outlook Customer Manager app automates and organizes sales and customer data within Outlook for small business users. \nMicrosoft is giving small to midsize businesses (SMBs) a new sales and marketing tool with the release of Outlook Customer Manager , a customer relationship management (CRM) application within the Microsoft Outlook email client. Available through the \"Customer Manager\" tab in the toolbar, Outlook Customer Manager is an automated organizational tool designed to surface emails, events, documents, tasks, and other interactions to help business users more effectively manage customer relationships. \nOutlook Customer Manager essentially turns Outlook into a smart sales inbox. When you click on the tab in the Outlook 2016 toolbar, it brings up a timeline view of automatically organized sales information including calls, deadlines, deals, emails, files, meetings, notes, and tasks related to specific customers. The app exists entirely within Microsoft Office 365 . According to Microsoft, the information in the timeline is gathered from email, calendar, and call log data pulled from various Office 365 apps. \nUsing Outlook Customer Manager, users can also set up reminders to respond to a customer interaction, and associate tasks with a contact, company, or deal. Plus, you can also organize deals in a few different ways. A Microsoft spokesperson provided PCMag with some additional insight, pointing out that you can share specific customer information with a team and use a feature called Focused list, which details particularly important customers and deals. \n\"The information in the timeline is automatically gathered from the email, calendar, and call log data from the Office 365 environment,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \"Outlook Customer Manager helps you stay on top of opportunities and commitments by surfacing timely reminders, letting you associate tasks with a contact, company or deal, and listing deals by stage, close dates, priority, and amount. To help you prioritize your time, the system automatically presents a Focused list of your most important customers and deals.\" \nThe app is currently rolling out to Business Premium subscribers at no extra cost and will be generally available in early 2017. Microsoft is also working to enable full mobile access to Outlook Customer Manager, and has already released a dedicated iOS app that includes meeting information, notetaking, and mobile scanning for business cards. What about Dynamics? Outlook Customer Manager gives SMBs a light CRM app within Microsoft's email client, but Microsoft also has a standalone CRM app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 . The company has a full-blown enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution as well with Microsoft Dynamics GP , which incorporates CRM along with general ledger, sales, human resources (HR), and accounting and finance features.\nMicrosoft describes Outlook Customer Manager as a lighter CRM app within Office 365 for SMBs that aren't necessarily large enough to employ an entire sales team. The app is geared toward helping entrepreneurs and small business users who are conducting lead acquisition and customer outreach themselves; it gives them an easy, built-in way to manage information and stay on top of interactions. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is a more heavy-duty CRM platform that provides deeper customer information and financial data as businesses scale up and expand their sales and marketing operations. \n\"Outlook Customer Manager is designed for small businesses that want to stay on top their customer and deal information,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \"Natively built into Outlook, it is simple to get started with and easy to use as a first customer management tool for small businesses. As their needs grow, business can move to Dynamics 365 for sales to take advantage of enhanced customer information, sales process consistency and efficiency, and deeper financial and customer insights.\" \nHow CRM is Getting Smarter Outlook Customer Manager is indicative of a larger trend around using machine learning and automated workflows to better organize and surface customer data. The new Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence (AI) platform bakes in deep learning and predictive analytics throughout the Salesforce CRM cloud, and we've already seen other CRM players begin to implement these kinds of smart email and predictive sales analytics features as well. \nThe major redesign to Zoho CRM came with a new product called SalesInbox, which offers a dedicated mail client for salespeople that uses contextual CRM data to surface relevant emails. Other CRM players have also implemented similar features in the past year, with Pipedrive CRM adding smart email and Base CRM integrating intelligent sales forecasting and email sentiment analysis using predictive analytics data. \nWe're seeing advances in machine learning and business intelligence (BI) across a host of business use cases. Through Outlook Customer Manager, Microsoft is using this kind of data automation to make it easier for small businesses without a dedicated sales team to efficiently manage customer relationships. As we head into 2017, the role AI and data automation in CRM will only grow as businesses look for smarter, more efficient ways to manage interactions, engage leads, and convert them into loyal customers.",

      "text": "Published on Dec 5, 2016 Abstract: Lack of information about irrigation potential has caused crop failures on irrigated farms in Kenya due to unexpected climate change. The information model through annual reports in form of table and text as provided by agricultural and meteorological experts is clearly not understood by the farmers. Therefore, this paper aimed to visualize irrigation potential by modeling the rainfall and runoff using Microsoft excel. Using Microsoft 2007 in a normal computer, daily rainfall was recorded into one sheet, calculated into another sheet as runoff and visualized in the last sheet as a map of irrigation potential. One sheet was added to record actual runoff harvested in a reservoir and another to distribute the runoff onto irrigation areas. A raster map was visualized as a result of modeling the entered data implying that ease of information could be achieved almost at no extra cost to what is usually done. Keywords: Modeling, Visualization, Irrigation, Potential, Microsoft excel. ...",

In an interview with Fox, Ballmer explains that hardware will be an essential business for Microsoft in the future, and explains that he is very pleased with the success the company experienced with the Surface series. “It’s one of the things I am really proud about was getting the muscle really working so that the company could do hardware. Because I do think it’s an important part of the future. I love the way the Surface has now emerged,” he said.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nToday, Microsoft is launching its annual '12 Days of Deals', offering discounts and free gifts on a variety of products. It announced the full list of deals in that promotional campaign last week - but one device that was notably absent from that list was the Surface Book. \nIf you were disappointed not to see any exciting deals for that device, then we've got good news for you. Microsoft is now offering up to $250 off several of its Surface Books, including the entry-level model: Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 128GB SSD | usually $1,499 | now $1,299 (save $200) Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD / dGPU | usually $1,899 | now $1,649 (save $250) Intel Core i7 / 8GB RAM / 256GB SSD / dGPU | usually $2,099 | now $1,899 (save $200) Intel Core i7 / 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD / dGPU | usually $2,699 | now $2,499 (save $200) \nAccording to the small print on the Microsoft Store listing , the discount on the Core i5 models listed above will continue until December 24. It appears that the savings on the Core i7 models will end sooner, on December 10.",

      "text": "2 \nSEATTLE (TNS): \nMicrosoft has joined the Linux Foundation, the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility. \nThe foundation helps advise the development of the Linux and other software tools built on open-source terms that allow the public to freely use and modify software. Microsoft last Wednesday said it had joined the foundation on its most expensive tier of corporate membership, alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Linux, which former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once called a cancer, was for years one of Microsoft's biggest rivals. The free-to-use operating system was seen for a time as the primary threat to expensive, proprietary Windows. \nWindows won the battle for the personal computer but didn't fare so well in the broader debate about the value of open-source versus proprietary technology. \nLinux-derived Android dominates the smartphone market, and open-source tools are a force in cloud-computing technologies. Many software startups favour open-source software by default. \nMicrosoft teams plugging away on developer tools and server software, realms heavily influenced by Linux, broke with the company line during the last several years in pushing greater involvement with the open-source community. \nTONE SHIFTED \n\nWhen Satya Nadella, previously Microsoft's server and tools chief, was named company chief executive in early 2014, the tone shifted companywide. Microsoft, Nadella said at an event in October 2014, loves Linux. \nThe company, headquartered outside Seattle, has since released elements of its own software under open-source terms and announced a version of its database management software, SQL Server, for Linux, among other steps. \nGitHub, an online developer community and repository for software projects, said in September that there were more Microsoft employees contributing to open-source projects than representatives of any other single company.

      "text": "Career Step releases new Microsoft Office 2016 training across all Career Step programs.\n\nLEHI, Utah (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\n\nCareer Step, an online provider of career-focused education and professional training, has updated its Microsoft Office curriculum, available in stand-alone Microsoft Office courses and in a variety of other Career Step programs, to reflect changes in the 2016 software released by Microsoft earlier this year. The updates cover the new Microsoft Office 2016 features designed to maximize productivity and collaboration.\n\n“We put our students first, and that means offering up-to-date training to keep them relevant in today’s high-tech job market,” said Ben Hartman, Vice President of Enrollments. “We work to respond to an ever-evolving business world so that our students have the tools they need to improve their lives and find the career that that works best for them.”\n\nThe updated Microsoft Office course includes 24/7 online access to in-depth training in the five core applications: Microsoft Access 2016, Microsoft Excel 2016, Microsoft Outlook 2016, Microsoft PowerPoint 2016, and Microsoft Word 2016.

      "text": "Posted by: Damir Arh , on 12/5/2016, in Category .NET Framework Views: 142 Abstract: Microsoft recently announced a slew of new development tools and frameworks for developers at Connect(); // 2016. This post gives a brief overview of what was announced. \nMicrosoft hosted its premier fall developer event – Connect(); // 2016 in New York on November 16-17, and streamed it live and for free on Channel 9 to developers around the world. While we may be a little late in doing a recap, we wanted to take our time to go through these announcements before writing about what’s new and exciting for Developers in and outside Microsoft’s Developer Ecosystem. What's New and Exciting in Microsoft's Open Dev Ecosystem .NET Core 1.1 \n.NET Core 1.1 is the first new minor version of .NET Core - a cross-platform, open source, and modular .NET platform for creating modern .NET applications. Unlike the LTS ( Long Term Support ) version 1.0, .NET Core 1.1 is categorized as “Current” release. While LTS releases have a 3-year support period from the original release or 1 year from the next LTS release, the “Current” releases are only eligible for support as long as their parent LTS release or 3 months after the next “Current” release, whichever comes first. The two versions can safely be installed side-by-side, so that individual applications on the same machine can use either one. \nThe focus of this release was performance. The big news was that ASP.NET Core is now included in the TechEmpower web framework benchmarks, and is the fastest mainstream full stack framework in the Plaintext category . \nSeveral new features were added to ASP.NET Core 1.1 as well: With MVC filters, you can now apply middleware only to specific controllers or actions. Two new middleware are included: URL rewriting and response caching. Web Listener Server for Windows is available as an alternative to Kestrel. With it, you can take advantage of Windows specific features, such as Windows authentication, HTTP/2 over TLS, and others. Compiling views during the publish process is now supported. \nEntity Framework Core 1.1 now has built-in support for connection resiliency and SQL Server memory-optimized tables. Thanks to improved LINQ translation, the database engines can successfully execute more queries than before. New APIs were added for explicit loading, mapping to fields and a few other features. \nMSBuild tooling for .NET Core became available in preview. This means that standard .csproj project files can be used instead of project.json. To better align the two formats, MSBuild now supports wildcard-based inclusion of files for folder based projects, and direct NuGet package references. A wizard for migrating project.json projects to .csproj is included as well. Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate \nVisual Studio “15” now has its official name: Visual Studio 2017. You can now download Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate and even use it in production with the exception of features marked as in preview, and are not yet supported. \nThe new version of Visual Studio comes with many productivity improvements : better filtering and default suggestions in IntelliSense dialogs, easier navigation with redesigned Find All References and Go To functionalities, new Exception Helper dialog with more information and support for filtering exceptions by the assembly they originate from, quick reattaching and filtering by process name in the Attach to Process dialog, continuous running of tests and coverage information for individual code lines with Live Unit Testing (only available in Enterprise edition), Figure 1: Live Unit Testing in action additional code refactorings, configurable code style, and more. \nBetter performance is also a high priority: Visual Studio 2017 starts faster, has shorter load times for solutions, and a faster, more componentized installer. To further speed-up initial loading of large solutions; lightweight solution loading can be enabled for them, which defers the full loading of projects to a later time when they are first needed. \nExtensions can also largely affect the overall responsiveness of Visual Studio. The new performance-monitoring feature will now warn the user about extensions which slow down Visual Studio. Other improvements to extensions include: batched installs and updates, support for extensions to detect missing dependencies and trigger their installation in Visual Studio. \nA few other new features in Visual Studio 2017 that are also worth mentioning: New versions of C# and Visual Basic provide many new language features, as described in my previous article for Dot Net Curry magazine . A new Service Capabilities page is now the centralized location for adding cloud service dependencies to a project. You can record tests for mobile applications using the new mobile test recorder and upload them directly to Xamarin Test Cloud. A preview version of Visual Studio Tools for Unity 3 is now included in the installer. Among other improvements, it adds full syntax coloring and IntelliSense support for Unity event functions. Visual Studio for Mac \nThe Visual Studio product family got a new member: Visual Studio for Mac. The preview is already available for download . The application is an evolved version of Xamarin Studio, more closely aligned to the Visual Studio experience on Windows. It supports development of Xamarin based mobile applications, and their cloud backends in .NET Core, using either C# or F#. It features the same Roslyn powered compiler, IntelliSense code completion and refactoring experience as Visual Studio. The same MSBuild project format allows for seamless sharing of projects between Visual Studio on Windows and Mac. Mobile Development with Xamarin \nThe Xamarin team announced stable releases of several new tools. \nXamarin Inspector is an extension for Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio, which can attach to a running iOS, Android, Mac or WPF application. It provides a structured look into the current view of the attached application, without pausing its execution with a debugger. You can even modify its properties via a graphical user interface or by executing custom C# code in the application context. \nXamarin Workbooks is an editor and viewer for interactive documents, consisting of rich formatted documentation with live runnable code. This makes it very useful for creating and consuming learning materials, guides and teaching aids. A large selection of workbooks on different Microsoft technologies is already available for download . \nFigure 2: C# 6 workbook in Xamarin Workbooks \nRemoted iOS Simulator for Windows provides a convenient way for testing and debugging iOS applications from Visual Studio on Windows. Although the simulator still requires a connected Mac machine where the simulator is actually running, you can fully interact with it directly from Windows. It even provides full touchscreen support, including Apple Pencil simulation using a stylus – that is if you have a touchscreen connected to your Windows machine. The simulator does not support Apple Watch devices yet. \nXamarin Profiler is everything you would expect from a profiler for Xamarin based applications. Its three main views allow tracking of memory allocations and footprint, performance tracking with method execution sampling, and tracking of memory cycles that cannot be released and cause memory leaks. \nRemoted iOS Simulator and Xamarin Profiler are only available to owners of Visual Studio Enterprise license. \nThe other large announcement was the preview of Visual Studio Mobile Center . It is the successor to HockeyApp and Xamarin Test Cloud, an integrated cloud service for the complete lifecycle of your mobile applications, providing a wide spectrum of functionalities: continuous integration and release management, automated testing on devices, application distribution to your test users and enterprise users, crash reporting and usage metrics, backend services for authentication and data storage, with push notifications and more coming in the future. \nIt currently supports iOS and Android applications written in Objective-C, Swift, Java, Xamarin or Reactive Native. Support for UWP and Cordova applications has already been announced. \nXamarin Test Cloud itself was also improved. It already supported tests written in C# with Xamarin.UITest and in Ruby with Calabash. Now it also supports tests written in Java with Appium. \nA stable release of Xamarin.Forms 2.3.3 became available, introducing two noteworthy new features: With the help of native view declarations in XAML, you can now create a single declarative XAML file, using a different native view for each of the platforms without additional code. Even data binding to native views works as expected. Platform specifics are an alternative to custom renderers, when certain behaviors are required for a single platform only. You can consume them using fluent API or XAML. Visual Studio Tools for Samsung’s Tizen \nTizen is Samsung’s Linux-based open source operating system, used in over 50 million of their devices : smart TVs, wearables, smartphones and IoT devices. At the event, Samsung announced its intention on collaborating with Microsoft to bring .NET Core to ARM devices, and add Tizen support to Xamarin.Forms. \nThe first preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen is already available. It provides an alternative to existing C and HTML 5 based programming models for Tizen. Currently only mobile application development is supported, but other types of devices will follow in the future. All the development is done in C# with.NET Core, Xamarin.Forms for the user interface, and wrappers for many native APIs to access device specific functionalities - everything with full IntelliSense support. Debugging takes advantage of device emulators, which are included in the download. \nThe official release is planned for 2017, when the .NET Core runtime will also ship to devices. A Quick Recap \nWhile a lot came out of Connect 2016 this year, here’s a quick recap of some major announcements made: \n- Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member \n- Google joins the .NET Foundation \n- Samsung releases Visual Studio Tools for Tizen \n- Microsoft announces Visual Studio 2017 \n- Visual Studio 2017 will have cross-platform support \n- Microsoft announces Visual Studio for Mac \n- Microsoft announces Visual Studio Mobile Center \n- Microsoft has the most contributors on GitHub \n- SQL Server for Linux is now publicly available. SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 available. \n- Azure Data Lake Analytics and Store \n- Azure Functions and N-Series available now. First Cloud Bot-as-a-Service announced. Conclusion: \nMicrosoft continues to offer a great set of benefits and tools for any developer, any app, and any platform. Since the first Connect(); event in 2014, Microsoft has been using it to announce many important development related releases. This year was no exception. From Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate with “go-live license” and Visual Studio for Mac Preview to new Xamarin tooling and new .NET Core version, there was something of interest for any developer already working with Microsoft tools or technologies. At the same time, as Microsoft expands its focus from Windows to other platforms, these announcements have become increasingly interesting to developers who are not in Microsoft’s ecosystem yet. \nThe new Microsoft has showed that isn’t afraid of making big bets, and delivering on them. Wake up and Code! Was this article worth reading? Share it with fellow developers too. Thanks!",

Microsoft’s Azure platform will combine with HPE infrastructure and services, reports said, to introduce a new program of service offerings for joint customers. \nTheir joint initiative was announced by Microsoft Executive Vice President of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie and HPE Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Enterprise Group Antonio Neri. They revealed the plans at the Discover London 2016 event. \nIn a blog post, HPE Director of Cloud Solutions Marketing Ken Won also remarked on the venture. \n“Our two companies have a shared, common vision for hybrid cloud computing and, in the past year, have made progress towards blending the power of Azure with HPE’s leading infrastructure, support and services to make the cloud more accessible to enterprises around the globe,” he wrote. \nMoving forward, Azure will be used as the preferred public cloud partner for HPE’s corporate customers. Similarly, Microsoft will point its clients to HPE’s infrastructure and services when providing customers with cloud solutions. In the future, the companies said they plan to integrate their services as well, according to reports. \nTheir announcement also revealed the launch of HPE Consulting for Azure Hybrid Cloud services, enabling corporate clients to more easily implement Azure and HPE solutions. Microsoft Operations Management Suite will integrate into HPE OneView, offering a single platform through which joint clients can access their hybrid clouds. \nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced that its corporate accounting service, Dynamics AX, would be moved to Azure and operate entirely on the cloud, a move analysts said represented a big leap of faith on Microsoft’s part for enterprise cloud solutions.",

      "text": "Microsoft has a new AI chat bot in town called Zo , first spotted on Twitter , which we're assuming is the \"successor\" to Tay , Microsoft's original and ultimately racist AI bot. Zo is in early access preview now, and can be accessed via the Kik messaging app, if that's your thing.\n\nIf you're not on Kik, Microsoft is allowing anyone to request an invite to the service , which will likely allow users to try her out elsewhere when ready. Regardless, Microsoft's latest attempt at an AI chat bot appears to be strong, but will that hold up?\nFor those unaware, Microsoft's original AI chat bot called Tay ended up being a PR disaster for the company, but only because it was subject to \"targeted attacks\" causing the bot to learn things it probably shouldn't. As a result, Tay wasn't afraid to express opinions others deem very politically incorrect.\nRegardless, hopefully Microsoft has learned from Tay's downfalls and implemented failsafe's that will stop Zo from becoming truly off the rails. Let us know how you feel about Zo in the comments below!\n",

Specifically, Microsoft says it’s the old phone scam trick reinvented, with scammers claiming to work for Microsoft and reaching out to address a number of computer issues, such as infections. Scammers claim that they discovered malicious activity on victims’ computers and often say that this is harming other users online or ISPs detected something suspicious on systems. As it usually happens, the phone scammers request a remote connection to the victims’ computers and ask for up to $500 in order to fix problems that don’t exist. Microsoft says that in some cases, attackers even deploy ransomware on these systems, locking down access to files until victims pay the requested amount of money. Microsoft won’t cal...",

      "text": "Read more: Microsoft delivers final public test builds of Windows Server 2016, System Center 2016 | ZDNet See also: What's New in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 News Acronis 2016 and Windows 7 (Advice) Who does not read this will install Windows 7 twice for having clean copy as image in ATI software. So what happens? - Installed win 7, installed sp1, installed drivers, installed acronis 2016, made backup (do not schedule) - done. - Installed crap, and acronis started schedule on my backup.... Software on winxp, when I defrag on a drive, and click to see the analyze report, i would get a list of most fragmented files. Ex: Fragments File Size Most fragmented files 94,735 452 MB ... Performance & Maintenance Win7 SSD shows up in Defrag? I just isntalled Win7 Pro on a new PC with a new SSD. I noticed it shows up under the list of disks that can be defragged. However my pals their PC's don't show that. I have AHCI on, and TRIM shows as its on. Any ideas? Mobo: ASUS E35M1-I Drive: Corsair Force GT 60GB Hardware & Devices Auslogic's Disk Defrag is a free utility. Does anyone know how it compares to Win 7's built in defrag utility? Is it worth downloading over what's already there? Performance & Maintenance DeFraggler vs Win7 defrag? my thoughts on both: Defraggler (by Piriform): FAST, more detailed defragging, awesome GUI win7 defrag: SL W to analyze, SL W to defrag, no GUI both are easy to use, but i find the Win 7 defrag so bloody slow its annoying. thoughts ?

      "text": "0 0 \nGears of War 4 is a third-person shooter developed by The Coalition and published by Microsoft Studios for Xbox One and Windows. This game was released back in October 2016 and it seems that Microsoft has finally revealed some details about an update that will be released next week for it. \nThe new update will bring new features, daily rewards and maps to the game. The new maps include Glory, a fortress based map where you will have to secure the defensible positions, and Speyer, a map designed for close-quarters combat. These two maps will be available on December 13, 2016 and will be rotated in and out of the public playlists. \nIn addition, the title’s developer has added a new Daily Rewards Citizen along with a new vertical split-screen options for players on Windows 10. Here are all the new features the December Update will bring to Gears of War 4: A Daily Rewards system; Improved visual feedback for damage dealt with the Gnasher; Vertical Split-Screen for Windows 10 players; Improvements to footstep audio balance, audio/video settings; A whole lot more! \nThe Coalition will also most likely share more information on “Gearmas”, which comes with holiday-themed weaponry and content. According to reports, a special Wintery theme event will be available sometime soon but we don’t have much information about this right now. \nThe December Update will be released for the Gears of War 4 on December 6, 2016 for both Windows and Xbox One.

      "text": "U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft will have to act faster to tackle online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, the European Commission said on Sunday.\nThe European Union (EU) executive’s warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks.\nThis included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech.\nThe code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests.\nHowever, a report commissioned by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said.\n“In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40% of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a Commission official said.\n“After 48 hours the figure is more than 80%. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.”\n \nThe Commission said it may enact laws to force swifter action.\n“If Facebook fb , YouTube, Twitter twtr and Microsoft msft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times.\nHer spokesman confirmed the comments.\nJourova’s report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50%, but just 11% in Austria and 4% in Italy.\nEU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down “terrorist propaganda” and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.",

      "title": "Microsoft's HomeHub Feature To Compete With Google Home - Android Headlines",
      "text": "Microsoft’s HomeHub Feature To Compete With Google Home December 5, 2016 - Written By Kristijan Lucic \nMost of you have probably heard of Google Home and Amazon Echo thus far, two competing devices which serve as your personal voice-guided assistants. Google had talked about Google Home back during Google I/O in May, and the company had finally launched the device not long ago during their Google Pixel press conference. The Google Home speaker is now available for purchase for $129 in the US, and it has been that way since November 4th when the device became available in the States. \nThat being said, the Amazon Echo has been available out in the market longer than Google Home, and it seems like these two devices could get some competition soon. According to a new report, Microsoft is planning to create a HomeHub feature and include it into future Windows 10 updates in order to compete with both the Google Home and Amazon Echo. According to The Verge, this feature is currently in planning stages, and Microsoft is going to roll it out in updates due in 2017 and 2018, which means that the HomeHub feature won’t be included in the Creators Update which is coming soon. Now, a recent report stated that this feature will ‘crush’ both the Google Home and Amazon echo, but the source thinks that will not be the case, as this feature will offer a somewhat different functionality. According to the source, HomeHub will basically be a feature which will run on all Windows 10 PCs, and will let you call upon Cortana anytime you want. \nNow, if reports are to be believed, Microsoft is trying to create a ‘family environment’ for a PC by including this feature, and it seems like the company will dedicate a whole department to making this feature great, and the HomeHub feature will have a ton of functionality similar to the Google Home, as you will be able to schedule appointments, launch apps, access various data using your voice, etc. So, the HomeHub feature is meant to improve PC’s functionality in a way, as it will allow you to use it as your personal assistant in addition to everything else. Now, the HomeHub feature could be included in third-party hardware which would compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo directly, though it remains to be seen what happens, as these are just rumors at this point, and it would be wise to wait for Microsoft to give us all the necessary details before we compare HomeHub to anything already available out there.

      "text": "( Reuters ) – U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Twitter, Google’s YouTube and Microsoft will have to act faster to tackle online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so, the European Commission said on Sunday.\nThe European Union (EU) executive’s warning comes six months after the companies signed up to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, following rising concerns triggered by the refugee crisis and terror attacks.\nThis included removing or disabling access to the content if necessary, better cooperation with civil society organizations and the promotion of “counter-narratives” to hate speech.\nThe code of conduct is largely a continuation of efforts that the companies already take to counter hate speech on their websites, such as developing tools for people to report hateful content and training staff to handle such requests.\nHowever, a report commissioned by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova showed that compliance with the code is far from satisfactory, the commission said.\n“In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,” a Commission official said.\n“After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.”\nThe Commission said it may enact laws to force swifter action.\n“If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourova told the Financial Times.\nHer spokesman confirmed the comments.\nJourova’s report showed an uneven pace across the 28-country bloc, with the removal rate of racist posts in Germany and France above 50 percent, but just 11 percent in Austria and 4 percent in Italy.\nEU justice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. They are also expected to ask the companies to clarify issues including taking down “terrorist propaganda” and helping provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith)\n",

      "text": "EU threatens Google, Microsoft, Twitter & YouTube with tough new laws to curtail hate speech By John Glenday  48am EU threatens Google, Microsoft, Twitter & YouTube with tough new laws to curtail hate speech \nThe European Commission has called on leading US technology companies including Google , Microsoft, Twitter & YouTube to speed-up their efforts to crackdown on hate speech and incitement to violence -under threat of tough new laws to enforce action. \nBack in May the firms joined forces to sign-up to a voluntary code of conduct in which they promised to ‘quickly and efficiently’ tackle hate speech but the EC has been singularly unimpressed, demanding actions not words and opening the door to the possibility of imposing new laws to ram home the point. \nThe code stipulated that tech firms must review the ‘majority’ of instances of reported hate speech within 24 hours of them being brought to their attention – deleting them if it is appropriate to do so. \nEU justice minister Vera Jourova told the Financial Times: “If Facebook , YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months.” \nSome IT companies have performed better than others with YouTube quickest to respond to flagged content whilst Twitter lagged someway behind. \nAccording to the Financial Times, of 600 items of flagged hate speech received over the past six months, 316 of were serious enough to warrant a response. In reality however just 163 cases saw flagged content deleted, with a further 153 examples left in-situ as they were deemed not to have breached their community rules. \nTakedown rates across the EU vary markedly with 50% of posts identified as racist pulled in Germany and France versus just 11% in Austria and 4% in Italy. \nSource: IBTimes John Glenday \nJohn Glenday is responsible for compiling The Drum's daily morning bulletin and ensuring that overnight breaking news is covered while you're still brushing your teeth.

      "title": "StorageCraft Launches Cloud Backup for Microsoft Office 365™",
      "text": "First in a New Series of Vital Cloud Solutions Improves Control and Management of Data Backup for Large and Small Users of Popular Microsoft® Suite\n\nDRAPER, Utah (PRWEB) December 05, 2016\n\nStorageCraft delivers better control and management of cloud data for small and large organizations with the introduction of Cloud Backup for Microsoft® Office 365™.\n\nMany SaaS users are finding out the hard way that using a cloud-based application is not the same as backing up a cloud-based application. The number one reason for needing to recover files is user error caused by overwriting or deleting critical data. SaaS applications typically provide a platform recovery which still leaves users in the lurch. StorageCraft Cloud Backup for Office 365 provides complete protection for Exchange, calendars and contacts, OneDrive, SharePoint and public shared folders. It is perfectly suited for large-scale enterprise deployments with multiple office locations and remote workers as well as for smaller organizations typically managed by channel service providers. Data is protected by state-of-the-art compression and encryption in Tier 3+ certified datacenters. Data additions or changes are identified automatically and backed up without user intervention. And all users have access to their data. They can quickly recover files, folders or an entire user account using a self-service portal thereby eliminating wait time for IT support tickets.\n\nFuture StorageCraft Cloud Backup solutions in this series will be available for Google Apps, Salesforce and Box.com in early 2017. The implications of Cloud Backup are profound. StorageCraft will protect organizations against ransomware attacks by providing complete data back to the customer. Since users have access to their data, that means they can simply roll back to a clean version and restore it malware-free.\n\n“The common misperception that cloud solutions provide sufficient backup capability is preventing organizations from taking the proper safeguards to protect their data,” said Scott Barnes, Chief Technology Officer of StorageCraft. “Microsoft backs up Office 365 against problems related to their own data centers, but they don’t provide safeguards against data loss from user or system errors.” Additionally, there are no assurances that any available data will be restored to the Office application with its original attributes. That’s if the data is even available. Cloud application vendors frequently discard their data after thirty days. So, while the cloud provides protection in case of floods or other natural disasters, if critical data is deleted or overwritten, having data in the cloud is meaningless from a recovery standpoint. That’s exactly where StorageCraft Cloud Backup plays a central role. “The entire StorageCraft suite of Cloud Backup solutions, including the pending products for Google Apps, Salesforce and Box.com, should be extremely relevant to users of SaaS applications,\" said Mike Kunz, Senior Vice President of Operations. \"When viewed in combination with the recent acquisition of Gillware software and the distribution agreement with Exablox, our total solution offering now addresses business continuity needs for businesses of all sizes.\"\n\nIt was customer control combined with ease of use that prompted Cliff Huxster, Solutions Architect at Integral Solutions Group in South Carolina, to comment, “businesses migrating to cloud solutions like Office 365 and Google Apps do not realize how little control they have on whether their data is being backed up and the nightmare of getting it back if something is deleted or gets corrupted. Our customers want more control and management of their Cloud data backups and restores. Plus, I really like the fact that the Cloud Backup service is integrated into the existing StorageCraft portal as a one-stop-shop.”\n\nChannel partners will be pleased to hear that once an account is set up for protection, they can simply monitor accounts from notifications or the portal. Plus, the single sign-on management portal allows partners to monitor all customers without logging in and out of each account. You can add and remove users, add and remove services and backup only needed data. And, there is no need to actively engage with Cloud Backup unless a restore or export is needed\n–30–",

      "text": "Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are three of the most vocal companies that opposed China’s plans to access proprietary source code of software and technology products in order to make sure that they’re hackerproof or do not include backdoors. In particular, Microsoft explains that providing access to source code contradicts the idea of boosting security, with the other tech companies also adding that such a thing would only expose their products to rivals or cybercriminals. “Sharing source code in itself can’t prove the capability to be secure and controllable. It only proves there is source code,” Microsoft said in comments submitted to the Technical Committee 260, which is the national cybersecurity standards body that’s pushing new laws requiring companies to share their source codes.
