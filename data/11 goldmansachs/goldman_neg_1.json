      "text": "CBS Taps Banks To Advise On Merger -- WSJ  49:  By Joe Flint \nMoelis, Goldman Sachs will review possible tie-up with Viacom \nCBS Corp. has retained banks Moelis & Co. and Goldman Sachs to advise the company on a possible merger with Viacom Inc., according to a person familiar with the situation. \nBoth Viacom and CBS boards have created special committees to review a possible reunion. The CBS committee engaged Lazard as its financial adviser, while Viacom's panel hired Morgan Stanley, Allen & Co. and LionTree Advisors LLC as financial advisers and Debevoise & Plimpton as its legal advisers. \nViacom's management hasn't hired and doesn't plan to hire any financial or legal advisers apart from those hired by its board's special committee, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which has long served as CBS's outside counsel, is also advising the company on Viacom. \n\"It's not even the second inning yet,\" CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves told analysts last week on the company's third-quarter earnings call, when asked about the merger exploration process. \"We are still in the very early stages.\" \nHe added that a merger could be attractive if structured properly and in the best interest of CBS shareholders. \n--Keach Hagey contributed to this article. \nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com  160249ET  ",

      "text": "Danish utility Dong Energy, part-owned by Goldman Sachs, on Tuesday posted a 10% rise in third-quarter net profit and backed its full-year guidance, boosted by a stronger performance in its wind power business, a renegotiated gas contract and the sale of a gas distribution grid.\nThe firm 3.08 billion Danish kroner ($457.6 million) under International Financial Reporting Standards, compared with DKK2.79 billion a year earlier. Revenue dropped 32% on the year to DKK14.27 billion.\nNon-IFRS net profit--which excludes one-off items and the effects of hedging contracts to gauge the company's underlying performance--rose to DKK3.22 billion, up from DKK288 million a year earlier.\nThe company is in the midst of a strategic transformation as it seeks to exit its oil and gas activities renewable energy. Lower oil and gas prices and reduced volume from the Ormen Lange field on the Norwegian continental shelf dented earnings in the quarter and Chief Executive Henrik Poulsen said Tuesday that the process to exit the business had begun, though it is at an early stage and as yet there is nothing to report. \"There can be no assurance as to the outcome or the timing of the completion of the process,\" he said.\nCost performance at its Oil & Gas business continues to improve, driven by continued renegotiation of supplier contracts, reduced exploration spending and improved operational efficiency, with total cash spend decreasing by 36% compared with the same period last year, he said. \"We now expect O&G to be cash flow positive in 2016, a year earlier than previously communicated.\"\nDong maintained its outlook for 2016 of DKK20 billion-DKK23 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and gross investments of DKK18 billion-DKK21 billion.\n-Write to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com; Twitter: @domchopping @WSJNordics\n Trump drops a big tax clue in debate -- here’s what it means How a Merck cancer breakthrough caused Bristol-Myers’ stock to plunge Google Pixel, Home: A Guide to Google's Gear",

      "text": "\nGoldman Sachs will announce its elite partner list on Wednesday -- here's what it means to make the cut Life is about to change for a whole bunch of Goldman Sachs employees. \nOn Wednesday, the firm will announce its new class of partners, one of the most highly coveted titles on Wall Street. \nThe list will likely be short, with just 78 individuals making the grade last time around in 2014. And the make-up of the list will likely hint at the future direction of Goldman Sachs' business. \nThose who get called up are given a comfortable raise and a solid chunk of the bonus pool. They're also provided with investment opportunities not available to other employees. \nTheir day-to-day work lives don't change drastically, though they're expected to take on more responsibilities in the form of partner meetings and firmwide committees. \nCurrently, more than 400 of Goldman's roughly 35,000 employees are partners. \n\"One of our greatest achievements since becoming a public company in 1999 is that we were able to preserve the partnership and the culture and values that it embodies,\" Dane Holmes, Goldman's global head of investor relations, said in a recent Q&A shared by the firm. \n\"The core attributes of a partnership include a commitment to collaboration and collective decision-making, a long-term orientation, and serving our clients with excellence and integrity.\" \nThe selection process takes place every two years, alternating with managing director appointments. Today, the partnership selection process is pretty similar to when the firm was private, Edith Cooper, the firm's head of human capital management, said in a video . \nFirst, the firm selects candidates, then evaluates them in a process known as \"cross-ruffing.\" The candidates are then evaluated by existing partners who are not from their division, based on how they are performing in their current roles and what their potential is to be a leader, going forward. \nA list of names is then presented to senior leadership. Lastly, either CEO Lloyd Blankfein or COO Gary Cohn will personally call each candidate to welcome them to the partnership. \nBecoming a partner \"means taking on more responsibility and broader accountability for the firm in its entirety,\" Holmes said in the Q&A. \n\"In addition to driving commercial success, they must protect and promote the firm's culture, inspire our people, and continuously enhance their individual impact.\" \nWe'll be back on Wednesday when the list is made public.

      "text": "Grab Some Clinton Cash With Goldman Sachs (GS) Stock Sell put spreads in GS to get a hefty fee just like Hillary By Tim Biggam , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 8, 2016, 9:23 am EST View All Posts \nWith election day mercifully here, it appears that Hillary Clinton is the heavy favorite to become the next President of the U.S. While one can debate the dubious merits of either of the major candidates, one certainty is that a President Hillary Clinton will be “beholden,” as Libertarian Party candidate William Weld so succinctly described it. This means that it will payback time for the large donors, with one of the largest being Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GE ). \nBut rather than lament the “pay to play” culture that embodies all things Clinton, I think it is more judicious to embrace that culture and profit by taking a hedged bullish stance in GS. \nIn her paid speeches for $225,000 per appearance, Hillary Clinton sounded more like a managing director for Goldman Sachs rather than a political candidate, according to Politico. While CNN’s source described her speech as neither “controversial or memorable.” \nMarc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of Hillary Clinton and a former Goldman Sachs employee, lost big in his hedge fund betting on Greek debt and had to finally shutter it. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was an investor in the doomed fund and also allowed his name to be used in marketing the fund. Payback will be coming. 7 S&P 500 Stocks That Will Be Knocked Back Down to Earth \nGoldman Sachs was coined the Vampire Squid for good reason, with a long reach into the inner workings of the U.S. Government. I expect that influence to continue in an even bigger way if Hillary Clinton is indeed elected President. Look for some key positions to be filled by former Goldman Sachs directors over the coming months. \nSo with their influence likely assured for at least the next four years, I expect GS stock to feel the benefits going forward. Yesterday’s price action in Goldman Sachs stock, with shares jumping more than 3% on news the FBI will not prosecute Hillary Clinton, was emblematic of those benefits. \nOn a longer-term basis, GS has solid support at the $169 level, with shares convincingly breaking through that area in mid-October. I expect this level to hold over the coming months. \nClick to Enlarge So to position, a bullish put credit spread is the way to play. GS Stock Options \nBuy the GS Dec $165 puts and sell GS Dec $170 puts for a 75 cent net credit. These options are the traditional monthly options that expire Dec. 16. \nMaximum gain is $75 per spread with a maximum risk of $425 per spread. Return on risk is 17%. The short strike is positioned 6% out of the money and near the $169 support level. Trade of the Day: Time Warner Inc (TWX) \nI would look to close out the position on a meaningful break through the $169 support level while looking to let the spread expire worthless and keep the initial $75 credit if GS stock behaves. \nAs of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

      "text": "advertisement \nBig global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are \"at DEFCON 2\" as they brace for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday's election. \nAs the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. \nAs a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on a building in San Diego, California. REUTERS/Mike Blake \nBank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. \nIn the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. \nThe bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a November 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. \nStock Prices Could Pendulum \nTraders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. \nSome banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. \nU.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \nInvestors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. \nThe \"market pretty much told you who was going to win today,\" said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. \nMarkets Are at 'Defcon 2' \nAnother official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from \"DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,\" referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. \nBrokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest \"known unknown\" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. \nThe election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. \nIt plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, \"ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making,\" and possibly raising risk limits.\" \nChris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see \"a massive collapse or spike.\" \nStaffing Up \nHSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. \n\"Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels,\" said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. \nNo U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. \nMore than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. \nThe extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

      "text": "View Comments Clinton's aides commissioned a vulnerability survey on the prospective presidential candidate two months before she launched her campaign Chief among their concerns: the former first lady, who hadn't driven herself in nearly 25 years, would come across as 'out of touch' The also worried that her speeches to Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs would come bank to haunt her The campaign also tested Republican attacks on the Clinton Foundation's funding and alleged mismanagement, as well as Benghazi Other questions were about ethics investigations into her and her husband like Whitewater and her dismissal of ISIS Campaign assumed that Jeb Bush and Scott Walker were top rivals for the presidency \nBy Francesca Chambers, White House Correspondent For Dailymail.com \nPublished: 12:16 EST, 8 November 2016 | Updated: 13:21 EST, 8 November 2016 \nHillary Clinton's aides commissioned a vulnerability survey on the prospective presidential candidate two months before she launched her campaign. \nChief among their concerns was that the former first lady, who hadn't driven herself in nearly 25 years, would come across as 'out of touch' to voters and her speeches to Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs would come bank to haunt her. \nThey also tested her against attacks that she was campaigning for 'Obama's third term,' a hacked email obtained by Wikileaks shows, and 'ineffective' as secretary of state. \nScroll down for video \nHillary Clinton's aides commissioned a vulnerability survey on the prospective presidential candidate two months before she launched her campaign. She is pictured voting today \nMandy Grunwald, a senior communications adviser, wanted the group conducting the study to probe voters' reaction to the messages: 'We need a new direction or 'We need to change course.' \nJohn Podesta, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama who'd left the White House that month to sign on as Clinton's campaign chairman, agreed. \n'To pile on' to that point, the Clinton loyalist said, the campaign should test the message: 'Obama's tried big government solutions for 6+ years and they haven't worked. Now she promises more of the same. We need a change in direction...' \nGrunwald also made the point that Clinton's comment a year before about the last time she drove a car, in 1996, could be problematic. \n'Should we add that HRC hasn't driven a car in thirty-five (?) years? (The Republicans love that one!). Also does \"dead broke\" go here or in the later videos??' she asked, referring to Clinton's comment that she and her husband were in dire straights when they left the White House. \nThey would go on to make millions off of public speeches to large corporations and the financial sector. \nGrunwald advocated for a message test that asked, 'When HRC recently spoke to bankers at Goldman Sachs, instead of holding them accountable for their activities that crashed the economy, she told them that banker bashing was foolish and had to stop. \n'She said \"soothing\" that we all got into our economic problems together,\" ' the fake attack ad was to say. \nCommunications Director Mandy Grunwald, left, and Senior Adviser John Podesta, right, exchanged possible criticisms of Hillary \nThe political consultant also suggested they drudge up someone saying, 'Clinton flew all over the world, but she can't name a single major accomplishment she made as Secretary of State.' \nShe also wanted to survey voters' reactions to positions that Clinton could take up on the trail in Iowa, including 'specific populist policy proposals -- or at least trying to get a sense of their corporate villains.' \n'Does this still make sense? Or should we just stay focused on the negatives?' she asked. \nOne of Clinton's pollsters chimed in to say that they might want to ask in Iowa specifically about an article that accused her of paying her female Senate staffers less than the men and a conservative attack ad that had just come out that targeted the Clinton Foundation. \nA final copy of the internal poll that they conducted over the phone included all of those points in addition to others about the taxpayer funded bailout of Wall Street Clinton backed, the money her family charity took from Middle Eastern countries 'that have been linked to terrorism,' mismanagement of funds at the Clinton Foundation, ethics investigations into her and her husband like Whitewater and the job she did as secretary of state. \nOne question was entirely dedicated to the terror attack in Benghazi. \nThe study asked voters whether they'd be more inclined to vote for Clinton or Jeb Bush, revealing that Clinton's aides viewed the former Florida governor as a major threat \nThe survey asked whether 'criticisms of Hillary Clinton's role in Benghazi are mostly fair and have merit in the facts' or not. \nOthers asked about her plans to 'continue the failed policies of Barack Obama,' including amnesty for illegal immigrants and Obamacare, and her tall tale about being shot at in Bosnia. \nThe study shows that Clinton's campaign also wondered if voters also believed she underestimated the threat posed by ISIS, should have voted against the war in Iraq and was wrong to have supported NAFTA. \nFinally, it asked voters whether they'd be more inclined to vote for Clinton or Jeb Bush in the presidential election, revealing that Clinton's aides viewed the former Florida governor as a major threat and a likely GOP nominee. \nThey also also asked about Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who ended up flaming out early, months before voting started. \nClinton's team still thought it was possible that Elizabeth Warren would go head-to-head with her in the primary, too, and tested her as a possible Democratic candidate.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs is unveiling its new partners. Just don’t get sick as an investment banker.  en/264880/u-s-election-traders-sleepless-night/ \nWhile the U.S. takes in the implications of a Donald Trump victory, Goldman Sachs is bringing to an end its own internal campaign of political wrangling – the bi-annual partnership promotion process. \nGoldman Sachs is to anoint a new round of partners in its bi-annual promotion round later today. Partners are a shrinking breed – two years’ ago just 78 made the cut and Goldman’s slowly seeping layoffs at the top this year have meant that that many potential candidates have ‘lost their rabbi’, as current partners and potential sponsors make way for the new round of promotions. \nCareer paths in investment banking are relatively straightforward. There’s a set number of years you must stick it out at analyst and associate level before you’re bumped up to VP and, while the road gets rockier in the middle ranks, promotions are generally predictable. \nGoldman partners are a whole different ball game. For the past nine months MDs in London and Asia have been flying to New York to be more visible to senior management. They’ve been schmoozing as many possible advocates in the organisation. The whole ‘cross-ruffing’ process involves current partners nominating Goldman Sachs MDs for potential promotion. The names and performance reviews are then submitted to senior partners who in turn interview other partners to see if these MDs are worthy. \nNote that there have been no leaks. The political wrangling over the past nine months has been kept entirely in-house. A select few will be waiting by their phones for the call from Lloyd Blankfein, Gary Cohn or Michael Sherwood later. Sherwood has, however, warned previously that partner status is not without its sacrifices: “Part of being a partner is putting your own personal ambitions behind the ambitions of the firm, especially in difficult years,” he told Financial News in 2012 . This could be described as a tough year for the ‘firm’, which has been making deeper job cuts than usual. \nFormer Goldman Sachs partner Joseph Mauro , who was head of fixed income, currencies, and commodities European hedge fund sales and co-head of European macro rates sales until his departure in May, wrote a consolatory note for all those who’s phone will not ring today. His implication is that those in technology and operations are less likely to be promoted. However, the latest round of MD promotions favoured technology and Goldman’s ‘Federation’ (non-revenue generating divisions), so there could be some surprises. \nSeparately, Milan Radia, a former managing director and research analyst at Jefferies in London, is claiming disability discrimination against the bank because of its behaviour towards him after he was diagnosed with leukemia. \nRadia says he was promoted to managing director a month after being diagnosed in November 2009. He returned to the bank in June 2010 to find that his bonus had been “reduced to a pro rata rate” and cut by two thirds to £192k ($237k) because he took time out for treatment. He didn’t get a bonus in 2011, received a “very poor” bonus of £50k the following year, £32k in 2013 and no cash bonus in 2014. Other MDs received £152-319k in 2012, he says. Radia claims that the bank forced him to quit through a combination of parsimonious bonuses and charges of gross misconduct. \nJefferies denies the claim.

      "text": "FRANKFURT/NEW YORK Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc.\nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor.\nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter.\n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital.\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\"\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities.\nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel.\nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion).\nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nEMPTY SPACE\nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said.\nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March.\nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy.\nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services.\nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market.\nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.\n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard)",

The candidates are identified in the summer and are vetted through a process called “cross-ruffing,” a term derived from the card game bridge. During this process, current partners engage in a series of lengthy conversations on whether or not that candidate deserves to be made partner. The candidates are not interviewed and they have no idea who is cross-ruffing them.\nBeing made partner comes with a number of perks, including an increased base salary and a portion of the bank’s bonus pool that’s divvied up among the 400-plus Goldman partners. Partners are also given access to investment opportunities not available to other employees.\nBelow is the list of the newest partner class:\nNicole Agnew\nAndrew Bagley\nJonathan Barry\nJonathan Bayliss\nDeborah Beckmann\nMichael Bruun\nRobert Camacho\nDavid Casner\nKenneth Castelino\nChristian Channell\nMassimiliano Ciardi\nDavid Coulson\nChris Crampton\nCanute Dalmasse\nMichael Daum\nJennifer Davis\nDavid Fox\nAndrew Fry\nCharlie Gailliot\nGabriel Gelman\nJoshua Glassman\nCourt Golumbic\nParameswaran Gopikrishnan\nSarah Gray\nCarey Halio\nBrian Haufrect\nPeter Hermann\nAmanda Hindlian\nHarold Hope III\nErdit Hoxha\nKathleen Hughes\nRussell Hutchinson\nOmer Ismail\nGeraldine Keefe\nAndre Kelleners\nAasem Khalil\nSimon Kingsbury\nKathryn Koch\nTuan Lam\nDavid Lang\nBruce Larson\nGavin Leo-Rhynie\nTim Li\nPaget MacColl\nClifton Marriott\nElizabeth Martin\nJason Mathews\nAlexander Mayer\nBrendan McGovern\nSean McHugh\nCéline-Marie Méchain\nJung Min\nSam Morgan\nEdward Gary Morse\nHeather Mulahasani\nDimitrios Nikolakopoulos\nMichael Paese\nKim-Thu Posnett\nAlexander Potter\nMacario Prieto\nXiao Qin\nPadideh Raphael\nMarko Ratesic\nLawrence Restieri, Jr.\nJason Rowe\nDavid Rusoff\nMaheshwar Saireddy\nThierry Sancier\nJason Savarese\nJohn Sawtell\nStacy Selig\nTejas Shah\nNicholas Sims\nNishi Somaiya\nLi Hui Suo * \nAurora Swithenbank\nChristopher Taendler\nRichard Taylor\nDavid Thomas\nAndrew Tilton\nPeter van der Goes, Jr.\nDamien Vanderwilt\nPeter Weidman\nNeil Wolitzer\n—\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. \nRead more :\nSCARAMUCCI: The government’s new rule will hurt investors \nTrump’s win is a ‘grand slam’ for Wall Street banks",

      "text": "  11:35pm IST EXCLUSIVE: Goldman Sachs considers Frankfurt move over Brexit - sources A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo By Alexander Hübner, John O'Donnell and Olivia Oran | FRANKFURT/NEW YORK \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. \nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. \nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. \nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. \nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence towards the centre of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial centre - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. \nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" \nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment. \nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. \nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. \nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. \nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion). \nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. \nEMPTY SPACE \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. \nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. \nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. \nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. \nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. \nThe bank has a comprehensive banking licence in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. \nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators. \n($1 = 0.8074 pounds; $1 = 0.9122 euros) \n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard) Next In Money News",

      "text": "Thomson Reuters \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc.\nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor.\nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter.\n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital.\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\"\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities.\nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel.\nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion).\nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nEMPTY SPACE \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said.\nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March.\nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy.\nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services.\nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market.\nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.\n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Writing by John O'Donnell; Editing by Anna Willard)\n",

      "text": "Peter Foley | Bloomberg | Getty Images Traders work at the Goldman Sachs booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman Sachs elevated 84 employees on Wednesday to its prestigious partner class. \nThe new group has six more people than the prior class, which was announced in 2014. The latest induction will bring the total number of partners to around 484, or 1.4 percent of Goldman's work force. \nNearly a quarter of the class is female, the highest percentage promoted from managing director to partner in the firm's history. \nGoldman, which announces new partners every two years, has cut the number by almost a quarter since 2010, when it appointed 110 to the coveted ranks. The pullback comes as the bank looks to cut costs broadly as increased regulation after the financial crisis has made traditional profit areas, like bond trading, less lucrative. \nGoldman embarked on a cost-cutting plan in the first half of the year intended to save $700 million a year. \nEmployee pay is Goldman's biggest expense and the title of partner comes with more responsibility and higher pay. \nWhile Goldman went public in 1999, the partnership hearkens back to the bank's time as a private company in which partners pooled their own money to support trading and investment banking and split the resulting profits or losses. \nPartner selection involves a rigorous process known as \"cross-ruffing\"—a reference to a move from the card game bridge—in which candidates are evaluated by Goldman employees who are not in their own divisions. \nThe new partners received a call from Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein or Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn on Wednesday morning.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs Selects 84 New Partners By LESLIE PICKER   The headquarters of Goldman Sachs in Manhattan. Nineteen of the company’s 84 new partners are women. Credit Mario Tama/Getty Images Every two years, Goldman Sachs promotes a fresh class of partners in a closely watched tradition that heralds back to the time when the company was still a private firm. This year’s list of the chosen is the longest since 2010 and includes the largest percentage of women. Goldman Sachs said Wednesday that it would add 84 partners, more than the 78 designated in 2014 but fewer than the 111 from six years ago. The current class has 19 women, 23 percent of the total, which surpasses previous years. Eighty-two percent of the new partners work in the areas that generate revenue like investment banking and asset management, and the rest come from what Goldman calls its federation, the behind-the-scenes functions like compliance and technology. The ascent to the Goldman Sachs partnership is considered one of Wall Street’s highest honors, opening doors to an exclusive club of financiers. Most other companies promote their top employees to the level of managing director, a designation that also exists at Goldman Sachs. Partners are a notch above that, a mere 1.6 percent of Goldman employees, or roughly 500 people. Achieving that title is an incentive for Goldman workers to stay around rather than bolting for a rival. The class named on Wednesday reflects that staying power, with 75 percent of the new partners having started at Goldman Sachs as either analysts or associates. Famous partner alumni include two former Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin. Goldman declined to give the exact number of partners it has, but it tends to keep fewer than 500 at any point. Many who leave move on to careers in government or elsewhere in business. \n  The selection process, taking place over months, has changed little since Goldman Sachs was a private firm, according to Edith Cooper, a partner and the global chief of human capital management, who described it in a video on the company’s website. It evaluates individuals on things like how they are performing and what their potential for leadership is. Once the names are chosen, Lloyd C. Blankfein , the bank’s chairman and chief executive, as well as Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer, approve the list and call all the new partners to inform them of their selection. “These appointments recognize some of the firm’s most senior professionals and acknowledge their commitment to our franchise, people, culture and values,” Mr. Blankfein said in a statement on Wednesday. “We congratulate all those selected and look forward to their continued strong performance, contributions and leadership in the months and years ahead.” The partnership notifications come as Wall Street reconciles with another tough year for bonuses. Incentive-based compensation will decline 5 percent to 10 percent this year, according to estimates published in a report on Monday by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. That would represent the third consecutive year of declines, because of stricter regulation, a challenging trading environment and broken deals. That has also led to thousands of job cuts across the industry. On receiving the promotion, partners typically get a salary increase and a slice of a special bonus pool. The promotions become effective on Jan. 1, 2017. “Everybody at Goldman Sachs is responsible for the firm’s performance and reputation,” Dane E. Holmes, the global head of investor relations for Goldman Sachs, said in a newsletter on Monday, previewing the partner announcements. “However, the level of accountability for our partners is fundamentally more different given the scope of their reach.” The following individuals were promoted to be a Goldman Sachs partner on Wednesday: Nicole Agnew",

      "text": "Tweet   \nFRANKFURT/NEW YORK - Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc. \nThe U.S. investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank, putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor. \nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. \nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \n\"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one of the people said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt. \nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence toward the center of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial center - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's own finance capital. \nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations. \"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" \nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment. \nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of UK authorities. \nBut banks' UK operations are expected to lose their passporting rights after Brexit. \nCurrently, U.S. banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 percent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. \nA bank such as Goldman Sachs would typically qualify for ECB supervision if it increased the assets of its euro zone operations to 30 billion euros ($33 billion). \nGoldman Sachs AG in Germany had assets of 551 million euros in 2015 according to filings for last year. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank. \nEMPTY SPACE \nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. \nThe bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote. \nBankers in the City of London are worried that British Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge to deliver a full exit from the European Union will mean banks lose their passports or automatic right to do business in the EU. Two years of talks to reach this are due to start in March. \nSecuring the City's open access to the EU market, which lobbyists say is worth about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion) a year to the British economy, is crucial for the financial hub of London - a central pillar of the country's economy. \nGoldman Sachs' Frankfurt office, which is focused on deal-making and selling securities in Europe's biggest economy, is currently its largest European operation outside London. The bank also has smaller offices in other European cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan, providing similar services. \nThe bank has a comprehensive banking license in Germany but some services are delivered via London, using the passport system to sell to the wider EU - posing a problem in the event of a \"hard Brexit\" where Britain has no access to the EU single market. \nGoldman Sachs' assets in Germany are small compared with the roughly $850 billion of assets of Goldman Sachs in London. London is the bank's headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \nEven were Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt to come under ECB supervision, its business in London would still answer to UK regulators.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David …\nBy Olivia Oran\n(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) elevated 84 employees on Wednesday to its prestigious partner class. The new group has six more people than the prior class, which was announced in 2014. The latest induction will bring the total number of partners to around 484, or 1.4 percent of Goldman's work force.\n\nNearly a quarter of the class is female, the highest percentage promoted from managing director to partner in the firm's history.\n\nGoldman, which announces new partners every two years, has cut the number by almost a quarter since 2010, when it appointed 110 to the coveted ranks. The pullback comes as the bank looks to cut costs broadly as increased regulation after the financial crisis has made traditional profit areas, like bond trading, less lucrative.\n\nGoldman embarked on a cost-cutting plan in the first half of the year intended to save $700 million a year.\n\nEmployee pay is Goldman's biggest expense and the title of partner comes with more responsibility and higher pay.\n\nWhile Goldman went public in 1999, the partnership hearkens back to the bank's time as a private company in which partners pooled their own money to support trading and investment banking and split the resulting profits or losses.\n\nPartner selection involves a rigorous process known as \"cross-ruffing\" - a reference to a move from the card game bridge - in which candidates are evaluated by Goldman employees who are not in their own divisions.\n\nThe new partners received a call from Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein or Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn on Wednesday morning.\nGoldman Sachs' Asia-Pacific business, which posted a 61 percent rise in pre-tax earnings in the third quarter from a sharp drop in the preceding three months, added 12 bankers in the partner class, a 50 percent jump from 2014.\nThe Asia-Pacific promotions, based in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Australia, accounted for 14 percent of this year's global partner class, the highest share in recent years.\nGoldman, which reported a 58 percent jump in third-quarter profit last month as bond trading rebounded, saw its September quarter pre-tax earnings in Asia rise to $543 million from $337 million, according to a regulatory filing last week.\nThe share of Asia in the Wall Street bank's overall pre-tax earnings grew to 19 percent in the July-September period from 16 percent a year ago and 10 percent in the first six months of this year.\n\n\n(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Additional reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; Editing by Dan Grebler and Stephen Coates)",

      "text": "A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney Thomson Reuters\nBy Olivia Oran\n(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc elevated 84 employees on Wednesday to its prestigious partner class. The new group has six more people than the prior class, which was announced in 2014. The latest induction will bring the total number of partners to around 484, or 1.4 percent of Goldman's work force.\nNearly a quarter of the class is female, the highest percentage promoted from managing director to partner in the firm's history.\nGoldman, which announces new partners every two years, has cut the number by almost a quarter since 2010, when it appointed 110 to the coveted ranks. The pullback comes as the bank looks to cut costs broadly as increased regulation after the financial crisis has made traditional profit areas, like bond trading, less lucrative.\nGoldman embarked on a cost-cutting plan in the first half of the year intended to save $700 million a year.\nEmployee pay is Goldman's biggest expense and the title of partner comes with more responsibility and higher pay.\nWhile Goldman went public in 1999, the partnership hearkens back to the bank's time as a private company in which partners pooled their own money to support trading and investment banking and split the resulting profits or losses.\nPartner selection involves a rigorous process known as \"cross-ruffing\" - a reference to a move from the card game bridge - in which candidates are evaluated by Goldman employees who are not in their own divisions.\nThe new partners received a call from Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein or Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn on Wednesday morning.\nGoldman Sachs' Asia-Pacific business, which posted a 61 percent rise in pre-tax earnings in the third quarter from a sharp drop in the preceding three months, added 12 bankers in the partner class, a 50 percent jump from 2014.\nThe Asia-Pacific promotions, based in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Australia, accounted for 14 percent of this year's global partner class, the highest share in recent years.\nGoldman, which reported a 58 percent jump in third-quarter profit last month as bond trading rebounded, saw its September quarter pre-tax earnings in Asia rise to $543 million from $337 million, according to a regulatory filing last week.\nThe share of Asia in the Wall Street bank's overall pre-tax earnings grew to 19 percent in the July-September period from 16 percent a year ago and 10 percent in the first six months of this year.\n(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Additional reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong; Editing by Dan Grebler and Stephen Coates)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "In early 2016, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, was producing Tarzan and Joker movies, while SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci was reviving a 1970s TV show, Wall Street Week , to star himself. Tom Barrack was trying to sell Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. They’re in a different place now.\nBy backing Donald Trump’s presidential run, this ragtag group of investors, financiers, and businessmen made such a long-odds bet that even their friends snickered. After his win, they may get the chance to control the levers of power in the world’s biggest economy.\nIn most years, they’d be seen as B-players. That’s not to say they aren’t rich. Barrack, whose holdings include California vineyards and real estate, is a billionaire, as are Trump backers Wilbur Ross, Carl Icahn, and Peter Thiel—who, like the nominee, have little government experience.\n“The first reach is to people who know the system, who can use the system, but are not part of the system,” Barrack told Bloomberg TV when asked about potential appointments after the election. “That’s all that it takes. Nothing sudden. Nothing bold. Nothing shocking.”\nIf Trump’s group of top financial advisers came together over the past few months, Hillary Clinton spent decades cultivating hers. Democratic donors were dreaming big this month. One hedge fund manager discussed his options for Washington appointments he might get while sipping wine in Manhattan the night before the polls. With Election Day under way, a banking veteran chewed over what kind of job he might get once Clinton won.\n(L) M. Scott Brauer for Bloomberg Businessweek; (R) Jonno Rattman for Bloomberg Businessweek Included in the new issue of Bloomberg Businessweek , Nov. 14-20, 2016, which features two covers on Trump’s American Revolution. Subscribe now .\nTrump beat her by railing against such insiders, putting out a closing ad—decried by some as anti-Semitic—featuring George Soros and Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. Mnuchin, the candidate’s chief fundraiser and now a top prospect for a big job in his administration, worked with both. Before he joined Trump’s campaign, he was tapped by Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, named a Goldman Sachs partner, ran a hedge fund, and bought the failed bank IndyMac, producing blockbuster films on the side.\nTrump said at a July fundraiser in the Hamptons that Mnuchin would make a good Treasury secretary, Scaramucci says. The same month, the candidate posted an image on Twitter of Clinton with cash and a six-pointed star. A Holocaust survivor Mnuchin knows asked him how he could be supporting Trump. Mnuchin told the man he respectfully disagreed.\n“He’s a guy that can recognize an opportunity and adapt to it,” friend and billionaire Richard LeFrak said about Mnuchin this year. “He’s able to switch into different things.” Lew Eisenberg, Republican National Committee finance chairman, is another possible pick for a job in the Trump administration. He was Mnuchin’s father’s partner at Goldman Sachs.\nBecause they belong to the elite Trump attacked so mercilessly, it’s hard to know how these investors and financiers would run regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve, Treasury, or the National Economic Council. But there are hints about what they might try to dismantle.\nLast month, Scaramucci compared a pending Labor Department fiduciary rule that makes some brokers put client interests before their own to the Supreme Court’s 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied black Americans citizenship. Icahn, a corporate raider who owns a majority stake in oil refiner CVR Energy, said this year that Trump can stop the Environmental Protection Agency’s “crazy regulations” on his first day.\nWall Street has reasons to be relieved and afraid. Trump has promised to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the financial crisis almost toppled the global economy. While some bankers would be thrilled to be rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Volcker Rule, Trump has alternately said he’ll bring back the Glass-Steagall Act’s wall between commercial and investment banking. And he’s said hedge fund managers are “getting away with murder” under the tax code.\nStill, bankers and financiers may have an easier time getting into the administration than anyone watching from the outside might think. The head of presidential appointments for Trump’s transition, William Hagerty IV, is a private equity executive. He didn’t respond to messages.\nOn the trail, Trump said fundraising wasn’t his favorite, but he and Mnuchin made a good team. “You know, I sit with 20 people, and we talk, and they all hand you checks. Bing! Bing! Bing! Bing!” he said at one of his golf resorts, when a reporter asked if he minded soliciting donations. “In fact, Steve Mnuchin is here someplace. Steve? Are we doing well, Steve?” They were.",

      "text": "At Whit's End The Answer Is Not Silence. It’s Engagement Goldman Sachs’ global head of human capital management Edith Cooper offers some inspiration to continue the diversity conversation. November 10, 2016 Kellye Whitney \nI don’t feel like talking about diversity in the workplace this week. \nI’m not upset. Nothing happened. I did some good work this week, and physically I feel fine. I just don’t feel like explaining anything that — to me — should be perfectly obvious, but for one reason or another, isn’t. I’m tired of it. \nBut I will, and it’s all because of Edith Cooper. \nI ran across this article she wrote last month on LinkedIn and was instantly inspired. I was soothed, honestly, because this highly successful black woman was writing about things I could personally relate to. She understands my struggles as a working woman, and every now and then you just need that, you know? \nNow, Cooper is a seasoned, successful executive who’s spent the past 30 some years climbing the ranks at high-brow financial institutions to reach her current position as executive vice president and global head of human capital management for Goldman Sachs. \nShe’s also black, and she understands racism from personal experience. Her parents grew up in the segregated South, and she knows what it feels like to be mistaken for the coat check girl at her son’s school and to be asked to serve coffee at a client meeting she came to run. In her recent article on LinkedIn she talks openly about having to constantly explain her credentials when no one else had to, and being asked what country she’s from — she grew up in Brooklyn. And this one made me roll my eyes ­— having someone suggest that she’s not “ black black.” Likely because as a Harvard-educated career leader she doesn’t fit the stereotypical image many people have of what a black woman looks like or could be. Edith Cooper, EVP and global head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, encourages dialogue surrounding diversity. \nBut what struck me about Cooper is her stance on race in the workplace. She actively wants to talk about it. I wouldn’t have expected it from someone at her level at a company like Goldman Sachs, but that’s what happens when you make assumptions, right? People surprise you, sometimes in the best way. \nBut in a video embedded in the article she talked about an event her company held in response to some of the things that have made headlines in \nrecent months. The black partners in the firm got together with the CEO and chairman to have a conversation about their experiences, and she said the turnout took her breath away. It made her realize that “now is the time for the conversation.” She echoed so many things that I say in this blog, that I say to anyone who asks me about race or gender or any other dimension of diversity and how to handle those tough conversations. For instance, “get comfortable being uncomfortable.” Cooper said the answer to that discomfort that tends to rise whenever anyone says something the least bit controversial or draws attention to something others consider to be “out of the box” — which most discussions of diversity are — is not silence. It’s engagement. \nShe offered this practical advice for me and for anyone interested in advancing workplace diversity: Engage in this dialogue; don’t be silent. Misunderstanding and miscommunication can be tempered by the simplest acts most of us learned as children: listen well, choose your words with care and respect others. Focusing on our differences is easy and divisive; leveraging what we have in common is harder, but will effect positive change for all. \nShe also talked about how the diversity conversation at Goldman had to go beyond the need for mentoring and coaching. They’re important, but so is the fact that people need to understand — unconscious bias is real; it affects us all. “The only way we can get comfortable with other people’s differences, is to get in that conversation, to explore the difference,” Cooper said. \nShe talked about feeling a sense of responsibility to share her experiences in an effort to advance the dialogue around diversity. I’m intimately aware of that sense of obligation; when I’m in one of my, what’s-the-point-of-it-all moods, it’s what keeps this blog going, my compulsion to add to that discussion. \nShe will probably never read this post, but thank you, Edith Cooper. Thank you for sharing honestly, and for offering this diversity blogger encouragement when my spirits were flagging. \nKellye Whitney is the associate editorial director for Workforce.

Press Trust of India | Last  40 (IST) Press Trust of India EMAIL COMMENTS The currency measures should be positive for the rupee bond market, says Goldman Sachs. Mumbai : The government's announcement to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to curb black money is positive for banking system liquidity but negative for near term economic activity, says a report by Goldman Sachs.\"The announcement to curb informal circulation of money is likely to be positive for banking system liquidity as well as medium-term fiscal resources and financialization, but negative for near-term economic activity,\" Goldman Sachs said in its report released on Thursday.The report said from an economic standpoint, this reform is likely to have material implications across money supply, consumption spending, fiscal policy and eventually inflation. The pace of increase in currency in circulation had risen significantly over the past year to 17.3 per cent year-on-year in October 2016, contributing to nearly 20 per cent of the overall increase in money supply over the same time period. \"With individuals depositing their cash at bank accounts, we think M3 growth is likely to switch away from currency into bank deposits over the next month,\" it said.Nearly 10 per cent of total household financial assets are held in currency, higher than those held in equities and debentures.It said the reform is a positive step over the medium term as it increases transparency, accountability and shifts more transactions through electronic mediums and the banking system.The undeclared cash when exchanged at banks over the next few months with an associated identity card, may be tracked by tax authorities and help increase the tax base of the economy, which is currently running below the regional average.\"This could help the government bring the fiscal deficit down to 3 per cent in the financial year 2017-18 from the budgeted 3.5 per cent in in the financial year 2016-17.\" The report said that over the medium term, as more transactions take place via the banking system, the Reserve Bank of India should be able to bring the banking system liquidity to net neutrality more smoothly and consequently improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission.From the growth perspective, the reduction in currency in circulation is likely to be negative for short-term consumer discretionary spending.In particular, cash-heavy sectors such as jewellery, restaurants, food and beverages, transport, among others are likely to witness a drop in sales.These sectors account for nearly 50 per cent of overall household spending. \"This places some downside risks to near-term growth, in our view.\"Gold import demand is also likely to be impacted as a result of reduced end-consumer jewellery demand. It said from the markets perspective, these measures should be positive for the rupee bond market. Story first published on : November 10, 2016 18:40 (IST) Related",

      "text": "Mumbai: A gauge of expected swings in India’s rupee dropped the most in almost six weeks as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the government’s crackdown on unaccounted wealth will boost the nation’s bonds and currency.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on late Tuesday decided to ban Rs500 rupee and Rs1,000 notes in India’s most extensive anti-graft operation in almost four decades. The currency reform will increase banking-system liquidity, and the rupee and local notes will likely outperform Asian peers in the near term, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe wrote in a report on Wednesday.\n“We see this as positive for the bond market because of the increase in banking system liquidity, eventual positive effects on the tax base and government revenue, and likely short-term disinflationary effects on spending from cash constraints,” the analysts wrote. “The rupee may face some volatility near term, but over the medium term, we expect the current account to improve on reduced imports.”\nALSO READ: Rs500, Rs1000 notes ban: Tax dept conducts raids in Delhi, Mumbai \nThe rupee’s one-month implied volatility, used to price options, fell 32 basis points, the most since 30 September to 4.54%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the spot market, the currency climbed to a two-month high of 66.3375 per dollar before reversing gains and ending 0.3% lower at 66.6250 amid a rally in the greenback.\nThe yield on sovereign notes due September 2026, which sank 13 basis points on Wednesday, fell one basis point to 6.66%, according to prices from the Reserve Bank of India’s trading system. That’s the lowest close for a benchmark 10-year security since June 2009. Overseas holdings of Indian government and corporate bonds increased for a seventh day on Wednesday, taking inflows this month to almost Rs53 billion.\nALSO READ: Old Rs500, Rs1000 currency notes can be used for paying utility bills, tax: govt \nIndia’s biggest money manager is bullish on local debt as it expects the government’s measures to curb illegal cash opening up room for more interest-rate cuts. Yields may decline to “levels which one may not have projected thus far over the next six months,” said S. Naren, executive director and chief investment officer at Mumbai-based ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $29 billion. “Fixed income appears attractive again.”\nModi’s step is an attempt to fulfil his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money. Mumbai-based brokerage Edelweiss Securities Ltd predicts the government’s surprise crack down on high-value currency notes will uncover Rs3 trillion in such funds. ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd is even more optimistic, pegging the figure at as much as Rs4.6 trillion. Bloomberg",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs’ Frankfurt bankers better off than London peers",
      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 3 hours ago \nGoldman Sachs is seriously contemplating moving some operations from London to Frankfurt. That might be a good thing.  en/265105/if-not-wall-street-if-not-the-city-where-next-for/ Goldman Sachs is possibly packing some of its bags \nGoldman Sachs is thinking hard about Frankfurt. So says Reuters , which claims the U.S. firm is “considering” shifting “assets and operations” away from London to the German city. None of this seems particularly revelatory: of course Goldman is contemplating Frankfurt. Of course it is – the real issue is whether it chooses Frankfurt over, say, Paris or Dublin. \nGoldman’s London bankers might want to hope it does. Frankfurt is not a bad place to be. The bankers we’ve spoken to who live and work there profess to love it: you can commute into the city from beautiful little villages at the foot of nearby mountains. The trains work; the roads aren’t congested; it’s like living in a urban fairy tale. \nEven better from a Goldman banker’s perspective, it looks like a move to Frankfurt might make you better off. \nThe chart below show how much Goldman Sachs pays its average banker in London and how much it pays its average banker in Frankfurt. These are according to figures for pay per head from Goldman Sachs International and Goldman Sachs AG. In dollar terms, the London average Goldman Sachs London employee is 20% better off. \nHowever, the cost of living in London is considerably higher than in Frankfurt: Mercer’s most recent ranking put’s Frankfurt in 88th place globally for the cost of living for expats; it puts London 17th. \nBy some estimates, living in London is 40% more expensive than living in Frankfurt. On this basis, that 20% pay differential doesn’t look so bad.- Goldman’s Frankfurt bankers have the advantage. \nAdmittedly, comparing Goldman’s London business and its German business might not be comparing like-with-like. As we’ve noted before, Goldman Sachs International in London is heavily skewed towards sales and trading , where pay is high. By comparison, Goldman Sachs AG looks more skewed towards asset and wealth management , where pay is less high. If Goldman moves securities staff to Germany, average pay may well rise and the advantage of being in Germany will be even greater. \nIn the meantime, junior Goldman staff in Germany may actually be paid more in headline terms than in London. Analyst pay figures on Glassdoor indicate that the average salary for a Goldman analyst in Frankfurt is €70k (£62k). In London, it’s £57k. There are signs that Goldman’s hiring juniors in Germany – it just recruited Henrik Jansen from Lazard as an associate. The firm’s London staff may want to ask for a transfer.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs mulls ditching London for Frankfurt Published time: 10 Nov, 2016 17:06 Get short URL © David Gray / Reuters US investment giant Goldman Sachs is reportedly considering moving some of its London assets and operations to Frankfurt over fears that it may lose access to the EU after the UK leaves the bloc. Read more Barroso says Goldman Sachs ‘not drug cartel’ in tirade against EU inquiry \nReuters reports the Wall Street bank is considering the move as a way to come under the umbrella of the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB), the eurozone’s banking supervisor. \n“Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,” one anonymous source told Reuters. \nA second source added that Goldman, which was famously compared to a vampire squid for its role in igniting the 2008 financial crisis, had already held talks about a possible move with ECB officials in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital. The firm is reportedly keeping a floor in its Frankfurt building empty to accommodate any additional staff. \nUnder ECB jurisdiction, the firm, which has also been blamed for helping Greece hide its debt in order to join the eurozone in the early 2000s, could continue selling its services, which include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, to clients across the EU, one of the sources told Reuters. Read more Major banks brace for market turmoil after US election \nCurrently Goldman relies on the EU’s ‘passporting’ system to do business. This allows the company to sell its services in Europe without having to have a physical presence in each member state. However, a so-called ‘hard Brexit,’ which would entail giving up access to the single-market, may mean that banks lose the automatic right to do business in the EU. \nReuters estimates Goldman would need to increase its eurozone operations to €30 billion ($33 billion) to qualify for ECB supervision. \nA spokesperson for Goldman said Brexit posed “numerous uncertainties” and that it was working through “all possible implications” of decision to leave the EU. \n“We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be,” he added. \nThe ECB declined to comment.",

      "text": "The Goldman Sachs economic team takes a crack at calculating the economic impact on Donald Trump’s stated trade policies (italics mine):\nIf tariffs on imports from Mexico and China only were raised to 35 and 45% respectively, the average effective tariff rate would rise by roughly 11-12 percentage points (pp) from 1.5% to roughly 13%, a level not seen since WWII. … Tariff increases would likely boost inflation, and have mixed short-run but negative long-run growth effects. We estimate that a hypothetical 10pp hike in US import tariffs would 1) depress imports by about 5% and 2) boost the core PCE price level by roughly 0.6% cumulatively. The decline in exports would depend on the extent to which trading partners retaliate.\nNovember 8, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri.\nThe growth effects of import tariff increases depend on the horizon. The short-term impact on GDP is uncertain and likely mixed. On the one hand, the shift from imports to domestic production contributes positively to short-term growth, and tariff revenues can finance fiscal stimulus. On the other hand, the real income loss from expensive imports lowers consumption and investment. Other important negative short-term effects include the decline in exports under retaliation, tighter monetary policy, and possibly broader FCI tightening. While trade raises important distributional questions, the long-term aggregate growth effects from trade restrictions are negative in our view. The academic trade literature has highlighted several channels through which trade fosters long-run welfare. Trade can boost output as countries specialize; raise the variety of available products; and increase productivity through larger and more competitive markets.\nAnd of course this analysis doesn’t take into account any a) chilling side-effects on global trade liberalization or b) geopolitical impacts . But there is a sounder version of Trump’s aggressive, tariff-focused take on trade policy, at least as concerns China. Forget about the budget deficits, forget about the yuan. My colleague Derek Scissors, in a report earlier this year, highlights what policymakers should focus on:\n1) Do not grant market economy status. The WTO accession agreement indicates China should be treated as a market economy for the purposes of American trade starting in late 2016. Whatever the legal considerations, the PRC does not have a market economy or anything close to it. Its own statements about the state sector make that clear.32 Pretending Beijing has implemented the necessary reforms would undermine American domestic political support for economic engagement with China and can only make justified attempts to address noncommercial Chinese behavior less effective and more complicated. It would be doubling down on a flawed WTO decision.\n2) Reorient policy to focus on foreign barriers. Punishing China (or others) just for selling cheap goods Americans want to buy is self-defeating. The US should, however, consider sanctions for unacceptable barriers to exports. A prime example is China’s sheltering of SOE from competition. While Chinese SOEs are not major exporters, the sectors in which they are most protected likely experience excess capacity and dumping, and sanctions in those cases might encourage reforms that Beijing has failed to undertake until now.33 Moreover, SOEs want to invest in the US and can be reasonably restricted on the grounds they do not operate on a commercial basis.\n3) Sanction the beneficiaries of stolen IP. Criminal charges against IP thieves do little to protect American innovation. In contrast, spending time and resources to track the theft of brands and technology to final users could be extremely useful. Depending on the extent of their complicity, Chinese entities and their subsidiaries using stolen IP could be subject to limits on investment in the US all the way to being barred from any business, including export. This will not be easy but has been shown to be possible.34 It has the distinct benefit of shielding those who respect IP and therefore encouraging good behavior, which is indispensable for the US to gain from the economic relationship.\n4) Postpone any bilateral investment treaty. In light of IP theft and noncommercial operation by SOEs, the Obama administration’s pursuit of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) is odd.35 American regulators need to be able to act freely against Chinese investors that have broken the law, and Beijing shows no interest in treating American firms better.36 A BIT is warranted only after years of better policy from Beijing. The American business community should have learned from WTO accession that the PRC has many ways to circumvent agreements it does not like. If the business community refuses to learn, the US government should recognize that difficult votes pertaining to globalization should be used more wisely than on a China BIT.\n5) Enforce existing US laws. This is less a China problem than an America problem. Branches of the US government appear unwilling to hold Chinese firms or firms involved in China-related business to the letter of American law, particularly with regard to disclosure.38 Chinese entities have cited obligations to their own government as overriding. If so, the operations of these entities should not be deemed as meeting regulatory requirements, and some should be banned from the US altogether. A looming issue as the Chinese presence expands is predatory pricing or other antitrust violations, where the accused may also seek to void American law.\nThe post 5 ways for the Trump White House to get tough on China trade without causing a trade war appeared first on AEI .\n",

REUTERS/Gary Cameron ( Copyright Reuters 2016 ) Goldman CEO Blankfein says Trump's plans may be good for economic growth \nBy By Olivia Oran \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the surprising U.S. election results show \"democracy at work\" and could bode well for the firm and its clients, in a voicemail to employees on Wednesday. \nContinue Reading Below \n\"Change is often the agent of progress in ways that we can't always readily see in the early days,\" he said, according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters. \nPresident elect Donald Trump's stated commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform, \"will be good for growth, and therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm.\" \nBlankfein acknowledged that the presidential campaign cycle had been divisive and that many Goldman employees \"may feel uncertain, or perhaps even disheartened or uncomfortable with the outcomes of these political cycles.\" \nJPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon also delivered a message to bank employees on Wednesday, saying business leaders and government officials needed to work together on solutions to the country's problems. \nDimon said a \"deep desire for change\" and frustration with the economy were among the reasons Trump had been voted into office. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nA senior person on Trump's transition team contacted Dimon about serving as Treasury Secretary in the new administration, Reuters reported on Thursday. \n(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York) ",

      "text": "FRANKFURT/NEW YORK • Goldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, three people familiar with the matter said, as it tries to secure access to the European Union market when Britain leaves the bloc.\nThe United States investment bank is examining the step as a way to qualify for supervision by the European Central Bank (ECB), putting some of its operations under the watch of the euro zone's main banking supervisor.\nComing under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the euro zone and wider EU post-Brexit, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.\nHowever, this is uncharted legal territory and the sources said Goldman had not yet taken any decision on the matter. \"Moving under ECB supervision in Frankfurt is one of the options the bank is considering,\" one source said. Another said Goldman had held talks about such a step with ECB officials in Frankfurt.\nThe plans being examined would shift Goldman's European presence towards the centre of the euro zone, representing a blow to London's status as a global financial centre - and a coup for Frankfurt, a small city that is Germany's finance capital.\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs said there were \"numerous uncertainties\" about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.\n\"We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"We have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be.\" An ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGoldman, whose services include broking and market-making in securities, foreign-exchange trading and corporate finance, currently relies on the EU's \"passporting\" system. This allows it to sell across the region without setting up shop in each member state, while under the supervision of the UK authorities. But banks' UK operations are expected to lose their \"passporting\" rights after Brexit.\nCurrently, US banks concentrate the bulk of their European operations in Britain, with 88 per cent of their regional employees based there, according to 2014 data from think-tank Bruegel. Goldman Sachs in Germany had assets of €551 million (S$842.6 million) last year, according to filings. The bank's overall assets, however, in other entities in Germany and the rest of the euro zone are higher, according to the bank.\nGoldman is keeping a floor vacant at its high-rise offices in Frankfurt which could accommodate any additional staff, one of the sources said. The bank had initially intended to return this to the owner of the tower, where Goldman Sachs has occupied the top floors for more than a decade, but changed its mind after the Brexit vote.\nREUTERS\n  'Goldman Sachs may exit London for Frankfurt'.

Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” By Claire Bernish\nContrary to his anti-establishment stance — which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton — Donald Trump’s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election.\nSteve Mnuchin came on board Trump’s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs — and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management — conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee’s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians.\n“It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,” Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump’s curious choice for Treasury Secretary.\nAccording to Fox Business Network , Trump’s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he’s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary.\nTrump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate:\n“I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” \nZero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton.\nFurther substantiating his establishing banking insider status — the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe — Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT’s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like “Avatar.”\nIf Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties don’t trouble Trump’s supporters enough, the hedge fund manager’s links to George Soros — an ardent Clinton fan — certainly will.\nIn fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible — and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump.\n“Steven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,” Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. “He brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.” \nIndeed, Trump’s campaign, quoted by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin “has previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.” \nWhile business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former’s links to the left.\nDespite the nominee’s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump’s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities — particularly as darlings of the establishment.\nShould you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric — from any politician — only constitutes so much hot air.\nSource: The Free Thought Project \nRelated: Netanyahu Congratulates Trump, a ‘True Friend’ of Israel Trump and all the other far right leaders are Zionist stooges Is Donald Trump Really an Anti-Zionist?

      "text": "REUTERS/Larry Downing \nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is on board with the idea of Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary.\nCNBC reported earlier Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump may ask Dimon, who is the CEO of JPMorgan, to take on the role.\n\"Wow, terrific,\" Blankfein said in a conversation with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference Thursday.\n\"Look there's certainly attractive aspects to that — I can think of a couple,\" Blankfein said.\n\"He'd be a great Treasury Secretary, and he's been a terrific competitor. And I'd say in that one move we could kill two birds with one stone!\"\nThe move, essentially, would put a Wall Street ally in the Treasury while simultaneously eliminating one of Blankfein's chief business rivals.\nDimon, 60, has been CEO of JPMorgan since 2005, while Blankfein, 62, took the reins of Goldman Sachs in 2006.\nBlankfein last month said he was supporting Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton , in her bid for president.\nNOW WATCH: These are the business skills you learn from being in a gang \n",

      "text": "(Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon.REUTERS/Larry Downing) \nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein is on board with the idea of Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary. \nCNBC reported earlier Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump may ask Dimon, who is the CEO of JPMorgan, to take on the role.\n\"Wow, terrific,\" Blankfein said in a conversation with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference Thursday.\n\"Look there's certainly attractive aspects to that — I can think of a couple,\" Blankfein said.\n\"He'd be a great Treasury Secretary, and he's been a terrific competitor. And I'd say in that one move we could kill two birds with one stone!\"\nThe move, essentially, would put a Wall Street ally in the Treasury while simultaneously eliminating one of Blankfein's chief business rivals.\nDimon, 60, has been CEO of JPMorgan since 2005, while Blankfein, 62, took the reins of Goldman Sachs in 2006.\nBlankfein last month said he was supporting Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton , in her bid for president.\nNOW WATCH: Here’s what happens when interest rates go negative \n\nMore From Business Insider \nUS bank stocks are climbing \nIt's Goldman Sachs partner day — here's what it means to make the cut \nOne word is on the lips of just about every Wall Streeter right now",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump loves all things gold.\nHis proposed policies should also push quite a few investors into becoming his fellow gold bugs, according to a Tuesday note from a team of Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer.\nMarket performance over the past few days, such as surging bond yields, suggests that investors are expecting economic reflation out of Trump presidency. The president-elect has, after all, proposed tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and promised to increase infrastructure and defense spending.\nGoldman suggested that selling bonds and buying gold, seen as a safe haven asset, would be a good hedge against future inflation.\n“With higher prospects for reflation, we continue to prefer being short bonds rather than long equities, as equity valuations remain elevated and the pick-up in growth has been too tepid so far,” the team wrote. “Also, bonds have not helped to hedge intraday equity drawdowns and broad risk-off; we think their ability to do so will likely continue to be limited compared to previous drawdown cycles. As a result, we continue to like gold as a hedge in the portfolio context; it has hedged risk well today, being up more than 5% at one point.”\n \nWhile Goldman suggested piling into gold, it suggested investor’s stay their hand when it came to stock markets. Goldman said that investors are still trying to make sense of the election outcome, making the trade too risky at least until year-end.\nThe team noted that they are also overweight on cash.",

      "text": " Financial regulation is not going to be repealed under President-elect Donald Trump, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday afternoon.\nSome investors are expecting Trump to repeal Dodd-Frank, which places regulation of the financial industry in the hands of the government. It was passed by the Obama administration in 2010 as a way to prevent a future financial crisis similar to the one that happened in 2008.\n\"Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,\" Trump told Reuters earlier this year. \"It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.\"\nWhile this piece of legislation won't be repealed, there could be some modifications to it, Blankfein admitted. \"You wouldn't want to repeal it in toto. If you want to be good for bankers, you have policies that drive economic growth. That will be good for bankers. It will be good for companies. It will be good for citizens.\"\nThere's also talk that Trump might bring back the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separated investment banking from commercial banking lending.\n\"I don't think that's realistic\" because \" the world has evolved since then and you really couldn't separate those activities because lending and corporate bond trading are kind of substitutes for each other,\" Blankfein claimed.\nRight now, lending to a bank or underwriting a corporate bond from a bank are \"economically equivalent things,\" he said. But even if the act was brought back, it would do \"very little violence\" to Goldman Sachs.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump loves all things gold.\nHis proposed policies should also push quite a few investors into becoming his fellow gold bugs, according to a Tuesday note from a team of Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer.\nMarket performance over the past few days, such as surging bond yields, suggests that investors are expecting economic reflation out of Trump presidency. The president-elect has, after all, proposed tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and promised to increase infrastructure and defense spending.\nGoldman suggested that selling bonds and buying gold, seen as a safe haven asset, would be a good hedge against future inflation.\n“With higher prospects for reflation, we continue to prefer being short bonds rather than long equities, as equity valuations remain elevated and the pick-up in growth has been too tepid so far,” the team wrote. “Also, bonds have not helped to hedge intraday equity drawdowns and broad risk-off; we think their ability to do so will likely continue to be limited compared to previous drawdown cycles. As a result, we continue to like gold as a hedge in the portfolio context; it has hedged risk well today, being up more than 5% at one point.”\nWhile Goldman suggested piling into gold, it suggested investor’s stay their hand when it came to stock markets. Goldman said that investors are still trying to make sense of the election outcome, making the trade too risky at least until year-end.\nThe team noted that they are also overweight on cash.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s What Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein Told Employees About Trump’s Win Here’s Lloyd Bankfein’s bottom line on Donald Trump: Keep an optimistic mind. That was the message the Goldman Sachs gs CEO sent out to employees Thursday via voicemail, based on a transcript seen by Fortune . \nPrior to Trump’s surprise win Tuesday night, most of Wall Street had predicted Hillary Clinton would take the White House and act as a continuation of President Barack Obama’s administration. But now that the opposite has come to pass, CEOs and executives of large companies and banks are now trying to explain what Trump’s presidency might mean for their firms . (Related: Read the Email Jamie Dimon Sent Out to J.P. Morgan Chase Employees on Trump Win ) \nBlankfein in his Thursday voicemail noted that while he can’t be certain if the election will be “good or bad in the long-run,” Trump’s proposed plan to lower taxes and increase spending could be a boon for economic growth. \nSeparately, Blankfein also appeared at the New York Times’ Dealbook conference on Thursday , saying that Trump’s policies are “asset friendly and market friendly.” The comments come despite the fact that Blankfein was negatively featured in one of the final commercials of the Trump campaign. Despite that investors, though, are already anticipating that president-elect will be friendlier to the financial sector . Shares of Goldman Sachs have rallied nearly 11% as of noon Friday since election day, while an exchange-traded fund tracking the industry xlf rose 7.4% in the same period. \nHere is Blankfein’s transcript, which was sent to Goldman Sachs’ team around the world: This is Lloyd. I’d like to take a moment to share some thoughts with you in the aftermath of the US election. The results of the election have surprised many of us, similar to what we saw earlier this year in the UK Brexit vote. The political cycle has unquestionably been divisive – not only in the US and in the UK, but also in other parts of the world. I know that some of you may feel uncertain, or perhaps even disheartened or uncomfortable with the outcomes of these political cycles, while others of you feel just the opposite. I can’t predict with certainty whether the outcomes of recent political processes we’ve seen will be good or bad in the long-run. We can aspire to predict the future, but that is beyond our reach, as recent events have shown. Instead, it is a more realistic ambition to be clear-minded about what is occurring, and to contingency plan for all scenarios. This helps us to risk manage our firm, and more importantly, it enables us to assist our clients as they adapt to changing circumstances. The election results in the US show democracy at work. This means respect for the will of the people and an orderly transition of power. And in the long-run, this, in and of itself, is a stabilizing process. It also means change, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Change is often the agent of progress in ways we can’t always readily see in the early days. In the US, for example, the president-elect’s commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform – among other things – will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm. Amidst the changes we expect to unfold, you should stay close to our clients. Your ideas, insights and advice will prove valuable to them as circumstances evolve in the weeks and months ahead. Separately, while there has been tremendous focus on the US election, we, Goldman Sachs, had an election of our own. As we do every two years, we selected a new class of partners, which we announced today. In many ways, the new class reflects the strength of the firm and the diverse experience and skills of an emerging class of new leaders. So as we head into the home stretch of 2016 with a number of divisive political contests settled, with an improving global economy, and with a firm that is well funded with both financial and human capital, I remain optimistic about the future, the world’s and our firm’s.

      "text": "Activist investor Elliott unveiled stake in company in June Goldman Sachs working on sale of identity protection provider Share on Facebook \nLifeLock Inc., the provider of identity-theft protection services, is in talks with several parties about being taken private, people familiar with the matter said. \nFinal bids for the company are due this month and could value LifeLock at about $2 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. Buyout firm TPG is among potential suitors, two of the people said. \nElliott Management Corp., the activist investment group founded by Paul Singer, unveiled a stake in LifeLock in June and owns about 11 percent of the Tempe, Arizona-based company. LifeLock is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on the sale, the people said. \nShares of LifeLock jumped as much as 14 percent to $20.03 in New York trading Friday, giving the company a market value of about $1.9 billion. \nRepresentatives for LifeLock, TPG, Elliott and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. \nLifeLock, which has more than 4.4 million customers, provides a range of identity-theft protection services, including credit monitoring and alerts, according to its website. Chief Executive Officer Hilary Schneider has worked as a senior adviser to TPG, according to her corporate biography. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

But it jibes perfectly with what Blankfein and other Wall Street giants have been saying all decade.\n\"We will be among the biggest beneficiaries of reform,\" Blankfein said when the bill was on the table.\n\"More intense regulatory and technology requirements have raised the barriers to entry higher than at any other time in modern history,\" Blankfein said in 2015. \"This is an expensive business to be in, if you don't have the market share in scale. Consider the numerous business exits that have been announced by our peers as they reassessed their competitive positioning and relative returns.\"\nThe other big guys feel the same way. Jamie Dimon has praised Dodd-Frank for widening JP Morgan's \"moat.\"\nOne result: More concentration in the financial sector and nearly no new banks entering the industry . Good for the incumbents. Bad for consumers and would-be competitors.\nAlso, remind me: Is there any systemic danger posed to the economy by having a consolidated financial sector with a few banks that are too big to fail?\nTimothy P. Carney, The Washington Examiner's senior political columnist, can be contacted at tcarney@washingtonexaminer.com .

      "text": "*Expect the election result to increase policy uncertainty, *warns Goldman Sachs, as a result of an increased pace of legislative action in 2017 without clarity, so far, regarding which issues the administration will prioritize. Over the near-term,* much will depend on how financial conditions respond to the policy positions of the new administration.* Despite today’s favorable market reaction, investors may take a *dimmer view* on proposals to raise tariffs or otherwise restrict international trade.\n\nVia Goldman Sachs,\n\n*Q: Where do the final results stand?*\n\n*A: Republican sweep.* At this point, Mr. Trump is likely to finish with 309 electoral votes but is slightly behind Sec. Clinton in the popular vote (the margin is likely to grow as votes are still being counted). In the Senate, one race has not yet been decided but Republicans look likely to hold 52 seats in the next Congress, two less than the 54 they hold currently. Likewise, in the House, four races have yet to be called, but Republicans look likely to hold 241 seats, down six from the their current level (including one vacant Republican seat).\n\n*Q: What does this mean for policy in general?*\n\n*A: Overall, we think the election result implies greater policy uncertainty, for two reasons.* First, the likelihood of significant legislative activity has increased as a result of single-party control for the first time since 2010, and Republican single-party control since 2006. In some areas, like fiscal policy, the question is now less if legislation passes, but what legislation passes. Second, uncertainty also looks likely to rise, at least temporarily, because it is much less clear what the priorities—or, on some issues, even the general views—of a Trump Administration are likely to be compared to most incoming administrations. As a first pass in thinking about policy under the new administration and Congress, we would categorize issues along two dimensions: how much political support Mr. Trump would need from Congress, and which issues have been key to his political success, suggesting a need to follow through directionally though not necessarily on the specifics.\n\n*Q: What is likely to be on the Trump Administration’s agenda?*\n\n*A: The issues on Mr. Trump’s agenda are fairly apparent but it is less clear how priorities will be ordered.* The campaign focused on tax reform, trade and immigration restrictions, easing of regulation, repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare ) and increased spending on infrastructure and defense. Some of these issues appear more likely to become priorities for the Trump Administration than others. For example, it is clear that congressional Republicans hold tax reform as a top priority, along with ACA repeal. While both of these issues likely resonated with many of Mr. Trump’s supporters, these are issues that congressional Republicans—and the 2012 Republican presidential candidate—have highlighted in the past, with mixed electoral success.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump focused new attention on trade policy and immigration, taking more restrictive stances in both areas than many Republican members of Congress support. While there were several factors behind Mr. Trump’s surprising victory, many of the states where he significantly outperformed were those with some of the highest shares of manufacturing-related employment (Exhibit 1). Given this, it would be surprising to see a Trump Administration distance itself entirely from commitments made on the campaign trail regarding trade. He also appears focused, as do many of his advisors, on reducing regulation, particularly in the energy and financial sectors. Some of these changes could require legislation, but many would be possible through executive action.\n\n*Exhibit 1: Trump outperformed in manufacturing-intensive swing states*Source: CNN, Department of Labor, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\n*Q: How much congressional support will President Trump need for his agenda?*\n\n*A: It ranges from needing bipartisan support to unilateral executive authority, depending on the particular issue.* He would need bipartisan support for regulatory-focused legislation, for example. Under current Senate rules, it usually takes 60 votes to pass major legislation dealing with most policy areas, such as regulatory changes affecting various sectors, legal changes (for instance, dealing with immigration or anti-trust laws) or labor laws like a minimum wage increase. In some cases, bipartisan support in the Senate might be possible in light of the fact that 10 Democratic senators representing states that Mr. Trump won will be up for reelection in 2018 (only one Republican senator representing a state that Sec. Clinton won will face reelection in 2018). Coalitions will differ based on the issue, but a deregulatory push in some areas, like energy, could receive sufficient support from these Democratic lawmakers to cross the 60-vote threshold. On many other issues, like comprehensive immigration reform, we expect that reaching a compromise would remain difficult.\n\nFiscal policies could be addressed with only a simple majority in the House and Senate. Under the budget “reconciliation” process, the majority party can pass legislation to cut or raise taxes with only 51 votes in the Senate, rather than the usual 60 votes needed for most legislation. The two issues most likely to be addressed using this process would be tax reform and changes to the ACA. It is possible that certain aspects of federal spending, like Mr. Trump’s infrastructure program, might be addressed through this process as well.\n\nA third set of issues could be addressed without congressional involvement at all. The president has broad powers related to trade policy, as discussed below. Once in office, President-elect Trump could also reverse the “deferred action” policies for undocumented immigrants that President Obama put in place in 2012. Beyond this, there are a number of regulatory actions that the current administration has taken that could be modified or reversed, related to labor rules, energy exploration and production, carbon emissions and other aspects of environmental regulation, and financial regulation.\n\n*Q: What has President-elect Trump proposed on taxes?*\n\n*A: Mr. Trump has proposed personal and business tax reform that would reduce tax revenues by an estimated $4.4 trillion over ten years, or roughly 1.9% of GDP over that period. *Roughly half of this cost is estimated to come from his proposed corporate tax reform plan, which would reduce the corporate income tax rate to 15% and would impose a one-time 10% tax on all foreign earnings not yet taxed by the US. Companies would be free to repatriate earnings without additional tax once this tax has been paid. Like the House Republican proposal, this would involve a transition to a new corporate tax system for taxing foreign earnings. The two plans are similar in several other respects as well, including a top individual marginal tax rate of 33%. However, the House Republican plan is estimated to cost around half as much over the next ten years as Mr. Trump’s plan, at least in part because it proposes to go further in limiting or eliminating existing individual and corporate tax preferences (Exhibit 2).\n\n*Exhibit 2: Tax plans compared*Source: Office of Management and Budget, House Ways and Means Committee, Trump Campaign , Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\n*Q: Will his tax proposal pass?*\n\n*A: We expect that significant tax legislation has a good chance of passing in 2017, but we would not expect it to reduce revenues by as much as Mr. Trump has proposed.* We note three potential obstacles to passing such a proposal:\n\n\n\nFirst, the cost is likely to be prohibitive for some members of Congress. While the majority party is able to pass tax legislation with only a simple majority in the Senate using the budget reconciliation process described above, it would require near-unanimity among the 52 Republicans in the Senate next year to do so. Our expectation is that some Republican lawmakers would balk at the deficit impact of his proposal.\n\n\nSecond, while the House Republican proposal would increase the deficit less, it has also generally been proposed in the context of the broader Republican budget proposal, which would also reduce spending in several areas. Mr. Trump has not proposed a significant net spending reduction.\n\n\nThird, tax reform is complicated, and even under a unified Republican government, it may be too complex to resolve in a matter of months.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the outlook for a tax cut depends on how willing marginal Republican lawmakers are to increase the deficit, and/or how willing they are to find offsetting savings elsewhere. Overall, our expectation is that there is a good chance that some type of tax legislation passes next year, but the obstacles to comprehensive tax reform go beyond partisan disputes, so we would expect tax legislation that is adopted in 2017 to be narrower in scope than the campaign proposal, and significantly smaller in its revenue effect.\n\n*Q: What has Mr. Trump proposed in terms of infrastructure spending?*\n\n*A: His infrastructure plan calls for up to $1 trillion in additional spending over ten years, most of it privately financed.* A memo released in late October by Mr. Trump’s economic advisors Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro detailed a plan to finance up to $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over ten years, equal to $100bn per year or about 0.5% of GDP. We previously estimated that a spending boost of this size would reduce the unemployment rate by about 0.3pp and raise inflation a touch, leading the Fed to eventually hike one or two more times by 2019 relative to a baseline without the infrastructure package.\n\nThe plan described by Ross and Navarro would be largely privately financed, but encouraged by tax credits. The plan would seek to incentivize the private sector to increase investment in infrastructure projects that would be supported by future usage fees, such as road tolls. Ross and Navarro suggest that 17% of the initial investments could be financed with equity and the remainder with debt. The government would then provide a tax credit equal to 82% of the equity to reduce the cost of financing. The large role of debt-financed private investment in Mr. Trump’s infrastructure plan implies that a significant increase in interest rates could be a hurdle for the plan’s feasibility.\n\nRoss and Navarro argue that the plan would be revenue neutral because the tax credit would be offset by revenue raised from taxes on income earned by workers employed by the infrastructure projects and on profits earned by contractors. However, their calculations both assume that the workers employed would not otherwise be earning taxable income and assume a tax rate that looks somewhat optimistic under the tax plan proposed by the Trump campaign. We expect that the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee would find that the plan increased the deficit under their methodologies.\n\n*Q: Will it pass?*\n\n*A: Mr. Trump appears to be more focused on infrastructure than many Republicans in Congress are.* That said, his proposal, which relies on tax credits, might attract more Republican support than a spending plan of the same size. Moreover, there is significant Democratic support for additional infrastructure investment, which raises the possibility that it could be combined with the tax reform legislation discussed earlier to increase support for the overall package.\n\n*Q: What does this signal regarding overall fiscal policy?*\n\n*A: We expect fiscal policy to loosen by about 0.75% of GDP, though there would be only a partial effect in 2017.* Our very preliminary view is that fiscal policy might loosen by around 0.75% of GDP, with perhaps 0.5% coming through tax reductions and 0.25% through spending. Our expectation is that the effect in 2017 would probably be smaller, for two reasons. First, tax legislation would probably not pass until around mid-year, at earliest. Second, increases in infrastructure spending (or subsidies) and/or defense spending would likely take until 2018 to materially change spending levels.\n\n*Q: What has President-elect Trump proposed regarding trade and tariffs?*\n\n*A: Mr. Trump has opposed existing trade agreements and suggested large tariff increases.* He has proposed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and raised the possibility of withdrawing from the World Trade Organization (WTO). Mr. Trump also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In terms of explicit changes, Mr. Trump has suggested imposing a 35% tariff on imports from Mexico and a 45% tariff on imports from China. If tariffs on imports from Mexico and China only were raised to 35 and 45% respectively, the average effective tariff rate would rise by roughly 11-12 percentage points (pp) from 1.5% to roughly 13%, a level not seen since WWII (Exhibit 3).\n\n*Exhibit 3: Will tariffs stay low?*Source: International Trade Commission, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\n*Q: What authority does the President have over trade and tariffs?*\n\n*A: Trade policy is an area of greater presidential discretion.* The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations but as a practical matter Congress has ceded much of this power to the executive branch over the years. Congress approves trade agreements, but the actual legislation that Congress passes usually simply authorizes the president to enter into an agreement that has already been concluded. The consensus among legal scholars is that presidents generally have the authority to withdraw from bilateral and multilateral trade agreements approved this way.\n\nTariff levels are technically under the purview of Congress, though most levels are governed by commitments in bilateral and multilateral agreements. The executive branch lacks the authority to make broad permanent changes to tariffs on a unilateral basis, such as Mr. Trump’s suggestion that imports from China should face a 45% tariff. That said, the president does have authority to raise tariffs broadly on a temporary basis, or to raise tariffs narrowly on a longer term basis. Regarding the former, authority exists under the Trade Act of 1974 that grants the president power to impose quotas and/or an import surcharge of no more than 15%, though neither could be left in place for longer than 150 days. Regarding the latter, the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission oversee anti-dumping and countervailing duty complaints from various US industries seeking relief from import competition. The tariffs imposed in these cases are often substantial, but they are limited to certain narrowly defined products from certain countries, rarely affecting more than 1% of annual imports and averaging less than 0.2% of imports since 1980.\n\n*Q: What would be the effects of tariff hikes on the economy?*\n\n*A: Tariff increases would likely boost inflation, and have mixed short-run but negative long-run growth effects. *We estimate that a hypothetical 10pp hike in US import tariffs would 1) depress imports by about 5% and 2) boost the core PCE price level by roughly 0.6% cumulatively. The decline in exports would depend on the extent to which trading partners retaliate.\n\nThe growth effects of import tariff increases depend on the horizon. The short-term impact on GDP is uncertain and likely mixed. On the one hand, the shift from imports to domestic production contributes positively to short-term growth, and tariff revenues can finance fiscal stimulus. On the other hand, the real income loss from expensive imports lowers consumption and investment. Other important negative short-term effects include the decline in exports under retaliation, tighter monetary policy, and possibly broader FCI tightening. While trade raises important distributional questions, the long-term aggregate growth effects from trade restrictions are negative in our view. The academic trade literature has highlighted several channels through which trade fosters long-run welfare. Trade can boost output as countries specialize; raise the variety of available products; and increase productivity through larger and more competitive markets.\n\n*Q: What are the President-elect’s views on monetary policy and the Federal Reserve?*\n\n*A: As a candidate Mr. Trump was sometimes critical of the Fed, but his views on the appropriate direction for policy are unclear. *On the one hand, Mr. Trump has expressed support for low interest rates, given the current inflation backdrop: “If inflation starts coming in, and we don’t see any signs of that, inflation starts coming in, that’s a different story. You have to go up and you have to slow things down. But right now I am for low interest rates.” He has also expressed concern about excessive dollar appreciation, saying in the same interview: “If we raise interest rates, and if the dollar starts getting too strong, we’re going to have some very major problems.” He added: “While there are certain benefits, it sounds better to have a strong dollar than it actually is.” Mr. Trump has also often noted that, as a developer, he prefers low rates. For example, at the Economic Club of New York in September, he said: “As a real estate person, I always like low interest rates, of course.”\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Trump has said he worries low interest rates are artificially supporting asset prices: “In terms of real estate, if I want to develop … from that standpoint I like low interest rates. From the country’s standpoint, I’m just not sure it’s a very good thing, because I really do believe we’re creating a bubble.” Similarly, he has said Fed policy has created a “false stock market ”, that the “only reason the stock market is where it is, is because you get free money”, and that the FOMC “should have raised the rates” at its September 2016 meeting. Many conservative economists favor tighter monetary policy, but Mr. Trump’s views appear more nuanced, and we are therefore unsure whether he would favor a more hawkish Fed stance after taking office.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Trump’s preferences for Fed Chair are still unclear. During the campaign he said clearly that he would want to replace Yellen: “She is not a Republican … When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that I think it would be appropriate.” And earlier today, a campaign spokesperson said that Mr. Trump would prefer a Fed Chair “whose thinking is more in keeping with his own”. However, at other times during the last year Mr. Trump said that he has “great respect” for the Fed Chair, and that he is “not a person who thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job.” So while unlikely, we would not totally rule out a Yellen reappointment. Several past Fed chairmen have been reappointed after the White House changed parties, including Chairmen Martin, Volcker, Greenspan, and Bernanke (Exhibit 4).\n\n*Exhibit 4: Fed Chairs have been reappointed by presidents of the other party*Source: Federal Reserve Board, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\n*Q: What changes have you made to your forecasts following the election result?*\n\n*A: We nudged down the odds of a Fed rate increase next month, but have made no other changes at this point.* After the tightening in financial conditions immediately following the election results , we lowered our subjective probability of a December rate increase to 60% from 75% previously. Markets have now recovered substantially—the S&P 500 in fact closed 1.1% higher on the day. If financial conditions remain benign in the coming weeks, the odds of a December rate hike would rise.\n\n*For now we are sticking with our forecast that real GDP will grow at a 2% pace in 2017. Over the near-term, much will depend on how financial conditions respond to the policy positions of the new administration. Despite today’s favorable market reaction, investors may take a dimmer view on proposals to raise tariffs or otherwise restrict international trade. Beyond the next couple of quarters, increased potential for fiscal stimulus may be a source of upside risk. Given that the US economy is already close to full employment, aggressive fiscal stimulus would also point to upside risks to inflation.*",

      "text": "This is a 'reset' moment for the dollar - Goldman Sachs November 12, 2016, 08:12:37 PM EDT By Adam Button, ForexLive Shutterstock photo From Goldman Sachs: \nWe discuss our dollar outlook in the wake of the election, with many asking if USD strength in recent days can extend. We think so and see the election as something of a \"reset. \nGoing into the election, the Dollar fell whenever odds of a Trump victory went up, in particular on the FBI disclosure of additional Clinton emails. As early signs of a Trump victory made their way into the markets during the night from Nov. 8 - 9, the Dollar fell in line with this pattern, but reversed sharply as President-elect Trump began giving his acceptance speech, which projected a conciliatory and inclusive message. This set off a rally in risk, which has morphed into markets trading a positive growth shock to the US: Dollar up, inflation breakevens up and SPX up. \nAmid substantial uncertainty, our US team has kept is growth forecast unchanged. There is upside risk from the fiscal stimulus, while there is downside risk from an escalation in protectionism. But in either case, inflation is likely to be higher than before, which is what has probably helped drive inflation breakevens up. As a result, market pricing for Fed hikes has risen sharply, with tightening priced through Sep. 2019 now 86 bps, almost a full hike more than at points before the election. \nOur point here is not that risks don't exist. Of course they do. Instead, it is that the policy mix has shifted in the direction of more inflation, which means that - given how dovish market pricing has been - there is room for the Dollar to catch up with where it should have been quite some time ago. \nOur US team forecasts three hikes next year in addition to the one now likely in December. This is more than double what is priced and underpins our forecast for the Dollar to rise around 7 percent on a trade-weighted basis over that horizon .

      "text": "show chapters \nCommodities rally was knee-jerk reaction: Investor \nExpectations of infrastructure spendin in the U.S. and demand from China has driven commodity prices, says Jonathan Barratt, CIO at Ayers Alliance Securities.\nCommodities rally was knee-jerk reaction: Investor      3 Hours Ago | 01:29 The sharp rally in metals and bulk commodities was \"too much too fast,\" because the impact of Donald Trump 's infrastructure plan on global demand was tiny compared to that of China , Goldman Sachs analysts cautioned in a report.\nIn his victory speech on Wednesday, Trump proposed a \"$1 trillion over a 10-year period\" infrastructure stimulus plan, sending iron ore prices up about 5 percent to around $74 a metric ton soon after.\n\nIron ore traded around $80 a ton on Monday, compared to all-time lows around $38 a ton hit 11 months ago. Meanwhile, copper prices spiked about 8 percent to above $6,000 a metric ton on Friday before retreating on Monday in Asia, with three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange priced around $5,620 a ton.\nGoldman's analysts cautioned on the rapid nature of the run-up, which they said was not sustainable.\n\"We believe that the initial reaction in iron ore and copper prices has been excessive and reiterate our view for sequentially lower prices,\" they wrote in the report released on Friday. \nChristopher Dilts | Bloomberg | Getty Images This was because iron ore and copper prices depended not just on U.S. but global demand, they noted, explaining that the U.S. accounted for just 4 percent of the seaborne iron ore market in 2015—versus China's 70 percent. \nEven if the U.S. imported of all of its additional steel demand under Trump's plan, the incremental impact on seaborne iron ore would only be 9 million tons a year. In comparison, China imported 950 million tons of the steel-making material in 2015.\n\nOverall, U.S. steel and copper demand shifts would represent just a 0.4 increase in total demand, with all else constant, the analysts said. \nGlobal growth forecasts also did not justify the price rally, the Goldman analysts continued. \nTaking Trump's spending plan at face value, last week's rally in iron ore and copper prices would be consistent with a 1.5 percentage point increase in global growth expectation from the 90th percentile of the iron ore and copper cost curves — meaning the market was pricing in seven times as large an infrastructure stimulus as the \"$1 trillion over a 10-year period\" Trump proposal, said Goldman. \nshow chapters \nInvestors embracing pro-growth policies: Expert\nCapital Advisors' Channing Smith says U.S. markets are embracing Donald Trump's policy proposals, which are expected to be good for growth.\nInvestors embracing pro-growth policies: Expert      5 Hours Ago | 01:44 Even at the 95th percentile of the cost curves, last weeks' rally would be consistent with twice as large a stimulus as Trump mooted, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in global growth expectations.\nThe investment bank has not raised its global growth forecast due to uncertainty on the proposed U.S. infrastructure stimulus and whether the new administration would pursue more restrictive international trade policies, which would weigh on emerging market demand growth. \n\n\"One intuitive way of seeing this is that China exports 100 million tons of steel per year, roughly the same amount of total U.S. steel consumption. To the extent that higher tariffs slow global trade and Chinese steel exports, infrastructure spending in the U.S. may only redistribute iron ore demand from China to the U.S. rather than lifting global demand for iron ore,\" the Goldman analysts said. \nGoldman's assumptions did not consider the extent to which the Trump administration would implement other policies such as tax cuts and deregulation, which could boost private construction activity and amplify the impact of U.S. demand on global markets. \nTailwinds in the metals market include China credit data strength and further appreciation in the Chinese yuan, they added. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Getty/Bryan Bedder\nGoldman Sachs last month launched an online consumer lending platform — an unusual move for the global investment bank — and many people are wondering why.\nThe lending tool, which you can find at Marcus.com , will offer fixed-rate, no-fee personal loans of up to $30,000 for two- to six-year periods. It's targeted at Americans with more than $10,000 in credit card debt.\nThe launch marks a step towards consumer banking for Goldman, which is arguably the best known investment bank in the world. The firm in April launched a digital savings account on GSBank.com, offering customers a 1.05% interest rate on their deposits, which can be as little as $1.\nCEO Lloyd Blankfein provided some insight into that push, while speaking with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference last week.\n\"Lending is a place which historically we haven't done as much of, being an investment bank, and so what we are doing is we are building lending platforms and lending businesses,\" Blankfein said.\n\"One of the places we thought we could go to, and have a relative advantage, and fill a void, is consumer lending. Not because it's a consumer business, but because it's a very good business for us to go to.\"\nHe said that financial regulations are a real driver of the push, as they have dissuaded banks from going into capital-intensive areas. He also highlighted the role that technology now plays in lending businesses, stressing Goldman's strength in technology.\nLending is a service that's focused on risk management and it's a service that's delivered digitally, Blankfein said, \"which we think we're pretty good at.\"\nHe said that, 10 years from now, he hopes Goldman's outstandings will be in the billions of dollars.\n\"Think about how much credit card debt is out there — allowing people to finance that … really accomplishes a lot for the consumers,\" Blankfein said.\nIn sum:\n\"We think we can risk-manage it, we think we can deliver it, and it's a good, relatively safe, relatively low-capital cost business,\" Blankfein said. \"It's a valuable niche for us to fill.\"\nGoldman Sachs CFO Harvey Schwartz last month told Business Insider that a convergence of factors led to Goldman's push into retail banking.\n\"The consumer and the market really presented itself to us,\" Schwartz told Business Insider. \"We've always had technology skills. We've always had risk-management skills. ... It's just converged for us in a way that works. And we are a bank, so we can do it — and we can get accretive returns.\"\nSchwartz added that if consumers were not using web platforms, and rather relying on physical bank branches, \"We probably wouldn't be in the space.\"\nSEE ALSO: LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary would kill 2 birds with one stone NOW WATCH: The real estate tricks billionaires use to sell their penthouses faster and for more money Loading video...

He also highlighted the role that technology now plays in lending businesses, stressing Goldman's strength in technology.\nLending is a service that's focused on risk management and it's a service that's delivered digitally, Blankfein said, \"which we think we're pretty good at.\" \nHe said that, 10 years from now, he hopes Goldman's outstandings will be in the billions of dollars.\n\"Think about how much credit card debt is out there — allowing people to finance that … really accomplishes a lot for the consumers,\" Blankfein said.\nIn sum:\n\"We think we can risk-manage it, we think we can deliver it, and it's a good, relatively safe, relatively low-capital cost business,\" Blankfein said. \"It's a valuable niche for us to fill.\"\nGoldman Sachs CFO Harvey Schwartz last month told Business Insider that a convergence of factors led to Goldman's push into retail banking. \n\"The consumer and the market really presented itself to us,\" Schwartz told Business Insider. \"We've always had technology skills.
