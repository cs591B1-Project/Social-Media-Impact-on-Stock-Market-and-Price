      "text": "Shares of Internet TV network Netflix ( NFLX ) jumped Tuesday on a stock upgrade and news about the company's latest moves to increase its original programming.\nNetflix rose 4.5% to 124.57 on the stock market today .\nResearch firm Evercore ISI on Tuesday upgraded Netflix stock to hold from sell after observing that competing streaming video services have failed to gain meaningful traction.\n\"While Netflix's elevated spending levels continue to raise the stakes where valuation is concerned, competitively speaking, Netflix seems to be in a good position,\" Evercore ISI analyst Ken Sena said in a report. He set a price target of 111 on the stock.\nIBD'S TAKE: Netflix was added to IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks after it cleared resistance around 120. The stock is building the handle of a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 129.39. Netflix has found support at its 50-day moving average line several times within its handle, indicating institutional support at those levels.\n\"As we assess the present-day competition, we find that the many impending OTT (over-the-top TV) and subscription video on demand offerings we feared have failed to gain material traction or had a combination of false starts and delays. What we have learned is that obtaining scale has not proven easy,\" Sena said.\nIn the Internet TV market, Netflix faces a host of competitors including Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Hulu.\nIn 2017, Netflix intends to release over 1,000 hours of original programming, up from over 600 hours this year. Netflix's content budget next year is $6 billion.\nSpeaking Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said the service would add about 20 unscripted TV series next year.\nNetflix's push into reality TV programming should help it expand into overseas markets, he said.\nFor instance, its upcoming athletic competition show, \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" will have productions in local markets worldwide. It will have versions of the show in six countries, including the U.S., South Korea and Mexico.\nLoading the player...",

      "title": "Netflix slashes base prices in India to accommodate 15% tax",
      "text": "Exclusive: American streaming service Netflix has slashed its base price in India to avoid charging the cost to consumers. Their old base price of Rs 500 is now Rs 435; the Rs 650 plan’s subtotal is now Rs 565; and the Rs 800 plan now has a base price of Rs 696. This change has kept the cost to Indian customers the same, but has reduced Netflix’s revenue per user by around 15% in the country.\nA tax component has been added to Indian subscribers’ monthly invoice:\nWe checked, and this tax component wasn’t there in the bill last month.\nThis is a stark departure from Netflix’s reaction in New Zealand, where they actually increased prices this October in reaction to a similar digital tax. There, prices were increased by up to NZ$2.50.\nThe 15% service tax on digital goods \nThe 15% service tax, which the Indian government has required starting this month , applies on all digital products and subscriptions purchased from abroad, including e-books, movies, cloud storage services, and other digital products. Such a tax has already been applicable on Indian digital products. Not all providers have slashed the prices like Netflix, though. Digital Ocean, a hosting provider, has started charging the tax in India without reducing the base price. Dropbox, which has charged similar taxes to customers in Japan and New Zealand, may also start collecting this tax.\nIt is unclear whether Netflix has registered in India to deposit the tax, or is simply collecting taxes that it plans to pay after registering later. MediaNama’s email to Netflix about this tax, sent a couple of weeks ago ( via this form ), has not received a response yet.",

      "text": "Comments Scott Buck, who is the showrunner on Netflix's 'Iron Fist', is set to lead another Marvel series, 'The Inhumans', at ABC. \nFormer \" Dexter \" showrunner Scott Buck is tapped to lead another superhero series , \" Marvel's The Inhumans \". According to The Hollywood Reporter , Buck will oversee the adaptation of the classic comic book series about Black Bolt and the Royal Family. Buck also serves as showrunner for upcoming series \" Marvel's Iron Fist \", which is scheduled to be released on March 17, 2017 on Netflix. \"Iron Fist\" marks Buck's first gig since \"Dexter\" ended in 2013. Buck has also worked on HBO's \"Six Feet Under\", \"Rome\" and \"Coach\". Details of \"The Inhumans\" series are still kept under wraps. The straight-to-the-series order came with the understanding that this wasn't a spin-off of \" Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \" nor was it going to replace the planned feature film. \"The Inhumans\" will be the third Marvel series on ABC, following \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and the canceled \" Marvel's Agent Carter \". The first two episodes will play in IMAX theaters for two weeks starting Labor Day weekend in 2017 before the series will make its debut on ABC. \n© AceShowbiz.com",

By gathering and sharing information on carbon emissions associated with their products, companies can make environmentally friendly choices easier for consumers and boost their own reputations as planet-friendly businesses. \nAdvances in online technology provide effective and inexpensive opportunities to do this, according to a recent study (PDF) conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. \nTo explore strategies for sharing carbon footprint information and evaluate the impact of offering consumers carbon offset options, NREL researchers designed a series of experiments focused on four industries — online retailing, ride sharing, video streaming and short-term lodging. \nUsing crowdsourced online survey services, they reproduced the online interfaces of actual companies to track the decision process of participants offered green choices. Follow-up questions explored participants’ reactions to these options. Their findings demonstrate that providing green choices can lower their overall carbon footprints and improve customer satisfaction. \nProviding green choices can lower overall carbon footprints and improve customer satisfaction. \nResearchers reproduced the online interface of a major U.S. online retailer, Amazon, to test carbon-reducing strategies in online retailing. Amazon Prime members receive free two-day shipping, but can also select free no-rush shipping and earn a $1 credit. \nIn one experiment, the researchers asked participants how they would respond if they were given a chance to accept carbon offsets instead of the credit, and how their opinion of Amazon would change if the company offered carbon-neutral no-rush shipping. Researchers found that green shipping was as popular as the credit and improved Amazon’s environmental image. In addition, since the carbon offsets generally were less expensive than the $1 credit, offering this service to customers could save the company money. \nA second experiment gave customers the option to add carbon offsets for shipping to their bills, with the cost of this offset varying with the product and the shipping option selected. When adding the carbon credit was the default, 88.2 percent of customers chose to do so. When the carbon credit was not the default option, 40 percent of customers still chose to add it. \nThe researchers used Uber as a model system for exploring the potential for carbon offsets in the ride-share industry. \nThe experiment was similar to that conducted using the Amazon interface, providing customers an option to add the cost of carbon offsets to their bill. The cost of the offset was varied between 2 cents and 20 cents per trip based on estimated costs of carbon of $6 per 1.1 tons and $50 per 1.1 tons and assuming a 10-mile trip and the 2012 U.S. average fuel economy for light-duty vehicles. \nGiven the scenario of a 10-mile trip every weekday for a year, participants then were asked if they would be willing to add the cost of carbon offsets to their bill for every ride. Depending on the carbon price, this would increase the total cost by either $5.95 or $49.58. Results showed close to three-quarters of customers were willing to add the offset for a single trip at either carbon price and to offset emissions associated with all of their Uber trips when the total yearly cost was $5.95. Even when the cost for all future trips was high, half of all participants remained willing to purchase offsets. \nTheir results support two basic \"design principles\" for initiatives aimed at helping consumers reduce their carbon emissions. \nFor video streaming, the research team used the model of Netflix. Content can be streamed in standard, high or ultrahigh definition — with the carbon footprint increasing with increased definition. Subscribers may not realize that higher definition streaming isn’t necessary for all content. The researchers provided information on the carbon footprints of the three streaming options to the Netflix user and found that participants tended to choose a lower resolution stream. \nNot only that, but 42 percent of participants said they would allow Netflix to automatically provide the least carbon-intensive streaming resolution, adjusting the definition level to the needs of the type of video being streamed. \"This response could represent an opportunity for Netflix to reduce operating costs, lower its corporate environmental footprint and improve customer satisfaction with one simple innovation,\" the researchers noted. \nIn the realm of short-term lodging, the researchers used the example of Airbnb, a company that connects customers with hosts who offer space in their homes as an alternative to hotels. The researchers found that, on average, potential Airbnb hosts could expect to receive just under $7 more per booking if they qualify as providing an energy-efficient rental. However, when participants were given the option to add between 50 cents and $3 to their bills to make their stays carbon neutral, less than 13 percent indicated that they would be willing to purchase these carbon offsets. \nThe researchers noted that their results support two basic \"design principles\" for initiatives aimed at helping consumers reduce their carbon emissions: provide credible information at the point of decision and keep things simple. \n\"These experiments indicate significant untapped potential for firms to reduce the climate impact of their product chains and improve customer satisfaction at very low or even negative cost,\" the researchers concluded. \"Such opportunities certainly exist in other industries as well.\" Topics:",

      "text": "  9 Underrated TV Comedies You Should Binge Now on Netflix (Photos)   Not every comedy can be “Friends” or “Modern Family” or “The Big Bang Theory.” Some flop or just fail to connect with the audience they should have. Luckily, you can catch these TV comedies again on Netflix and other streaming platforms.\n“The Grinder”\nIt was one and done for this Fox comedy starring Rob Lowe as an actor pretending to be a lawyer, but the writing and the performances were smart and funny.\n“Freaks and Geeks”\nOne of the biggest comedy cult shows of all time, this acerbic look at a 1980s high school aired just 12 episodes before NBC pulled the plug. You can catch a very young James Franco and Seth Rogen, among many others.\n“The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret”\nDavid Cross plays an American loser who keeps getting into worse jams with his British employers. Cross – more famous for “Mr. Show” and “Arrested Development” – has said that after three seasons, the show’s over, but it has plenty of hilarious moments.\n“The Bernie Mac Show”\nCreated by Larry Wilmore, this family sitcom on Fox is worth seeing if only for the antics of Bernie Mac , the supremely talented standup comic who died just two years after the show ended in 2006.\n \nRead original story 9 Underrated TV Comedies You Should Binge Now on Netflix (Photos) At TheWrap",

      "text": "Comments Also get new looks at Colleen Wing, Claire Temple, Joy Meachum and Ward Meachum in sneak peeks of the upcoming superhero series. \nNetflix and Marvel Television have released new photos for \" Marvel's Iron Fist \". The photos feature new looks at Danny Rand ( Finn Jones ), Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), Claire Temple ( Rosario Dawson ), Joy Meachum ( Jessica Stroup ) and Ward Meachum (Tom Pelphrey). The first photo shows Danny Rand a.k.a. Iron Fist stepping in to pass some knowledge on some of the students at Colleen's self-defense class. Danny gains the power of the Iron Fist after being lost in the mountains on a family excursion. Another photo shows Colleen laden with training equipment. Colleen is a martial arts instructor and in her comic book incarnation, she is described as one-half of the Daughters of the Dragon vigilante duo with her partner, Misty Knight (Simone Missick on Marvel's \" Luke Cage \"). Another image gives us a look at Claire Temple, the nurse who has appeared on \" Daredevil \" series, \" Marvel's Jessica Jones \" and \"Luke Cage\". Claire will find herself involved in Danny's escapades through Colleen and her self-defense class. The fourth image shows Joy Meachum casually handling Ward Meachum a file. The Meachums were family friends of the Rands, but betrayed Danny's family and left them for dead in the mountains. \"Marvel's Iron Fist\" will follow the story of Danny Rand as he returns to New York City after being missing for fifteen years, trying to reconnect with his past and his family legacy. He fights against the criminal elements corrupting New York City with his mystical abilities to summon the awesome power of the fiery Iron Fist. \"Marvel's Iron Fist\" will premiere on March 17, 2017 on Netflix. \n© AceShowbiz.com",

      "text": "Netflix Introduces Video Previews To Alleviate Your Total Indecisiveness Decisions, decisions! 12/07/2016 06:36 am ET Sara Boboltz Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post \nSince deciding how to spend the next half hour to five days watching Netflix can be rough, the streaming giant launched a new feature on Tuesday to help us out. \nBehold: Video previews. \nPeople spend less than 90 seconds deciding whether they’re into a particular title, according to Netflix. To speed that process along, hovering over a title card will now cause a quick, wordless video preview to appear above to give viewers a sense of a show’s tone and its characters. \nSix years ago when Netflix introduced streaming, the company said that “the technology didn’t exist to allow us to easily show video to members as they browsed through thousands of titles.” (Besides, people were still getting used to the whole “TV on the internet” thing.) \nThere will soon be even more choices, too, as Netflix plans to spend an extra $1 billion in original content in 2017 ― up from $5 billion spent in 2016 ― and 20 unscripted shows. \nWhat a truly great time to be alive. Also on HuffPost: Movies From 2015 That You Can Watch On Netflix Now Movies From 2015 That You Can Watch On Netflix Now 1 11 \"Welcome to Me\" Kristen Wiig submitted a trio of dynamite indie-dramedy roles this year, the first of which was the memorable \"Welcome to Me.\" As directed by Shira Piven, Wiig plays an Oprah obsessive with borderline personality disorder who uses her $86 million in lottery winnings to fund her own narcissistic daytime talk show. The results feel like a long, smart \"SNL\" sketch that will have you in stitches. Share this slide:",

      "text": "Comment Luke Cage 2 might be released in 2019 Screen Rant \nAre you a very avid follower of Marvel’s superhero miniseries over on Netflix? Well, if you are, we are quite sure that you would also have kept tabs on when a particular show is about to be released, and whether your favorite series would gain the nod of approval for yet another season of renewal to keep you entertained while you are on the move. Having said that, here is some good news to kick off the month of December for all you Marvel TV miniseries on Netflix fans out there. For starters, we do know that Luke Cage has recently been confirmed to obtain a renewal for a second season . \nThe Luke Cage Netflix series has garnered plenty of rave reviews since it was shown to the masses not too long ago. In the TV miniseries, Mike Colter plays the role of the nigh indestructible ex-convict who goes about on a crime fighting spree in Harlem, after gaining his newfound superpowers through a botched experiment. Ah well, this goes to show that there is always room for redemption regardless of where one’s situation in life is. The first season started off with a bang, and you could also say that it ended with a bang on a cliffhanger note. Hence, it remains to be seen whether there will be a second season in tow, leaving fans of the TV miniseries on the edge of their seats and biting their nails. Well, all of the fretting and worrying can come to an end now, as there is a new announcement that mentioned how Luke Cage Season 2 has been confirmed, and Harlem’s streets of crime ought to be on the lookout just in case they get busted by Luke Cage while dealing with some illicit drugs or illegal rackets. \nLuke Cage Season 2 should be essential in the development of the overall storyline in the Marvel universe even on the small screen, when there are other Marvel superheroes such as Daredevil , Jessica Jones, and Iron Fist who will make up part of the upcoming The Defenders miniseries over on Netflix. \nHaving said that, the standalone Iron Fist series is touted to debut officially this coming March 17, 2017. The Iron Fist TV miniseries will thrust Finn Jones’ Danny Rand into the limelight. Danny Rand grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth, being the son of a billionaire, but his world came crumbling down after his father was murdered. However, what makes Danny stand apart from other billionaires whose parent(s) have been murdered would be the fact that he has picked up the right to be powered by a mystical fighting force. \nApart from that, here is one more bit of news that will concern Jessica Jones , the TV miniseries that stars Krysten Ritter who plays the role of a young woman. Her superhero career, however, was cut short because of a tragedy on a personal level. It is nice to know that this miniseries has just been introduced on two platforms where you need not download anything at all -- DVD and of course, the higher resolution Blu-ray format. ",

      "text": "Email Getty Images \nIf you've been watching or watched Netflix's The Crown , then you know the royal family is very protective of its reputation and all that—wait for it—the crown represents. \nBut the fascination surrounding the royal family has yet to decrease; in fact, interest has only increased in recent years thanks to the Prince William and Kate Middleton 's royal wedding, as well as the births of their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte . With all eyes on the royal family, it would be impossible not to get into some trouble, which is why royal scandals have become completely unavoidable. \nPerhaps the only part of a scandal that they can try to control, however, is the severity. Photos \nRoyal Scandals: The British and Beyond Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage, Samir Hussein/WireImage \nPrince Harry has been no stranger to royal controversy over the years. He made headlines once again recently after defending girlfriend Meghan Markle in an official statement via the palace. Prior to that, the redheaded royal seemed to turn it all around after having a tumultuous time growing up in the spotlight. \nIn 2005 Prince Harry was famously photographed leaving a Halloween party where he was dressed as a Nazi. Afterwards he released a statement calling the costume a \"poor choice,\" but that didn't stop the controversy from spreading like wildfire. \nYears later in 2012, Prince Harry enjoyed a crazy weekend in Las Vegas, but ended up taking it a little too far when he was photographed naked during a game of strip billiards. Let's just say what happens in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas. Coleman-Rayner \nOf course, Prince Harry isn't the only royal to become embroiled in negative headlines. Before Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge tied the knot, they called it quits for a short period of time. The worldwide reaction, however, couldn't have made the split any easier on either of them. Cruelly dubbed \"Waity Katie,\" Kate later admitted she was devastated by the split, but didn't want to show it, so she maintained an incredibly busy social calendar. \nOne year after Wills and Kate tied the knot, Kate found herself at the center of a photo scandal when publications released topless photos of her . The images of the couple were taken while they were on a balcony of their private residency while on vacation, and they immediately took legal action. Read \n8 Undeniable Style Cues Kate Middleton Took From Princess Diana Anwar Hussein/Getty Images \nThe palace released a statement that called the media's actions \"reminiscent of the worst excesses\" of the paparazzi in Princess Diana 's life. \nWhile Prince Harry, Prince William and Kate have found themselves at the center of royal scandals in recent years, the rest of the family has had its fair share of headlines, too. \nPrince Charles and Princess Di's rocky marriage was filled with controversy as a result of both their extramarital affairs. They ultimately divorced, another no-no in the eyes of the royal family. The controversy grew larger after they divorced and a phone conversation between Prince Charles and now-wife Camilla leaked. Known as tampon-gate, the scandal revealed Charles' and Camilla's dirty sides. \n\"Oh god. I'll just live inside your trousers or something. It would be much easier!\" Charles joked on the phone call. \n\"What are you going to turn into, a pair of knickers?\" said Camilla. \"Oh, you're going to come back as a pair of knickers.\" \n\"Or, God forbid, a Tampax,\" Charles responded. \"Just my luck!\" \nWith all eyes—and ears—on the royals, it's no wonder they can't get away with anything.

      "text": "Email Getty Images \nIf you've been watching or watched Netflix's The Crown , then you know the royal family is very protective of its reputation and all that—wait for it—the crown represents. \nBut the fascination surrounding the royal family has yet to decrease; in fact, interest has only increased in recent years thanks to the Prince William and Kate Middleton 's royal wedding, as well as the births of their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte . With all eyes on the royal family, it would be impossible not to get into some trouble, which is why royal scandals have become completely unavoidable. \nPerhaps the only part of a scandal that they can try to control, however, is the severity. Photos \nRoyal Scandals: The British and Beyond Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage, Samir Hussein/WireImage \nPrince Harry has been no stranger to royal controversy over the years. He made headlines once again recently after defending girlfriend Meghan Markle in an official statement via the palace. Prior to that, the redheaded royal seemed to turn it all around after having a tumultuous time growing up in the spotlight. \nIn 2005 Prince Harry was famously photographed leaving a Halloween party where he was dressed as a Nazi. Afterwards he released a statement calling the costume a \"poor choice,\" but that didn't stop the controversy from spreading like wildfire. \nYears later in 2012, Prince Harry enjoyed a crazy weekend in Las Vegas, but ended up taking it a little too far when he was photographed naked during a game of strip billiards. Let's just say what happens in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas. Coleman-Rayner \nOf course, Prince Harry isn't the only royal to become embroiled in negative headlines. Before Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge tied the knot, they called it quits for a short period of time. The worldwide reaction, however, couldn't have made the split any easier on either of them. Cruelly dubbed \"Waity Katie,\" Kate later admitted she was devastated by the split, but didn't want to show it, so she maintained an incredibly busy social calendar. \nOne year after Wills and Kate tied the knot, Kate found herself at the center of a photo scandal when publications released topless photos of her . The images of the couple were taken while they were on a balcony of their private residency while on vacation, and they immediately took legal action. Read \n8 Undeniable Style Cues Kate Middleton Took From Princess Diana Anwar Hussein/Getty Images \nThe palace released a statement that called the media's actions \"reminiscent of the worst excesses\" of the paparazzi in Princess Diana 's life. \nWhile Prince Harry, Prince William and Kate have found themselves at the center of royal scandals in recent years, the rest of the family has had its fair share of headlines, too. \nPrince Charles and Princess Di's rocky marriage was filled with controversy as a result of both their extramarital affairs. They ultimately divorced, another no-no in the eyes of the royal family. The controversy grew larger after they divorced and a phone conversation between Prince Charles and now-wife Camilla leaked. Known as tampon-gate, the scandal revealed Charles' and Camilla's dirty sides. \n\"Oh god. I'll just live inside your trousers or something. It would be much easier!\" Charles joked on the phone call. \n\"What are you going to turn into, a pair of knickers?\" said Camilla. \"Oh, you're going to come back as a pair of knickers.\" \n\"Or, God forbid, a Tampax,\" Charles responded. \"Just my luck!\" \nWith all eyes—and ears—on the royals, it's no wonder they can't get away with anything.

      "text": "Posted By: Kazem Sedighzadeh   TV Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nThe first half of Season 1 of the American musical drama TV series “The Get Down,” featuring six episodes, has already streamed on Netflix in August. The second half, composed of six episodes, has been reported to be streamed on the streaming giant next year yet. \nThus, it comes as a surprise to many critics when online news sites have been reporting about Season 2 of “The Get Down.” Many of these sites appear to be not aware that “The Get Down” Season 1 had a 12-episode order and only the first six episodes of the TV series has been streamed on Netflix last August. \nSome reports are also saying that “The Get Down” has already been canceled for Season 2 by Netflix, which is also producing the TV series. \nThere are also talks about the second season of “The Get Down” being in jeopardy because of the huge cost of producing the show. But Netflix, later on, stated that it is paying big money for the TV series but it does not intend to cancel it for its sophomore season. \nAn expensive piece of TV \nDuring Netflix’s quarterly earnings call on November 7, company chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirmed that “The Get Down” is indeed an expensive piece of television. \nHe explained however that it is primarily because the TV series is very large scale and cinematic. He also revealed that their new season of content, including “The Get Down” was traveling globally as they really had projected. \nSarandos admits that “The Get Down” may be an issue of expense versus viewership to some but they have found the show to be attractive on a global scale. \nHe explained that Netflix is still seeing how the show is going to unfold for the remainder of its first season. \nThe chief content officer of Netflix added that they are very excited about how the show has been performing, particularly in a quarter where they had four shows that turned out to be kind of big event programs for Netflix. \n$16 million per episode \nEven before Netflix decided to dip its hands into producing “The Get Down,” the streaming service knew that it would be an expensive proposition. \nThe series from Academy Award-winning husband-and-wife team of Baz Luhrmann and Catherine Martin, Pulitzer-winning playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, hip-hop historian Nelson George, and iconic rappers MC Nas and Grandmaster Flash was expected to cost around $11 million per episode for 12 episodes, which all-in would have totaled about $120M. \nBut as it turned out, Netflix is paying more like $16M per episode because inclusive in the total is worldwide rights to the IP, and factored into that are the premiums that Netflix paid to acquire those rights exclusively. \nOther costs include start-up, visual effects, music rights and production design. Of the $16 million, around $11 million was the final production expenses per episode, $3 million-$4 million over the initial budget following a string of filming shutdowns, staffing changes, and script rewrites. \nIn the small screen, when a TV drama is produced for $6M or higher an episode, it is considered expensive. \nSo adding in all the costs on “The Get Down,” including the worldwide rights and premiums, that brings the total for the 12-episode Season 1 closer to the $190M-plus range. \nDespite rumors of cancellation for “The Get Down,” the TV series is currently in production for Season 1B and perhaps for Season 2 as well, which was already confirmed by Baz Luhrmann, reports Game & Guide. \nThere are also reports saying that Season 1B or Season 2 of “The Get Down” shall have a time jump to the 80s during the time of pop icons like Michael Jackson and Prince, notes the Parent Herald. \nWhile there are reports saying that Season 2 of “The Get Down” would air in the spring of next year, it is least likely to happen since Season 1B had to air first in order for Season 2 to get its crack in airing or streaming.

      "text": "Netflix's 'Iron Fist' will look different than most shows Hollywood cinematographer Manuel Billeter hovers over a TV monitor a few feet away from the set of Netflix's upcoming Iron Fist series, looking for small objects in the shot that might catch the camera's eye. After a take, he sends someone over to repaint a metal flap hanging off the side of a wall. Seconds before, protagonist Daniel Rand (played by Finn Jones) jumped over the wall to hide from villains. \nWhile the flap wouldn't need a touch up on most sets, the Iron Fist crew is filming with new high-dynamic range technology. Without the fix, it would have glistened on screen just like if you were standing in front of it in real life, potentially distracting from the action. \nNetflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) is one of the first entertainment companies to take incorporate HDR both on set and in the cutting room. \nThe HDR format allows viewers at home to see shows with richer, brighter colors at a significantly larger contrast than what's possible in high definition or 4K. The lightest pixels in HDR are 40 times brighter than standard definition. \nRelated: This light bulb projects Netflix onto any surface \nMarvel's 'Iron Fist' will come to Netflix in March. Throughout most of the fall, Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) has been filming Iron Fist in New York City -- marking the fourth and final installment of its Marvel series (following Daredevil , Jessica Jones and Luke Cage) . Together, the collection makes up \"The Defenders,\" similar to \"The Avengers\" of film. \nThe latest series, due out in March 2017, follows a young man with a mythical fist capable of enormous strength. \nWorking with HDR \n\"I didn't know too much about HDR before working on Iron Fist , and it's been a learning curve,\" said Billeter, director of photography for Iron Fist . \n\"We've had to look at how Iron Fist will appear in the living rooms of consumers with HDR TV monitors,\" he said. \"For those who don't own one, nothing changes. But the post-production process has been more intensive as we figure out a way to make it look the best in both worlds.\" \nMarvel's Daredevil series on Netflix has been remastered in HDR. \nWhile few consumers currently use HDR-capable TVs, the technology is widely expected to hit the mainstream in the next few years. \nWith this in mind, Billeter has had to change the way he envisions scenes on set, considering everything from cityscapes peeking through windows to the clouds in the sky. \n\"HDR displays everything much brighter than regular standard resolution monitors, and sometimes objects in scenes need to be toned down because they are too harsh,\" Billeter added. \"If you have a car light in a scene with HDR, it really feels like there is a car light in your living room. It's that bright.\" \nFor Iron Fist , shot mostly outside at night, these types of car and street lights were the biggest challenges. \n\"Lights have almost become like characters in HDR,\" he said. \"Sometimes we have to paint things to bring down the highlights.\" \nThe move to embrace HDR follows Netflix's push into 4K several years ago when it was one of the early adopters of the technology. \nBehind the scenes, the camera doesn't do anything different to capture scenes in HDR. The technical adjustments are added later during the post-production process. This means it's best suited -- for now -- for companies like Netflix that have longer lead times for production. \nRelated: Netflix now lets you watch your favorite shows offline \nHDR technology makes colors significantly more bright and crisp compared to standard definition. \"When you don't have to worry about ratings, you can approach it in a slightly slower, more careful and affectionate way,\" said Iron Fis t showrunner Scott Buck. \"You get to tell a story that feels more like a novel, opposed to thinking about what to do today to keep it moving.\" \nBecause Netflix puts out its full series at once, ratings don't factor into the development process. \n\"Series live and die by ratings, but with Netflix, that's not the situation, so it creates a more relaxed atmosphere where everyone is on the same team,\" Buck said. \nRemastering Daredevil \nWhile Iron Fist is among the first Marvel series to film in HDR, Netflix has since reformatted both seasons of Daredevil with the technology, as well as Marco Polo and Chef's Table France . To do so, it worked closely with post-production facility Deluxe, which has already mastered close to 100 titles in HDR. \nTony D'Amore, a colorist at Deluxe's Encore, said each remastered episode preserves the intent of the original. Instead of bringing out the brightness HDR is known for, D'Amore focused on emphasizing details that weren't picked up in standard definition. For example, viewers can now see the specific color of glass in a scene or the details of brick buildings in the background. \nDeluxe is also working with Iron Fist during the post-production stage to adjust colors the team didn't have time to tweak on set. \nTeasing Iron Fist \nWhile Netflix has been mum on plotlines for Iron Fist , Buck teased what to expect from the upcoming series. \n\"I thought his superpowers weren't that impressive when I first learned about the character -- all he could do was punch really hard,\" Buck said. \"But I realized that... his greatest gift is his martial arts skills -- it's something he learned by training day and night throughout his childhood.\" \nActor Finn Jones plays Danny Rand in 'Iron Fist' Buck said the mythical aspect of the fist is something that lingers but isn't fully explored in the first season. \n\"We try to approach Danny Rand as a person to see life through his eyes,\" Buck said. \"As for the fist, it's dealt with in the most realistic way possible.\" \nRather than treat his strength as a magic power, the team sat down with scientists to discuss how someone could potentially have that type of super strength in the real world. \nBuilding on this, Netlix's Allie Goss, vice president of original series, said Iron Fist will be a character-driven story first and a superhero one second. \n\"We don't want to downplay abilities, powers or the fact that these characters are derived out of comics and graphic novels -- that is what is so special about them,\" she said. \"But we wanted to explore characters beyond being superheros because that feels so generic, especially considering how deep they tend to be.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   7, 2016: 8:21 AM ET",

      "text": "The stock market gained ground and was trading at session highs heading into the final hour.\nWhile the Nasdaq and S&p 500 edged higher by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, the Russell 2000, the small-cap index, was the star of the stock market today, reaching record highs, up 1.1%.\nThe Dow Jones industrials treaded water, with Verizon ( VZ ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) leading the blue chip index.\nAmong leading growth stocks , Synchronoss Technologies ( SNCR ) sank 13% after the company said it plans to purchase Intralinks ( IL ) for $13 per share. Synchronoss shares, which had been acting well following its breakout in early November, fell slightly below the 43.75 buy point. The stock may be finding support at its 50-day moving average line.\nNetflix Upgrade; Nike Downgrade Netflix ( NFLX ) continued to outperform today following an analyst upgrade to hold from sell. Although competition in the video streaming arena is increasing, Evercore ISI, the institutional research firm, found that many video offerings have failed to gain meaningful traction.\nKen Sena, the lead analyst, wrote, \"While Netflix's elevated spending levels continue to raise the stakes where valuation is concerned, competitively speaking, Netflix seems to be in a good position.\" Shares gained 4% on the news and the stock continued to build the handle of the large cup with handle base. The streaming content company has found support at its 50-day moving average line several times within its handle, indicating institutional support at those levels.\nAfter leading the market yesterday, Nike ( NKE ) gave back all of its prior gains after being downgraded to market perform from outperform by Cowen and Company. In addition, the analyst company cut the price target to 54 from 59. \"Nike faces potentially peak market share and operating margin in North America as Adidas remains in a robust product cycle while Under Armour ( UA ) expands distribution and categories,\" the analyst team wrote.\nNike shares fell 2.8%; it was the biggest loser on the Dow Jones industrial average today. Prior to the most recent two quarters, earnings had risen an average 24% on a year-over-year basis over seven quarters. However, earnings were flat in the May-ended fiscal fourth quarter and were up just 9% in the most recent three-month period.\nOil Falls; IBD 50 Earnings After The Close Oil prices snapped a four-day winning streak and fell 2% as doubts emerged regarding OPEC's ability to cut production, as data showed crude production rose in most major export regions. The U.S. dollar rebounded after falling substantially yesterday.\nDave and Buster's ( PLAY ) and HealthEquity ( HQY ) report Q3 earnings after the close today. For Dave and Busters, analysts expect earnings per share of 14 cents on revenue of $216.72 million. For HealthyEquity, the company is expected to report EPS of 9 cents on revenue of $43.28 million.",

      "text": "Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) were in rally mode on Tuesday. The stock surged over 4.5% to close at $124.57, with the help of a nice bump in volume. This impressive move extends the stock's rebound off the November lows to 12% and more upside appears likely.\nFor patient investors the pullback from last month's extremely overbought reading may now be over.\nTwo weeks after Netflix' powerful earnings-inspired breakout move the stock entered extremely overbought territory. By late October the stock was in pullback mode as it began to work off some of the 30% rally from the October low. NFLX eventually retraced slightly over 50% of the October range before finding a bottom near $110. This fairly deep pullback allowed the stock to regain its post earnings strength. Since the Nov. 14 low NFLX has been steadily improving.\nTuesday's ramp has left behind a fresh layer of support. In the near term NFLX investors should keep a close eye on the $122.20 to $118.40 area. This key support zone includes the January high and last week's peak near the upper band and this week's low near the lower band. A retest of this area would provide a low-risk entry opportunity. On the upside, once past the October high the stock has room to run.\nClick here to see the below chart in a new window.",

      "text": "Ever since Netflix made binge-watching a common pastime for nearly three-quarters of Americans, the phenomenon has offered ample material for studies that purport to tell us something about ourselves. We are more likely to take in a whole season of Scandal or Breaking Bad in one sitting if we are lonely and depressed . We get hooked on The Killing just two episodes in, but it takes eight to commit to How I Met Your Mother . We’re also at risk for impaired cognitive development and deep vein thrombosis , but we can worry about those as soon as we get through the last episode of Search Party . \nOn Wednesday morning, Netflix released the results of a new study that takes into account the viewing habits of more than 86 million members across 190 countries. For this study, the streaming service looked at what viewers do when they finish binge-watching a show—specifically, how long it takes before they dive into the next one and what they choose to watch in the meantime. \nThe study found that 59 percent of viewers take a pause of around three days before moving from one obsession to the next, and 61 percent of those interim bingers (36 percent of all Netflix members studied) watch a movie before they plunge into the next rabbithole, Snuggie and all. \nThe study also examined the kinds of movies members chose to watch after completing 100 different TV series, identifying several common pairings. After finishing all four seasons of House of Cards , viewers often watched Beasts of No Nation . Bingers of Gilmore Girls went on to watch Sixteen Candles and The Princess Bride . Bloodline was frequently followed up with a serving of Spotlight for dessert. \nMany viewers segued from TV series to documentaries before committing to a new show. Narcos watchers followed up on their interest in drug trafficking with documentaries like Cartel Land and Narco Cultura . Fans of Marvel’s Luke Cage took in 13th , Ava DuVernay’s documentary about race and the American criminal justice system. BoJack Horseman devotees tended to prefer stand-up comedy specials, but a good number of them hunkered down with a motivational speaking superstar in Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru . \nThese TV-movie pairings, several of which are illustrated in the graphic below, may not reveal critical insights about human nature or erase those binge-watching health concerns. But they remind us that even in this Golden Age of Television, there’s still a place for the humble, streaming feature film—if only as a palate cleanser for the next show. \nNetflix Netflix’s binge pairings infographic shows the most popular pairings between shows binge-watched on the streaming service and the movies watched subsequently.

And in analyzing that behavior, Netflix found that instead of simply taking a break from the service altogether, users filled that gap with movies (61%). \nThese movies aren't random, Netflix found. They saw patterns — specific pairings of TV shows and movies. \n\" After watching ' House of Cards ,' some members moved to ' Beasts of No Nation,' swapping politics for war, but keeping a narrative deft with uncompromising and ruthless leaders,\" the company wrote in a blog post. \"'Key West' and 'Boston' may not seem an obvious pair, but stories that unearthed deeply buried secrets took members from the balmy coast of ' Bloodline' to the chilling streets of ' Spotlight .' Vince Gilligan’s cinematic nod to Tarantino in ' Breaking Bad' didn’t go unnoticed with watchers moving on to ' Pulp Fiction' after Mr. White bid his final adieu. Meanwhile, fast talking fans of ' Gilmore Girls' kept their retro references fresh by revisiting classics like ' Dirty Dancing' and ' Sixteen Candles .'\" But perhaps most intriguing was Netflix's realization, from the data, that seeing issues on TV shows can lead people to explore how they manifest in real life. Netflix found that after watching its Pablo Escobar show \"Narcos,\" members tended to watch documentaries \"Cartel Land\" and \"Narco Cultura,\" both about the drug trade. After \"Luke Cage,\" they looked at justice system documentary \"13TH.\" And after \"Black Mirror\"'s future-dystopian horrors, they looked at \"Hot Girls Wanted,\" a documentary about pornography and the internet. In all those cases, they bounced from the fictional depiction of the topic to the documentary exploration. But Netflix viewers don't always look for similar subjects. Netflix said that subscribers broke that mold with comedy, which served as a break from more tense genres like horror.

      "text": "Netflix December 7, 2016 | 06:00AM PT \nNetflix is highlighting its movie lineup with research showing that after many of its streaming subscribers finish binge-watching a TV show, they cleanse their palates with a movie. \nAfter finishing a series, 59% of Netflix members took at least a one-day break with a median gap of 2.5 days, according to the company’s data. During that period, 61% of those members (36% of all Netflix members) watched a standalone title. \nAmong U.S. subs, Netflix identified TV-movie pairings — the films that binge-watchers most frequently turned to after completing a show. Some look logical: “Pretty Little Liars” series viewers turned to “Bring It On” and “Mean Girls,” while “Breaking Bad” bingers flipped on “Full Metal Jacket” and “Pulp Fiction.” \nAnd after binge-watching adult animated series “BoJack Horseman,” some sought a little self-help from “Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru.” \nFor horror series, Netflix found viewers most often turn to comedy before moving to the next nailbiter. For instance, fans of Netflix’s supernatural thriller “Stranger Things” most frequently watched Adam Sandler’s “Big Daddy” and Disney’s “Zootopia” next. And “American Horror Story” bingers traded terror for teen angst with “Mean Girls” (although they also watched psychological horror flick “The Babadook”). \n“In our ongoing effort to make great programming decisions for our members, we found movies play a unique role in their evolving binge-watching routines,” Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said in announcing the findings. \nSarandos, speaking at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference this week, noted that one-third of Netflix viewing on average is movies . But at the same time, he said, the company will continue to shift more of its $6 billion content budget for 2017 into original series, with plans to launch 20 unscripted shows next year. \nNetflix based the analysis on viewing data of more than 86 million members worldwide between January 2016 and October 2016. Members did not have to complete a TV series in a certain amount of time in order to be included in the research. To determine example series and movie pairs, Netflix analyzed more than 100 TV series to identify which movies were paired most frequently per market, but the movie pairings do not equate to viewership numbers. \nHere are the top TV-movie pairings among Netflix’s U.S. subscribers: American Horror Story: Mean Girls, The Babadook Arrow: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny, The Fast and The Furious Bates Motel: Cruel Intentions, Dope Better Call Saul: Reservoir Dogs, The Big Short Black Mirror: Experimenter, Hot Girls Wanted Bloodline: Spotlight, The Machinist BoJack Horseman: St. Vincent, Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru Breaking Bad: Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction Fuller House: Chef, Grease Gilmore Girls: Dirty Dancing, Sixteen Candles Gossip Girl: Breakfast At Tiffany’s, Clueless Grace & Frankie: August: Osage County, Philomena Grey’s Anatomy: American Beauty, Practical Magic House of Cards: Beasts of No Nation, The Usual Suspects How To Get Away With Murder: Cruel Intentions, Lila & Eve Jane the Virgin: Clueless, Palm Trees in the Snow Making A Murderer: Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, The Hunting Ground Marvel’s Daredevil: The Punisher Marvel’s Jessica Jones: Lila & Eve Marvel’s Luke Cage: 13th, Beverly Hills Cop, London Has Fallen Master of None: Aziz Ansari Live at Madison Square Garden, Meet the Patels Narcos: Cartel Land, Narco Cultura Orange Is the New Black: The Big Short, The Fundamentals of Caring Pretty Little Liars: Bring It On, Mean Girls Scream: Goosebumps, Minions Sense8: Pulp Fiction, The Giver Stranger Things: Big Daddy, Zootopia The Ranch: The Do-Over, The Finest Hours The Walking Dead: Saving Private Ryan, The Do-Over Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Pleasantville, The Princess Bride \n-",

      "text": "\nEver since Netflix made binge-watching a common pastime for nearly three-quarters of Americans, the phenomenon has offered ample material for studies that purport to tell us something about ourselves. We are more likely to take in a whole season of Scandal or Breaking Bad in one sitting if we are lonely and depressed . We get hooked on The Killing just two episodes in, but it takes eight to commit to How I Met Your Mother . We’re also at risk for impaired cognitive development and deep vein thrombosis , but we can worry about those as soon as we get through the last episode of Search Party . \n\nOn Wednesday morning, Netflix released the results of a new study that takes into account the viewing habits of more than 86 million members across 190 countries. For this study, the streaming service looked at what viewers do when they finish binge-watching a show—specifically, how long it takes before they dive into the next one and what they choose to watch in the meantime. \nThe study found that 59 percent of viewers take a pause of around three days before moving from one obsession to the next, and 61 percent of those interim bingers (36 percent of all Netflix members studied) watch a movie before they plunge into the next rabbithole, Snuggie and all. \nThe study also examined the kinds of movies members chose to watch after completing 100 different TV series, identifying several common pairings. After finishing all four seasons of House of Cards , viewers often watched Beasts of No Nation . Bingers of Gilmore Girls went on to watch Sixteen Candles and The Princess Bride . Bloodline was frequently followed up with a serving of Spotlight for dessert. \nMany viewers segued from TV series to documentaries before committing to a new show. Narcos watchers followed up on their interest in drug trafficking with documentaries like Cartel Land and Narco Cultura . Fans of Marvel’s Luke Cage took in 13th , Ava DuVernay’s documentary about race and the American criminal justice system. BoJack Horseman devotees tended to prefer stand-up comedy specials, but a good number of them hunkered down with a motivational speaking superstar in Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru . \nThese TV-movie pairings, several of which are illustrated in the graphic below, may not reveal critical insights about human nature or erase those binge-watching health concerns. But they remind us that even in this Golden Age of Television, there’s still a place for the humble, streaming feature film—if only as a palate cleanser for the next show. \nNetflix Netflix’s binge pairings infographic shows the most popular pairings between shows binge-watched on the streaming service and the movies watched subsequently.

There will be up to 1,000 hours of original programming, more than doubleNetflix's current original lineup. \nNetflix plans to spend $6 billion on content next year, up from $5 billion in 2016.

We’re greeted by Lemony Snicket himself (Patrick Warburton) and get a bit more of the storyline in this second version. 'Iron Fist' EP Scott Buck Set To Showrun Marvel's 'The Inhumans' For ABC \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents’ untimely death in a fire. A careless oversight initially places the children in the custody of a distant relative named Count Olaf, a mysterious and devious figure who is seeking fortune by way of stealing their inheritance. After his elaborate plans are foiled and his evil intentions are revealed, Count Olaf ( Neil Patrick Harris ) employs a variety of outlandish disguises to situate himself in the children’s path, causing mayhem for the Baudelaire’s and their subsequent guardians. As the children manage to evade Count Olaf’s scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they pick up clues along the way about their parents’ past. \nThe series is created by Lemony Snicket author Daniel Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld (Pushing Daisies, Men in Black, The Addams Family). Along with Harris, the series also stars Malina Weissman (Violet), Louis Hynes (Klaus), Presley Smith (Sunny), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O’Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty), Don Johnson (Sir) and more. \nThe series premieres January 13 on Netflix worldwide. Check out the trailer and let us know what you think.

      "text": "What do you do after binge watching a series on Netflix?\nAccording to the streaming service, you take a break.\nNetflix has released data on the binging habits of its subscribers and found that 59% of viewers pause for about three days after finishing a series before committing to a new show.\nThat’s right: viewers literally Netflix, then chill.\nThe company analyzed the viewing habits of more than 86 million members across more than 190 countries from January to October 2016.\nAmong those who took a break after finishing up a series, 61% watched a movie.\nWho watched what is pretty telling.\nFor example, a “Narcos” viewer was, after binging on tales of a Colombian drug lord, apt to stream “Pulp Fiction.”\nInto the nostalgia of “Gilmore Girls?” Those viewers often kept that throwback energy going by next watching movies like “Sixteen Candles” or “Dirty Dancing.”\nDocumentaries got some love, too.\nFans of “Luke Cage” moved on to “The 13th,” while “Black Mirror” bingers hopped over to “Hot Girls Wanted.” (Technology is technology, right?)\nAccording to the data Netflix gathered, comedy is a bit of a refuge for viewers.\nAfter indulging in the chills and thrills of series like “Stranger Things” and “American Horror Story,” folks turned to sunnier fare like “Zootopia” and “Mean Girls.”\nAnd Netflix will soon offer more to binge.\nThis week, chief content officer Ted Sarandos told Variety the service will debut 20 unscripted shows — read “reality” — in 2017. There will be up to 1,000 hours of original programming, more than double Netflix’s current original lineup.\nNetflix plans to spend $6 billion on content next year, up from $5 billion in 2016.",

      "text": "NEW YORK– Hollywood cinematographer Manuel Billeter hovers over a TV monitor a few feet away from the set of Netflix’s upcoming Iron Fist series, looking for small objects in the shot that might catch the camera’s eye.\nAfter a take, he sends someone over to repaint a metal flap hanging off the side of a wall. Seconds before, protagonist Daniel Rand (played by Finn Jones) jumped over the wall to hide from villains.\nWhile the flap wouldn’t need a touch up on most sets, the Iron Fist crew is filming with new high-dynamic range technology. Without the fix, it would have glistened on screen just like if you were standing in front of it in real life, potentially distracting from the action.\nNetflix is one of the first entertainment companies to take incorporate HDR both on set and in the cutting room.\nThe HDR format allows viewers at home to see shows with richer, brighter colors at a significantly larger contrast than what’s possible in high definition or 4K. The lightest pixels in HDR are 40 times brighter than standard definition.\nThroughout most of the fall, Netflix has been filming Iron Fist in New York City — marking the fourth and final installment of its Marvel series (following Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage). Together, the collection makes up “The Defenders,” similar to “The Avengers” of film.\nThe latest series, due out in March 2017, follows a young man with a mythical fist capable of enormous strength.\nWorking with HDR \n“I didn’t know too much about HDR before working on Iron Fist, and it’s been a learning curve,” said Billeter, director of photography for Iron Fist.\n“We’ve had to look at how Iron Fist will appear in the living rooms of consumers with HDR TV monitors,” he said. “For those who don’t own one, nothing changes. But the post-production process has been more intensive as we figure out a way to make it look the best in both worlds.”\nWhile few consumers currently use HDR-capable TVs, the technology is widely expected to hit the mainstream in the next few years.\nWith this in mind, Billeter has had to change the way he envisions scenes on set, considering everything from cityscapes peeking through windows to the clouds in the sky.\n“HDR displays everything much brighter than regular standard resolution monitors, and sometimes objects in scenes need to be toned down because they are too harsh,” Billeter added. “If you have a car light in a scene with HDR, it really feels like there is a car light in your living room. It’s that bright.”\nFor Iron Fist, shot mostly outside at night, these types of car and street lights were the biggest challenges.\n“Lights have almost become like characters in HDR,” he said. “Sometimes we have to paint things to bring down the highlights.”\nThe move to embrace HDR follows Netflix’s push into 4K several years ago when it was one of the early adopters of the technology.\nBehind the scenes, the camera doesn’t do anything different to capture scenes in HDR. The technical adjustments are added later during the post-production process. This means it’s best suited — for now — for companies like Netflix that have longer lead times for production.\n“When you don’t have to worry about ratings, you can approach it in a slightly slower, more careful and affectionate way,” said Iron Fist showrunner Scott Buck. “You get to tell a story that feels more like a novel, opposed to thinking about what to do today to keep it moving.”\nBecause Netflix puts out its full series at once, ratings don’t factor into the development process.\n“Series live and die by ratings, but with Netflix, that’s not the situation, so it creates a more relaxed atmosphere where everyone is on the same team,” Buck said.\nRemastering Daredevil\nWhile Iron Fist is among the first Marvel series to film in HDR, Netflix has since reformatted both seasons of Daredevil with the technology, as well as Marco Polo and Chef’s Table France. To do so, it worked closely with post-production facility Deluxe, which has already mastered close to 100 titles in HDR.\nTony D’Amore, a colorist at Deluxe’s Encore, said each remastered episode preserves the intent of the original. Instead of bringing out the brightness HDR is known for, D’Amore focused on emphasizing details that weren’t picked up in standard definition. For example, viewers can now see the specific color of glass in a scene or the details of brick buildings in the background.\nDeluxe is also working with Iron Fist during the post-production stage to adjust colors the team didn’t have time to tweak on set.\nTeasing Iron Fist \nWhile Netflix has been mum on plotlines for Iron Fist, Buck teased what to expect from the upcoming series.\n“I thought his superpowers weren’t that impressive when I first learned about the character — all he could do was punch really hard,” Buck said. “But I realized that… his greatest gift is his martial arts skills — it’s something he learned by training day and night throughout his childhood.”\nBuck said the mythical aspect of the fist is something that lingers but isn’t fully explored in the first season.\n“We try to approach Danny Rand as a person to see life through his eyes,” Buck said. “As for the fist, it’s dealt with in the most realistic way possible.”\nRather than treat his strength as a magic power, the team sat down with scientists to discuss how someone could potentially have that type of super strength in the real world.\nBuilding on this, Netlix’s Allie Goss, vice president of original series, said Iron Fist will be a character-driven story first and a superhero one second.\n“We don’t want to downplay abilities, powers or the fact that these characters are derived out of comics and graphic novels — that is what is so special about them,” she said. “But we wanted to explore characters beyond being superheros because that feels so generic, especially considering how deep they tend to be.”",

Confirmed the movie is in actual fact LEGO Movie despite what it says. Redeemed the coupon on Google's store (was nice it allowed you to pick colours but went with black anyway). Arriving between 12-13th :) Sorry man, I was just checking myself. It did seem to have a bit of a go slow, but I refreshed, logged in and away I went :) I got it in the end, had to go back with the link and then try again. Seems a little bit bugged but all worked out in the end, surprised they gave a Google Shop voucher though instead of sending it out like they've done in the past :o LEGO Movie is also UV btw.",

      "text": "This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Digital Media Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . Netflix is doubling down on its original programming next year, Variety reports . Original programming on the platform should hit 1,000 hours in 2017 — which is a conservative estimate, and more than twice the current amount — as the company works toward its stated goal of having originals account for 50% of its catalog. Netflix's original content strategy is playing out in several spaces. Unscripted shows: Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, emphasized the importance of unscripted shows moving forward, noting that the company is set to debut 20 new unscripted shows in 2017. He's particularly excited about the potential for these kinds of shows to reach wide audiences in different geographies, as touched upon below. Cosmopolitan content: Netflix is focusing on content that can travel internationally, transcending borders and cultures. Sarandos highlighted a new unscripted competition show, the \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" which is produced by Sylvester Stallone and features contestants and commentators from the US, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan. Original movies: The company wants to adapt its approach for creating TV events for the movie universe, and has an eye on creating franchises in the guise of Disney and Marvel films. Netflix has also made moves recently toward the traditional box office , releasing films on the large screen. In total, movies account for about one-third of viewing time on Netflix, Sarandos said. Staying off live: In response to a question about whether Netflix is interested in buying sports rights, Sarandos reiterated that the company isn't currently a platform for live programming. But while he dismissed the notion of bidding for existing league rights, he did raise the possibility of Netflix getting into creating its own sports leagues. Two-way street: Sarandos is wary of getting \"trapped\" into producing every piece of original content in-house, recognizing the merits of partnering with third parties and securing exclusive licenses for existing intellectual property. This collaborative approach helps Netflix secure a breadth of programming on its platform. \nOver the last few years, there’s been much talk about the “death of TV.” However, television is not dying so much as it's evolving: extending beyond the traditional television screen and broadening to include programming from new sources accessed in new ways. \nIt's strikingly evident that more consumers are shifting their media time away from live TV, while opting for services that allow them to watch what they want, when they want. Indeed, we are seeing a migration toward original digital video such as YouTube Originals, SVOD services such as Netflix, and live streaming on social platforms. \nHowever, not all is lost for legacy media companies. Amid this rapidly shifting TV landscape, traditional media companies are making moves across a number of different fronts — trying out new distribution channels, creating new types of programming aimed at a mobile-first audience, and partnering with innovate digital media companies. In addition, cable providers have begun offering alternatives for consumers who may no longer be willing to pay for a full TV package. \nDylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence , has compiled a detailed report on the future of TV that looks at how TV viewer, subscriber, and advertising trends are shifting, and where and what audiences are watching as they turn away from traditional TV. \nHere are some key points from the report: Increased competition from digital services like Netflix and Hulu as well as new hardware to access content are shifting consumers' attention away from live TV programming. Across the board, the numbers for live TV are bad. US adults are watching traditional TV on average 18 minutes fewer per day versus two years ago, a drop of 6%. In keeping with this, cable subscriptions are down, and TV ad revenue is stagnant. People are consuming more media content than ever before, but how they're doing so is changing. Half of US TV households now subscribe to SVOD services, like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and viewing of original digital video content is on the rise. Legacy TV companies are recognizing these shifts and beginning to pivot their business models to keep pace with the changes. They are launching branded apps and sites to move their programming beyond the TV glass, distributing on social platforms to reach massive, young audiences, and forming partnerships with digital media brands to create new content. The TV ad industry is also taking a cue from digital. Programmatic TV ad buying represented just 4% (or $2.5 billion) of US TV ad budgets in 2015 but is expected to grow to 17% ($10 billion) by 2019. Meanwhile, networks are also developing branded TV content, similar to publishers' push into sponsored content. \nIn full, the report: Outlines the shift in consumer viewing habits, specifically the younger generation. Explores the rise of subscription streaming services and the importance of original digital video content. Breaks down ways in which legacy media companies are shifting their content and advertising strategies. And Discusses new technology that will more effectively measure audiences across screens and platforms. \nInterested in getting the full report?

      "text": "View Photo \nNetflix explained why its movie selection has gotten so skimpy No matter what movies Netflix has on its service, subscribers spend about a third of their time watching films on Netflix, according to the company's content boss Ted Sarandos. \nOn Monday at the UBS Gobal Media and Communications conference in New York, Sarandos was asked about the perceived sparseness of Netflix's movie offerings. \"No matter what, we end up with about 1/3 of our watching being movies,\" he responded. \nSarandos cited two contrasting examples: the US and Canada. In Canada, Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, while in the US, it basically has none, with the exception of the just-starting Disney one. And yet in both places, Netflix sees about 1/3 of its viewing being movies. \nResearch earlier this year showed that Netflix's selection of IMDb's 200 highest-rated movies had gone down in the past two years by a substantial amount , as had its total catalogue of movies . And given what Sarandos revealed Monday about the viewing habits of Netflix subscribers, that decision makes total sense. Why would you pay a bunch of money for blockbuster movie deals if it's not going to make people watch more Netflix? The future of movies \nSarandos went on to say that Netflix needs to find a way to really differentiate itself in the movie business. \nIf you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that's not going to create a ton of value, he explained. \"If you were passionate [about the movie], you've already seen it,\" he said. Netflix is \"happy to have\" some of those movies, but the audience isn't particularly passionate (hence the \"1/3 no matter\" what pattern). \nBut there are ways Netflix can elevate its movie strategy. An exception Sarandos pointed to was Disney, which puts out movies people like to watch over and over again, he said. The new Disney deal is a chance for Netflix to shine. He also mentioned Netflix's original film strategy, which is still in its early stages. He said he wanted Netflix to put out original movies people would go to see in theatres, and pointed to the new Will Smith vehicle \"Bright\" as a big test. That's a movie you'll be able to see on Netflix the day it comes out. \nThe bottom line: Netflix still seems to be experimenting with how to make a winning movie strategy that fits the company's goals and bottom line. And if you're a movie buff who has felt like Netflix hasn't exactly been catering to your interests in the past few years, you're not imagining things. \nVisit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

      "text": "print BI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Digital Media Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . Netflix is doubling down on its original programming next year, Variety reports . Original programming on the platform should hit 1,000 hours in 2017 — which is a conservative estimate, and more than twice the current amount — as the company works toward its stated goal of having originals account for 50% of its catalog. Netflix's original content strategy is playing out in several spaces. Unscripted shows: Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, emphasized the importance of unscripted shows moving forward, noting that the company is set to debut 20 new unscripted shows in 2017. He's particularly excited about the potential for these kinds of shows to reach wide audiences in different geographies, as touched upon below. Cosmopolitan content: Netflix is focusing on content that can travel internationally, transcending borders and cultures. Sarandos highlighted a new unscripted competition show, the \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" which is produced by Sylvester Stallone and features contestants and commentators from the US, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan. Original movies: The company wants to adapt its approach for creating TV events for the movie universe, and has an eye on creating franchises in the guise of Disney and Marvel films. Netflix has also made moves recently toward the traditional box office , releasing films on the large screen. In total, movies account for about one-third of viewing time on Netflix, Sarandos said. Staying off live: In response to a question about whether Netflix is interested in buying sports rights, Sarandos reiterated that the company isn't currently a platform for live programming. But while he dismissed the notion of bidding for existing league rights, he did raise the possibility of Netflix getting into creating its own sports leagues. Two-way street: Sarandos is wary of getting \"trapped\" into producing every piece of original content in-house, recognizing the merits of partnering with third parties and securing exclusive licenses for existing intellectual property. This collaborative approach helps Netflix secure a breadth of programming on its platform. \nOver the last few years, there’s been much talk about the “death of TV.” However, television is not dying so much as it's evolving: extending beyond the traditional television screen and broadening to include programming from new sources accessed in new ways. \nIt's strikingly evident that more consumers are shifting their media time away from live TV, while opting for services that allow them to watch what they want, when they want. Indeed, we are seeing a migration toward original digital video such as YouTube Originals, SVOD services such as Netflix, and live streaming on social platforms. \nHowever, not all is lost for legacy media companies. Amid this rapidly shifting TV landscape, traditional media companies are making moves across a number of different fronts — trying out new distribution channels, creating new types of programming aimed at a mobile-first audience, and partnering with innovate digital media companies. In addition, cable providers have begun offering alternatives for consumers who may no longer be willing to pay for a full TV package. \nDylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence , has compiled a detailed report on the future of TV that looks at how TV viewer, subscriber, and advertising trends are shifting, and where and what audiences are watching as they turn away from traditional TV. \nHere are some key points from the report: Increased competition from digital services like Netflix and Hulu as well as new hardware to access content are shifting consumers' attention away from live TV programming. Across the board, the numbers for live TV are bad. US adults are watching traditional TV on average 18 minutes fewer per day versus two years ago, a drop of 6%. In keeping with this, cable subscriptions are down, and TV ad revenue is stagnant. People are consuming more media content than ever before, but how they're doing so is changing. Half of US TV households now subscribe to SVOD services, like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and viewing of original digital video content is on the rise. Legacy TV companies are recognizing these shifts and beginning to pivot their business models to keep pace with the changes. They are launching branded apps and sites to move their programming beyond the TV glass, distributing on social platforms to reach massive, young audiences, and forming partnerships with digital media brands to create new content. The TV ad industry is also taking a cue from digital. Programmatic TV ad buying represented just 4% (or $2.5 billion) of US TV ad budgets in 2015 but is expected to grow to 17% ($10 billion) by 2019. Meanwhile, networks are also developing branded TV content, similar to publishers' push into sponsored content. \nIn full, the report: Outlines the shift in consumer viewing habits, specifically the younger generation. Explores the rise of subscription streaming services and the importance of original digital video content. Breaks down ways in which legacy media companies are shifting their content and advertising strategies. And Discusses new technology that will more effectively measure audiences across screens and platforms. \nInterested in getting the full report?

We've all been there - but now Netflix is finally giving us trailers for ALL its movies and TV shows. At the moment, preview trailers are only available for original content produced by Netflix itself. Related: New on Netflix this week: all the new TV shows available to watch right now But the streaming service has finally decided to give viewers a better idea of what they want to watch and will soon be adding brief previews for every film and series in its catalogue. Watch the cool video they made: The previews won't be your average trailers, though - they're made specifically by Netflix as \"video synopses that help members make faster and more confident decisions by quickly highlighting the story, characters and tone of a title\". If anything, the videos don't sound like they'll be trying to mislead us, at least. Related: New on Netflix this week: all the new movies available to watch right now The previews will currently only be available when you stream Netflix on TV, but gaming consoles, Roku and other devices will have them in the coming weeks. This is yet another helpful tool introduced by Netflix in the last week, as it recently added the long-awaited ability to watch some of its content offline. ",

There will be up to 1,000 hours of original programming, more than double Netflix’s current original lineup. \nNetflix plans to spend $6 billion on content next year, up from $5 billion in 2016. ",

There will be up to 1,000 hours of original programming, more than double Netflix’s current original lineup.\nNetflix plans to spend $6 billion on content next year, up from $5 billion in 2016.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n",

      "text": "Netflix, Marvel Television release new pics for \"Marvel's Iron Fist\" December 7, 2016 - 16:45   Netflix and Marvel Television have released new photos for \"Marvel's Iron Fist\" . The photos feature new looks at Danny Rand (Finn Jones), Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), Joy Meachum (Jessica Stroup) and Ward Meachum (Tom Pelphrey), AceShowbiz said. \nThe first photo shows Danny Rand a.k.a. Iron Fist stepping in to pass some knowledge on some of the students at Colleen's self-defense class. Danny gains the power of the Iron Fist after being lost in the mountains on a family excursion. \nAnother photo shows Colleen laden with training equipment. Colleen is a martial arts instructor and in her comic book incarnation, she is described as one-half of the Daughters of the Dragon vigilante duo with her partner, Misty Knight (Simone Missick on Marvel's \"Luke Cage\"). \nAnother image gives us a look at Claire Temple, the nurse who has appeared on \"Daredevil\" series, \"Marvel's Jessica Jones\" and \"Luke Cage\". Claire will find herself involved in Danny's escapades through Colleen and her self-defense class. \nThe fourth image shows Joy Meachum casually handling Ward Meachum a file. The Meachums were family friends of the Rands, but betrayed Danny's family and left them for dead in the mountains. \n\"Marvel's Iron Fist\" will follow the story of Danny Rand as he returns to New York City after being missing for fifteen years, trying to reconnect with his past and his family legacy. He fights against the criminal elements corrupting New York City with his mystical abilities to summon the awesome power of the fiery Iron Fist. \n\"Marvel's Iron Fist\" will premiere on March 17, 2017 on Netflix.

      "text": "By Dinesh Leave a Comment \nDid you know that Netflix allows users to delete history of movies and shows that they watched from “recently watched” list? This feature was not available for long time, and you have it now. We will be showing you how to delete recently watched shows/movies from history on Netflix. \nAre you a movie buff? Do you love watching blockbuster movies online ? It is not always possible to watch movies when it is released in the theatres. You may be too busy with your personal commitments. Another option is to buy a DVD of your favorite movie. But, what if the DVD stops working when you badly feel like watching the movie again? These things can happen to anytime and it becomes really hard for the crazy movie fan in you. \n\nSometimes, in addition to movies, you may also miss out on watching your favorite TV program due to some busy schedule. You may not get a chance to watch the same program again on TV. Netflix solves all these issues. What is Netflix? \nNetflix is a website that allows you to watch your favorite movie or TV program whenever you wish without spending much from your pocket. Now, that sounds great right. Netflix was founded way back in the late 1990s by two former employees of Pure Software, Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings. Netflix revolutionized the concept of watching movies and Television programs online. By the end of 2015, Netflix had more than 44 million viewers in America alone. The main reason for the popularity of Netflix is that it not only provides fast streaming of movies and videos, but is very cost effective and contains a wide range of movies and videos. \nBy signing up with Netflix, you can watch more than 2200 movies and television programs. Netflix stores information about your viewing history and it makes it easy for you to revisit any of your favorite movies and programs to watch again. But, what if you don’t want your viewing history to be visible? You feel like deleting the history of previously watched movies and programs on Netflix. Till recently, Netflix did not have the option to delete previous history. It is only recently that they have introduced this feature. Let’s see how we can delete the viewing history in Netflix. Simple and Quick way to Delete Recently Watched Shows on Netflix \nIn Netflix, your previously viewed items not only show there in your history, but also in various places in Netflix like “Continuous watching” items. Suggestions will be shown depending on your viewing history. You must double check whether the delete operation is reflected in all the areas mentioned above when the history is cleared. \nThere are actually two ways in which you can delete your Netflix history. Both ways are different from each other. We will first look at the most straight forward method. \nDeleting the Netflix History – For managing your Netflix account, you have to use a web browser. Even if you use Netflix in your Smartphone, it will use a web browser to open Netflix. For removing your history, you need to login to your Netflix account. After logging in, click on the option “Your Account” to view your account settings. From there, scroll down to select “My Profile” option. After that, click on the “Viewing Activity” option. \nIn the “Viewing Activity”, you can see the list of movies and TV programs you have watched till date. You can also see an “X” present on the right side of each entry. When you press on the “X” close icon, it will delete the entry. You need to keep in mind that the list of items displayed there can be long based on your viewing history. If you have been viewing many movies and TV programs , the list will be pretty long, whereas if you are not used to viewing much, then it will be short. Delete Full History in Netflix \nIf you want to remove the complete history of your Netflix, you need to remove all the entries under “Viewing Activity” . Netflix will not ask you for confirmation when removing the entries. That means, you can quickly remove the entries that you don’t wish to see in your profile viewing history. \nNetflix usually takes around 24 hours to update the changes in all devices. In most cases, you can see that the entries are removed immediately. \nReplacing your existing profile- Another way of removing your viewing history is by replacing your existing profile in Netflix. It may sound a little confusing, but actually the process is not that difficult. For this, you need to login to your Netflix account. Now, hover over your profile image and click on the option “Manage profiles”. \nYou can now add a new profile by clicking on the option “Add Profile”. Make sure you give a completely new name to your profile. \nOnce you are done with creating a new profile, go and delete your old profile. For deleting your old profile, go to “Manage Profiles”, click on the option “Edit” that is displayed next to the old profile name and now delete the profile. \nIt will ask for confirmation whether you want to delete the profile or not. Press on “Delete Profile” button again to delete the profile permanently. \nThis way your entire profile history will be deleted and you will have a new profile for using Netflix. Both the options given are easy and will help you avoid the embarrassment of someone seeing your viewing history in Netflix. Another benefit of removing your viewing history from Netflix is that it will stop showing recommendations. That means you can find the latest updates in your page rather than the recommendations given by Netflix. Control Your Kids on Netflix \nMany parents also choose to have multiple profiles. So, when your kid logs in to your account, he will have a separate profile. In this way, you can make sure kids do not get access to see what parents have viewed. \nFor creating multiple profiles, you first need to login to your Netflix account and then click on the option “Add Profile”. If you are going to create profile for your kid, make sure you check the option “ This profile is for kids under 12” when you create the profile. This option will restrict the content your kids can access in Netflix. Many parents choose this option as it is safe and can avoid your children from misusing Netflix. \nWith the option to delete your viewing history, Netflix just added another feather to their cap. So, sign in for a Netflix account and watch all your favorite movies again and again whenever you feel like! Around the World!

      "text": "Netflix knows *exactly* what you should watch next after a big television binge — a movie You’ve been there before, and you know you’ll be there again: You’ve just finished an epic binge — whether it be one season of a TV show…or six — and now you’re trying to figure out what you should watch next on Netfix .\nConsidering there are more shows to watch than there are hours of the day, picking your next great binge can be hard, which is why you should always take your time in deciding. Take a breath, take a step back, and maybe do a little binge-cleanse. Actually, that’s what many of us do once we’ve finished a TV show. We don’t jump right into another show — instead, many of us watch a movie.\nIn a brand new survey from Netflix, they discovered that roughly 30 million of their subscribers around the world finish a TV show, and instead of starting a new show immediately, switch things up and watch a movie. “In our ongoing effort to make great programming decisions for our members we found movies play a unique role in their evolving binge watching routines,” Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix explained in a press release . “It’s interesting to see a third of our members adopt this pattern and the movies those 30 million go on to pair with series, but what I find most compelling is how consistently our members expand the role movies play in their lives on Netflix.” The numbers break down to this: Following a binge, 59% usually wait three days before starting a new show. From there, a whopping 61% will watch a movie during that three day break “to keep the binge feeling alive,” and we like the sound of that.\nNot only that, but Netflix has figured out our favorite ~binge pairings~. Like how great wine and delicious cheese go together, certain TV shows are just craving a movie counterpart for them. All of us who watched Gilmore Girls over Thanksgiving weekend were stalled in nostalgia, and turned to movies like Dirty Dancing and Sixteen Candles . There’s a trend in people finishing Breaking Bad and immediately watching Pulp Fiction , too.\nSo what are some great TV and movie binge pairings to watch now? Our friends over at Netflix were nice enough to draft up a perfect pairings chart for our viewing pleasure, based on some of our favorite Netflix originals. You’re going to want to jot this down: Netflix Suddenly, our viewing habits make so much sense. When you finish something epic like Jessica Jones , you don’t necessarily want to switch over to Kimmy Schmidt , let alone something like House of Cards ! When you’re feeling the vibe from a powerful, kickass lady (not that Kimmy and Claire are not powerful, kickass ladies) you want to keep that alive for as long as possible.\nNetflix TV + Netflix Movies = PERFECTION. Netflix Oh Netflix, always one step ahead of knowing EXACTLY what we want out of life (and television). Thanks for always looking out for us xoxo.

      "text": "\n(Carin Baer/AMC; Linda R. Chen) Posted December 7 2016 — 1:19 PM EST See also Netflix now offering downloads so you can watch on the go \nCompleting a long binge of a TV show prompts many feelings, including accomplishment, sadness, exhaustion, and, according to a new study from Netflix, the need to take a break and watch a movie. \nWhile the streaming service still isn’t releasing ratings for their shows, they have compiled an interesting list of statistics related to viewers’ binging habits. Netflix’s research has found that upon completing a binge of a TV show, more than 30 million viewers choose to watch a movie before jumping into a new series. \nThe study finds that 59 percent of users will wait at least three days before starting another binge, with 61 percent of those viewers watching a film during that period. Even more interesting than those numbers is what people are watching. In the chart below, Netflix reveals the most common movies that bingers of specific shows turn to upon completion. Image Credit: Netflix \nNetflix points out that many of their customers seem to gravitate to a similar genre or subject matter, such as the transition from Gilmore Girls to The Princess Bride . But the noticeable exception in the equation is comedy, which explains Stranger Things viewers wanting to take a break from horror with the light-hearted animated world of Zootopia . (Still no explanation on why viewers go from Walter White and Jesse Pinkman to Adam Sandler and David Spade in The Do-Over .) \n“It’s interesting that in this golden age of television, movies are consistently in demand on Netflix,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content office. “What we’ve come to figure out is that movies are really an important part of people’s viewing routines and complementary to the way they watch and enjoy TV.” \nTo determine these numbers, Netflix analyzed the viewing habits of more than 86 million members from across the world over the course of 2016. Even though the majority of the series in the chart are Netflix originals, the streaming service said it examined the data from over 100 series to determine the most common pairings. ",

      "text": "View Comments Print By Ken Shepherd - The Washington Times - Wednesday, December 7, 2016 \nNumber crunchers at Netflix reviewed their user data for all but November of this year and found that nearly 6 in 10 TV-show binge-viewers take a breather before devouring another TV series on the streaming-video service. \n“After finishing a series, 59% of Netflix members took at least a one-day break with a median gap of 2.5 days, according to the company’s data,” Variety magazine reported Wednesday . “During that period, 61% of those members (36% of all Netflix members) watched a standalone title.” \nResearchers found other interesting patterns, Variety noted, such as how horror-series bingers often turn to tickling their funny bone after feasting on fright. \n“For instance, fans of Netflix’s supernatural thriller ‘Stranger Things’ most frequently next watched much lighter fare: Adam Sandler’s ‘Big Daddy’ and Disney’s ‘Zootopia,’” the Hollywood trade magazine said. \nAccording to Variety, the Netflix findings are based on a review of data from 86 million members around the world who watched programming via the service online between January 2016 and October 2016.",

      "text": "Netflix knows *exactly* what you should watch next after a big television binge — a movie Rachel Paige More You’ve been there before, and you know you’ll be there again: You’ve just finished an epic binge — whether it be one season of a TV show…or six — and now you’re trying to figure out what you should watch next on Netfix . Considering there are more shows to watch than there are hours of the day, picking your next great binge can be hard, which is why you should always take your time in deciding. Take a breath, take a step back, and maybe do a little binge-cleanse. Actually, that’s what many of us do once we’ve finished a TV show. We don’t jump right into another show — instead, many of us watch a movie. In a brand new survey from Netflix, they discovered that roughly 30 million of their subscribers around the world finish a TV show, and instead of starting a new show immediately, switch things up and watch a movie. “In our ongoing effort to make great programming decisions for our members we found movies play a unique role in their evolving binge watching routines,” Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, Netflix explained in a press release . “It’s interesting to see a third of our members adopt this pattern and the movies those 30 million go on to pair with series, but what I find most compelling is how consistently our members expand the role movies play in their lives on Netflix.” The numbers break down to this: Following a binge, 59% usually wait three days before starting a new show. From there, a whopping 61% will watch a movie during that three day break “to keep the binge feeling alive,” and we like the sound of that. Not only that, but Netflix has figured out our favorite ~binge pairings~. Like how great wine and delicious cheese go together, certain TV shows are just craving a movie counterpart for them. All of us who watched Gilmore Girls over Thanksgiving weekend were stalled in nostalgia, and turned to movies like Dirty Dancing and Sixteen Candles . There’s a trend in people finishing Breaking Bad and immediately watching Pulp Fiction , too. So what are some great TV and movie binge pairings to watch now? Our friends over at Netflix were nice enough to draft up a perfect pairings chart for our viewing pleasure, based on some of our favorite Netflix originals. You’re going to want to jot this down: More Suddenly, our viewing habits make so much sense. When you finish something epic like Jessica Jones , you don’t necessarily want to switch over to Kimmy Schmidt , let alone something like House of Cards ! When you’re feeling the vibe from a powerful, kickass lady (not that Kimmy and Claire are not powerful, kickass ladies) you want to keep that alive for as long as possible. Netflix TV + Netflix Movies = PERFECTION. More Oh Netflix, always one step ahead of knowing EXACTLY what we want out of life (and television). Thanks for always looking out for us xoxo.",

      "text": "Search Go! Netflix Just Introduced A New Feature That Should Make It So Much Easier To Decide On What To Watch Today at 3:00 pm Share Tweet \nNetflix is great, but one of the worst thing about the service is that it's nearly impossible to actually decide what movie or TV show you want to watch, meaning a bunch of wasted time just reading titles and a short description. \nToss that out the window, though, because it's 2016 and Netflix just upped their game. \nAccording to CNET , the streaming, on-demand service will now introduce custom, 15- to 30-second previews for every title in its catalogue, meaning you'll have a little glimpse of what you may want to watch. \nThis video helps explain things a little better. \n\nHere are more details about the news. \nThe changes are all about convenience for busy consumers in a world with a dizzying array of entertainment options and online distractions. \n\"What we are trying to do is live within your attention budget and find you something great to watch in that budget,\" said Chris Jaffe, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, in an interview with CNET. \nEvery show in Netflix's catalog will feature a video preview that's been manually curated to intrigue viewers. Instead of showing a specific clip from the show or movie, the video is designed as a mini reveal to introduce the story and characters. \nIt's not the first time Netflix's TV interface has shown video previews. The streaming service has been using the top half of its user interface for trailers, hiding it when people start to browse through its catalog. Now it will retain the space for video previews. \nFor those worried about higher bandwidth consumption, beware that Netflix says the feature can't be turned off. However, the preview system also uses the same adaptive streaming technology as Netflix's usual videos, which increases the resolution of the video as it plays, so that could help. \nIn addition, the change means users will have fewer rows to browse through compared to the old design, but that could be helpful in deciding what to watch. \nThe announcement of the new feature comes about a week after Netflix released the news that users will be able to download their favorite content, rather than only rely on a wi-fi signal. \nAvailable immediately on PS4, Xbox One and Roku, the changes will take effect on Xbox 360, smart TVs and other devices in the coming weeks, per CNET. \nThis is big news—even if you'll now be even more distracted from actually choosing what you want to watch.",

      "title": "Coming Distractions: Relive One Day At A Time with the Netflix reboot trailer",
      "text": "Share Tweet \nOf Norman Lear’s classic sitcoms, One Day At A Time is arguably one of his least revered. That makes it ripe for reinvention, and the Netflix remake appears similar only in the sense that it’s about a single mother raising two children. And even that premise has been altered: In the original the kids were two girls; Here, Justina Machado’s Penelope has a daughter (Isabella Gomez) and a son (Marcel Ruiz). \nThe new version focuses on a Cuban-American family led by Penelope, a nurse and a veteran. That latter title adds a layer of drama to the first trailer, which otherwise is filled with lighthearted familial conflicts and an ”Unbreak My Heart” singalong. ”I went to war, I got hurt, and when I came back there was an organization set up to help me and other veterans get the help we need,” Penelope says in the footage. But that seriousness is not to discount the many goofy multicam moments here. After all, there’s the legendary Rita Moreno in the role of Penelope’s mother, making a big entrance. One Day At A Time premieres January 6.",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nNetflix has released a second trailer for its upcoming adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events . The series is set to star Neil Patrick Harris as the villainous Count Olaf, and Patrick Warburton as the titular author and narrator Snicket.\nA Series of Unfortunate Events tells the story of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, three children who are forced to resist Count Olaf’s attempts to steal their family fortune after the untimely death of their parents. Over the course of 13 novels, the orphans delve into a mystery that links their family with Olaf.\n“If you are interested in stories with happy endings, that story is streaming elsewhere,” Snicket states at the beginning of the trailer. “I would advise all our viewers to watch something more pleasant instead.”\nMore: How to download Netflix movies and TV shows to your phone or tablet\nWarburton’s presence in the trailer seems to confirm that we’ll actually see Snicket on screen in this adaptation, whereas in the 2004 film, Jude Law’s performance as the character was limited to spoken narration. The new footage also confirms exactly which books from the series will be covered in the first season of the Netflix show.\nIt stands to reason that the first novel, The Bad Beginning , will be adapted for the show, given that it introduces the Baudelaire children and their nemesis Count Olaf. However, we also see Olaf’s Stephano disguise from The Reptile Room , Aunt Josephine from The Wide Window , and the mill from The Miserable Mill .\nEach book will seemingly be adapted across two episodes of the show. This might seem like cause for concern, but given that each novel clocks in at around 200 pages, there should be plenty of time to do these stories justice in this format.\nAll eight episodes of the first season of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events will be available on Netflix from January 13, 2017.\nNeil Patrick Harris is ‘awful’ in Netflix’s new ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ teaser Don’t be dissuaded: Watch ‘Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events’ teaser",

      "title": "10 meme themes of 2016",
      "text": "In 2015, the internet gave birth to \"Netflix and Chill\" and the revelation that any misfortune – no matter how minute – calls for a healthy dose of Michael Jordan tears .\nMemes continued to reign supreme in 2016, but with a somewhat newsier twist. After all, it’s not every year America sees a presidential election, the Olympics and a \"Gilmore Girls\" remake.\nHere are 10 of the biggest meme themes of the year. #NeverForget.\nPolitics as usual. The World Wide Web sees some of its brightest and darkest moments during presidential election years (R.I.P., legitimate news), but you can’t argue that they don't make for great meme-age. Between Trump’s hair and Hillary Clinton ’s inbox, political memes were ripe for the picking.\nMore specifically, Joe Biden. America’s “uncle-in-chief” – as the interwebs dubbed him – was arguably the biggest thing to happen to memes since Drake's “Hotline Bling” music video. As the election progressed, Biden memes came in hot, painting him as Obama’s fun-loving, practical jokester BFF (complete with friendship bracelets ).\nAnimals that look like food. Who knew that a piece of fried chicken could look so much like a labradoodle puppy? Or that sloths so closely resemble croissants? Or that the Chihuahua-blueberry muffin likeness is uncanny. Who cares, the world is a better place for it.\nLethargy. When the current meme generation is old and gray, they’ll look back fondly on 2016 as the year they decided to stay at home, binge watch Netflix, hibernate and generally be as antisocial as possible. The \"Gilmore Girls\" reboot surely did not help this year's social scene.\nHarambe. First the internet was furious about the Cincinnati Zoo’s decision to shoot Harambe — a 17-year-old male gorilla — after a boy fell into his enclosure. Then they spent a few days calling for the boy’s mother to be arrested and charged with child endangerment. And on the seventh day, they made memes.\nEvil Kermit. Originating from the 2014 “Muppets Most Wanted” film, Evil Kermit is 2016’s version of having a devil on one shoulder, an angel on the other. The formula follows your standard internal struggle, except with more dogs and shopping.\nMichael Phelps. McKayla Malone's “unimpressed” smirk is so 2012. While Michael Phelps listened to Future and unleashed the death stare to end all death stares at the Summer Olympics, America watched on in horror … and then promptly turned him into a meme.\nStock art. While perhaps most relevant to anyone who works with stock art on a daily basis, everyone can get a chuckle out of a sarcastic caption pasted below an impossibly clean-cut guy at a desk. Most stock art memes target job interviews, hating your job, quitting your job or being generally jobless.\nDogs acting like people. Animal memes have stood the test of time, and 2016 brought a playful new approach: Animals acting like people. Or dressed like people. Or glaring at their people.\n2016. Memes mocking the sheer ridiculousness of 2016 (mostly election-related, if we're being honest) is the internet's way of laughing at itself. Here's to the madness that was this year and the many memes that got us through. R.I.P., 2016.\n ",

Newly-single mother and military veteran Penelope ( Justina Machado ) contends with the trials and tribulations of raising her two children — Elena (Isabella Gomez) and Alex (Marcel Ruiz) with the help of her old-school mother (Rita Moreno) and building manager (Todd Grinnell). Watch a trailer for the series below. \nThe series is executive produced by Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce. Kellett previously worked as a writer and producer on the CW series “iZombie,” the long-running CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” and “Rules of Engagement.” Royce has served as a writer and producer on “Everybody Loves Raymond,”“Men of a Certain Age” and “Enlisted.” They will both serve as co-showrunners alongside Lear. \nREAD MORE: Netflix Reboots Post-Divorce Family Sitcom ‘One Day At A Time’ With Rita Moreno-Led Latino Cast \nThe entire first season of “One Day at a Time” will premiere on Netflix on Friday, January 6.",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nThose of us who came out for the Iron Fist panel at New York Comic Con earlier this year received a deeper look at Marvel and Netflix’s new series about mystical martial artist Danny Rand, but more new looks are slowly making themselves known to the public. While there’s still a lack of new footage, Marvel debuted a batch of images, showing Game of Thrones actor Finn Jones as the titular Defender , Rosario Dawson ’s return as Claire Temple, Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, and Jessica Stroup and Tom Pelphrey as Joy and Ward Meachum. \nThe basic gist of Iron Fist is that Danny comes home to New York after years of his presumed death. He looks like a hippy dippy vagabond, complete with bare feet and a first-generation iPod, but he’s packing a serious punch. In his absence, his family company, Rand Enterprises, has been taken over. \nIn the four photos, Danny teams up with Colleen and Claire for a good old-fashioned stakeout, Joy and Ward handles business at the company, and Colleen spots Danny flaunting his skills in her dojo. The end of Luke Cage featured a small but noticeable teaser for Iron Fist : Claire pulled a paper tab off of a flyer promoting the dojo, and the actress later confirmed at NYCC that she’ll be kicking more ass in this latest installation for Netflix’s Marvel series. \nThe characters of Danny, Colleen, and Claire are all officially confirmed to return for The Defenders , the eight-episode Avengers -style miniseries about a team-up of the heroes from New York City. In addition to Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage, other supporting characters — including Elektra , Trish Walker, Stick , and Matt Murdock’s law buddies — will appear. Iron Fist will debut its first season on March 17th, while The Defenders is filming now for a projected release in the second half of the year. \nSee photos from Iron Fist below: Related Content",
