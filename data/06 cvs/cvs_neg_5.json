      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart,... No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target November 22, 2016 0 Aloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker. \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe’s three chemical markers – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.” \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.” \nThough it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,” attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. \n“What you have there is not aloe,” said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.” \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren’t new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group’s executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n“Aloe is all harvested by hand,” Barrie said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.” \nThere’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, “there’s nothing to hang your hat on” in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n“There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,” said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n“I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.” \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg · Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux \n{ Matzav.com }",

That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "\nScan your CVS ExtraCare card at the Coupon Center, usually located at the front of the store, each week to get CVS store coupons that can be stacked with manufacturer coupons for CUCKOO deals! Be sure to scan multiple times to make sure you’re getting all the coupons you’re eligible for until the machine says “Hey Super Scanner! You’ve printed all your coupons”. Some coupons are randomly given, some are based on shopping habits and some coupons are given to everyone! CVS resets the personalized coupons on Monday mornings, so that is usually the best time to scan to get the widest variety of coupons. You can also access your coupons from your CVS account online and the CVS app!\nThe coupons can only be used once, whether printed from the Coupon Center or your online account or redeemed from the app–they are the same coupon. Read about how you can load them to your ExtraCare card or print them from your computer !

      "text": "on Tuesday November 22, 2016 @04:00PM from the truth-is-now-out dept. From a Bloomberg report: The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. Samples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests . The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice -- another name for aloe vera -- as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. There's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. \"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. Aloe's three chemical markers -- acemannan, malic acid and glucose -- were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two.",

A $250,000 arrest warrant also has been issued for him in DuPage County, where prosecutors say he is charged with armed robbery with a weapon.\nJanine Gurgone, 32, of the 3600 block of Pulaski in Chicago, also is charged with armed robbery in the Nov. 15 holdup of the CVS Pharmacy at 1299 E. Ogden Ave. A $25,000 arrest warrant also was issued for her late Monday.\nPolice say the pair threatened store employees with the needle and stole several medications.\nPaul Darrah, spokesman for DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin, said he expects Malhotra to eventually be brought to DuPage County to face charges. Officials were unable to confirm whether Gurgone was in custody Tuesday afternoon.\nThrough the investigation into the robbery in Chicago, Chicago police discovered that he matched the description of a similar armed robbery that happened in Niles Nov. 14 at a CVS store on the 9600 block of Milwaukee Avenue and the Naperville robbery.\n\"Those are our suspects,\" Naperville police Cmdr. Jason Arres said Tuesday. \"A collaboration of great police work between Chicago, Niles and Naperville led the identification of these two.\"\nRelated Article\nNiles robbery suspect could be linked to Naperville case, police say Related Article\nPolice: Robbers said they had needle with HIV Get articles sent to your inbox.

      "text": "Aloe products at Walmart, CVS and Target may not include any aloe vera, study says Aloe products at Walmart, CVS and Target may not have any aloe A study found that there were no markers of actual aloe vera plants in several store-brand aloe products, including one at CVS. (CVS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:   6:01 PM \nStore-brand aloe vera gels at CVS, Target and Walmart contain no evidence of any actual aloe vera, according to a study. \nThree main chemical markers of the succulent known for its supposed soothing properties were absent from the stores' products, according to tests commissioned by Bloomberg News . \nThe study found a cheaper chemical used to imitate aloe, maltodextrin, despite the fact that the CVS, Target and Walmart products all say they contain aloe barbadensis material as their first or second ingredient. \nWalgreen’s brand aloe vera gel was found to have one of the chemical markers of authentic aloe vera. \nChipotle customers sue because burritos had too many calories \nNone of the products tested were on the list of certified products from the International Aloe Science Council, which aims to create standards for the more than $100 million aloe industry. \nIndependent company ConsumerLab published a report last year that only 50% of aloe products contained the expected levels of aloe. \nTarget was accused of selling aloe products without aloe in a class action lawsuit earlier this year, and did not comment on the Bloomberg report. Chemicals from the aloe vera plant are used in many skin products. (MarsBars/Getty Images) \nThe Florida-based company behind CVS’s product did not answer questions about where they get their aloe, though CVS said that it was in \"ongoing contact\" with it. \nMissouri gun seller makes landmark $2 million settlement \nWalmart and Walgreens said they trusted their manufacturer, Texas-based Fruit of the Earth. \nThe company told Bloomberg that it stood by its products, which come from a company that says it farms aloe in Guatemala, and did not respond to a request from the Daily News about how exactly its gels are made. \nFruit of the Earth’s general counsel John Dondrea told CBS that the company’s own tests found the chemical marker acemannan, which was missing in the Bloomberg test. \nSupplier Concentrated Aloe Corp. said that it disputed the tests validity and said that the process behind making the gel could remove the essential chemical even if it was present at the beginning.

      "text": "Aloe vera (photo by Olga Berrios via Flickr ) No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target By Lydia Mulvany and Zeke Faux • Bloomberg 10 hrs ago \nAloe vera (photo by Olga Berrios via Flickr ) \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Walmart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, N.Y.-based ConsumerLab.com , which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Fla.-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,\" John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.\" \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,\" Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.\" \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Ore., which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Fla.-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,\" attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Md., which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,\" said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.\"",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Published November 22. 2016 10:37AM Lydia Mulvany and Zeke Faux, Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, N.Y.-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Fla.-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Ore., which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Fla.-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, N.H.-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, or about 2.2 pounds, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 882 pounds of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Md. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"",

      "text": "That May Not Be Aloe Vera You're Applying, Report Says Products sold at Walmart, CVS and Target were found to contain a sugar instead. 11/22/2016 06:39 pm ET Nina Golgowski Trends reporter, The Huffington Post Walmart CVS Target Testing on store-brand aloe vera products sold at (from left) Walmart, CVS and Target found no evidence of aloe, according to a new report. \nFirst, there were reports of wood pulp in grated cheese. And now, this. \nA new Bloomberg News report raises doubts about store-brand aloe vera after tests it commissioned on products bought at Walmart, CVS and Target reportedly found no trace of their claimed prime ingredient ― aloe barbadensis leaf juice. \nInstead, the products were said to have contained cheaper maltodextrin , a sugar used as a food additive that Bloomberg said can imitate aloe. \nThree gels identified as failing Bloomberg’s tests are Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera. kaanates via Getty Images Aloe offers a wealth of health benefits, with it containing vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes and fatty acids, and minerals. \nWalgreens’ Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel was reportedly found to contain one of aloe’s three chemical makers, malic acid. Acemannan and glucose were not found, which Bloomberg said means the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. \nThe report comes months after a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Texas-based company that manufactures aloe products for Walgreens, Walmart and Target. That company, Fruit of the Earth, responded to Bloomberg’s article by calling it utterly false. \nThe company argued in a statement to The Huffington Post that acemannan doesn’t equate to aloe, but said its tests nevertheless show Fruit of the Earth products do contain the chemical maker. The company said it would share its test results in the class-action litigation. \n“The true test of whether the product contains aloe is to trace the aloe ingredient from the aloe leaves, through processing, and to the manufacturer’s use of the aloe ingredient in the finished product,” the company said. \nAs for the presence of maltodextrin, Fruit of the Earth said a production step “uses maltodextrin to aid in the spray drying process.” \nWalmart and CVS appear to be taking their supplier’s word. A Walmart spokesman said in an email to HuffPost that the retailer would continue to sell the product. A spokeswoman for Target declined comment, citing the litigation. \nAloe vera, which contains vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes, fatty acids and minerals, has a range of health benefits. Acemannan has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and appears to promote cell growth, studies have shown.

      "title": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target",
      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News . The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nAloe plant Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee An aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\nAn aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\n(Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee) The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.''\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.''\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nALOE Daniel Acker / Bloomberg Aloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\nAloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\n(Daniel Acker / Bloomberg) The CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.''\nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"\n CVS Health Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Scam alert: There may be no aloe in the aloe vera sold at 23,000 Wal-Mart, CVS, Target stores By \nMany people are familiar with aloe vera gel and keep it on hand in their home or take it on vacation for relief when they get sunburns. \nBefore you go run and buy some aloe vera gel to soothe your sunburn, think twice. \nAccording to Bloomberg , if you purchase aloe vera gel from one of the nation’s top retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target or CVS, you may be missing out on actual aloe! \nThe products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice (another name for aloe vera) as either the number 1 or 2 ingredient… but none of them actually contained this product. The lab hired by Bloomberg tested 4 gels: Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. \nThe four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nAloe’s three chemical markers are acemannan, malic acid and glucose. \nAll 3 of these chemical markers were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products. \nThese three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin , which is a sugar used to imitate aloe. Bloomburg reported: \nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. No regulation by the FDA \nIt is pretty scary to know that no cosmetics need to be approved by the FDA . \nIt’s also a shame that companies have no punishment for selling fake products to consumers. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nConsumers have already taken note of this aloe vera controversy and several law firms have filed lawsuits against the four retailers. \nThey’re all seeking class-action status and restitution for customers who they claim were misled. \nAttorney’s wrote: \nNo reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. Alternative to store bought aloe vera gel? Get it from the plant! \nIf you are looking to soothe a burn and typically relied on aloe gel, there is always the natural alternative… Using the gel from the plant itself! \nYou can keep an aloe plant in your home and simply cut a piece off and apply directly to your burn or skin condition. \nThis way, you are getting the real aloe to heal your skin, not some fake product filled with countless chemicals.

By Mike Westerdal CPT \nI bet you can’t guess which muscle in your body is the #1 muscle that eliminates joint and back pain, anxiety and looking fat. \nThis “ hidden survival muscle ” in your body will boost your energy levels, immune system, sexual function, strength and athletic performance when unlocked. \nIf this “hidden” most powerful primal muscle is healthy, we are healthy. \nIs it… \nTo begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email. \nHowever I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it. \nImagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe... \n...suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells. \nShockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most : \n64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health. \nIt's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry. \nBut here's the worst part: \nFor most, this bodyfat has become \"calorie-resistant\": \nIt's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises. \nThis zombie fat is essentially... \"dead tissue\". \nThat's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose... \nAND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called \"pocket obesity\"... \n...unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like: \njust above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face. \nHowever, there's good news: \nObesity researchers have now discovered a \"metabolic jumper cable\": \nIt jolts dead bodyfat back to life. \nThis allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body. \nFirst though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant: \nIt lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects: Not enough oxygen or nutrients reach fat cells, so they become unresponsive.. Released fat can't be sent to other tissues to be burned, so fat cells suck it back in... 3) Metabolic hormones carrying the \"burn calories\" message don't reach the fat cell... \nAll this means one thing: \nYour body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat! \nYou become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate. \nUpdate: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed... \nThe discovery of this \"metabolic jumper cable\" can now reverse this process: It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt.... It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in... It shuttles fat to your brain, heart, lungs, kidneys - even your bones - to be burned as energy. \nNot only do those layers of \"zombie fat\" start coming off, but your entire body just works better. \nPlus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away. \nThis \"metabolic jumper cable\" isn't any exercise, machine or pill. \nIt's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive. \nIt's not thyroid , leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, HGH or any other \"fat loss\" hormone you may know. \nAnd on this next page , you'll find out precisely how to unleash its calorie-burning power: \nHow to Activate Your #1 \"Bodyfat-Eating\" Hormone \nPS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%. Here's more of the scientific proof... By Jonathan Richard, WMHB Staff Writer \nIn April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases. \nSee, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. Cancer claims another 584,000...stroke 130,000...Alzheimer's disease nearly 85,000 — and the list goes on. \nTruth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it. \nFortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by \"turning off\" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that. \nIf you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating condition-and you\"re not sure what the culprit is-now's the time to find out...while you can still do something about it! By Lisa D, WMHB Staff Writer \nIf you haven't heard of Claude Davis yet do yourself a huge favor and watch this video . He's going to be the talk of 2016. \nOne of the smartest guys I ever had the pleasure of meeting, Claude set-up a unique system that changed his life forever. \nI already tried it myself and let me tell... you I was completely blown away... His surprising tactics could make your life easier and give you the peace of mind you deserve. \nDon't just take my word for it... watch his short video and decide for yourself. Is Bread Really the Staff of Life… or the Stuff of Disease? \nFor most us, there are few foods more comforting than bread. \nFluffy biscuits, crusty baguettes, flaky croissants… even a simple slice of toast topped with melted butter can taste like heaven. \nAnd that smell… few scents are quite as pleasant as fresh bread baking in the oven . \nBut there is a lot of confusion as to where bread fits into a healthy diet. \nThe Bible practically commands followers to eat it: “Give us this day our daily bread…” The government put it at the base of the food pyramid. And for centuries, it has been called “the staff of life.” \nOf course, there are some who disagree… \nWell-known cardiologist, Dr. William Davis, calls wheat “the perfect chronic poison.” \nAnd for a poison, we sure eat lots of it… \nThe average American consumes 55 pounds of wheat flour every year, making refined flour the #1 source of calories in the American Diet – a situation that nutrition expert Chris Kresser describes as, “a public health catastrophe.” Is it the perfect poison… or an essential daily food? Is “gluten-free” bread better for you than regular bread? And can you still eat bread… while maintaining a lean body and optimal health? \nThe answers to these questions may surprise you! By Kelley Herring, Editor, Healing Gourmet \nRecently, Doctor of Naturopathy, weight-loss expert and best-selling Amazon author Liz Swann Miller, creator of the Red Smoothie Detox Factor, revealed 2 of the secrets to easy, steady weight loss. Secrets the big food corporations do their best to hide from us. \nSecret #1: Enjoy real food. Don’t fall for the lie that you have to deprive yourself to lose weight. \nSecret #2: stop eating out. You will automatically eat less without even noticing. \nThen start detoxing your body with tasty, nourishing smoothies that are just as easy on your wallet as they are easy to make. \nBecause a single day of enjoying Liz’ smoothies demonstrated the radical power of her superfood-packed red smoothies to make me feel incredibly good. \nNow prepare yourself for one of the biggest weight loss secrets there is. A secret that, when you use it properly, can transform your body and your health. \nYou probably know most of us eat too much processed food. What you may not know is that it’s full of toxic chemicals and substandard, dirt-cheap ingredients designed to make you eat more …and force you to gain weight. \nHere’s how it works. \n“That stuff is just a lot of calories your body can’t use,” Liz told me, “Some are poison . And all these foods are stripped of the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that help your body detox. The result? Your body expends huge amounts of calories to eliminate some toxins—the rest, it stores in your fat to protect you. This is why most people are hungry all the time. They’re not getting energy they need.” \n“So… what’s going on with me? Why am I losing weight but not going hungry?” \nLiz paused, then dropped the bombshell. \nYour body is designed to burn fat. You just have to let it. \n“What? I thought we were designed to store fat?!?” We were Skyping and I was practically shouting. Then I heard Liz say… \nWhat good is a fat reserve if you can’t burn it? \nMind blown. \nLiz continued: “You’re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores… and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.” \nSo that’s why I’m losing weight without going hungry. \nWatch Liz’ free presentation. It’s packed with revolutionary weight loss information—information that works. Because it’s based on how nature. \nClick the button only if you want to wear smaller clothes, breathe easier, move more freely and just plain feel better. Which calories help you lose weight…and which ones help you gain it… The “diet” foods…some of them vegetables…that lead to weight gain and diabetes… The “low-fat” foods that can dramatically increase your risk of cancer . And the superfoods that rescue your body from this assault by detoxing you… \nRevitalizing your metabolism so you can Shed pounds as well as toxins, renew your body and reset your internal clock by up to 7 years. \nFor next the week only, Liz is offering the Red Smoothie Detox Factor at 50% off. \nBecause until now, the Red Smoothie Detox Factor has been available only to Liz’ private clients.

      "text": "What Pharmacy Carries Sandoz 20 Mg Methylphenidate Hcl Besides Cvs 29 Replies Updated Fri, Jan 21 '11, 6:08 PM I am losing it trying to find a pharmacy other than CVS that carries the Sandoz brand of 20mg Methylphenidate hcl. I have tried most independent pharmacies and none of the major chains seem to have them. I called Walmart, Walgreens, Costco, Neighborcare, Riteaid, Safeway Pharmacy, SuperFresh Pharmacy, a bunch of small independents as well as a few epic pharmacies. The only reason I dont go to CVS is because They have to order it, I have been out for 3 days now, and there cash price is higher than anyone in town. I take three 20mg hcl tabs a day. Plus, my mother is one of the pharmacy techs at my neighborhood pharmacy and has been in recovery for 12 years and would go crazy if she new I was being prescribed generic ritalin . Although I have never had a substance abuse problem, and she knows I have been suffereing with add since I was 15 yrs old and actually had to repeat the 10th grade. My mom is way to in my business and checks my profile all the time to see if I have been picking up my other important meds. I have been going to an independent pharmacy in my town but they have switched to Methlyn which makes me edgy, nauseus, and even kills my stomach. Sorry this is so long. If anyone can help me out I would appreciate it. I live in Maryland. Thanks everyone Showing Replies 1 - 20 of 29 Page Wed, Mar 02 '11, 11:24 PM i would also like to know what pharmacies other than CVS carry 20mg of methylphenidate manufactured by Sandoz. i live in connecticut. any feedback would be much appreciated. thank you in advance. take care. Fri, Mar 04 '11, 9:46 AM I was wondering what your experiences have been using Sandoz Methylphenidate HCL compared to other generic brands?? Sat, Mar 19 '11, 10:07 AM Fri, Mar 25 '11, 1:48 PM I'm sorry to hear of the difficulties that everyone is having finding this product and I wish I had an answer for you. What I can tell you, however, is that since Methylphenidate / Ritalin is a controlled substance, calling the pharmacies will usually not get you an accurate answer. Most of them are just going to automatically tell you that they don't, because they have no way of knowing whether the person on the phone is a legitimate customer or a potential thief. Most pharmacies do this with anyone that calls asking if they carry any type of controlled substance. To get an accurate answer, even if you are just asking about what they carry from a specific manufacturer, you are actually going to have to physically go to the pharmacies, with your prescription in hand, so they know that you are a real customer. Thu, Mar 31 '11, 12:00 AM Durham Pharmacy in what state? Connecticut or Maryland?? I also found that some CVS' actually dispense methylin from Mallik (sp). My last CVS' script was 20mg of methylin , not SZ methylphenidate . I actually remember getting methylin from the same CVS I went to where they dispensed the methylin , and then recently (2 months ago) then dispensed the SZ methylphenidate again, so I don't know what their ordering process is. i recall that when i was on the 10's that Target's pharmacy dispensed SZ, but that was for 10 mg. I'm not sure if they do the same with 20's, nor have I been back there. Walmart used to carry SZ 10's, but I think they changed to Methylin form Malik (sp). Maybe because it's so much cheaper. Mon, Apr 04 '11, 4:09 PM I have been taking generic Ritalin (20 mg SR) for over 15 years. Now all of sudden, the price has trippled and some pharmacies don't even offer it. Does anyone know why this is happening to such an old drug? Must be Obamacare?? Thu, Apr 07 '11, 4:20 PM It seems that Ritalin for $500 is readly available but no on has the generic which costs me $66.00 for 20 mg time released 240 tablets thru Ridgeway Pharmacy, Victor Montana. It seems that the generic has been out of supply for two months now. How is it Ridgeway can sell it for $66.00 and make a profit when every one else charges three times that amount? It should be a crime to price gouge like this. Ridgeway is one of the few that will mail order. BJ Wholesale has good prices but will not mail. Mon, May 23 '11, 11:46 AM Found this thread searching online for info on 20 mg Methylphenidate and thought I'd share my experience. My prescription is for Methylphenidate 20 mg 90 tabs (I have no insurance). I called Ridgeway Pharmacy as somewhere suggested here and because I don't have insurance, they can't ship out of state (I'm in PA). I called Walmart. The cost is $48.32 I found a small local pharmacy and the cost was $27.76! My hometown pharmacy doesn't do online ordering or anything so it wouldn't matter if I gave the name. Again, I'm in South Central PA. Hope that helps. Mon, Oct 03 '11, 1:13 AM There is the same problem with adderall . Many ritlin users graduate to adderall . when adderall supply runs out then patients get put back on ritlin on some occasions - therefore this will increase ritlin usage and cause potential shortages.. this isn't a full reason or explanation but it does play a part in Ritlin shortages I'm sure. The world wnats to know why there is no adderall thats for sure. Thu, Dec 01 '11, 4:58 PM From what I'm told, Sandoz's Drug for Methylphenidate 20 mg. is back ordered in a bunch of pharmacies. I get an order for both types of generic ritalin . I found this in all pharmacies and ended up only being able to get the one prescription filled and got told that they won't fill the other because their on one prescription page. Mon, Feb 06 '12, 12:19 PM Tue, Feb 14 '12, 2:26 PM I am also having trouble finding the sandoz methylphenidate I found that works the best for me the Methylin is no good that is at walmart.Walgreens carries Watson methylphenidate which seems to be pretty close. Thu, Aug 09 '12, 4:25 PM I too am having a hard time getting methylphenidate . I tried name brand Ritalin and it makes me feel like I've had 10 cups of coffee and makes me nauseated. I am just desperate to find someone with the Watson 20mg or at least the white one with an M on it. I have CFS, Fibromyalgia, chronic pain, sleep disorders +...I barely had a life with Watson but now I am just beyond fatigued, terrible headaches....my pharmacist told me (small town) that the big brand name co. is pushing out the little guys!! Well then they need to offer the same meds that they are causing the others to bow out from making!! So tired of being so tired!! It also makes me moody!! Hate this ____!! By the way... Texas Thu, Aug 09 '12, 4:48 PM By the way, had to get remainder filled (as they didn't have my full amount when I filled. This pill is the sandoz and it is as bad for me as the Ritalin . Wish a sandoz user with Watson or the \"M\" 20mg one lived nearby I would swap in a heartbeat!! Crazy how everyone's body reacts so different to each brand!! Mon, Nov 26 '12, 7:50 PM Quick response to a few things said on this thread. Obamacare has nothing to do with the ADD drug shortages. Sandoz Customer Service: 1-609-627-8500. You can find that and other good info on the FDA.gov website. Don't know what info may be available from the Sandoz customer service but good luck... A few states have a website with alternative pricing by pharmacy on certain drugs. Try the following link for that and other good info. consumerreports.org/health/shop-online/compare-prices-disclaimer.htm?drugName=Dextroamphetamine Shire has been messing with the amphetamine supply ( Adderall + its generics) creating a shortage on the generics maket on purpose to shore up their namebrand Adderall and their somewhat new prodrug version Vyvanse . Not sure if they also supply the amphetamines for Dexedrine and its generics or not. The DEA distributes the ingredients to Shire in the amount of a set quota. Shire distributes to the generic companies. Shire has been produceing more of their namebrand drugs to create the shortage with the various generics companies. The DEA after a while increased the supply but that hasn't seemed to be enough. People who can't get their generic Adderall or Dexedrine are getting what they can which drives up demand for other drug alternatives. Don't know if Ritalin uses any of the same ingredients in it's processing or not but people will go there as an alternative and drive up demand and create a shortage if it wasn't caused by lack of ingredients already. The generics have the same active ingredients as each other and the name brand. It's the stuff they pack it with that can make the difference in how it is absorbed and other issues. The name brands tend to use higher quality ingredients but obviously cost more. Right now they jacked up the price again and my namebrand 1 month supply of Dexedrine would be about $1300 out of pocket so screw that. If you are curious to see how some of the drug industry pricing is rigged to maximize profit you can start researching UNC, AMP, AWP, ACA FUL, and other pricing. Walgreens switched the price submitted to my insurance company this month that I have to pay for generic Dexedrine from UNC ($68.99) to AWP ($285.99) this month. Up from $27.99 a year ago that's a 922% increase. Don't know if they have a part in it or if it is all on the manufacturer/supplier side that has been jacking up the price.",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target   12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

      "title": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target - Chicago Tribune",
      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News . The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nAloe plant Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee An aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\nAn aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\n(Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee) The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.''\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.''\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nALOE Daniel Acker / Bloomberg Aloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\nAloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\n(Daniel Acker / Bloomberg) The CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.''\nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune CVS Health Bloomberg L.P.",

Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, Target and CVS 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \n(Bloomberg) -- The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \n23,000 Stores \nTarget Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. Related Stories Cures for ailments can be found in plants \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \nRaw Ingredients \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nLawsuits Filed \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \nSee also: The Parmesan Cheese You Sprinkle on Your Penne Could Be Wood \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nBeneficial Properties \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nReliability Questioned \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nImitation Aloe \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \nLoving Aloe \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" SFGATE'S BEST DEALS ",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues might make some consumers feel even more burned, especially those who use some store brand products.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera.\nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\"\nAloe Vera brings in a lot of green too. According to Bloomberg, $146 million last year.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises.\nA rep for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart.\nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.",

Instead, researchers found maltodextrin, a polysaccharide used to imitate aloe. Store-brand products claiming to contain aloe at Walgreens contained only malic acid. \nAnd since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't evaluate or approve cosmetics before they're sold, there's nothing stopping retailers from selling the products as advertised. \nLawsuits filed against the four retailers claim that customers were misled and that \"no reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera.\" \nRead more at Bloomberg . \nThere are no comments yet.

      "text": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:00 PM Lydia Mulvany, Zeke Faux - Bloomberg \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS. \n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. \nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings. \n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.'' \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said. \n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.'' \nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989. \n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.'' \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. \nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. \nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. \n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\" \nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. \nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. \nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. \n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\" Authors Information:",

Instead, researchers found maltodextrin, a polysaccharide used to imitate aloe. Store-brand products claiming to contain aloe at Walgreens contained only malic acid. \nAnd since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't evaluate or approve cosmetics before they're sold, there's nothing stopping retailers from selling the products as advertised. \nLawsuits filed against the four retailers claim that customers were misled and that \"no reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera.\" \nRead more at Bloomberg .

      "text": "\nBlack Friday freebies? Really? Yes, there are tons of them out there, but you have to know where and when to get them! While many consumers will be looking for the best deals online and throughout department stores across the country, there are also ways shoppers can cash in on several freebies along the way.\nAccording to The Black Friday.com , many stores are spicing up the deals by giving away freebies to entice shoppers to head into their stores, and several major businesses have jumped on board. From CVS. Bon-Ton to Victoria Secrets, Home Depot and JCPenney, shoppers can cash in on a little extra incentive this holiday season.\nCVS has some great Black Friday deals. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] Here is a look at some great examples various stores will be offering on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.\nBon-Ton will give the first 200 in-store shoppers on Thanksgiving a free gift card, valued between $5 and $500. How can you beat that? To sweeten the pot, Bon-Ton guarantees to give away one $500 gift card at each store. So if you are planning on heading to a local Bon-Ton outlet, the doors open at 5 p.m. local time.\nBealls is also giving away freebies, but this one will come in the form of an instant in-store drawing.\nAccording to Deals.com , the first 75 people in line at Bealls on Thanksgiving Day will be entered into their “Giftspiration” drawing, in which the three luckiest recipients will get a $100, $75, or $50 gift card. The remaining 72 customers will receive a $10 gift card. Stores are scheduled to open at noon.\nJCPenney will also be getting into the act when it comes to the Black Friday freebies and deals. The long time retail giant will be offering coupons for $10 off orders over $10, or $100 off $100 orders. How can you beat that? In other words, if you spend $10, you will get $10 in freebies, and the same goes for $100. In fact JCPenney will match your spending up to $500. This may be the best deal in town! Shoppers will have up to Christmas Eve to make use of all of the cost-cutting coupons you earn.\nJCPenney is running a great deal this year. [Image from JCPenney.com] CVS shoppers have a more than a handful of options to cash in this holiday season. Several reward offers will be up for grabs this Black Friday, including cash rewards on popular items that include Green Giant Vegetables, Hershey’s Mars Chocolate, Mentos Mints and Air Heads candy products along with Stylessentials Leggings and CVS Blade Torq3 Kits – and that is just to name a few.\nOther Black Friday freebies and deals include Victoria’s Secret, Fred Meyer stores, Belk and Shopko.\nVictoria’s Secret will be giving away a free tote bag on Thanksgiving Day.

Doors open at 4 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day.\nIf you don’t see a department store or location you like to visit in your town be sure to ask someone when you are there.

      "text": "Posted By: PoemStone No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart, Target, CVS The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. Samples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart , Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. There’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. “You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. Aloe’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. 23,000 Stores Target Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. The tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. Fruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. Raw Ingredients “We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,’’ John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.’’ Tim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. “Acemannan has been misinterpreted,’’ Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.’’ Though it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. The CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. Lawsuits Filed Several law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. See also: The Parmesan Cheese You Sprinkle on Your Penne Could Be Wood “No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. Fruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. Independently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. Beneficial Properties Acemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. Jesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. “What you have there is not aloe,’’ said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.’’ Reliability Questioned Acemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. Aloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Jeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. Making just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. “Aloe is all harvested by hand,” Barrie said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.” There’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, “there’s nothing to hang your hat on” in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Loving Aloe “There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,’’ said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. Some people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. Meredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. “I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.” (0)",

      "text": "This post may contain affiliate links. Read our disclosure here . \n\nHere’s your long awaited CVS Black Friday Scenario. I’ve figured out how to get all 29 items for FREE after rewards!! \nIt’s so hard to make a big scenario for CVS that will work for everyone. The tricky part is that by the time you get there they will be out of a few things and it will throw all your planning on scenarios to the wind… Another difficult part is that we are all starting with a different amount of ExtraCare Bucks. This plan is my personal plan. I have right at $20 ExtraCare Bucks so the first transaction I’ll pay nothing on. Any ECB’s you already have will help pay for the 1st transaction. \nTip: If you want to get everything then be ready to be there when they open or at midnight if they never close. Some stores that do close at night will start running these deals secretly starting around 6 pm tonight. Scenario Idea To Get Everything Transaction #1 (1) CVS Alkaline Batteries, AA or AAA, 4 pk., $4.39 (1) Advil Pain Reliever, 40-50 ct., $5.99 (1) CVS Health Extra Strength Acetaminophen, 24 ct. Gelcaps, $3.99 (1) CVS Blade Torq3 Razor Kit, $5 (1) Stylessentials Leggings, $5 -$2 off Advil, Excedrin or CVS pain killers, $8+, printing at CVS Coupon Center -$1 off Advil product, excl trial size RP 11/06 or printable Total Due: $21.37",

(NYSE: WMT ), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS ) do not contain aloe vera inside of them. Source: Flickr \nThe companies sell the skin soothing product with their brand names, which are reportedly designed and manufactured by professionals. However, they do not contain the aloe barbadensis leaf juice, which is another name for aloe vera \nThis product is supposed to be either the number one or number two ingredient within the gel after water. Bloomberg analyzed the gels from all three companies and they did not have aloe vera. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not have to approve cosmetics products and there is no such thing as a fine for selling fake aloe. The aloe market grew 11% over the last year to $146 million. \nThe president of a company that tests products said that companies have to be careful when they select and use aloe products. Three chemicals that were marked in the product were also not within the gel. \nThese are acemann, malic acid and glucose, which were not in the products designed by Wal-Mart, Target or CVS. Instead, they contain a cheaper element called matrodextrin, which is a sugar that imitates aloe. \nThe company behind the Wal-Mart product says it stands behind its gel, claiming it uses real aloe vera. The plant allegedly comes from Guatemala.  ",

According to Bloomberg, $146 million last year. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA rep for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

      "title": "No actual aloe vera found in aloe gels from Walmart, Target, CVS: study | WREG.com",
      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

CVS Health reports quarterly financial results on Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2015. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nDespite consumer reports, investigations, arrests and public service announcements—people in northeast Wisconsin continue to hand over money and gift cards to scammers claiming to be bill collectors or the IRS. \n“This is the time of year when scammers are kind of having field days because there’s so much economic activity going on out there specific to the gift cards which is a very convenient way to stop,” said Frank Frasetto, Administrator, Division of Trade and Consumer Protection at DATCP. \nThis year, billions of dollars were lost to scammers claiming to be the IRS or utility companies—demanding immediate money in the form of gift cards for outstanding debt and impending lawsuits. \n“We continue to get calls into the hotline regarding the utilities scams,” said Frasetto, “and now as the winter months are rolling around you can anticipate that that’s going to be adding an uptick or two– because people don’t want to have their heat turned off in the middle of winter.” \nThat’s why CVS pharmacy added an extra step to their check out recently. Anyone buying a gift card is prompted with the following message on their screen: \n“Protect yourself from prepaid card scams. Common scams include requests related to lotteries, taxes, a new job and helping someone in need. Don’t provide any prepaid card information to someone you don’t know; including PIN # or Card #. If you feel you are a victim of fraud, reconsider your purchase and contact local law enforcement.” \nThe customer can choose “continue” to the payment screen, or “cancel.” \nOfficials also want to remind consumers that reputable companies like WPS, for example, want a check made out to them. \n“They don’t get payments via gift cards,” Frasetto told Action 2 News, “or—the latest twist—the iTunes gift cards. So consumers should be very wary whenever an unsolicited contact comes to them and starts demanding money.” \n",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled. 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Aloe vera green gel transparent bottle/File image × Report: Tests find no evidence of aloe vera in gel products from CVS, Target and Walmart Aloe vera green gel transparent bottle/File image \nHow much aloe vera is in products that list it as one of the main ingredients? \nNone at all for some products, according to a new study from Bloomberg News . Bloomberg analyzed aloe gel products from Walmart, Target and CVS. Those products all had one thing in common: tests showed none of them contained aloe vera even though it was listed as the first or second ingredient on each product. \nThe store-branded gels lacked the three chemical markers signifying the presence of aloe vera, according to the lab report commissioned by Bloomberg . \nMost people buy aloe products in hopes of soothing burned or damaged skin. \nThe findings reignite a debate about who should regulate such products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and suppliers more or less operate on the “honor system.” The U.S. market for aloe products has grown 11 percent in the last year, according to Chicago-based market research firm SPINS LLC. \nAccording to lab results , samples from Walmart, CVS and Target contained maltodextrin, a sugar used as a filler in aloe vera products. Another product that was tested, aloe gel from Walgreens, contained one chemical marker for aloe but not the other two, meaning the presence of aloe couldn’t be confirmed or ruled out in that product. \nAccording to Bloomberg, Target declined to comment on the lab results. Spokesmen for Walmart, CVS and Walgreens told Bloomberg that their suppliers informed them that the products were authentic. \nFruit of the Earth, a Texas-based brand, made the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens. The company identified its aloe supplier as Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp. Both companies disputed the results of Bloomberg’s tests and said nuclear magnetic resonance testing used on the gels can be unreliable for cosmetic products. \nThe company that produced CVS’ aloe gel, Florida-based Product Quest Manufacturing LLC, declined to comment on the findings or identify its supplier. \nBloomberg had the following products tested: Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel ",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera.\nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\"\nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results.\nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe.\nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises.\nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart.\nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera.\nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\"\nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results.\nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe.\nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises.\nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart.\nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.",

(I got 3). Just print out one of the manufacturer coupons for each tube and scan each cvs card at the kiosk to get the unique cvs coupons.\n\n\nAlso, if you have a CVS nearby and go when there is no line, they have a lot of \"free\" items (you get a rebate in extrabucks for the purchase price). But if there's no line, you can simply put each item on a separate transaction and use each items extrabucks to pay for the next one. In that way, you only have to pay for the first and everything else is free. ",
