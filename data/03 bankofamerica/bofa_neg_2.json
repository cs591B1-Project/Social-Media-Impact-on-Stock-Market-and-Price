(WTNH) — News 8 joined forces with the Connecticut Food Bank and Bank of America to help the 500,000 Connecticut residents who struggle with hunger every day.\nOne in five children is food insecure in Connecticut and many of the people who need help from the Connecticut Food Bank are employed, but are unable to meet basic living expenses.\nOn Saturday, the News 8 team, along with Bank of America and Girl Scouts Troop 60834, collected donations for the Connecticut Food Bank. Aside from food donations, for every $1 that was donated, Bank of America will match the donation with $2 more.\nRelated Content: Photos: News 8 Thanksgiving Food Drive \nWe were able to collect so much money and food for Feeding America, as well as meet dozens of great News 8 viewers.\nAll of us at News 8 want to thank everyone for their generosity and for coming to spend some time with us!",

Why Bank of America expects the surge to ride through the holidays By Brian Price | CNBC – 4 hours ago \nCNBC - This year, the 'Santa Claus' rally may be replaced by 'Santa Trump' instead. RELATED QUOTES \nThis year, the 'Santa Claus' rally may be replaced by 'Santa Trump' instead. It's the most wonderful time of the year —for stocks, that is. \nAll major U.S. indices are sitting near all-time highs, and one technician thinks there's even more room to run. The dynamic inspired by President-elect Donald Trump and the aftermath of the U.K.'s vote to quit the European Union appear to be converging, which may be good news for investors. \nAll told, it suggests the traditional \"Santa Claus\" rally that investors see around the holidays could easily become the 'Santa Trump' surge instead. \n\"We have an overlay of the post-election rally with the post-Brexit rally in the S&P and it is a pretty good fit,\" explained Bank of America's top technician Stephen Suttmeier on CNBC's \" Futures Now \" in a recent interview. \"The market is going up at about the same pace as it did after that big risk-off move going into Brexit.\" \nIndeed, in the eight days following Brexit and the U.S. presidential election, the S&P 500 Index gained 3 and 2 percent, respectively. The Chief Equity Technical Strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch went on to detail that the similarities in movement in both instances went beyond price action. \nFor Suttmeier, the key underlying indicator that accompanied both drops was fear in the market. The strategist compared the VIX , otherwise known as the market's \"fear gage\" and the VXV against U.S. equities. \nThe VXV/VIX ratio shows expectations of volatility three months out, versus expectations for volatility in the near term. Measurements above 1.2 indicate an overbought market while a reading of 1.0 or below indicated an oversold market, which indicates fear in the market on a tactical basis. \nHeading into both the election and Brexit, \"investors were fearful. But, take a look at what's going on right now: You have a lot of stocks going to new 52-week highs ahead of the averages. Same thing happened right after Brexit.\" \nSuttmeier also noted the importance of seasonality when making the bull case for stocks. He explained that Brexit occurred in the midst of the second-best three-month period of the year. \n\"We're now starting the best three-month and six-month period,\" said the technician, discussing November through January and November through April, which are historically strong periods for the market. \n\"Seasonality supports the case for a rally. There is a little resistance on the S&P around 2,180 to 2,194, but I do think we can surpass that and trend up into the 2,200 to 2,230 range,\" he added. \nSuttmeier also noted that he and his team have yet to see diminished market breadth despite the recent rally. \n\"Pay attention to the breakout that we just had last week,\" noted Suttmeier. \"The downtrend line from August is a support level that comes in roughly around 2,150. I think we're embarking on a seasonal rally with some pretty interesting groups leading like financials and semiconductors, which look fantastic.\" \nHe added: \"We have a lot of good cyclical strength in this market. Until we see internal deterioration in the market, meaning a less broad-based rally, we have to stick with the gains. We have to stick with the view that we're going to rally.\" Chancellor warns Brexit uncertainty leaves UK facing 'eye-watering' debt Sky News - 7 hours ago The Chancellor has warned that an unprecedented level of uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to forecasts which predict slower growth for the UK and an \"eye-wateringly\" large debt.

      "text": "View Photo \nLloyds leads race for Bank of America's £7bn UK credit card business – report \nLloyds Banking Group has moved ahead of US private equity firm Cerberus to become the leading bidder for Bank of America's (BofA) £7bn ($8.64bn) UK credit card business. If the deal goes through, it would mark the British bank's first acquisition in more than seven years. \nThe business that could be sold refers to the credit card operations of MBNA, an American bank which was acquired by BofA in 2006. MBNA has five million credit card customers in the UK and about 11% of the UK market in terms of credit card balances. In 2015, it reportedly made a profit of £166m. \nBofA had earlier sold some of its credit card operations in Ireland and Spain. However, five years ago, it abandoned plans to sell its entire European credit card business, including its UK operations, as takeover bids were less than expected. \nLloyds was one of the potential bidders at the time, but pulled out from the process after BofA denied to share future costs involved in compensating customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI). However, according to sources cited by the Financial Times, BofA has agreed to Lloyds condition, provided the PPI costs does not go above a fixed cap. \nMBNA's higher-margin business will help Lloyds offset the impact of low interest rates on its main mortgage business. While sources who were briefed on the sale process, said that Lloyds could close the deal in the first quarter of 2017, they added that there was a possibility that the deal may not materialise. \nOne of the sources said that the deal could raise competition issues and added that post this deal, Lloyds would control about 25% of the UK credit card market in terms of receivables, which is similar to the holding of market leader Barclaycard. \nAccording to the sources, the takeover could also affect the city in Chester in northwest England where MBNA's business is based. As Lloyds would be expected to transfer MBNA's customers to its own systems, it could lead to redundancies of 1,700 staff, the source explained. \nAnalysts further said that the deal would be bad for shareholders of the London-headquartered company. They added that the MBNA takeover would bring down Lloyds' ability to pay higher dividends. \nRelated Articles Chancellor warns Brexit uncertainty leaves UK facing 'eye-watering' debt Sky News - 11 hours ago The Chancellor has warned that an unprecedented level of uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to forecasts which predict slower growth for the UK and an \"eye-wateringly\" large debt.

Like the other banks, BAC will certainly benefit from a steepening yield curve and a wider net interest margin, but BAC will likely benefit more than some of the other big banks if the Dodd-Frank Act gets repealed. BAC has had more difficulty than most of the other big banks passing stress tests and gaining approval for its financial plans. This has kept the stock’s valuation lower than its peers, but it gives the stock more room to run in the face of a lighter regulatory environment. \nBAC is just now bouncing up off of what used to be long-term resistance at $19.86 — which was established all the way back in April 2010. We anticipate the stock is going to rise above this level and continue on toward $21-$22. \n‘Buy to open’ the BAC January (2017) 21 Calls (BAC170120C00021000) for a maximum price of $0.65. \nYou can learn more about identifying price patterns and using them to project how far you think a stock is going to move in our Advanced Technical Analysis Program . \nInvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

      "text": " 55pm EST BofA must face fraud lawsuit by Tutor Perini over debt sales The Bank of America building is shown in Los Angeles, California October 29, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo By Jonathan Stempel \nA U.S. appeals court on Monday revived a lawsuit accusing   of defrauding Tutor Perini Corp ( TPC.N ) by selling the construction company millions of dollars of auction-rate securities it knew were on the brink of collapse. \nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said a lower court judge erred in dismissing federal and Massachusetts state securities fraud claims against the second-largest U.S. bank. \nTutor Perini said Bank of America pushed it to buy auction-rate securities in late 2007 and early 2008 despite knowing the market was \"one step away from illiquidity.\" \nThe $330 billion auction-rate market seized up in February 2008 when dealers stopped supporting it, saddling investors with illiquid debt that had often been marketed as a cash substitute. \nIn dismissing Tutor Perini's lawsuit in August 2015, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said Bank of America made numerous disclosures to the Sylmar, California-based company and \"had no duty to disclose all facts\" reflecting the risks. \nWriting for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson said deteriorating conditions might have obliged Bank of America to warn of new risks that made its earlier recommendations stale. \nCiting emails, Thompson said \"a reasonable jury could find that while (the bank) was taking steps to protect itself, it urged an unsuspecting Tutor Perini to walk right off the cliff.\" \nBank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson   \nTutor Perini estimates its losses at more than $50 million, including interest. \nIts lawyer, George Carpinello, a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said the company was \"very pleased\" with the decision. \n\"The court recited chapter and verse from Bank of America's own emails as to how the bank knew the market was on the verge of collapse, and decided that one way out of the crisis was to dump securities on unsuspecting investors,\" he said. \nBank of America was among more than one dozen companies that agreed to repurchase more than $61 billion of auction-rate securities to settle claims by Andrew Cuomo, then New York's attorney general and now its governor. \nTutor Perini said corporate investors such as itself were ineligible for these settlements. \nThe case is Tutor Perini Corp v Bank of America Securities LLC et al, 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1945. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jonathan  ",

      "text": "NEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE) Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on Bank of America, N.A.'s (BANA) U.S. residential mortgage servicer ratings:\n--Primary servicer rating for Prime product affirmed at 'RPS2-', Outlook Stable;\n--Primary servicer rating for Alt-A product affirmed at 'RPS2-', Outlook Stable;\n--Primary servicer rating for HELOC product affirmed at 'RPS2-', Outlook Stable;\n--Primary servicer rating for Subprime product affirmed at 'RPS2-', Outlook Stable;\n--Primary servicer rating for Second Lien product affirmed at 'RPS2-, Outlook Stable;\n--Special servicer rating withdrawn at 'RSS2-'.\nThe rating actions and Stable Outlook for BANA's servicer ratings reflect the company's comprehensive internal control environment, continued investments in technology, and incremental operational enhancements. In addition, the ratings incorporate the company's financial condition. BANA is rated 'A+' with a Stable Outlook by Fitch.\nThe withdrawal of the special servicer rating is based on the lack of sufficient information to maintain the rating. BANA indicated that it is not currently active in non-agency RMBS special servicing and this influenced their decision stop providing updated information to maintain the special servicer rating.\nBANA has a comprehensive internal control environment which includes three lines of defense: internal audit, compliance, and QC testing. The company's internal audit results for the servicing operations continued to show improvement. BANA's Regulation AB report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015 contained one instance of material noncompliance, a decrease from three instances of material noncompliance in the prior year.\nDuring the current review period, BANA continued its substantial progress to reduce the size of its delinquent portfolio, and the company evidenced focus on aligning its operations utilizing capacity models and service level metrics. In conjunction with these initiatives, the company has continued to make incremental operational enhancements to servicing operations, including the implementation of an interactive voice system to augment live agent collections calls and virtual messaging, and a new application to provide a centralized location that houses all borrower call notes across the servicing operation.\nBANA has sustained its investments in technology and operational initiatives to support the servicing operation. Through this transition the company continues to invest in technology and operational initiatives to support compliance with CFPB and other regulatory and settlement servicing requirements.\nAs of June 30, 2016, BANA serviced 4,108,440 loans totaling $535.7 billion, a decrease from 5,234,912 loans totaling $674.6 billion as of March 31, 2015. The total servicing portfolio included 11.1% non-agency first lien prime product, 1% first lien Alt-A product, 1.2% first lien subprime product, 29.6% HELOC product, and 3.2% closed-end second lien product based on loan count.\nFitch will continue to monitor BANA's ability to maintain performance as it continues to work to optimize its mortgage servicing operations.\nFitch rates residential mortgage primary, master, and special servicers on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating. Within some of these rating levels, Fitch further differentiates ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well as the flat rating.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.\nThe information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

      "text": "Bank of America’s SVP of marketing Andrew Deming talks addressable TV and first party data By Staff Writer - 22 November 2016 04:00am Credit: Beet.TV \nAt Beet.TV’s recent Beet Retreat in Miami, Bank of America’s SVP of marketing Andrew Deming discussed how the bank is utilizing addressable TV tactics to help it transition to a one-to-one, more relationship-driven marketing model. \nSpeaking with Beet.TV, he explained that the bank is moving away from the “old transactional style, product-led driven model” and is now focusing on providing messages to consumers that are relevant to their individual needs. \nOne of the ways it is doing this is by utilizing addressable TV tactics that allow the bank to deliver different messages to different audience groups depending upon their individual needs. For example, he explained that someone who is looking for a new credit card would see a different message than a newlywed couple who might be looking for a home loan. \nDeming said that Bank of America recently launched its first addressable TV campaign and has more in the works as well. \n“When we really know more about the customer and can present them with the most relevant information at the given time of when they need it, to me that is going to be the most effective and that’s where everybody is going to win,” he said. “And that’s when we move to truly having conversational relationships with our consumers rather than just being a bank who is providing them products.” \nHe also discussed how having access to first party data is both an “asset and also a complexity” since the banking industry is heavily regulated, and stressed the importance of working with a legitimate third-party to ensure that customer data remains private and anonymous. \n“You have to find somebody that you can work with that’s an approved vendor that can actually take your first party data and anonymize it so when you’re working with your vendor partners, they can exercise the match without actually having any understanding of who is the customer is, because their privacy and their protection is obviously the first and foremost important thing to us,” he said. \nThis article is about: North America , Addressable media , Digital , Marketing , Marketing Services , Brand Staff Writer \nThe Drum is all about modern marketing and media.

She is expecting their son in March. \nThat was until Trombley, an Iraq war veteran, received help from Bank of America and Humble Design. \nThe bank kicked off its Detroit Day of Giving 2016 on Wednesday, Nov. 16, with a check presentation of $20,000 to Humble Design, one of many checks presented throughout metro Detroit to 20 charities and nonprofit organizations totaling $725,000. Advertisement \nHumble Design is a Pontiac-based nonprofit that helps families transition out of homeless shelters by furnishing their new dwellings with furniture, bath and kitchen necessities, bedding, accessories, even books and toys. \nAmong the numerous volunteer activities during the Day of Giving, 15 Bank of America employees spent the day moving furniture and helping furnish the entire house for the Trombley family. \nRita Oldani, senior vice president and senior client manager at Bank of America, was one of the volunteers cleaning and furnishing the home for the Trombley family. \n“It’s part of our culture to give back to the community and it is days like this that recharge our batteries,” said Oldani. “This was a wonderful day for us to volunteer and help build his home.” \nThis was Humble Design’s 700th home furnishing. The nonprofit furnishes about three homes per week and works with several shelters and organizations to identify families who need their assistance. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, who helped Trombley secure housing about a year ago, referred the family to Humble Design. \n“We were blessed with a pretty amazing group of people coming in and making our house a home,” said Trombley. \n“We’re so grateful this veteran served our country and to see the look of excitement on his children’s faces just to have a bed in their own room,” said Tregar Strasberg, Humble Design Founder.   \nAnne Runkle is a multimedia journalist at The Oakland Press.

      "text": "11/22/16 AT 12:19 PM Close \nA global financial regulator declared three of America’s largest banks sources of higher risk to the world’s financial system compared to last year, requiring them to hold more capital as a sort of insurance against failure and the resulting ripple effects across the global economy. The announcement on Monday came less than two weeks after banking industry deregulation-friendly candidate Donald Trump won the presidential election. \nThe Basel, Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board (FSB) will, starting in January 2018, require Citigroup Inc. to have a 2.5 percent capital buffer —the second-highest risk bracket— compared to last year’s 2 percent requirement , and Bank of America Corp. needs to keep 2 percent of its capital available, above last year’s 1.5 percent. Morgan Stanley, however, was moved to the lowest risk bracket, with a capital buffer of just 1 percent, down from 1.5 percent last year. \nWells Fargo & Co.’s bump to a higher capital buffer level, to 1.5 percent from 1 percent last year, followed a rough patch for the bank. Over the past several months , Wells Fargo has been investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the House Financial Services Committee, the Justice Department, the California Attorney General’s office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and its own directors over the opening of false accounts without customers’ knowledge for more than a decade . The ordeal resulted in the resignation of the bank’s CEO, after a high-profile grilling by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as a $185 million fine. \nWhile the FSB deemed the three American banks, including scandal-mired Wells Fargo, higher systemic risks to the global economy, Deutsche Bank, which the International Monetary Fund labeled the greatest systemic risk to the international financial sector last summer, retained its middle-tier position, with a capital requirement of 2 percent. \nSo why should Wells Fargo hold more capital than usual if Deutsche Bank hasn’t been bumped up on the list? Related Stories Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf Quits \nThe FSB’s decision came down to “data quality improvements, changes in underlying activity and the use of supervisory judgement,” according to the oversight group’s press release . And the Financial Times cited “ people familiar with the move ” as saying the decision was related to a surge in the value of the U.S. dollar, which automatically boosts American banks’ risk rankings. Yet it also followed the election victory of Trump, who has promised several times to dispose of a law that sought to mitigate the systemic risks posed by American megabanks—risks that helped set off the 2008 financial crisis. \nIn an Oct. 20 interview with Fox Business’ Stuart Varney , Trump said he believed \"we have to get rid of Dodd-Frank,\" referring to the 2010 law that required banks to keep higher reserves available, avoid predatory lending and keep their customer services and speculative trading activities separate. Many have expressed worries for the financial industry in light of Trump’s Nov. 8 upset, with some arguing that the “laissez-faire” proposals could send the U.S. into another financial crisis . \nThe President-elect’s website has explicity expressed its opposition to Dodd-Frank. \n\"The Dodd-Frank economy does not work for working people. Bureaucratic red tape and Washington mandates are not the answer,\" a note from the site says. \"The Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.\" Join the Discussion Everything You Need To Know, Right Now. \nThe IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.

      "text": "(VIDEO) Bank Of America Sees More Dynamic Segmentation As Addressable TV Grows 11/22/2016 11:25 am ET Andy Plesser \nMIAMI - Having just dipped its toes into addressable television advertising, Bank of America is planning additional campaigns and looks forward to being able to do sequential messaging to specific consumer targets. \"I think there's a ton of opportunity in the space,\" says SVP of Marketing Andrew Deming. \nThe company's overall goal is a shift to one-to-one marketing and a more relationship-driven model as opposed to the \"old transactional-style, product-driven model,\" Deming says in an interview with Beet.TV conducted by Tracey Scheppach , who recently launched the Matter More Media consultancy. \nBOA will still have an umbrella brand message that it pushes out to the masses to tell its brand story. \"But then when it comes down to each different audience group, we can deliver to individuals within them messages that are relevant and resonate to them,\" Deming says. \nFor example, people looking for their first credit card would receive a specific pitch. \"But if you already have a credit card with bank of America and you're just recently married and are looking for a home loan, we can provide different home loans and mortgage solutions for you,\" he adds. \nAsked by Scheppach about BOA's recent experience with addressable TV ads, Deming notes, \"I think we've really just cracked the surface on it by launching our first campaign there. We're working on one, possibly two, additional addressable campaigns. It will be in a very similar vein to what we did the first time.\" \nAs technology evolves in the addressable space and the national footprint gets larger, Deming hopes to drive sequential messaging aligned with consumer needs. \n\"We can have more dynamic segmentation where we can actually have one group that's in a segment for investing products but they may be in a different segment for cards,\" Deming says. \nOne irony for BOA in an age of split-second digital ad delivery is the time it takes to prepare for an addressable campaign because of confidentiality surrounding its first-party data. \n\"It's an asset and also a complexity at the same time when you have access to your own first-party data,\" he says. \"In our world, we need to be thinking nine months in advance and we need to be sizing and beginning to start seeking approval on the use of data six months in advance.\" \nThis interview was conducted at Beet Retreat 2016: The Transformation of Television Advertising , an executive retreat presented by Videology with AT&T AdWorks and the 605 .

      "text": "November 22, 2016 2:21 PM Bank of America trader says he had panic attack after boss’s ‘abuse’ \nBy Patrick Gower Order Reprint of this Story \nA Bank of America trader said in a lawsuit that he had panic attacks after his boss assaulted him and made racist comments about his French and Lebanese heritage. \nMaurice Marco, who is still an executive on the bank’s Euro Commercial Paper team, said in a witness statement at a London court Tuesday that his boss, Anthony Dullaghan, referred to some clients as “French rats” and called a Middle Eastern customer a derogatory term involving a camel. A lawyer for the Charlotte-based bank countered that Marco exaggerated and took his shirt off during a heated argument. \nMarco, who is suing for racial discrimination, told the employment tribunal that he had panic attacks after Dullaghan assaulted him during a disagreement when Dullaghan was “pushing the index fingers of both hands firmly” into his chest and asked Marco to “sort this out outside.” \n“My anxiety has changed every aspect of my existence. I am in a dark place,” Marco said. “I often wake bathed in sweat and gripped with fear, I start hyperventilating, my chest feels tight like a vice and I feel extremely claustrophobic.” \nBank attorney Sophie Belgrove said Dullaghan, who no longer works at the lender, had given a different account of the disagreement and suggested Marco had exaggerated. \n“You were shouting at Mr. Dullaghan and you were being aggressive,” she said. “You took your shirt off altogether and stood there bare-chested.” \nElspeth Lynch, associate general counsel and managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, declined to comment. Dullaghan, through Lynch, also declined to comment. \nMarco is one of half a dozen executives to sue banks at London’s employment tribunals in recent months. Winnings are capped at about 80,000 pounds ($99,000) unless claimants can prove they were victims of discrimination or abused for blowing the whistle on corporate misconduct. \nThe trial started Tuesday after both sides failed to reach a settlement during noisy talks outside the courtroom. \nMost of the first day’s evidence focused on the altercation that Marco said left him suffering with anxiety. One employee who witnessed the argument said Marco was the aggressor and was shouting louder than Dullaghan, Belgrove said. \nMarco’s witness statement listed about half a dozen exchanges with Dullaghan that he claims amounted to “racist abuse.” \nIn 2009, when Marco began training for a pilot’s license, Dullaghan joked that due to his Lebanese background he might be “a terrorist who had learned to fly in order to carry out a suicide bombing using an aircraft akin to the 9/11 attacks,” according to Marco’s statement. \nIn January 2015, when Marco was moving to a new house, Dullaghan asked in front his team whether the police had “cordoned the neighborhood off” because “usually when highly explosive materials are transported the police cordon off the area,” he said in the statement.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nThe U.S. government let a high-profile mortgage case against Bank of America quietly fizzle out this week. \nThe Department of Justice had until Monday to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to take up its “Hustle” lawsuit against the Charlotte-based bank. In May, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed findings against the bank in the 2012 case, the first civil fraud suit brought by the Justice Department over home loans sold to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nA Justice Department spokeswoman did not comment on the decision to let Monday’s deadline pass. A Bank of America spokesman also declined to comment. \nNamed after a program at Countrywide Financial, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, the case was initially brought by former Countrywide executive Ed O’Donnell under a federal whistleblower statute. \nThe government, which took over the case, claimed Hustle rapidly processed loans without regard for their quality in the run-up to the financial crisis, resulting in thousands of fraudulent loans being sold to Fannie and Freddie and later defaulting. Countrywide marketed the “toxic products” as investment grade despite their poor quality, the government alleged, calling Hustle a “spectacularly brazen” loan-origination program. \nIn 2014, a federal judge ruled in the case that Bank of America should pay $1.27 billion in civil penalties and that former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone should pay $1 million. That ruling came after a jury’s findings against the bank and Mairone. \nBut in this year’s ruling, a three-judge panel of the appeals court overturned the jury’s findings and tossed out the penalties against the bank and Mairone. The judges said there was insufficient evidence that Countrywide committed mail and wire fraud in late 2007 and 2008. \nThat decision delivered a blow to the Obama administration’s attempts to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the financial crisis. \nThe government then asked the appeals court to reconsider its decision, but that request was denied.",

Bank of America Suffers 'Sporadic' Teller System Outages 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue \nConsumers flooded Twitter and downdetector.com with complaints that Bank of America's teller system was down Tuesday afternoon. \nA bank spokeswoman contacted late in the afternoon said everything was operating normally. \"Some of our tellers were having sporadic issues with their terminals, but they were able to serve customers manually,\" Jumana Bauwens said. \"Also, there were no issues with ATMs or any other services.\" \nShe declined to answer questions about possible causes. \nThe problems seemed to peak around 2 p.m. Eastern, when downdetector.com – a website that tracks outages and other disruptions based on information from consumers and other sources – received 203 reports of B of A system outages. The complaints appeared to be tapering off late in the day. \nThe timing of the outage was unfortunate, as consumers expressed frustration at not being able to get cash before the long Thanksgiving weekend and at being thwarted from holiday shopping. So what is up with Bank of America today. Turning customers away. System down since 8am ET. #BoA #BankofAmerica — Random Bot (@eaglefeather4) November 22, 2016 I'm here at Bank of America and they are telling me that teller operations are down nationwide. — Jack Gately (@gatelywire) November 22, 2016 I wanted to do some online Christmas shopping today but Bank Of America's system is down nationwide?",

      "text": "By Minda Smiley - 23 November 2016 17:01pm Credit: YouTube \nTo promote its Cash Rewards credit card ahead of the holidays, Bank of America has rolled out a 30-second spot that features a young boy named Danny who is forced to run boring errands with his parents. \nHowever, Danny's shopping trip with his parents becomes much more exciting when his parents begin to transform into the very action figures and toys that he is dreaming about getting for Christmas. \nThe insight behind the campaign is that the cash rewards credit card used to do things like buy groceries and get gas is also the one that helps you purchase the Christmas gifts your children are wishing for. \nCreated by Hill Holliday, the spot has been voted by readers as US Creative Work of the Week. 15 November 2016 Hill Holliday Overall Rating 5 /5 Vote \nIf you’d like to vote for next week’s US Creative Work of the Week, visit our US Creative Works here .

      "text": "Bank of America Corp.'s stock BAC, +1.40% climbed 1.4% in active afternoon trade Wednesday, as a rise in Treasury yields helped push it up to an eight-year high. Volume of over 67 million shares made the stock the most actively traded on the major U.S. exchanges. The stock, on track to close at the highest level since Nov. 5, 2008, has now run up 21% in the 11 sessions since the election. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 0.041 percentage points (4.1 basis points) to 2.362%, putting it on track for the highest close since July 20, 2015, in the wake of stronger-than-expected durable goods orders data and a jump in consumer sentiment . The yield has run up 50 basis points since the election , on concerns that promised infrastructure spending could boost economic growth while also increasing the government's budget deficit. BofA's stock has now run up 22% year to date, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.49% has climbed 16% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.04% has gained 7.8%.",

      "text": "The S&P 500 index may have stormed into the record books after Election Day, but the benchmark remains likely to give back some of those recent gains before the year is over, says one prominent Wall Street analyst.\nSavita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, exercised some cautious optimism in a late Tuesday note by increasing her year-end S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% target to 2,100 from 2,000, accounting for the recent rally in stocks but noting there are still possible macro shocks on the horizon over the next month.\n“There are still potential catalysts for macro shocks through the end of the year ( OPEC meeting , Italian Referendum , central bank meetings, etc.), but the market has sailed through some of this year’s biggest shocks,” including Britain’s June vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. presidential election earlier this month, Subramanian said.\nThe S&P 500 is currently trading up above 2,200 following its first close above that level on Tuesday . A drop to 2,100 by the end of the year would be a 4.6% drop, but would still leave the index up 2.7% for the year.\nThat plants Subramanian’s target right around the current 200-day moving average of the S&P 500 of 2,101.45, which had fallen to a year-to-date low of 2,010.81 on May 25.\nRead: Stock market’s record November shouldn’t scare off Santa Claus\nWhile valuation models suggest an even lower target of 1,942, Subramanian said that’s balanced out by still-bearish sentiment toward stocks—a contrarian buy signal—and analyst earnings estimate revisions, which target the S&P 500 at 2,235 and 2,203, respectively.\nBack in February, Subramanian cut her S&P 500 target to 2,000 from an initial target of 2,200 before the year began.\nMore from MarketWatch Tom DeMark now sees 5%-6% retreat for stock market in wake of Trump rally Sessions, Pompeo Tapped as Trump Cabinet Picks Giuliani’s Trump-Like Audition for Secretary of State Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch\nResilient stocks still have potential speed bumps ahead\nThe S&P 500 index may have stormed into the record books after Election Day, but the benchmark remains likely to give back some of those recent gains before the year is over, says one prominent Wall Street analyst.\nSavita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, exercised some cautious optimism in a late Tuesday note by increasing her year-end S&P 500 target to 2,100 from 2,000, accounting for the recent rally in stocks but noting there are still possible macro shocks on the horizon over the next month.\n\"There are still potential catalysts for macro shocks through the end of the year (OPEC meeting (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-stretch-rally-further-on-optimism-over-an-opec-deal-2016-11-22), Italian Referendum (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-search-for-direction-as-miners-rise-italian-banks-drop-2016-11-23), central bank meetings, etc.), but the market has sailed through some of this year's biggest shocks,\" including Britain's June vote to leave the European Union and the U.S. presidential election earlier this month, Subramanian said.\nThe S&P 500 is currently trading up above 2,200 following its first close above that level on Tuesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-on-track-to-knock-out-fresh-record-highs-2016-11-22). A drop to 2,100 by the end of the year would be a 4.6% drop, but would still leave the index up 2.7% for the year.\nThat plants Subramanian's target right around the current 200-day moving average of the S&P 500 of 2,101.45, which had fallen to a year-to-date low of 2,010.81 on May 25.\nRead: Stock market's record November shouldn't scare off Santa Claus (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-record-november-points-to-strong-december-2016-11-23)\nWhile valuation models suggest an even lower target of 1,942, Subramanian said that's balanced out by still-bearish sentiment toward stocks--a contrarian buy signal--and analyst earnings estimate revisions, which target the S&P 500 at 2,235 and 2,203, respectively.\nBack in February, Subramanian cut her S&P 500 target to 2,000 from an initial target of 2,200 before the year began.\n-Wallace Witkowski; 24-16 0407ET\n ",

      "text": "CHARLOTTE, NC (WBTV) - A bipartisan group of more than 40 Connecticut legislators has written a letter to Charlotte-based Bank of America inviting the corporation to relocate its corporate headquarters to Connecticut.\nThe letter, addressed to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, was sent Tuesday.\nNorth Carolina’s new law, House Bill 2 - signed March 23 by Gov. Pat McCrory, limits legal protections of LGBT individuals by setting a statewide definition of protected classes of citizens. The new law means schools and local governments cannot adopt more inclusive rules.\nLegislative leaders say they were responding to Charlotte’s non-discrimination ordinance, which would have allowed transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify.\nAfter the passage of House Bill 2, Bank of America released a statement:\nBank of America has been steadfast in our commitment to nondiscrimination and in our support for LGBT employees through progressive workplace policies and practices. We support public policies that support non discrimination.\nTuesday, Connecticut lawmakers sent Moynihan a letter saying they \"hope Governor McCrory and the North Carolina legislature listen to your call.\" It goes on to invite Moynihan to move the headquarters, currently located in Charlotte, to Connecticut.\nWEB EXTRA: Click here to read the letter\n“Connecticut is home to world class financial institutions,” Rep. Matthew Lesser said. “We invite Bank of America to consider moving to a state that shares its social values and supports its LGBT workforce. We welcome Bank of America and major North Carolina financial institutions threatened by their state’s reckless actions.”\nLesser noted that Bank of America is already expanding its footprint in Connecticut and applauded recent moves by the company including an expansion of paid family and medical leave.\n\"If the State of North Carolina insists on standing on the wrong side of history by keeping this law on the books, we are more than happy to invite Bank of America to join us in Connecticut, where we are proud to stand with the LGBT community,\" said Sen. Gary Winfield. \"We have a proven track record of upholding the rights of individuals in this community. We too are appalled by HB2.\"\nThe letter was signed by dozens of legislators.\nBank of America sent WBTV a statement about the request.\n\"We have been serving customers and communities in Connecticut for more than 200 years and have more than 3,000 teammates in the state now,\" the statement read. \"We appreciate the support of the elected officials across the state as reflected in the letter today.\"\nMcCrory spokesman Graham Wilson said he was unfamiliar with the Bank of America relocation discussion when asked about it Tuesday night.\nConnecticut's Banking Committee chairs would not rule out targeting other North Carolina financial institutions, including Wells Fargo and PayPal, both of which have strongly opposed the new law.\n ",

      "text": "The Offer Some people are seeing an amazing deal Bank Amerideals on their credit/debit cards.\nGet $75 cash back: Must make two separate transactions with AT&T on wireless products or services of at least $15.00 on the card associated with this offer by 2/18/2017 Last time this deal was around there was actually three versions of this offer:\nGet $100 credit after making two $15 purchases Get $75 credit after making two $15 purchases (shown above) Get $50 credit after making two $15 purchases The Fine Print Valid in-store or online at at&t.com or over the phone Must make two separate transactions of $15 or more on the card associated with this offer by 2/18/2017 The $50/$75/$100 cash back is earned within 30 days Our Verdict This is an awesome deal and it’s a money maker regardless of if you’re with AT&T or not. I’ll repeat what we said last time this deal was offered :\n“Simply buy an accessory (charger, etc.) for $15 at an AT&T store or online at att.com (see this comment if you’re doing it online), repeat a second time, and get back $75. Net profit will be $45, plus some free accessories. Make sure to make the purchases at a corporate store, not an Authorized Retailer.\nSomeone mentions the idea of buying a $25 refill card from an AT&T store which would work for prepaid plans. Not sure if it’s possible to buy a gift card for a post-paid plan too.\nA reader confirms that making $15 payments to your AT&T cellular bill or Uverse internet bill counts to trigger the credit.”\nHat tip to reader Wyle & @HeyCrutch \n \nThe post Bank of America: $100/$75/$50 Back for Spending $30 at AT&T [Targeted] – Money Maker appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "The Truth About Bank Of America's Meteoric RIse Nov.28.16 \nBank of America has been on an absolutely incredible run over the last month. \nDoes performance justify this run which has been fueled by a Trump election victory? \nAn examination of the key metrics. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) has been on an absolutely incredible run over the last month. Just take a look at the returns in figure 1. Since the election of Donald Trump, the financial sector has been red hot, as have many other sectors. Bank of America is up nearly 25% in a month. That kind of move means one of two things are about to happen. Either the stock is about to be pulled back to Earth by gravity, or the growth is going to continue and the stock will hone in on $25. But I absolutely do not see the stock simply leveling off and trading sideways at $20-$21 the next few months. At the end of the day, it comes down to performance. Forget about the \"what-ifs,\" the short-term trading impacts on the stock due to \"a December rate hike.\" Etc. These things matter, but growth in the key metrics, and ultimately the top and bottom lines are what truly matter. Figure 1. One month price action in Bank of America stock. Click to enlarge Source: Google Finance When I say performance not just on the top and bottom lines but also in several key metrics, I am specifically referring to those that I follow closely for all major banks. Look, clearly Bank of America has come a long way from when it once was facing extinction, and it took a bailout to stay alive. Fast forward almost a decade and today Bank of America is one of the largest banks in the United States by assets and yes, it has recovered from the Great Recession. Is it firing on all cylinders like it was pre-recession? No, certainly it is not, but it has emerged as what now seems like a growth stock. The stock itself has ebbed and flowed but it has come back from the brink. The bank is set up to do well in the coming years especially in light of the forthcoming interest rate hikes by the Fed. Let me be clear. I am behind Bank of America long-term. I think it is set for growth and in turn, the stock should provide decent returns. But after this recent 25% jump, some may be considering jumping in, but before you do so we need to examine the company's most recent earnings and key metrics. It may be boring but is critical to look for a growing loan and deposit record, a decent efficiency ratio, as well as of course revenues and earnings. The reason is because this is the bread and butter of a bank. Without these underlying metrics in line, it doesn't matter. These metrics can give us an indication of where the bank is heading, and can help us separate the strong from the weak in the sector. Now look, Bank of America is massive and while it is true that it will benefit from rising rates, slow and steady growth is most desirable from a bank of this size. Keeping in mind the recent run-up, how is the name doing? In Bank of America's most recent quarter, the bank saw a top line and bottom line number that beat analyst estimates. That is excellent. Certainly supports upping your expectations. The quarter was pretty decent overall. Revenue was $21.6 billion, up 3.1% year-over-year. It was nice to see the company break a trend of year-over-year declines. With this rise, revenue also beat expectations by a hefty $700 million. The company also saw a bump in earnings which is a plus. Last year, the company saw earnings per share of $0.38 per share, or $4.6 billion. This year net income jumped to $5.0 billion and earnings per share increased 8% to $0.41. I will point out that this was a nice beat versus expectations of $0.08. Now of course we need to consider what drove these results? The answer lies in the bank's net interest income and non-interest income, two of the biggest sources of cash for the company. Net interest income was $10.2 billion up 3% from the $9.9 billion in Q2 2015. Non-interest income was also up year-over-year. It came in at $11.4 billion. This is up versus the $11.1 billion last year. On a real positive note, another 1.32 million credit cards were backed, which bodes well for future potential interest income as well as fees generated from the use of these cards. Above nearly all else, the most under-appreciated, yet critical metric to look at, is the efficiency ratio. But for whatever reason, still so many opinion makers ignore it. Huge mistake. I will remind you that the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue. The efficiency ratios in each of the business segments improved year-over-year. The highest efficiency was in Global Banking, where the ratio was 45%. The worst ratio was in Global Wealth and Investment Management, where it was 74%. Still, the metrics are improving across the board and I will continue to closely monitor these stats. And then there is the bread and butter of the bank, loan and deposits. Growth of these two measures is key, as these are the most basic fundamentals of any bank. That said, we need to see loan and deposit growth. On this front, the bank is doing well. Loans were up across the board, rising to $905 billion in the quarter, up from $903.2 billion just last quarter. Total average deposits were up year-over-year. They rose to $1.25 trillion in Q3 2016, from $1.15 trillion last year. Finally, we need to be aware of non-performing assets. I was pleased to see that non-performing loans decreased to $8.73 billion, down from $8.8 billion last quarter and down from almost $10.3 billion in Q3 2015. When considering we have a stock that just rose 25% when nothing has really changed except that there is expectations of a better business climate ahead, we need to go back to the fundamentals to understand what to do with the name. And the key metrics are solid. With interest rates rising into the future, it can only help net interest income longer-term. A Trump Presidency may indeed bode well for the banks, but the banks have certainly performed well in the last few years as well. That said, as interest rates do rise (and they would have regardless of who occupied the White House), the largest banks stand to gain. I maintain a buy rating on Bank of America for the long-term, and believe the stock will continue to march toward $25. Note from the author: Christopher F.

      "text": "Bobby Yip/Reuters \n\nBank of America 's stock has been on a tear since the presidential election, with analysts and investors speculating that the incoming Trump administration will push through policies that will make it easier for banks to make money.\nTo get a sense for how optimistic Bank of America investors are, all you need to do is look at a chart of its stock over the last few years. See that sharp upturn on the far right? That's because of the election.\nBut even though this rally has been great for Bank of America's current investors, myself included, it could lead prospective investors in the nation's second-biggest bank by assets to stay on the sideline, concluding that there isn't any upside left in its stock.\nThe upside in bank stocks I'm sympathetic to this argument. Over the past week in fact, I've even considered that now may be a good time to sell my shares, given that they've risen more than 70% since I bought them at the beginning of the year.\nThere are two things that keep me from doing so, however. The first is that I'm well aware that investors can rarely call the top. Research has shown that trying to time the market is never a good strategy upon which to base your investing.\nSecond and just as important, it isn't unreasonable to think that Bank of America's stock could still head higher from here. And it could do so in December if  higher interest rates come to fruition .\nThe narrative around bank stocks right now revolves around rising rates. Holding all else equal, if rates go higher, so too will bank profits. And if bank profits head higher, so too should bank stock prices.\nThis is because banks generate revenue by originating loans and then holding them on their balance sheets -- the higher the interest rate they're able to get on their loans, the more money they make.\nBobby Yip/Reuters \nAs I've  noted frequently of late , Bank of America says it'll earn $5.3 billion in additional net interest income in the 12 months after short- and long-term rates rise by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point.\nLong-term rates have already headed in this direction. You can see this in a chart of the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the most frequently cited long-term interest rate benchmark.\nAt the beginning of October -- after Bank of America estimated the impact of higher rates on its income statement -- the 10-year Treasury yield was 1.6%. Fast-forward to today and it's nearly 2.4%. That equates to an improvement of nearly 80 basis points.\nThe big question now is whether short-term rates will follow suit. This depends on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has signaled that the central bank is looking to increase rates \"relatively soon.\" And  minutes from its most recent meeting , held on the first two days of this month, showed that officials at the central bank wanted the economy to continue improving before they pulled the trigger on higher rates. Since then,  that's exactly what's happened , with a wave of positive economic news coming out.\nThe net result is that the Fed could very well end the year with a rate hike, much like it did last year. And if it does so, it'll reinforce the bull case for Bank of America's stock.\nNOW WATCH: Why almost every pair of jeans has a zipper that says ‘YKK’ \n",

      "text": "Bobby Yip/Reuters\nBank of America 's stock has been on a tear since the presidential election, with analysts and investors speculating that the incoming Trump administration will push through policies that will make it easier for banks to make money.\nTo get a sense for how optimistic Bank of America investors are, all you need to do is look at a chart of its stock over the last few years. See that sharp upturn on the far right? That's because of the election.\nBut even though this rally has been great for Bank of America's current investors, myself included, it could lead prospective investors in the nation's second-biggest bank by assets to stay on the sideline, concluding that there isn't any upside left in its stock.\nThe upside in bank stocks I'm sympathetic to this argument. Over the past week in fact, I've even considered that now may be a good time to sell my shares, given that they've risen more than 70% since I bought them at the beginning of the year.\nThere are two things that keep me from doing so, however. The first is that I'm well aware that investors can rarely call the top. Research has shown that trying to time the market is never a good strategy upon which to base your investing.\nSecond and just as important, it isn't unreasonable to think that Bank of America's stock could still head higher from here. And it could do so in December if higher interest rates come to fruition .\nThe narrative around bank stocks right now revolves around rising rates. Holding all else equal, if rates go higher, so too will bank profits. And if bank profits head higher, so too should bank stock prices.\nThis is because banks generate revenue by originating loans and then holding them on their balance sheets -- the higher the interest rate they're able to get on their loans, the more money they make.\nFederal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2016, before the Senate Banking Committee hearing on: 'The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.' Susan Walsh/AP\nAs I've noted frequently of late , Bank of America says it'll earn $5.3 billion in additional net interest income in the 12 months after short- and long-term rates rise by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point.\nLong-term rates have already headed in this direction. You can see this in a chart of the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the most frequently cited long-term interest rate benchmark.\nAt the beginning of October -- after Bank of America estimated the impact of higher rates on its income statement -- the 10-year Treasury yield was 1.6%. Fast-forward to today and it's nearly 2.4%. That equates to an improvement of nearly 80 basis points.\nThe big question now is whether short-term rates will follow suit. This depends on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has signaled that the central bank is looking to increase rates \"relatively soon.\" And minutes from its most recent meeting , held on the first two days of this month, showed that officials at the central bank wanted the economy to continue improving before they pulled the trigger on higher rates. Since then, that's exactly what's happened , with a wave of positive economic news coming out.\nThe net result is that the Fed could very well end the year with a rate hike, much like it did last year. And if it does so, it'll reinforce the bull case for Bank of America's stock.\nRead the original article on The Motley Fool . Copyright 2016.

      "text": "The postelection spike higher in Bank of America Corp.’s stock may still be less than half over, some analysts say, given the potential boost that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies could provide to the banking giant and others in the financial sector.\nShares of the moneycenter bank BAC, +0.25% climbed 1% in active morning trade, to sit just below Friday’s eight-year closing high of $20.86. With volume of over 55 million shares, the stock was the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges.\nB. of A.’s shares have rocketed 21% since the election, as investors expect the Republican sweep of the White House and Congress will relieve the regulatory pressure the banking sector has faced since the financial crisis. That compares with an 11% run-up in the SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.16% and a 3% gain in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.27% over the same time.\nDon’t miss : Why the rally by U.S. stocks is ‘just getting started’ -- in one chart .\nAnalyst Steven Chubak at Instinet said he believes the Trump “Goldilocks” scenario for banks -- higher interest rates, improved economic growth and reduced regulations -- hasn't yet been fully priced in by investors, leaving more than 20% further upside to B. of A.’s stock. Read more about what Trump means for every U.S. industry .\nChubak’s fair value estimate for the stock is $25, which is 22% above current levels, and would be the highest price seen since Oct. 24, 2008.\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said that despite the stock already having the best performance among its peers, he believes it “still has room to move,” given the improved regulatory backdrop and expectations that longer-term rates will continue to rise faster than expected. He upgraded B. of A. to outperform from market perform, and lifted his stock-price target to $23.00 -- 12% above current levels -- from $17.50.\nKleinhanzl said he projects the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.31% to reach 2.5% by the end of 2017, and 2.75% by the end of 2018, compared with the current yield of 2.3%. See Bond Report .\nHigher long-term interest rates can boost bank profits, as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.\nMeanwhile, Chubak and Kleinhanzl disagree about the outlook for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, +0.85% stock in a Trump world. Kleinhanzl upgraded Goldman to outperform from market perform, as he believes Trump’s policies will lead to a better trading environment for fixed income, currencies and commodities, which suits the broker relatively well.\nChubak went the other way, downgrading Goldman to neutral from buy. He believes the stock’s 17% surge since the election already prices in the “full gamut” of potential Trump tailwinds, given its already low tax rate, heavier international exposure and relatively lower sensitivity to interest rates.\nDonald Trump Outlines Plans in Video Message (2:45) President-elect Donald Trump released a video statement on YouTube Monday outlining his agenda for his first 100 days in office. Trump has yet to hold a press conference since the election. Photo/Video: Transition 2017 via YouTube\nSeparately, Chubak said he also believes LPL Financial Holdings Inc.’s stock LPLA, -0.68% , which has soared 22% since the election, is now “slightly rich,” while shares of Stifel Financial Corp. SF, +0.16% and Raymond James Financial Inc. RJF, -0.17% still have greater-than 20% upside potential from current levels.\nIf B. of A.’s stock reached Chubak’s fair value estimate, it will have climbed nearly eightfold from its 25-year closing low of $3.14 on March 6, 2009. However, it will have only retraced 42% of the financial-crisis-led decline (94%) from its Nov. 20, 2006 all-time closing high of $54.90.\nMore from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: The Nikki Haley Pick Jared Kushner’s Businesses Raise Conflict of Interest Issues What the world’s top investors read every morning Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing",

      "title": "Allegiant Air’s co-branded credit card deemed a success",
      "text": "Allegiant Air’s co-branded credit card, offered through a partnership with Bank of America and MasterCard, is only two months old, but already being deemed a hit with consumers by the Las Vegas-based airline.\nAirline executives gave details of the credit card and several other of the company’s revenue-generating initiatives in a four-hour investor day presentation Tuesday for about 40 analysts and representatives of investment companies.\nAllegiant officials say the credit card could generate $10 million in incremental revenue for the company next year and $45 million by 2020.\nWhile Allegiant’s executives expect 2017 to be a year that the company “catches its breath,” according to Chief Operating Officer Jude Bricker, it’ll be a time when the airline — the sixth busiest operating at McCarran International Airport — makes strides toward fixing some of the operational issues that has plagued it over the past year and a half.\nAllegiant is in the midst of a 10-year plan to retire all of its aging twin-engine MD-80 aircraft in favor of refleeting to newer Airbus A320-series jets.\nIn 2017, Allegiant will acquire five used Airbus A319 jets, four used A320s and nine new A320s while retiring its four Boeing 757s and eight of its MD-80s.\nWhile the acquisitions and retirements will increase and accelerate depreciation expenses, it’ll also improve fuel economy and avoid heavy maintenance expenses on the calendar for the oldest jets.\nNext year also will be the first full year of Allegiant’s new pilot contract with the Teamsters union. The contract adds an estimated $30 million to $35 million in salaries and benefits, but should lower attrition and generate a higher number of applicants for pilot openings.\nAs part of Allegiant’s plan, the airline will acquire 12 new jets, a strategy the airline has never undertaken. Through the life of the company, Allegiant has acquired and flown used aircraft as a means to save money.\nBut using older aircraft has had its downfalls. In 2014 and 2015, Allegiant reported more than 25 instances of flights requiring unscheduled maintenance stops or failures to complete flights due to mechanical issues.\nBricker told investors Allegiant is focused on flying its last Boeing 757 flights next year and the last of its MD-80s by 2019. During the transition, Allegiant will nearly double the number of spare A320s in its fleet from seven to 13 to have reliable planes available as the MD-80s are phased out.\nIn addition to building its all-Airbus fleet, Allegiant plans to undertake a plan to add seats to its A320s to increase capacity of each plane from 177 to 186 seats. The company successfully deployed the same seat conversion strategy on its MD-80 jets from 150 to 166 seats in 2010.\nBricker said the seat modification plan would boost revenue by $27 million by 2020.\nLast year was a banner year for Allegiant’s route map expansion, adding 26 new cities — 20 percent of all of its routes.\nBut it’s the new credit card that may get most of the public’s attention.\nBrian Davis, Allegiant’s vice president of marketing, said the airline is in the process of testing, learning and optimizing e-commerce and credit card strategies through a series of 200 consumer tests — and only four have been tried so far.\nThe company is emphasizing the card’s ease of use and simplicity. Card owners accumulate points through purchases with three points acquired per dollar spent on every Allegiant Travel purchase, two points on qualifying dining purchases and one point on all other buys. The company is offering 15,000 bonus points, equal to $150 on a trip purchase, awarded after $1,000 or more in purchases are made within the first 90 days of card ownership.\nThe “myAllegiant” points have no blackout dates, no destination restrictions and no minimum points required for redemptions. In addition, points won’t expire as long as the card is used once every 12 months.\nPersons holding Allegiant-branded credit cards get early boarding on flights and free drinks onboard, a benefit that is expected to be visible to other passengers at gates and attract attention from those travelers.\nAllegiant won’t say how many credit cards it has issued, but said the total is exceeding expectations of Bank of America and the airline.\nDavis said its e-commerce platform would expand next year with American Express and PayPal purchases to be allowed in addition to Visa, MasterCard and Discover purchases now. The company also will begin offering discounts for round-trip fares, but will also initiate automatic flight cancellations on remaining flight legs if the first flight segment isn’t used.\nShares of Allegiant fell 70 cents, or 0.42 percent, to close at 166.30 -0.70. They are down 0.9 percent for the year.\nContact Richard N. Velotta at rvelotta@reviewjournal.com or 702-477-3893. Follow @RickVelotta on Twitter.\nLas Vegas hotels,...",

      "text": "The Bank of America's stock, being the most heavily traded stock on the S&P 500, may have high volatility but also holds potential for long-term hold as it is positioned to benefit from new regulations and a rise in rates.\nAdvertisement In the mid-2016, shares in the Bank of America Corp were on a 30% loss year-to-date, but now it has come back on course as its stock is up 20% for the year. It has shown progress in trading, loans and cost cuts.\nBAC's price-to-book ratio has been climbing for more than three months as it rose from 0.55 midsummer to 0.68. There is an improvement in BAC stock's relative performance since June.\nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expect the broader banking sector to gain benefits from higher interest rates and lighter regulations .\nKBW noted on the bank sector's return on tangible common equity or ROTCE next year.\n\"In our breakdown of bank profitability today compared to the period of peak profitability in the early 2000s, we roughly estimate that industry ROTCEs could move up 200 basis points from the current level of 12.3% under a possible scenario of higher interest rates and reduced regulation, assuming no change in tax rates. This suggests that a further 16% upside to the [KBW Nasdaq Bank Index] is possible based on today's overall market values.\"\nKBW also noted that the \"ability of banks to demonstrate higher profitability will take time and the avoidance of major credit issues.\"\nAdvertisement Based on this report, if the corporate tax rate were to drop by 10%, it would bring a 2% boost on profitability.\nGiven Bank of America Corp's exposure to an interest-rate hike, its stocks should outperform. And its shares being heavily traded , investors would not need to worry about buying into it and selling their stock later.\n BAC Stock In Position As the Best In The Sector RE/MAX LLC OKs 3 Independent Regions Purchase Foreclosure Shocks Region Buildings Owners Snow Cover Sand Over Saudi Arabia Regions Oil and Gas Production Regions.

      "text": "How Yields Impact Banks Like Bank Of America, Citigroup, And JPMorgan Chase & Co. Nov.30.16 Summary \nBanks are benefiting from the recent surge in bond yields thanks to an expected rise in inflation. \nCharts show a historical correlation between bank earnings, stock prices, and yields. \nVolatility in yields significantly impacts the stock prices of Citigroup, Bank Of America, and JPMorgan Chase & Co by double-digit percentages. In this article is a brief historical analysis of yields and the impact on bank stock prices and profits. By no means is it exhaustive and I'm not a financial advisor nor am I making a buy or sell recommendation. One of the ways banks generate income is by lending, and since loan rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury, any rise in yields typically leads to higher earnings for banks. This correlation exists because, the 10-year yield is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other lending products. In other words, think of any rise in yields as an increase in pricing- power for banks. Companies earn profits by selling their goods above cost. Well, banks are no different. Banks need yields to rise so they can charge a wider loan spread on their loans. The loan spread is simply the difference between the rate the Fed charges banks and what banks, in turn, charge their customers. The sentiment of financials benefiting in a higher yield market was echoed by Credit Suisse in early November. \n\"Normally, cyclicals outperform when bond yields rise, but U.S. cyclicals already seem to be pricing in a 2.4 percent U.S. 10-year yield; valuations are expensive in the U.S. ... Hence, we prefer to play rising yields through financials.\" CNBC Interview. Inflation and the Fed play a key role. As inflation expectations pick up, so does the expectation of more Fed hikes, which in turn, drives the 10-year yield higher. This is true since the Fed typically combats inflation by raising the Fed Funds Rate. The recent run-up in yields and subsequently bank stock prices have been as a result of anticipation of higher inflation due to possible fiscal stimulus by the Trump administration. Any rise in inflation might force the Fed to hike rates more than expected in 2017 and beyond. Caution about inflation and bank stocks: Any change in inflation expectations to the downside may crush the current surge in bank stocks. Be mindful of the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) because it's not only an effective measure of inflation in the U.S. but it's also one of the Fed's favorite indicators. \nAnyone long bank stocks should be cautious leading up to any future PCE releases, as it can trigger your stop-losses rather quickly. Historical correlation between banks and 10-year yields: To illustrate the correlation further, let's compare Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), and Citigroup (NYSE: C ) to the 10-year Treasury since 2013. Click to enlarge Although not a one-to-one correlation, we can see from the chart that any large move in the 10-year Treasury yield significantly impacts stock prices for BAC, CITI, and JPM. More on this to follow. Mapping the 10-Year Treasury yields to profits of BAC, CITI, & JPM: Click to enlarge How much are bank profits tied to yields? The above chart is a brief historical comparison between the 10-year Treasury yield and bank profits. 2013 yields surged, but banks suffered from loan losses and litigation from the financial crisis. As a result, bank profits were lackluster. 2014 Q4, banks reported declines in profits and cited the fall in yields towards the end of 2014. (see red arrow on chart) \n\"Profits fell 14% for BAC, 14% for JP Morgan, and 16% for Citi in Q4 2014 as yields fell roughly from 2.4% to 1.95% in 2014's final months.\" From Reuters. 2016 The FDIC reported that bank profits rose in Q3 2016. \n\"The nation's commercial banks and savings institutions reported a 13% rise in net income in the third quarter, hitting a record as institutions' profits soared.\" Nasdaq 11/22/16. Perhaps the recent 13% rise in net income, as a result of higher yields, may already be reflected in today's bank stock prices. With that in mind, let's see how yields have historically impacted the stock prices of our three banks. Correlation of 10-Year Treasury yields to the stock prices of BAC, CITI & JPM: Click to enlarge Please note, the chart shows the percentage change in yields versus the percentage change in stock prices. Again, not a perfect correlation, however, we can safely say that if there's a double-digit move in yields, bank stocks will move significantly. This correlation can aid us in determining whether or not to enter a trade following a substantial fluctuation in yields. And given such a huge run-up in bank stocks this year, the higher yields on the 10-year must at some point correlate to further increases in bank profits. Otherwise, we risk a correction. Another scenario is that yields continue rising sending bank stocks higher. However use caution, since higher yields can have the opposite effect on banks. Why some banks could suffer despite higher yields: Monitoring the housing market. Rising yields may need to be accompanied by a strong housing market in 2017. Why? Banks will not have refinancing income from their with lower interest rates and to offset that decline, banks need new mortgages at the higher yields. If yields rise too fast and result in a decline in new housing purchases; banks could suffer if new mortgage origination declines as well. Remember 2013, when yields surged, and bank stocks soared? Well, profits were higher for BAC but the mortgage division still suffered. \n\"As interest rates have risen in recent months, mortgage refinancing has become less common. On Wednesday, Bank of America said that its mortgage pipeline, or the loans it is preparing to close on, declined by 59 percent in the third quarter, from the same period a year earlier.\" NY Times. Of course today banks are not saddled with the loan losses of 2013 from the financial crisis and the housing market is much improved. However, the housing market will likely be key for banks in the next few years as the Fed attempts to normalize the yield curve. Key takeaways and potential risks to bank stocks: Decline in new mortgages or decline in housing starts can negatively impact banks. Bank stocks have possibly moved too far, too fast as they have yet to report Q4 earnings. Bank stocks are already surging on the anticipation of higher profits in the coming months. Any surprise in earnings to the downside in the coming months may have an exaggerated, negative effect on bank stocks since the market may get caught off guard. Watch inflation. Although typically subdued and well below the Fed's 2% target, any hint of lower inflation due to cheap exports, lower commodity prices (i.e. oil), or lower consumer spending can impact inflation expectations. And remember, inflation doesn't actually need to decline for it to impact the market. Any anticipation of lower inflation can send yields lower and bank stocks with them. If you want proof of this phenomenon, look no further than the current surge in yields and bank stocks; all due to the anticipation of higher inflation and subsequently, additional Fed hikes. Of course, there are a myriad of factors that impact the stock prices of financials, however, yields and anything that drives yields will likely create volatility for banks. In positioning your portfolio risk management strategy: If you're thinking of going long or short financials; you must incorporate an analysis of the 10-year Treasury yield before making a decision.

      "text": "How Yields Impact Banks Like Bank Of America, Citigroup, And JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Seeking Alpha) \nDeutsche Bank raised estimates and price targets on big U.S. banks , as it expects 25–30 percent of EPS upside from stronger economic growth should drive better loan growth and fee revenues, while higher interest rates should aid net interest margins. The sector should also benefit from less regulation and lower tax rates. \nNotably, DB’s U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna recently raised his real GDP growth forecasts to 3 percent in 2017 and 3.3 percent in 2018. \nThe brokerage also upgraded Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) to Buy from Hold, saying the investment bank should benefit from a strong economy, which would boost its capital market businesses. Further, Goldman too is poised for a stronger macro environment given revenue upside, good cost control and a valuation below peers. Banking Trends \nLead analyst Matt O'Connor noted that the bank stocks seem to be pricing in higher rates, but not a stronger economy. The BKX has gained about 15 percent since the election versus a 3 percent rise in the S&P 500. \n“We sense that leverage to higher rates is mostly reflected in stock prices, but that higher lending and fee volumes from a stronger economy may not be,” O'Connor wrote in a note. DB's Changes For The Sector \nFollowing are the hike in price target changes for large cap financial institutions in the United States: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ): $23 from $17.50. Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C ): $61 from $49. Goldman Sachs: $255 from $180. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ): $90 from $73. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ): $43 from $34.

Business Wire Nov30,20169:00AMEST (RED) and Bank of America are once again joining forces on Thursday, December 1, World AIDS Day, to help end mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Africa. Since January 2014, Bank of America has contributed $10 million to the Global Fund through its partnership with (RED), and earlier this year announced its partnership extension that will bring the overall total to fight AIDS to $20 million by 2020. \"As part of World AIDS Day, we encourage our employees and customers to join the fight and help bring an end to mother-to-child transmission of HIV,\" said Anne Finucane, vice chairman at Bank of America. \"Together with our customers, we're helping mothers with HIV live healthy lives and give birth to HIV-free babies. When we do this, we create more economic opportunity by addressing an urgent and solvable health need for mothers and children.\" As part of World AIDS Day 2016, Bank of America is the official payment provider of (SHOPATHON)RED , a month-long holiday shopping campaign that kicked off with a commercial that premiered during ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! on November 22. (SHOPATHON) RED offers hundreds of (RED) products and chances to win once-in-a-lifetime experiences with celebrities. All money raised goes to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Additionally, Bank of America will donate $1, up to $1 million, for every purchase made December 1-7 using a Bank of America debit or credit card linked to Apple Pay. The money raised will support HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan Africa, providing HIV+ mothers access to life-saving medication to ensure their babies are born HIV-free. Learn more about one mother and child who have benefitted from contributions to the Global Fund. (RED) was founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver in 2006 to engage businesses and people in the fight to end AIDS in Africa, where approximately 25 million people are living with HIV/AIDS. To date, (RED) has generated more than $360 million for the Global Fund, impacting the lives of 70 million people. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Bank of America CEO Says Banks Shouldn’t Expect a Quick Payoff on This Investment \nIt may be more than a decade before bank s see substantial benefits from investments they are now making in new payments technologies, Bank of America bac Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Tuesday. \nThe industry has been investing heavily in digital methods of exchanging money, including a U.S. payments network called Zelle. But the cost of processing paper checks and carting around dollars and cents still weighs heavily on big bank s, and it may take 10 to 15 years before that problem goes away, Moynihan said at a conference organized by The Clearinghouse, a trade group focused on payments. \n“Even though mobile wallets, credit cards and debit cards all grow, you still have a lot of cash and a lot of other things, so it will take time for customers to change,” he said in an interview with Reuters following a panel discussion. \nRoughly 10% of Bank of America ‘s costs come from moving coins, currency and checks throughout the bank ing system, Moynihan said during the panel discussion. \nThe Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank reported $32.9 billion in operating costs for the first nine months of this year. \nCredit cards worked as a profitable payment system for the bank ing industry for a long time. However, a 2010 financial reform law placed limits on fees bank s can charge to process transactions, making the business less lucrative. \n“We had this great system called Visa and Mastercard, which we built for years,” said Moynihan, “but it gets attacked on expense.” ",

      "text": "Company logo of the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch is displayed at its office in Hong Kong Thomson Reuters\nBy Elizabeth Dilts\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said on Wednesday it fined Bank of America Merrill Lynch $7 million for inadequate supervision of client brokerage accounts that used leverage to buy Puerto Rican municipal bonds and other securities.\nFINRA found that between 2010 and mid-2013, Merrill Lynch's systems did not adequately enforce policies that govern how clients can use securities-backed loans. Lines of credit, called loan management accounts at Merrill Lynch, allow clients to borrow money using the securities in their portfolios as collateral.\nFINRA found Merrill Lynch's systems failed to ensure the suitability of Puerto Rican municipal bonds and closed-end funds for customers who were highly leveraged through these loans or whose investments were mostly concentrated in Puerto Rican securities.\nFINRA said that 25 customers with modest net worth had three-quarters of their portfolios invested in Puerto Rican securities and lost a total of $1.2 million.\nThe fine includes $780,000 in restitution for those clients.\n\"Following a comprehensive internal review of our loan management accounts, we reported issues to FINRA, cooperated fully with their inquiry and have strengthened our controls and procedures,\" Bank of America spokesman Bill Halldin wrote in an email.\nMerrill Lynch neither admitted nor denied the charges.\n(Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts; Editingnby Steve Orlofsky)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Bank of America on Track to Achieve Consumer-Relief Mandate, Monitor Says  00   BOSTON   Bank of America has conditionally fulfilled 97 percent of its obligation to provide $7 billion worth of consumer relief under its August 2014 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states, Eric D. Green , independent Monitor of the agreement, reported today. Professor Green, in his seventh report on Bank of America's performance under the agreement, said that he and his professional staff conditionally approved an additional $449,827,010 of consumer-relief credit in the most recent reporting period, covering requests for credit that the bank submitted in July and August of 2016. Together with previous submissions, the amount of credit conditionally validated totals $6,803,934,697 , or 97 percent of the $7-billion obligation. The validation is subject, at the close of the bank's consumer-relief activities, to the Monitor's final determination and certification that the bank's efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement. \"Based on credit testing that is underway, it appears that Bank of America is on target to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement this year, well ahead of the four-year deadline,\" Professor Green said. The consumer relief appears to be going where the settling parties intended, Professor Green said. About 53 percent of all loan modifications to date have been in Hardest Hit Areas, with a large number of them directed at VA- or FHA-guaranteed loans. (Hardest Hit Areas are census tracts identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as having high concentrations of distressed properties and foreclosure activities.) Loan modifications and new loans have been directed to every state and the District of Columbia , and to 116,895 census blocks. More than 5,000 affordable rental housing units – 68 percent for Critical Need Family Housing – are supported by 44 subordinated loans made at a loss to the bank. Most importantly, according to Professor Green, the data show that modifications for first-lien principal reductions – the largest category of intended consumer relief – are significantly reducing the financial burden on recipients. The average principal reduction on modifications to date is more than 50 percent, the average loan-to-value ratio has dropped from 176 percent to 75 percent, the average interest rate has been slashed from 5.38 percent to 2.10 percent, and, critically, the average monthly payment has been reduced by $599 a month—more than 37 percent. \"This relief directly and materially assists homeowners struggling to afford to stay in their homes,\" Professor Green said. The November 30 report and an interactive map are available at the Monitor's website at: http://bankofamerica.mortgagesettlementmonitor.com/ . The website provides further details about the settlement, contact information for Bank of America, the DOJ, the attorneys general of the six participating states, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, plus information for homeowners who want assistance but do not know where to get it or cannot afford it. The Monitor's mailing address is: Monitor of the Bank of America Mortgage Settlement, P.O. Box 10134, Dublin, OH 43017-3134, and the e-mail address is .

      "text": "November 30, 2016 at 17:00 PM EST Bank of America on Track to Achieve Consumer-Relief Mandate, Monitor Says \nBOSTON , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America has conditionally fulfilled 97 percent of its obligation to provide $7 billion worth of consumer relief under its August 2014 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states, Eric D. Green , independent Monitor of the agreement, reported today. \nProfessor Green, in his seventh report on Bank of America's performance under the agreement, said that he and his professional staff conditionally approved an additional $449,827,010 of consumer-relief credit in the most recent reporting period, covering requests for credit that the bank submitted in July and August of 2016. \nTogether with previous submissions, the amount of credit conditionally validated totals $6,803,934,697 , or 97 percent of the $7-billion obligation. The validation is subject, at the close of the bank's consumer-relief activities, to the Monitor's final determination and certification that the bank's efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement. \n\"Based on credit testing that is underway, it appears that Bank of America is on target to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement this year, well ahead of the four-year deadline,\" Professor Green said. \nThe consumer relief appears to be going where the settling parties intended, Professor Green said. About 53 percent of all loan modifications to date have been in Hardest Hit Areas, with a large number of them directed at VA- or FHA-guaranteed loans. (Hardest Hit Areas are census tracts identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as having high concentrations of distressed properties and foreclosure activities.) Loan modifications and new loans have been directed to every state and the District of Columbia , and to 116,895 census blocks. More than 5,000 affordable rental housing units – 68 percent for Critical Need Family Housing – are supported by 44 subordinated loans made at a loss to the bank. \nMost importantly, according to Professor Green, the data show that modifications for first-lien principal reductions – the largest category of intended consumer relief – are significantly reducing the financial burden on recipients. The average principal reduction on modifications to date is more than 50 percent, the average loan-to-value ratio has dropped from 176 percent to 75 percent, the average interest rate has been slashed from 5.38 percent to 2.10 percent, and, critically, the average monthly payment has been reduced by $599 a month—more than 37 percent. \n\"This relief directly and materially assists homeowners struggling to afford to stay in their homes,\" Professor Green said. \nThe November 30 report and an interactive map are available at the Monitor's website at: http://bankofamerica.mortgagesettlementmonitor.com/ . The website provides further details about the settlement, contact information for Bank of America, the DOJ, the attorneys general of the six participating states, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, plus information for homeowners who want assistance but do not know where to get it or cannot afford it. \nThe Monitor's mailing address is: Monitor of the Bank of America Mortgage Settlement, P.O. Box 10134, Dublin, OH 43017-3134, and the e-mail address is .

      "text": "  \nBank of America has provided nearly all of the $7 billion in consumer relief required by a record 2014 mortgage settlement, according to an independent monitor’s report Wednesday. \nMonitor Eric Green said he has now given approval for $6.8 billion in relief to the Charlotte-based bank, which must provide the aid under its $16.65 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states. Bank of America appears to be on target to meet its obligations this year, ahead of the 2018 deadline, Green said. \nGreen noted his approval remains conditional and subject to final determination that the bank’s relief efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement. \n“This latest monitor’s report again shows Bank of America has extended meaningful relief to homeowners in need of assistance,” bank spokesman Dan Frahm said. The pace of relief reflects the bank’s “effort to provide solutions to homeowners as quickly as possible, when that assistance was most needed,” he said. \nIn reaching the settlement, Bank of America admitted it, Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch took part in faulty mortgage-backed securities practices. The bank bought Countrywide in 2008 and Merrill Lynch in 2009. The accord was the biggest civil settlement between a single company and the government. \nUnder the settlement, Bank of America can earn credit for various forms of consumer relief. Those include modifying mortgages to make them more affordable, giving loans to low-income and moderate-income borrowers and donating money to housing-counseling and legal-assistance groups. \nThe settlement made incentives available to Bank of America for relief provided ahead of the 2018 deadline. Extra credit was offered for aid issued last year.",

      "text": "Comment BAC stock saw its all-time high in eight years last Friday. PBS. \nWith US President-elect Donald Trump coming to the fore as Head of State by January 2017, Bank of America Corporation's stocks (NYSE: BAC) have been on the spike and are expected to rise phenomenally by December. Trump, a long-time businessman and investor, is expected to put into policy generous incentives to the financial industry. \nBank of America currently holds 114 million shares, and is the most actively traded stock in the US. In this early half of the week alone, BAC's stocks have been rising to as much as 1.2%. Last Friday saw BAC's highest stock price at $20.86, the highest in eight years . \nBAC saw its stocks skyrocket since the commencement of the US elections, with Donald Trump emerging as the new president. BAC stocks went to as high as 19%. \nInstinet analyst Steven Chubak says that this phenomenon is known as the \" Goldilocks \" scenario for the banking industry, featuring high interest rates, improved economic growth and reduced regulations. The only thing to watch out for, Chubak says, is once investor pricing comes into the picture. Major investor decisions may make or break the skyrocketing prices of BAC stocks. As of last Friday, BAC stocks are at $20.86. Chubak expects the price to get to $25 by the end of the year. \nBrian Kleinhanzl, analyst for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, is on the same note as Chubak saying there is \"still room to move\" amidst the sudden shoot-up of BAC stocks. He expects BAC stock prices to reach up to $23.00. \nThe Trump administration is said to be on the side of financial institutions seeing their promise for US growth. On an interview last May, Trump says he wants to see the overhaul of the Dodd-Frank Act , a financial regulatory law passed in 2010 under the Obama administration. Following the big recession of 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act limits the state and the public's dependence on banks, and places the financial industry's regulation on the state. \nTrump is quoted into saying, \"Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function... It makes it very hard for bankers to loan money for people to create jobs, for people with businesses to create jobs. And that has to stop.\" \nAnalysts foresee BAC's rising stocks to be a boon to higher long-term interest rates as these can give way to higher bank profits, larger capacities to take more people under the bank's accounts, and decreased financial risks both for banks and depositors.",

      "text": " Bank of America Monitor: Eric D. Green\nBOSTON Bank of America has conditionally fulfilled 97 percent of its obligation to provide $7 billion worth of consumer relief under its August 2014 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states, Eric D. Green , independent Monitor of the agreement, reported today.\nProfessor Green, in his seventh report on Bank of America's performance under the agreement, said that he and his professional staff conditionally approved an additional $449,827,010 of consumer-relief credit in the most recent reporting period, covering requests for credit that the bank submitted in July and August of 2016.\nTogether with previous submissions, the amount of credit conditionally validated totals $6,803,934,697 , or 97 percent of the $7-billion obligation. The validation is subject, at the close of the bank's consumer-relief activities, to the Monitor's final determination and certification that the bank's efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement.\n\"Based on credit testing that is underway, it appears that Bank of America is on target to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement this year, well ahead of the four-year deadline,\" Professor Green said.\nThe consumer relief appears to be going where the settling parties intended, Professor Green said. About 53 percent of all loan modifications to date have been in Hardest Hit Areas, with a large number of them directed at VA- or FHA-guaranteed loans. (Hardest Hit Areas are census tracts identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as having high concentrations of distressed properties and foreclosure activities.) Loan modifications and new loans have been directed to every state and the District of Columbia , and to 116,895 census blocks. More than 5,000 affordable rental housing units – 68 percent for Critical Need Family Housing – are supported by 44 subordinated loans made at a loss to the bank.\nMost importantly, according to Professor Green, the data show that modifications for first-lien principal reductions – the largest category of intended consumer relief – are significantly reducing the financial burden on recipients. The average principal reduction on modifications to date is more than 50 percent, the average loan-to-value ratio has dropped from 176 percent to 75 percent, the average interest rate has been slashed from 5.38 percent to 2.10 percent, and, critically, the average monthly payment has been reduced by $599 a month-more than 37 percent.\n\"This relief directly and materially assists homeowners struggling to afford to stay in their homes,\" Professor Green said.\nThe November 30 report and an interactive map are available at the Monitor's website at: http://bankofamerica.mortgagesettlementmonitor.com/ . The website provides further details about the settlement, contact information for Bank of America, the DOJ, the attorneys general of the six participating states, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, plus information for homeowners who want assistance but do not know where to get it or cannot afford it.\nThe Monitor's mailing address is: Monitor of the Bank of America Mortgage Settlement, P.O. Box 10134, Dublin, OH 43017-3134, and the e-mail address is info@mortgagesettlementmonitor.com .\n releases/bank-of-america-on-track-to-achieve-consumer-relief-mandate-monitor-says-300370752.html\n ",

If you are affiliated with this page and would like it removed please contact pressreleases@franklyinc.com\nSOURCE Bank of America Monitor: Eric D. Green\nBOSTON , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America has conditionally fulfilled 97 percent of its obligation to provide $7 billion worth of consumer relief under its August 2014 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states, Eric D. Green , independent Monitor of the agreement, reported today.\nProfessor Green, in his seventh report on Bank of America's performance under the agreement, said that he and his professional staff conditionally approved an additional $449,827,010 of consumer-relief credit in the most recent reporting period, covering requests for credit that the bank submitted in July and August of 2016.\nTogether with previous submissions, the amount of credit conditionally validated totals $6,803,934,697 , or 97 percent of the $7-billion obligation. The validation is subject, at the close of the bank's consumer-relief activities, to the Monitor's final determination and certification that the bank's efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement.\n\"Based on credit testing that is underway, it appears that Bank of America is on target to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement this year, well ahead of the four-year deadline,\" Professor Green said.\nThe consumer relief appears to be going where the settling parties intended, Professor Green said. About 53 percent of all loan modifications to date have been in Hardest Hit Areas, with a large number of them directed at VA- or FHA-guaranteed loans. (Hardest Hit Areas are census tracts identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as having high concentrations of distressed properties and foreclosure activities.) Loan modifications and new loans have been directed to every state and the District of Columbia , and to 116,895 census blocks. More than 5,000 affordable rental housing units – 68 percent for Critical Need Family Housing – are supported by 44 subordinated loans made at a loss to the bank.\nMost importantly, according to Professor Green, the data show that modifications for first-lien principal reductions – the largest category of intended consumer relief – are significantly reducing the financial burden on recipients. The average principal reduction on modifications to date is more than 50 percent, the average loan-to-value ratio has dropped from 176 percent to 75 percent, the average interest rate has been slashed from 5.38 percent to 2.10 percent, and, critically, the average monthly payment has been reduced by $599 a month-more than 37 percent.\n\"This relief directly and materially assists homeowners struggling to afford to stay in their homes,\" Professor Green said.\nThe November 30 report and an interactive map are available at the Monitor's website at: http://bankofamerica.mortgagesettlementmonitor.com/ . The website provides further details about the settlement, contact information for Bank of America, the DOJ, the attorneys general of the six participating states, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, plus information for homeowners who want assistance but do not know where to get it or cannot afford it.\nThe Monitor's mailing address is: Monitor of the Bank of America Mortgage Settlement, P.O. Box 10134, Dublin, OH 43017-3134, and the e-mail address is info@mortgagesettlementmonitor.com .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-on-track-to-achieve-consumer-relief-mandate-monitor-says-300370752.html\n©2016 PR Newswire.

That dissonance may be coming to an end as analysts at Bank of America Corp. predict we are approaching the market’s last hurrah. The crux of the argument is that the firm’s contrarian sell side indicator, which measures Wall Street’s bullishness on equities, jumped to a six-month high in November, its biggest gain in more than a year.

Bank of America Corp. \n“The Sell Side Indicator does not catch every rally or decline in the stock market, but the indicator has historically had some predictive capability with respect to subsequent 12-month S&P 500 total returns,” the bank said. \nBank of America analysts currently have a base case call for the S&P 500 to end 2017 at 2,300, or 5 percent above today’s levels. With this indicator taken into consideration when formulating their outlook, the team’s bull case scenario represents a rapid rise in stocks. “The case for a traditional euphoria-driven end-of-bull-market rally is easy to argue for, and 20 percent or greater annual returns are the historic norm, putting the S&P 500 at 2,700 in our bull case,” they conclude, adding that their bear case calls for stocks to end the year down 27 percent at 1,600. --With assistance from Oliver Renick in New York.

      "text": " Bank of America Monitor: Eric D. Green\nBOSTON , Nov. 30, Bank of America has conditionally fulfilled 97 percent of its obligation to provide $7 billion worth of consumer relief under its August 2014 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and six states, Eric D. Green , independent Monitor of the agreement, reported today.\nProfessor Green, in his seventh report on Bank of America's performance under the agreement, said that he and his professional staff conditionally approved an additional $449,827,010 of consumer-relief credit in the most recent reporting period, covering requests for credit that the bank submitted in July and August of 2016.\nTogether with previous submissions, the amount of credit conditionally validated totals $6,803,934,697 , or 97 percent of the $7-billion obligation. The validation is subject, at the close of the bank's consumer-relief activities, to the Monitor's final determination and certification that the bank's efforts comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement.\n\"Based on credit testing that is underway, it appears that Bank of America is on target to fulfill its obligations under the settlement agreement this year, well ahead of the four-year deadline,\" Professor Green said.\nThe consumer relief appears to be going where the settling parties intended, Professor Green said. About 53 percent of all loan modifications to date have been in Hardest Hit Areas, with a large number of them directed at VA- or FHA-guaranteed loans. (Hardest Hit Areas are census tracts identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as having high concentrations of distressed properties and foreclosure activities.) Loan modifications and new loans have been directed to every state and the District of Columbia , and to 116,895 census blocks. More than 5,000 affordable rental housing units – 68 percent for Critical Need Family Housing – are supported by 44 subordinated loans made at a loss to the bank.\nMost importantly, according to Professor Green, the data show that modifications for first-lien principal reductions – the largest category of intended consumer relief – are significantly reducing the financial burden on recipients. The average principal reduction on modifications to date is more than 50 percent, the average loan-to-value ratio has dropped from 176 percent to 75 percent, the average interest rate has been slashed from 5.38 percent to 2.10 percent, and, critically, the average monthly payment has been reduced by $599 a month-more than 37 percent.\n\"This relief directly and materially assists homeowners struggling to afford to stay in their homes,\" Professor Green said.\nThe November 30 report and an interactive map are available at the Monitor's website at: http://bankofamerica.mortgagesettlementmonitor.com/ . The website provides further details about the settlement, contact information for Bank of America, the DOJ, the attorneys general of the six participating states, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, plus information for homeowners who want assistance but do not know where to get it or cannot afford it.\nThe Monitor's mailing address is: Monitor of the Bank of America Mortgage Settlement, P.O. Box 10134, Dublin, OH 43017-3134, and the e-mail address is info@mortgagesettlementmonitor.com .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-on-track-to-achieve-consumer-relief-mandate-monitor-says-300370752.html\n ",

      "text": "Bank of America Donates $1M to 17 Charlotte Non-Profits for Giving Tuesday By Caroline VandergriffTuesday, November 29, 2016 at 12:56 PM EST CHARLOTTE --- Today is Giving Tuesday, a day to open our hearts and wallets to help out non-profits. One of Charlotte's biggest corporate citizens is also helping out by giving more than $1 million to 17 charities. Bank of America is donating to organizations like the Salvation Army, the United Way and the Men's Shelter of Charlotte. The Renaissance West Community Initiative (RWCI), a non-profit that transformed a former public housing project on West Boulevard into a vibrant neighborhood, is receiving $200,000. \"They gave me a second chance at life,\" said Sharae Williams, a resident at Renaissance. \"It's not easy being a single mom, and a young mom, wanting better for your child, and they gave me that opportunity by living here.\" RWCI is a new development with mixed-income housing, a new CMS school and resources for families and kids. It's meant to be a comprehensive approach to tackling economic mobility. \"You can't piece meal it,\" said Laura Clark, CWO of RWCI. \"You have to go really all in on communities and really revitalize them from the ground up.\" Clark says that kind of change isn't possible without support from the community, and she's grateful for Bank of America's support. There are 174 participating in a #GivingTuesdayCLT campaign. You can look at them all here. Time Warner Cable customers get full access to all our video, including our live stream.",
