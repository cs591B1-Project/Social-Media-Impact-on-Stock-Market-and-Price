As a Microsoft Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP), Workspot is providing organizations of all sizes the simplest and fastest path to adopting VDI on Azure. \nWorkspot's solution is deeply integrated with Azure, automating and optimizing resources within a matter of minutes. Workspot DaaS 2.0 automatically streamlines the usage of the virtual network, virtual storage, and compute services included in the Azure infrastructure. The cloud-native architecture and built-in automations maximizes deployment speed, performance, and flexibility and minimizes costs across all Azure regions, resulting in optimized and predictable per user billing. \nAccording to Gartner, \"by 2019, 50% of new virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) users will be deployed on DaaS platforms.\"(1) \n\"Workspot has been empowering companies of all sizes to go live with desktop virtualization in just 60 minutes,\" states Amitabh Sinha, CEO and Co-Founder of Workspot. \"We are extending our rock-solid VDI 2.0 architecture to leverage the power of Microsoft Azure and deliver the only all-cloud VDI solution on the market. Our DaaS 2.0 solution enables a customer to simultaneously deliver desktops from the Microsoft Azure cloud and from on-premises infrastructure while managing the entire environment from a single console.\" \n\"In addition to having a single management console, Workspot has put a lot of work into power management, usage reporting, billing, and more,\" states Gabe Knuth in his recent article Workspot enters the DaaS space. Here's our full analysis of their Windows 10 on Azure platform . \"These are all things you'd have to do on your own if you wanted to put desktops into Azure. They've also built all the networking, image management, and security functions you would need from Azure into their console. DaaS 2.0 takes all the benefits of VDI 2.0, and then some, and brings them to the cloud.\" \n\"The Cloud Solution Provider Program puts our partners at the center of the customer relationship,\" said Gavriella Schuster, Corporate Vice President of Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. \"Through participation these partners have demonstrated dedication to helping our mutual customers drive their digital transformation.\" \n\"Workspot VDI 2.0 and DaaS 2.0 solutions have enabled me to deliver VDI to internal and external users in a very short period of time,\" said Tom Merkle, Director of Information Technology at Houston Eye Associates. \"The subscription model for DaaS 2.0 is tailor made for our growing business requirements.

(Microsoft Photo) The European Commission this morning approved Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of LinkedIn for more than $26 billion, with certain conditions, giving the Redmond technology giant the final regulatory sign-off needed to complete the largest deal in its history.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith at the company’s annual meeting last week. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Microsoft announced the acquisition in June , and regulators in the U.S. and other countries had already cleared the deal. With the EU approval, “the deal will close in the coming days,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, in a post this morning .\n“With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,” Smith said. “The events of the past six months make not just this business opportunity, but the broader societal issues connected to them, more important.”\nMicrosoft had faced opposition from Salesforce , which had competed for LinkedIn and asked European regulators to investigate the competitive implications of the deal.\nHere are the conditions on the approval, as outlined by the EU this morning .\nensuring that PC manufacturers and distributors would be free not to install LinkedIn on Windows and allowing users to remove LinkedIn from Windows should PC manufacturers and distributors decide to preinstall it. allowing competing professional social network service providers to maintain current levels of interoperability with Microsoft’s Office suite of products through the so-called Office add-in program and Office application programming interfaces. granting competing professional social network service providers access to “Microsoft Graph”, a gateway for software developers. It is used to build applications and services that can, subject to user consent, access data stored in the Microsoft cloud, such as contact information, calendar information, emails, etc. Software developers can potentially use this data to drive subscribers and usage to their professional social networks.

      "text": "European Commission clears the way for Microsoft-LinkedIn deal Posted \nMicrosoft’s $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn looks like it’s ready to go. \nThe company’s Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith just announced that the deal has been cleared by the European Commission — the last regulator that needed to sign off on the deal. \n“As a result, we’ve now obtained all of the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition, and the deal will close in the coming days,” Smith said. \nReuters had previously reported that Microsoft was offering concession to the EU regulators in response to their concerns. Smith’s blog post confirms that Microsoft has “formalized several commitments regarding Microsoft’s support for third-party professional social networking services” — in other words, the company is supposed to take steps to ensure that LinkedIn competitors don’t get completely disadvantaged on Microsoft platforms. Related Articles Microsoft offers concessions to EU regulators eyeing its $26.2B LinkedIn bid LinkedIn Q3 sales up 23% to $960M in its last earnings ahead of MSFT acquisition He provided a few specifics, like continuing to make the Office Add-In program (used to integrate with Microsoft Office products) and promotional opportunities on the Office Store available to non-LinkedIn networks. Some of these concessions also involve potential integrations between Microsoft products and LinkedIn — IT administrators and individual users should get the option of whether or not to display LinkedIn profile information in Microsoft Office, for example. (All of those examples are five-year commitments, by the way.)\n“With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,” Smith said. “The events of the past six months make not just this business opportunity, but the broader societal issues connected to them, more important.” \nWhich issues? Smith said that together, the two companies have “a bigger opportunity to help people online to develop and earn credentials for new skills, identify and pursue new jobs, and become more creative and productive as they work with their colleagues.” 0",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company’s service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from “flash to bang” — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies’ content policies,” according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.”\n“We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,” said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. “The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,” said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. “Today’s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.”\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media’s use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining “terrorist activity,” which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik’s page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n“Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter’s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter’s vice president of public policy. “A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.”\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it’s already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___ \nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Microsoft Tweets Terrifying Demon to Advertise Windows 10 at Christmas Written by December 6, 2016 // 08:30   \nRunning a social media account for an enterprise technology company must be boring at times. Your bosses just want you to tweet at followers with inane server statistics or cloud computing case studies, but you just want to tweet dank memes, don’t you? \nStep up Microsoft Austria, which last night tweeted from its official Twitter account a horrifying image of a pre-Christian half-devil half-goat horned beast destroying an innocent, petrified child. The monster is infamous Austro-Bavarian Christmas-ruiner Krampus , and he’s got his wormy tongue all over that child, slathering up his wispy, Trumpy hair like it’s a fresh scoop of Ben and Jerry’s. \n“What? You’re still not using Windows 10?” the tweet roughly translates as. \nBad. Ass. \nWas? Du verwendest noch immer kein Windows 10? Microsoft Österreich December 5, 2016 \nThis is the kind of tweet that works. This is the kind of tweet that wins a social media intern that promotion. I want to see that child ripped apart. I want to see his parents sob in despair as the beast chomps down on that tasty, virgin flesh. The ultimate retribution for not using Windows 10! Take that, Apple. This is how you do Christmas advertising! Read more: Of Murder Houses and Hell Gardens: A Top-Ten List for the Morbid Traveler The tweet isn’t entirely out of the blue, though. Today, December 6, is the Feast of St Nicholas, which means last night was Krampusnacht—the night of the Krampus. Austrian and German lore has it that the beastly devil goat roams the streets terrorizing bad children, gobbling up the naughty brats. The tradition is strong to this day, with adults still donning devilish Krampus costumes and running around giving children a right spook and giant, multinational technology companies freaking out Twitter users with sweet Windows 10 adverts.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 5 minutes ago with 1 comment \nLast month, as part of its Black Friday promotions, Microsoft launched the HP Elite x3 Holiday Bundle. It included the flagship Windows 10 Mobile handset , along with a Desk Dock and notebook-style Lap Dock, as well as a screen protector and cover for the phone. \nMicrosoft initially priced the Holiday Bundle at $1,149 , offering substantial savings over the total cost of buying each of those items individually, which would ordinarily add up to $1,462. But a few days later, it quietly dropped its price even further, reducing it to $999 , a savings of almost 32%. \nThat deal finally ended on December 3, but a revised version of the bundle is sticking around. Microsoft has dropped the 'Holiday Bundle' branding, renaming it the 'HP Elite x3 + Lap Dock Bundle'. \nThe bundle now includes just the handset, Desk Dock and Lap Dock, so if you want the phone screen protector and cover, you'll have to pay more. The price is now a lot higher too - the new bundle will set you back $1,298 ; if you were to purchase the Elite x3 with Desk Dock ($799) and Lap Dock ($599) separately, your credit card would be $1,398 worse off, so the bundle will save you $100 (just over 7%). \nAccording to the store listing, the new bundle is a special offer, which will end on April 14, 2017.",

      "text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft <MSFT.O> won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn <LNKD.N>, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions.\nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer.\n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog.\nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing.\nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns.\n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.\nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.\nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs.\nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years.\nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard.\n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Keith Weir)",

      "text": "© 2016 Adweek All Rights Reserved Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, YouTube Take Aim at Terrorist Content Advertisement Comment \nFacebook, Microsoft , Twitter and YouTube are teaming up to take on online terrorist content. \nThe online giants announced via a Facebook Newsroom post that they will create a shared industry database of what they described as “hashes,” or unique digital fingerprints of content they have removed from their respective services, in the hopes that the information sharing will help each of them to more effectively rid their platforms of such content: \nOur companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services–content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions and remove matching content as appropriate. \nAs we continue to collaborate and share best practices, each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database. No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found. And each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances. As part of this collaboration, we will all focus on how to involve additional companies in the future. \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube stressed that users’ privacy will be protected, as will their ability to “express themselves freely and safely,” adding that the companies will continue to engage with their respective communities on the best ways to move forward. \nReaders: What are your thoughts on the anti-terrorist-content partnership between Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube? \nImage courtesy of Shutterstock .",

      "text": "Brussels (AFP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's mega buyout of the professional networking site LinkedIn, provided the US tech giant meets commitments to allow fair competition.\nThe European Commission, the EU executive, said it approved the merger after Microsoft offered promises, including leaving personal computer manufacturers and distributors free not to install LinkedIn on Windows operating systems.\n\"The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft,\" the commission said.\nMicrosoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn was announced in June, the biggest-ever deal for a social media company.\n\"Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said.\nData has increasingly become a major driver for big acquisitions in the digital world, including the blockbuster buyout of messaging service WhatsApp by Facebook in 2014 that was waved through at the EU by Vestager's predecessor.",

      "text": "Deals | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 4:20pm GMT Microsoft gains EU approval for $26 billion buy of LinkedIn A 3D printed logo of Microsoft is seen in front of a displayed LinkedIn logo in this illustration taken June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS \nBRUSSELS Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn ( LNKD.N ), its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs. \nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. \nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Keith Weir) Next In Deals",

      "text": "Share View photos A 3D printed logo of Microsoft is seen in front of a displayed LinkedIn logo in this illustration taken June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration More By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion (20.46 billion pound) bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. The deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. The U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. LinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. The European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. Reuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. To secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes. It will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. U.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement.

      "text": "Microsoft Tweets Terrifying Demon to Advertise Windows 10 at Christmas Written by 6 December 2016 // 08:30   \nRunning a social media account for an enterprise technology company must be boring at times. Your bosses just want you to tweet at followers with inane server statistics or cloud computing case studies, but you just want to tweet dank memes, don’t you? \nStep up Microsoft Austria, which last night tweeted from its official Twitter account a horrifying image of a pre-Christian half-devil half-goat horned beast destroying an innocent, petrified child. The monster is infamous Austro-Bavarian Christmas-ruiner Krampus , and he’s got his wormy tongue all over that child, slathering up his wispy, Trumpy hair like it’s a fresh scoop of Ben and Jerry’s. \n“What? You’re still not using Windows 10?” the tweet roughly translates as. \nBad. Ass. \nWas? Du verwendest noch immer kein Windows 10? Microsoft Österreich December 5, 2016 \nThis is the kind of tweet that works. This is the kind of tweet that wins a social media intern that promotion. I want to see that child ripped apart. I want to see his parents sob in despair as the beast chomps down on that tasty, virgin flesh. The ultimate retribution for not using Windows 10! Take that, Apple. This is how you do Christmas advertising! Read more: Of Murder Houses and Hell Gardens: A Top-Ten List for the Morbid Traveler The tweet isn’t entirely out of the blue, though. Today, December 6, is the Feast of St Nicholas, which means last night was Krampusnacht—the night of the Krampus. Austrian and German lore has it that the beastly devil goat roams the streets terrorizing bad children, gobbling up the naughty brats. The tradition is strong to this day, with adults still donning devilish Krampus costumes and running around giving children a right spook and giant, multinational technology companies freaking out Twitter users with sweet Windows 10 adverts.

Share story Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter \nEuropean antitrust regulators on Tuesday gave their approval to Microsoft’s $26 billion deal to buy LinkedIn after the software maker agreed to concessions to keep Microsoft products open to LinkedIn rivals. \nThe OK from the European Commission was the last major regulatory approval the deal required, paving the way for Microsoft to seal its purchase of the professional social networking website in the coming days. \nThe European regulator said Microsoft had agreed continue to allow LinkedIn competitors to have the same level of access to Microsoft’s Office suite. The company also pledged to not require computer makers to install LinkedIn on Windows PCs. \nAfter the deal was announced in June, Salesforce.com, the San Francisco builder of sales and marketing software, had urged European regulators to scrutinize the deal, saying it could give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its software services with the trove of information held by the social network.

      "text": " 09 AM EST DialogTech Brings Phone Calls to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Sales \nCHICAGO , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DialogTech, the leading call attribution platform, today announced an integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. The integration allows companies to automatically capture intelligence on every phone call, caller and conversation generated from their marketing within Microsoft Dynamics 365. By adding phone call analytics, DialogTech helps marketers gain actionable insight into how every channel, ad, search keyword, web session and marketing interaction drives leads, customers and revenue, whether a consumer converts online or by phone. The integration automatically populates records with data on every call and caller, even if the call goes unanswered, making sales teams more efficient by ensuring accurate and comprehensive data is captured by the CRM. \nWith calls to U.S. businesses from digital advertising expected to reach over 100 billion in 2017, marketers can no longer measure and optimize ROI without knowing how each channel is generating calls and customers. The DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 provides that insight and more. \n\"DialogTech is excited to bring intelligence on the most valuable customer interaction – the phone call – to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform,\" said Josh Mallamud , SVP of Corporate Development & Strategic Partnerships at DialogTech. \"Businesses can now access data on both online conversions and marketing-driven phone calls within the platform, giving them a complete view of the customer journey, key data to close the loop on marketing attribution and insights to optimize marketing spend across all channels to drive more revenue more efficiently.\" \nCanada's largest provider of cemetery and funeral services, Arbor Memorial, has been piloting the Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration. \"Families want to speak to a real person over the phone when planning memorial services,\" said Jeffrey Loretta , Marketing CRM Specialist at Arbor Memorial. \"Prior to DialogTech's integration we couldn't attribute calls to our marketing efforts. Now with DialogTech, we've added callers from marketing to the mix and are attributing 150% more revenue within Microsoft Dynamics 365. And having data on the call and caller captured automatically in a CRM record frees up our sales team to focus on providing the quality call experiences that our families deserve.\" \nHighlights of the DialogTech integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365 include: Detailed Call Attribution from Source to Sale: Know which marketing channels, ads, search keywords, campaigns and website interactions generate calls that become customers. Demographic Data on Inbound Callers: Capture over 50 data points on each caller, including their name, caller ID and geographic location, even if the call goes unanswered. Insightful Reports on the Impact of Calls: View reports on call volume from each marketing source for any time period to see its impact on sales opportunities, prospects and revenue. Call Logging: Save sales agents time and eliminate manual errors by having information on each call and caller – including call duration, time and date – logged and tied to a new or current lead or contact based on caller ID. \nSupporting Resources:",

Thomson Reuters | Last   22:02 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS BRUSSELS: Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions.The deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer.\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. The U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing.LinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.The European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns.\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.Reuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.To secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes.It will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years.U.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard.\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement. ©   (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

      "text": "Home » News » Computer News » After 'disastrous' Tay, Microsoft to release another chatbot After 'disastrous' Tay, Microsoft to release another chatbot 10 hours ago | 06-12-2016 | IANS New York, Dec 6 : After a disastrous launch of its previous chatbot Tay, Microsoft is reportedly releasing another artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot named 'Zo' on the social messaging app 'Kik', reports said on Tuesday. [NK Computer] According to technology website MSPoweruser, Microsoft is yet to officially announce 'Zo' but it was spotted by a Twitter user. The app is believed to come to Twitter, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat once it's officially announced. Earlier this year, Microsoft launched AI-powered chatbot called 'Tay' but it soon caused controversy with its racist and unpleasent comments, causing the technology giant to pull off the product. \"Zo is essentially a censored Tay or an English-variant of Microsoft's Chinese chatbot Xiaoice,\" MSPoweruser reported. At the initial launch of the app, the chatbot does a \"super abbreviated personality test\" in which it asks if the user would rather study in school or learn from experience. 'Zo' does not discuss the political topics with users and instead says, \"People can say some awful things when talking politics so I do not discuss.\" qd/na/ahm",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 2 minutes ago with 1 comment \nMicrosoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith announced today that the company's $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn has been approved by EU regulators. Originally announced in June , the deal will be Microsoft's largest acquisition to date. \nThe company had to make several commitments to the European Commission though. For one thing, Add-ins for Office will continue to be open to third-party professional social networks for at least an additional five years. Over that time, those social networks will also have promotional opportunities in the Office Store. \nThere are also conditions for if Microsoft decides to develop a LinkedIn app or tile for Windows. PC manufacturers must be allowed to not pre-install the app on devices sold in the European Economic Area, and for those that do pre-install it, users must be able to uninstall it. The company will also be unable to enter agreements with OEMs that favor the app over competing services. \nFinally, IT administrators and users will have the option to choose whether to display LinkedIn profiles in Office, should that be implemented in the future. \nMicrosoft hasn't specifically stated its plans for the social network, as it couldn't do so until the deal was finalized. The company has shared the value that it sees in the social network , such as the personal data that's offered, saying, \"In the future, Cortana will also know your entire professional network to connect dots on your behalf so you stay one step ahead.\" \nLinkedIn also owns Lynda.com, which is a valuable service for helping people to learn new skills. Right now, it's a subscription service, but some have speculated that Microsoft may integrate it into Office 365. \nThe firm will have more to share regarding its massive acquisition soon, now that it has been approved by the European Commission.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on July 17, 2014. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More like this Inside Google's Loon and Wing \nMicrosoft is taking another shot at giving users a friendly AI-driven bot conversation partner. On Monday, the company released Zo , a chatbot that users can converse with on the Kik messaging platform. \nZo is a follow-up to Tay, the tech giant's first foray into friendly, English-speaking chatbots. It's clear that the company has learned from its first attempt, when the chatbot was turned into a font of white supremacist propaganda by malicious users. \nIn contrast, Zo adamantly refuses to discuss political matters. Even a casual mention of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's conversation with the leader of Taiwan led the bot to say that it wasn't interested in discussing politics. \nIt's a push by Microsoft to explore how people interact with bots, as the company pushes the idea of conversations with automated partners as the next computing platform. \nThat doesn't mean Zo, which identifies itself as a 22-year-old woman, is beyond saying outlandish things. The chatbot opened its conversation with me by asking if I preferred backpacking overseas or visiting a theme park. When I turned the question around, Zo replied \"I love you.\" \nIt's a kind sentiment, but a bit too familiar for a conversation that was maybe two minutes old. When I pushed back, it said \"You can't handle the truth.\" \n\"Are you Jack Nicholson?\" I asked, referencing his iconic monologue from \"A Few Good Men.\" \n\"Yep,\" Zo replied. \nSo that's that, then. The bot offered a few other nonsensical responses to further questions about a variety of topics like news, as well. But at the same time, it felt like a lighthearted engagement. \nIf Zo is the future of computing, it has a ways to go towards being a good conversation partner -- or perhaps humans will just have to adjust to its strange sense of humor. There is potential for bots to have a major impact, however. Microsoft's Xiaoice chatbot, which is similar to Zo, has proven wildly popular in China. \nMicrosoft isn't the only company to throw its weight behind bots as the future of computing, either. Google, Apple, Amazon and other firms are each building their own general-purpose virtual assistants, and several other companies have released or previewed tools for building bots.

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube will share terror content info The move comes after concern that the companies weren’t taking down terrorist content fast enough Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 6, 2016 3:42 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA municipal display panel provides contact information for victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. Credit: Peter Sayer Inside Google's Loon and Wing \nFacebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google's YouTube have agreed to share with one another identifying digital information of violent terror content that they find on their platforms. \nWhen they remove \"violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images\" from their platforms, the companies will include in a shared industry database the hashes, or unique digital fingerprints, of the content. \nOther participants can use the shared hashes to help identify matching content on their hosted consumer platforms, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove the content when appropriate, according to a statement by the companies on Monday. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” the companies said. \nThe move comes shortly after members of the European Parliament from the Civil Liberties Committee voted Monday to back stricter initiatives to counter terrorism, including measures to take down and block content that constitute public provocation to commit terrorism. On Thursday, the EU Internet Forum, a private-public partnership set up last year with internet companies, will meet to take stock of measures to reduce online terrorist content. \nTerrorist organizations like the Islamic State group are believed to use social media for propaganda, communications and to attract new recruits. \nGoogle, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter agreed with the European Union in May to remove from their websites illegal hate speech , visible in Europe, that could incite hatred or acts of terror. But in August, a panel of lawmakers in the U.K. said it was \"alarming\" that social networking companies have very small teams to monitor billions of accounts for extremist content. \nOn Sunday, the European Commission said internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, will have to act faster to counter online hate speech or face laws forcing them to do so , according to news reports. \nIn a study of the companies' processes to remove hate speech that broke the law or breached their community standards, only 40 percent of complaints received a response within 24 hours, and 43 percent within 48 hours, according to a Commission official. \nOverall, 28.2 percent of the complaints resulted in removal of the content -- but there were large disparities in the removal rate, depending on the country where the complaint was made, the study found. In France and Germany, it topped 50 percent, but in Austria only 11 percent of complaints resulted in content removal, and in Italy just 4 percent. The Commission plans to publish the study Tuesday. \nNo personally identifiable information will be shared when hashes are passed among the companies, according to the statement. The four companies will begin sharing hashes of the \"most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos\" removed from their services, which they describe as content most likely to violate all their content policies. \nA recent study by the Global Network Initiative, a group that represents academics, investors, civil society organizations and companies, has cautioned against the human rights risks of censoring online terror content. \nInternet companies acting as intermediaries should not be required to monitor third-party terrorist content that they host or transmit, or face direct or indirect liability from governments for such content, according to the study. Such requirements and liabilities may lead companies to go overboard in the removal of controversial content, according to the report. \nThe companies don't expect to share hashes until early next year after the technical work is completed. They are also open to including other firms that are interested in joining the initiative in the future. \n[With additional reporting by Peter Sayer in Paris] To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "Microsoft today is announcing new enterprise-oriented features coming to Windows 10 with the release of the the Creators Update, which is due out in early 2017 . \nFor one thing, Microsoft is including new mobile application management (MAM) capability that can run on Windows 10 devices for those users who are part of Azure Active Directory (AAD). It can integrate with existing first- and third-party MAM and mobile-device management (MDM) services.\n“As employees use their own devices at work more and more, we are providing IT with oversight to apply policies to the applications employees use to be productive. This helps keep corporate data more secure without taking on the added responsibility of managing employees’ personal devices,” Rob Lefferts, director of program manager for Windows Enterprise and Security at Microsoft, write in a blog post .\nAlso with the Creators Update, enterprises will be able to deploy differential downloads, or essentially only downloading the diffs, or changes, to existing builds so that file sizes are smaller and they can be ultimately installed more quickly. Microsoft is also looking to make updates up to 90 percent smaller when sent through Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager software, Lefferts wrote.\nAnd Microsoft will introduce a tool that make it easy to enable UEFI — which is a requirement for certain security features like Device Guard — on devices that have older BIOS. That process can otherwise involve lots of manual work. The tool is designed to automate it across lots of devices.\nMicrosoft is also enhancing its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection tool for detecting and responding to cyberattacks with the release of Windows 10 Creators Update for enterprises with Secure Productive Enterprise licenses . \nThe feature will be able to pick up on memory and kernel-level exploits. And it will be possible for admins to “isolate machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center and further reduce response time, Lefferts wrote.\nPlus, organizations will be able to customize the Windows Security Center with alerts that are triggered based on their own data.\nSome of the new features will appear in Windows Insider builds in the next few weeks, Lefferts wrote.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Details New Enterprise Features Coming To Windows 10",
      "text": "\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the ‘Creators’ update for Windows 10 and while the name didn’t invoke positive responses from the enterprise crowd, the company has announced today several features that will be targeted at the business world. Coming this spring, the Creators update will deliver enhanced security functionality that builds upon the narrative that Microsoft is using security as its differentiator for all of its products .\nWith this release, the Creators update will include updates to Windows Security Center, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), updates for Cloud-based Insights with Windows Analytics, in-place UEFI conversion, and improved mobile management.\nA significant focus of this release is based around monitoring the security of your environment and in the upcoming release, Windows Security Center will be updated to link natively with Office 365 ATP to create a single view of security events in a centralized portal. The goal is to make it easier to monitor threats, across your entire ATP network, and respond faster to events as they arise.\nWindows Defender ATP is also getting several updates that will focus on detection, intelligence and remediation:\nDetection : Microsoft is expanding the use of sensors to detect threats that persist only in memory or at the kernel level. Intelligence : Microsoft is opening up Threat Intelligence to allow admins to feed their own data into the Windows Security Center. Remediation : New remediation features in Defender ATP provide IT admins tools to isolate machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes and quarantine or block files, which will reduce the response time from event trigger to isolation. The Windows Analytics dashboard will be updated in the coming months to provide additional resources to make it easier to manage Windows 10 devices. These new features will allow organizations to use their own telemetry to provide new insights and ensure compliance with the upgrade, update and device health processes within their organizations.\nCurrently, if you want to convert a device to UEFI, you needed to physically take ownership of the hardware. With the Windows 10 update coming this spring, Microsoft will release a tool that automates this process and the feature can be integrated into System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) as part of the Windows 7 to Windows 10 in-place upgrade process.\nOne of the more significant features of this release is how the company will protect data on devices a company does not own. As more employees use personal devices for work purposes, Microsoft will release this spring mobile application management; this feature will protect data on personal devices without requiring the device to be enrolled in a Mobile Device Management solution.\n—\nWhen Microsoft announced the Creators update a few weeks back, they did not make a compelling argument about why the enterprise would want the new release. Granted, that event was targeted at consumers but when the majority of their Windows revenue comes from the corporate world and there was nothing announced at the event, or even the following weeks, it raised more than a few eyebrows. Simply put, they should have acknowledged that enterprise features were coming and would be announced at a later time.\nNow that the features have been announced, Microsoft has made its pitch about why you should install the next release of Windows 10 that will arrive this spring.\n \n \n \nThe post Microsoft Details New Enterprise Features Coming To Windows 10 appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "title": "dplyrXdf 0.90 now available",
      "text": "dplyrXdf 0.90 now available \nby Hong Ooi, Sr. Data Scientist, Microsoft \nVersion 0.90 of the dplyrXdf package has just been released. dplyrXdf is a package that brings dplyr pipelines and data transformation verbs to Microsoft R Server ’s xdf files. This version includes several changes, mostly to address performance and efficiency concerns, which I’ll detail these below. The .outFile argument \nAll dplyrXdf verbs now support a special argument .outFile , which determines how the output data is handled. If you don’t specify a value for this argument, the data will be saved to a tbl_xdf which will be managed by dplyrXdf. This supports the default behaviour, whereby data files are automatically created and deleted inside a pipeline. There are two other options for .outFile : \nIf you specify .outFile = NULL , the data will be returned in memory as a data frame. \nIf .outFile is a character string giving a file name, the data will be saved to an xdf file at that location, and a persistent xdf data source will be returned. \nThis should improve the efficiency of pipelines with large datasets, by reducing the amount of I/O. Previously, to save the output of a pipeline, you had to call the persist verb at the end: xdf %>% filter( ... ) %>% mutate( ... ) %>% persist( \"final/output.xdf\" ) \nIn this example, mutate would save a temporary xdf file in dplyrXdf’s working directory, and persist would then copy that file to the final output location. Now, you can save the output directly to the final location as follows: xdf %>% filter( ... ) %>% mutate( ... , .outFile= \"final/output.xdf\" ) \nThis omits a redundant file save and copy, thus speeding things up. \nThe persist verb remains available, for situations where you have already run a pipeline and want to save its output after the fact. Setting the dplyrXdf working directory \nBy default, dplyrXdf will save the data files it creates into the R working directory. On some systems, this may be located on a drive or filesystem that is relatively small; this is rarely an issue with open source R, but can be problematic when working with large xdf files. You can now change the location of the xdf tbl directory with the setXdfTblDir function: # set the tbl directory to a network drive (on Windows) setXdfTblDir( \"n:/Rtemp\" ) \nSimilarly, you can view the location of the current xdf tbl directory with getXdfTblDir . \nFor best performance, you should avoid setting the xdf tbl directory to a remote location/network drive unless you have a fast network connection. Extraction operators \nSometimes it’s useful to be able to extract variables from an Xdf file. With a data frame, you can do this with the $ and [[ operators: for example iris$Species and iris[[\"Species\"]] both return the Species column (as a vector) from the iris dataset. This update to dplyrXdf implements the same functionality for Xdf files: sampDir <- system.file( \"sampleData\" , package= \"RevoScaleR\" ) airline <- RxXdfData(file.path(sampDir, \"AirlineDemoSmall.xdf\" )) ArrDelay <- airline$ArrDelay head(ArrDelay) ## [1] 6 -8 -2 1 -2 -14 \nBy default, the entire column is returned, so you should be careful using these operators when you have very large Xdf files. The subset verb \nIn dplyr, subsetting data is handled by two verbs: filter for subsetting by rows, and select for subsetting by columns. This is fine for data frames, where everything runs in memory; and for SQL databases, where the hard work is done by the database. For Xdf files, however, this is suboptimal, as each verb translates into a separate I/O step where the data is read from disk, subsetted, then written out again. This can waste a lot of time with large datasets. \nYou can get around this by using the .rxArgs argument in a verb to pass commands directly to the underlying RevoScaleR functions. For example, filter(xdf, .rxArgs=list(varsToKeep=*))) would subset by rows, and simultaneously use the varsToKeep parameter to tell rxDataStep to subset by columns. But this is inelegant. It would be better if there was a verb that could natively subset in both dimensions, without having to rely on workarounds. \nAs it turns out, base R has a subset generic which (as the name says) performs subsetting on both rows and columns. You’ve probably used it with data frames: subset(iris, Species == \"setosa\" , c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) ## Source: local data frame [50 x 2] ## ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width ## (dbl) (dbl) ## 1 5.1 3.5 ## 2 4.9 3.0 ## 3 4.7 3.2 ## 4 4.6 3.1 ## 5 5.0 3.6 ## 6 5.4 3.9 ## .. ... ... \nHere, the first argument to subset specifies the rows, and the second argument the columns to return. The subset method for Xdf files works along the same lines: airSubset <- subset ( airline , DayOfWeek == \"Monday\" , c ( ArrDelay , CRSDepTime ) ) head ( airSubset ) airSubset <- subset(airline, DayOfWeek == \"Monday\" , c(ArrDelay, CRSDepTime)) head(airSubset) ## Source: local data frame [6 x 2] ## ## ArrDelay CRSDepTime ## (int) (dbl) ## 1 6 9. ## 2 -8 19.916666 ## 3 -2 13.750000 ## 4 1 11.750000 ## 5 -2 6.416667 ## 6 -14 13.8 \nYou can also use the same helper functions to choose columns as you would with select: airSubset2 <- subset(airline, , starts_with( \"A\" )) names(airSubset2) ## [1] \"ArrDelay\" Other changes \nIn addition to the above, version 0.90 includes the following changes: \nThe persist verb now uses the base R functions file.copy and file.rename to copy/move a file, which should improve performance considerably on large datasets. \nThe code for two-table verbs has been extensively rewritten, and should be much more reliable than before. \nThe documentation, including the vignettes, has been significantly revised. \nUnit testing infrastructure has been added, utilising the testthat package. \nSeveral bugs have been fixed, some found with the aid of the aforementioned unit testing. \nThe latest version of the dplyrXdf package is available on Github at the link below.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nBRUSSELS, Belgium—Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday, Dec. 6, for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programs, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs.",

      "text": "Bill Gates's 5 Favorite Books of 2016 The Microsoft co-founder's latest recommended reading choices. Image credit: Ida Mae Astute | Getty Images --- Shares December 6, 2016 \nIn between getting a Presidential Medal of Freedom and developing an odor-blocking perfume, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates put out his list of his favorite books of 2016, just in time for the holiday season. \nThe Grid by Gretchen BakkeWhat it's about: Bakke, a cultural anthropologist who teaches at McGill University, lays out the history of the United States electrical grid and explores how the nation's energy infrastructure needs to change. Gates's recommendation: \"[The grid] got built up piece by piece. She talks about how it's becoming critical, not only for reliability, but the deal with these intermittent energy sources that are in very different locations than the actual uses of the power. The grid's going to have to be dramatically better in the future.\" \nThe Myth of the Strong Leader by Archie BrownWhat it's about: Historian and Oxford political science professor Archie Brown explores whether the most aggressive, outwardly strong leaders are the ones that are best for the job. Gates's recommendation: \"I think he's right that there's a big danger, both in the corporate world and government [of] this individual that embodies all things, and he's just doing it largely himself. Leaders who don't listen can get more and more isolated.\" \nShoe Dog by Phil KnightWhat it's about: The Nike co-founder looks back at the rise of the business. Gates's recommendation: \"It's amazingly honest, the company almost didn't succeed. It points out the unusual characteristics of the key people who helped the company succeed. I think tons of people would find it an interesting story about how business really works.\" \nThe Gene by Siddhartha MukherjeeWhat it's about: Mukherjee, who was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2010 for his biography of cancer, The Emperor of All Maladies , wrote a comprehensive history of the gene as we know it. Gates's recommendation: \"He really tells you what the gene is. There's three big domains that genetic technology helps in. One is plants, the other is livestock and the third is humans. Some countries may be very liberal, letting parents edit genes related to beauty or intelligence. It'll get people up to the point where they can participate in that debate which will be fairly intense over the next 10, 20 years.\" \nString Theory by David Foster WallaceWhat it's about: A posthumously published collection of the famed author's essays about the world of tennis. Gates' recommendation: \"I loved [Wallace] talking about his tennis career, and being slammed into the fence, and being a little bit modest about how he grinded it out. If you're going to read one tennis book, it's probably the best.\" Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "text": "BRUSSELS Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions.\nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer.\n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog.\nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing.\nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns.\n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.\nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.\nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes.\nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years.\nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard.\n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement.",

      "text": "By Foo Yun Chee / Reuters Today at 10:43 a.m. The ticker symbol and trading information for LinkedIn Corp. is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded, before the start of trading, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nBRUSSELS, Belgium—Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday, Dec. 6, for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signalled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programs, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs.",

Posted 07 Dec 2016 00:54 LinkedIn has over 467 million registered members, according to its website. (AFP/Justin Sullivan) A \nBRUSSELS: The European Union on Tuesday (Dec 6) approved Microsoft's mega buyout of the professional networking site LinkedIn, provided the US tech giant meets commitments to allow fair competition. \nThe European Commission, the EU executive, said it approved the merger after Microsoft offered promises, including leaving personal computer manufacturers and distributors free not to install LinkedIn on Windows operating systems. \n\"The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft,\" the commission said. \nMicrosoft's US$26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn was announced in June, the biggest-ever deal for a social media company. \n\"Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. \nData has increasingly become a major driver for big acquisitions in the digital world, including the blockbuster buyout of messaging service WhatsApp by Facebook in 2014 that was waved through at the EU by Vestager's predecessor. - AFP/de",

      "title": "Microsoft’s $26 billion LinkedIn acquisition will close in the coming days",
      "text": "Microsoft has gained all necessary regulatory clearance for its acquisition of LinkedIn, the company announced today, and the massive deal is set to close “in the coming days.” The European Commission was the last hurdle remaining after officials in the US, Canada, and elsewhere had already approved the $26.2 billion all-cash buyout. \nMicrosoft had to make several commitments — outlined in this blog post from president and chief legal officer Brad Smith — regarding its “support for third-party professional social networking services” to have the European Commission clear the deal. Most of them pertain to keeping Office open to competitors , as had been rumored. \nThe Microsoft-LinkedIn deal was announced back in June , and at the time Microsoft said it hoped to close the acquisition by year’s end. It has met that goal with today’s announcement. In Microsoft’s own words, the combination brings together “the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.” \nBut it’s about more than networking and enterprise collaboration, according to Smith. His blog post mentions both the Brexit vote and recent US presidential election as evidence that “many people feel left out and unable to participate in the economic growth and opportunities created by the rising digital economy.” \nWhile technology tools are not a panacea for current economic challenges, we believe they can make an important contribution. Microsoft and LinkedIn together have a bigger opportunity to help people online to develop and earn credentials for new skills, identify and pursue new jobs, and become more creative and productive as they work with their colleagues. Working together we can do more to serve not only those with college degrees, but the many people pursuing new experiences, skills and credentials related to vocational training and so-called middle skills. Our ambition is to do our part to create more opportunity for people who haven’t shared in recent economic growth.\nLinkedIn’s 433 million members (2 million of them paid subscribers) and social graph closely align with the software and services Microsoft provides . And though some of us bemoan the pestering emails and largely ignore our LinkedIn profiles, they’re about to become much more important in the world of Office.",

I just got a 2 pack play and charge from Game for £6, see how those fare. Are there any that are compatible with the elite controller? The clips on the battery door are in a different place. I have one rechargeable which isn't built onto a battery door so use that bit would be nice to have a sealed unit without using a hacksaw!",

      "text": "Arab in Gaza uses Facebook Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash 90 Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube said they will partner to curb the spread of terrorist content online.\n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” said a statement released Monday by the social media firms.\nThe companies said they will create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints, called hashes, for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that were removed from their services.\n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” the statement said.\nSocial media has become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State terror group and others.\nThe companies said they would start by sharing the “most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services.”\nThey added: “We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms. We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.”\nThe companies said they will each apply their own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content. Each also will apply its own “practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances.”\nThe program is expected to begin early next year. The companies said they would look to add other firms to the collaboration in the future.\nThe statement comes as the Israel-based civil rights organization Shurat Hadin today released a YouTube video in a campaign to support its two major lawsuits against Facebook for inciting terrorism.\n\n\nTags: Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , incitement to violence , terror activity",

      "text": "| Topic: Windows 10 \nMicrosoft's coming Windows 10 Creators Update isn't just for those who want to make 3D models or use pens to digitally sketch on their PCs. \nIn October, Microsoft disclosed a number of the new, consumer-focused features coming to the next feature update to Windows 10 , known as the Windows 10 Creators Update. Today, December 6, Microsoft officials went public with a list of new features aimed more at business users that will be in the Creators Update . \nMicrosoft is focusing on security and mangeability improvements with the coming update. A primary goal will be to make the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service that the company first released alongside Windows 10 Anniversary Update even more robust, officials said. \nATP is service aimed at enterprises for detecting and responding to advanced attacks. ATP, goes beyond what's in plain old Windows Defender. It is a post-breach service meant to help detect threats that have made it past other defenses, provide users with means to investigate breaches, and offer suggested responses. \nWith the Creators Update, Microsoft is beefing up the detection capabilities of ATP by enabling its sensors to detect threats that persist only in memory or kernel-level exploits. Microsoft also will allow IT admins to add their own alerts unique to their companies to the service. (Ultimately, officials said, Microsoft would like to add these alerts back into the main ATP threat database -- with the OK of the participating users -- but that functionality is not part of the Creators Update.) Microsoft also is beefing up the remediation actions supported by ATP to further reduce response time. \nOn the manageability side, the Creators Update will add new capabilities to Windows Upgrade Analytics, specifically around the Windows Analytics Dashboard. Rather than only monitoring which PCs are running which versions of Windows, the updated dashboard will provide more telemetry on device-health of PCs in an organization. Microsoft's Operations Management Suite will be integrated directly with the dashboard, providing users with a secure way to analyze those insights, officials said. \nThere's a new UEFI-conversion tool that will be part of Creators Update, as well that will reduce the need for IT pros to manually convert Windows 7 devices using legacy BIOSes to UEFI. This tool can be integrated with other management tools like System Center Configuration Manager, officials said. \nAdditionally, Microsoft is adding new mobile application-management functionality into the Creators Update that won't require devices to use a separate mobile device management product to help isolate personal and work data and appropriately protect restricted content. Sign-up will be enabled directly within the applications. \nThe coming ATP-specific features I mention above are part of the Windows 10 Enterprise/E5 version only. The new mobile application management functionality will work across all the different Windows 10 variants. Microsoft will be lighting up all of these coming features in Windows 10 test builds in the coming weeks. \nMicrosoft recently also acknowledged that the company is working on a new Edge browser security feature that's been rumored for some time: Container-based isolation in the browser . That feature, codenamed \"Barcelona,\" may or may not be part of the Creators Update; if it hasn't been tested sufficiently by \"Spring 2017\" -- the date by which Microsoft officials say Creators Update will be released to mainstream users -- it may become part of Redstone 3, expected in the Fall of 2017. \nMicrosoft's internal ship target for the Windows 10 Creators Update (previously known by its codename, \"Redstone 2,\") is March 2017 , sources have confirmed. More Windows 10 ",

The name of the symlink is a hashvalue computed from the certificate (using openssl x509 -hash -noout -in $CERT ), with a dot and sequence number appended to avoid possible hash collisions (IMHO, it would be nicer of the Apache Webserver to grab the certificates and keep an internal table, after all there aren't millions of them, but that's not currently so. Historical reasons I suppose, this setup is from the 90s after all.) \nSo for example, in order to set up everything for my little server: \nThis is all very straightforward. \nOn Windows, however, there are no symlinks (I think there are now, though ... well it is 2016), so what do I do with the hashing symlink.",

      "text": "International Business Microsoft gains EU approval for US$26 billion buy of LinkedIn Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its US$26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn , its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. Posted 06 Dec 2016 23:50 Updated 07 Dec 2016 00:30 A 3D printed logo of Microsoft is seen in front of a displayed LinkedIn logo in this illustration taken June 13, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration A \nBRUSSELS: Microsoft won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its US$26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn , its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its US$3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs. \nIt will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. \nU.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard. \n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,\" Salesforce said in a statement. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Keith Weir) - Reuters",

      "text": "TUESDAY, DEC. 6, 2016, 9:05 A.M. EU clears Microsoft’s $26 billion LinkedIn deal By Matt Day Seattle Times Twitter \nEuropean antitrust regulators on Tuesday gave their approval to Microsoft’s $26 billion deal to buy LinkedIn after the software maker agreed to concessions to keep Microsoft products open to LinkedIn rivals. \nThe OK from the European Commission was the last major regulatory approval the deal required, paving the way for Microsoft to seal its purchase of the professional social networking website in the coming days. \nThe European regulator said Microsoft had agreed continue to allow LinkedIn competitors to have the same level of access to Microsoft’s Office suite. The company also pledged to not require computer makers to install LinkedIn on Windows PCs. \nAfter the deal was announced in July, Salesforce.com, the San Francisco builder of sales and marketing software, had urged European regulators to scrutinize the deal, saying it could give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its software services with the trove of information held by the social network. \n“Having completed detailed conversations with governments around the world about the opportunity to bring Microsoft and LinkedIn together, we’re excited to get started,” Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.   9:05 a.m.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

Reuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop) Related Links",

      "text": "\nIt's been a year since the Lumia 950 launched, meaning it's time to revisit Microsoft's latest flagship and see what's improved... and what hasn't.\nThe Microsoft Lumia 950 is a year old this week, which is pretty unbelievable considering it feels like just yesterday many of us were blown away by the Lumia 950 XL's \"liquid cooled\" Snapdragon 810 and Windows Hello integration. As a Windows phone fan myself, the Lumia 950 series was exactly what I was hoping for from Microsoft at the time of announcement.\nBut it didn't take long to realize that the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL were plagued with a number of launch issues and general software bugs that Microsoft had missed with Windows 10 Mobile , so much so the Lumia 950 was basically unrecommendable for several months after launch.\nIt's been an entire year since then, however, and I thought it would be a good idea to take a second look at the Lumia 950, a year later, to see how things have improved or gotten worse.\nHardware When launched a year ago, both Lumia models were rocking the latest from Snapdragon. The 950 features a octa-core Snapdragon 808 processor, with the 950 XL packing a \"liquid cooled\" hexa-core Snapdragon 810, both rocking 3GBs of RAM and 32GB of storage with QHD screens.\n\n",

As we wrote last year, ISIS in particular has been “using 21st-century technology to promote a medieval ideology involving mass killings, torture, rape, enslavement, and destruction of antiquities.”\nNow, the companies whose websites are used to promulgate such content are going to work together to try and block it. Using a technique known as hashing—which can ascribe a unique number to a media file—they will share records of content that each has banned from its site.\nA report earlier this year claimed that Google and Facebook had started experimenting with the use of hashing to block extremist content. But the new shared database will mean that items banned by one organization will also be removed from the websites of the others. The new database will go into action early 2017.\nThe blacklisted content won’t be automatically detected by algorithms. Instead, humans will perform that part of the task in order to ensure that, say, journalistic reporting of terrorism isn’t wrongly taken down.\nHany Farid, a computer scientist from Dartmouth College, has warned the Guardian that such a task should itself be carefully monitored. “You want people who have expertise in extremist content making sure it’s up to date,” he explained. “Otherwise you are relying solely on the individual technology companies to do that.”\nStill, the news is welcome. Historically, tech companies have resisted calls to police such content, but increasing political pressure has clearly forced them to re-evaluate their approaches.\n(Read more: The New York Times , The Guardian , “ Fighting ISIS Online ,” “ Facebook and Google May Be Fighting Terrorist Videos with Algorithms ,” “ What Role Should Silicon Valley Play in Fighting Terrorism? ”)",

      "text": "Microsoft's LinkedIn deal clears the EU, will close in the coming days Despite competitors' protests, Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition will go through U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 6, 2016 10:07   \nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Credit: Microsoft Facebook drones will deliver Internet from the sky \nMicrosoft's mammoth acquisition of LinkedIn has just cleared the last hurdle in front of it, paving the way for the tech titan to buy the professional social network for US$26.2 billion. \nEuropean Union regulators have approved the acquisition, joining agencies in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. The deal is expected to close \"in the coming days,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post Tuesday. \nThe news comes roughly six months after Microsoft announced the deal . Microsoft at the time said it expected the acquisition to close by the end of 2016, and it seems poised to hit that mark. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nIt's good news for Microsoft, considering that the company’s competitors filed complaints with European regulatory authorities to block the deal. Chief among them was Salesforce, which argued that Microsoft would be able to hoard LinkedIn's data to enhance its CRM products and other software while barring competitors from accessing it. \nMicrosoft did make several commitments to European regulators related to its treatment of LinkedIn, Smith said. The company committed to making its Office Add-In program available to third-party social networks so that LinkedIn competitors will be able to integrate their services into Microsoft's productivity apps. \nThe company also committed to allowing IT administrators the ability to hide the LinkedIn user interface from users if they choose to. Should Microsoft develop a LinkedIn application or tile for Windows, PC manufacturers will be able to opt-out of pre-installing it on devices sold in the European Economic Area. \nUsers will also be able to uninstall a LinkedIn application should it come pre-installed, and Microsoft also said that it wouldn't use Windows to prompt users to install that app. The hypothetical app could remain available for sale in the Windows Store, however, and Microsoft could choose to promote it in other ways. \nSome of these restrictions feel reminiscent of the EU-Microsoft antitrust judgment from the early 2000s. But all in all, they don’t add up to much of a negative consequence for Microsoft. The company will need to provide an open platform for competing social networks to access Windows and Office, but won’t be required to hand over LinkedIn's data.  ",

However, the approval wasn't a cakewalk for the software giant, as it had to cede in to some of EU-diktats to scrape through the European anti-trust approval process. \nThe European Commission said in a press release it has approved the proposed M&A deal and conditioned the approval on compliance with a series of commitments aimed at preserving competition among professional social networks in Europe. \nAmong the aspects the commission was concerned included: Stifling competition among professional social networks by pre-installing LinkedIn in all Windows PCs and integrating LinkedIn into Microsoft Office and combine. Shutting out Microsoft's competitors through obligating customers buying LinkedIn services to also purchase its CRM software and denying its competitors access to full LinkedIn database, thus preventing then to develop advanced CRM functionalities. Online advertising services \nThe commitments sought by the European Commission, include: Ensuring that PC manufacturers and distributors would be free not to install LinkedIn on Windows and allow users to uninstall it if PC manufacturers had pre-installed it. Allowing competing professional social networks to maintain current levels of interoperability with Microsoft's Office suite of products. granting competing professional social networks access to Microsoft Graph \nThe deal now looks on track for the calendar year end closure.

      "text": "Microsoft, LinkedIn merger cleared by European Commission (Seeking Alpha) \nAs expected , the European Commission gave its blessings to the impending acquisition of LinkedIn Corp (NYSE: LNKD ) by Microsoft   MSFT ). However, the approval wasn't a cakewalk for the software giant, as it had to cede in to some of EU-diktats to scrape through the European anti-trust approval process. \nThe European Commission said in a press release it has approved the proposed M&A deal and conditioned the approval on compliance with a series of commitments aimed at preserving competition among professional social networks in Europe. \nAmong the aspects the commission was concerned included: Stifling competition among professional social networks by pre-installing LinkedIn in all Windows PCs and integrating LinkedIn into Microsoft Office and combine. Shutting out Microsoft's competitors through obligating customers buying LinkedIn services to also purchase its CRM software and denying its competitors access to full LinkedIn database, thus preventing then to develop advanced CRM functionalities. Online advertising services \nThe commitments sought by the European Commission, include: Ensuring that PC manufacturers and distributors would be free not to install LinkedIn on Windows and allow users to uninstall it if PC manufacturers had pre-installed it. Allowing competing professional social networks to maintain current levels of interoperability with Microsoft's Office suite of products. granting competing professional social networks access to Microsoft Graph \nThe deal now looks on track for the calendar year end closure.

      "text": "Any idiot with modest control both over the English language and also Microsoft Excel is capable of writing a weblog post about the implications of Mauricio Dubon ‘s statistical record as a minor leaguer on his possible future as a major leaguer. The only idiot prepared to do it for FanGraphs.com, however, is the one composing these words right now.\nWho is Mauricio Dubon? A different person to everyone he meets, probably, because this is how humans work. Who he is for the purposes of the current post, however, is one of the players received by Milwaukee in a deal that sent reliever Tyler Thornburg to Boston this morning. Travis Shaw is almost certainly the most well-known player acquired by the Brewers. Dubon, however, is likely the best.\nAs a professional, Dubon almost immediately joined that class of player who presents a challenge to evaluators. He was drafted in the 26th round, has always lacked a carrying tool, and plays what amounts to probably just a fringe shortstop. At the same time, however, he also possesses nearly elite contact skills and — regardless of the position at which he’s being deployed — profiles as a net-positive defensive contributor.\nThe final three-plus months of Dubon’s 2016 season represented probably the best of of his career so far — and might call for whatever credentials he continued to possess over “fringe” status. Promoted to Double-A Portland towards the end of June, Dubon continued to exhibit his usual collection of skills while also displaying unprecedented power, hitting six home runs and recording a .199 isolated-power figure in 269 plate appearances. The result: an overall offensive line roughly 50% better than league average. In light of his youth — the 2016 campaign represented Dubon’s age-21 season, while the average age of an Eastern League batter this past year was 24.3 — the offensive production was impressive. Not only that, the production was supported by indicators (strikeout rate, ISO) which become reliable in smaller samples.\nCurious about the implications of Dubon’s performance, I identified every 21-year-old Eastern League batter from the five-year interval between 2010 and 2014 who had recorded (a) at least 200 plate appearances and (b) a strikeout rate below 15% and (c) an isolated-power figure above .150. The list is a short one: from a sample of 964 Eastern League players who meet the plate-appearance criterion, only two others meet the additional constraints. Both of their names are familiar.\nMauricio Dubon’s Eastern League Comparables, 2010-14 Name Team Year Age PA K% ISO Mookie Betts Red Sox (AA) 2014 21 253 7.9% .196 Lonnie Chisenhall Indians (AA) 2010 21 524 14.7% .172 To rephrase: out of nearly a thousand possible outcomes, these are the batting lines from the recent past most comparable to Dubon’s half season at Portland. And to reiterate: they belong to a pair of players, in Mookie Betts and Lonnie Chisenhall , who’ve combined for about 20 wins in roughly 3,500 plate appearances — or about 3.5 wins over a full season.\nIt should be noted: the emergence of Dubon’ power seems vital to the optimism implied by these comparables. If one removes the isolated-power criterion from the table above, the additional results are less encouraging:\nMauricio Dubon’s Other Possible Comparables, 2010-14 Name Team Year Age PA K% ISO Mookie Betts Red Sox (AA) 2014 21 253 7.9% .196 Lonnie Chisenhall Indians (AA) 2010 21 524 14.7% .172 Che-Hsuan Lin Red Sox (AA) 2010 21 543 11.6% .068 Adeiny Hechavarria Blue Jays (AA) 2010 21 273 14.7% .087 Adeiny Hechavarria continues to remain employed based almost entirely on the strength of his defensive reputation. Che-Hsuan Lin remains employed, too — but as a pitcher now in the Rangers’ system. In other words: the skill set is a promising one, but probably more promising when it’s complemented by the power. Otherwise, there’s a greater burden placed on Dubon’s shortstop defense, and the returns — by the numbers, at least — haven’t been entirely encouraging.",

      "text": "Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana There's a reason Google and Amazon make a high-end speaker with a voice assistant that can control your home. You can buy a few of them and place one in every room. You can speak to the device at any time, because it’s always listening to you. (On the Google Home speaker, you can disable the microphone using a button on the back.) There’s no screen, no batteries to recharge, no driver updates, and no confusion. You say “Alexa” or “OK, Google” and you’re in. For some strange reason, rumors rumbled recently about Microsoft getting in on the game, but they plan to make a Home Hub that works within Cortana on your Windows 10 computer . It makes sense on one level -- Cortana becomes a one-stop voice assistant for dictating a memo, setting reminders, and turning on the lights in your home. There are quite a few problems with this approach, though. One is that people don’t use their laptop or desktop in the same places where they might want to control their lights or set the thermostat. Sure, in the living room on a couch, but few of us have a laptop running in every room. A laptop microphone won’t pick up across the room (usually). More importantly, a laptop is for productive work, gaming, maybe research and media streaming -- we don’t use them continually throughout the day. I always lose the lid on my Chromebook when I’m done. I move onto other things. Just as important, the market has already decided that speakers work better. The Google Home plays music with a rich and loud bass; it is worth using as a speaker only. Every song I’ve played sounds as a good or better than many of the other portable speakers I’ve tested. Kudos to both Amazon and Google for emphasizing music streaming quality. On a laptop, we listen on earbuds or headphones, we connect up to a secondary speaker or even a home receiver, but few of us play music on a laptop directly, although that works much better on the recent Apple MacBook laptops. It’s not a primary music listening device in the home (or the office). It lacks the immediacy, the audio power, and the quality we normally want for a new album by the Boxer Rebellion or an audiobook. I might talk to my laptop once in awhile -- Cortana is great for setting reminders -- but I don’t think of that voice-acted assistant as something I’d use all day. Part of the issue is the size. The Home speaker sits comfortably on a nightstand, on a kitchen counter (even with pots and pans everywhere) or on my desk. It has a sleek modern look. A laptop or a desktop? Not as much. What Microsoft needs to make is a Surface speaker. The device should cost about $100 and work with Cortana. Bonus if you can also tap into Microsoft Word and dictate a document, control the lights, your home heating, the garage door openers, and several other connected home devices. The speaker should sound outstanding , something you’d place in every room. It would be a nirvana state for anyone who already uses Outlook and Office, because the speaker could also read incoming emails out loud, allow you to place a Skype call, and listen to the Groove music service. Will it happen? I’m not sure if Microsoft wants to take on giants like Amazon and Google in the consumer space, but they might try anyway. The Surface speaker could bridge the gap between home life and work life in a way that other products have not attempted. Here’s hoping they decide to turn the Home Hub into a product that fits modern life. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?  ",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is continuing to announce new features for the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, outlining new features that are aimed at IT professionals. Over the last couple of months, the company announced that the update - formerly known as Redstone 2 - will include new virtual and augmented reality features , game broadcasting , Continuum improvements for Windows 10 Mobile , and more. \nToday's announcement builds on security features that the company unveiled at its Ignite 2016 conference , which include Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) and Office ATP being able to communicate with one another through the Windows Security Center. This will allow IT admins to \"easily follow an attack across endpoints and email in a seamless and integrated way.\" \nEnriched Detection . As I’ve said before, methods and means attackers use are increasingly varied, complex and well-funded. The sensors we have today across the network traffic channeled through end points and the cloud are powerful. However, cyber threats won’t stop, and neither will we. With the Creators Update we will expand Windows Defender ATP sensors to detect threats that persist only in memory or kernel level exploits. This will enable IT administrators to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and to detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications indicating potential kernel exploits. \nEnriched Intelligence . We already add on to our Microsoft Threat Intelligence (TI) with industry partners like FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence. In the Creators Update, we’ll enable IT administrators to feed their own intelligence into the Windows Security Center for alerts on activities based on their own indicators of compromise. This added level of insight will enrich machine learning models to identify and block malware more quickly and better protect their unique environment. \nEnhanced Remediation . We will also deliver new remediation actions in Windows Defender ATP that will give IT administrators the tools to isolate machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center and further reduce response time. \nHowever, the focus of today's announcement wasn't only on security. There will be additional insights on the Windows Analytics dashboard, which will \"help IT administrators better manage and support Windows 10 devices.\" These are meant to allow companies to use their own telemetry data to create new insights and \"ensure compliance on the upgrade, update and device health processes within their organizations.\" \nThere will also be a new tool that will easily allow administrators to convert a device that uses a legacy BIOS to UEFI. Previously, they would have to reconfigure the firmware to do this, which would require hands-on time with each machine. The tool will be available through management tools such as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). \nMobile application management is a tool that's meant to give IT admins oversight in a BYOD (bring your own device) environment, without the device having to be enrolled in Mobile Device Management (MDM). It keeps corporate data more secure by controlling the applications that work data has access to. For example, it would keep you from copying something from your work email and pasting it into your personal email. The apps that corporate data can access will be controlled by IT admins. \nMost of the features that the company outlined today were previously announced at Microsoft's Ignite 2016 conference . Others, like differential updates, were announced in November , and that's meant to decrease the size of downloads for major Windows updates, although normal users won't see the results of the Unified Update Platform until Redstone 3. \nThe Creators Update is scheduled for an early 2017 release , which will likely be March. Insiders have access to some of these features now, as long as they're running Windows 10 Enterprise. Tags",

      "text": "print Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune \nThere's at least one company that's not too happy that Microsoft has received European Union approval for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn: Microsoft's rival Salesforce. \nSalesforce had been protesting to the EU about the deal, hoping that the EU would force Microsoft into promising that it would keep access to LinkedIn's treasure trove of data open to all competitors (such as Salesforce). \nThe EU did extract a rather lengthy list of concessions from Microsoft , but not about LinkedIn's data. The list centered on things like making Microsoft promise not to use its market position with Windows and MS Office to squash other social networks. \nSalesforce, which tried to buy LinkedIn itself, is now warning that regulators will have to watch Microsoft closely and hints that if Microsoft does close access to LinkedIn's data, Salesforce won't accept the situation silently. \nHere's the statement Salesforce sent us regarding Microsoft's approval of the LinkedIn deal (emphasis ours). \"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it . As AI, machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical datasets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policymakers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy.\" \nSalesforce also sounds as if it is going to try and convince regulators to come up with new rules regarding how data should be treated in acquisitions involving companies with lots of data. \nIn the meantime, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has already been setting himself up to make anti-trust complaints, if need be. He's been saying things like, \"The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft\" and and telling an odd story accusing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella of duping him into revealing Salesforce's long-term strategy. \nThe EU had previously monitored Microsoft for antitrust issues in a deal struck with the software giant in 2009. Then in 2013, slapped a big fine against Microsoft , accusing the company failing to comply.",

      "text": "There's at least one company that's not too happy that Microsoft has received European Union approval for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn: Microsoft's rival Salesforce.\nSalesforce had been protesting to the EU about the deal, hoping that the EU would force Microsoft into promising that it would keep access to LinkedIn's treasure trove of data open to all competitors (such as Salesforce). \nThe EU did extract a rather lengthy list of concessions from Microsoft , but not about LinkedIn's data. The list centered on things like making Microsoft promise not to use its market position with Windows and MS Office to squash other social networks.\nSalesforce, which tried to buy LinkedIn itself, is now warning that regulators will have to watch Microsoft closely and hints that if Microsoft does close access to LinkedIn's data, Salesforce won't accept the situation silently. \nHere's the statement Salesforce sent us regarding Microsoft's approval of the LinkedIn deal (emphasis ours).\n\"Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it . As AI, machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical datasets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policymakers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy.\"\nSalesforce also sounds as if it is going to try and convince regulators to come up with new rules regarding how data should be treated in acquisitions involving companies with lots of data.\nIn the meantime, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has already been setting himself up to make anti-trust complaints, if need be. He's been saying things like, \"The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft\" and and telling an odd story accusing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  of duping him into revealing Salesforce's long-term strategy. \nThe EU had previously monitored Microsoft for antitrust issues in a deal struck with the software giant in 2009. Then in 2013, slapped a big fine against Microsoft , accusing the company failing to comply.\nNOW WATCH: The best way to cook scrambled eggs — according to Anthony Bourdain \n",

      "text": "Microsoft's new Chatbot Zo won't talk politics Business / 6 December 2016, 1:48pm Dina Bass Seattle - Microsoft is letting users try a new chatbot on the app Kik, nine months after it shut down an earlier bot that internet users got to spout racist, sexist and pornographic remarks. The new one is called Zo and it refuses to discuss politics and steers clear of racism. When asked whether President-Elect Donald Trump is racist, Zo replied \"that kinda language is just not a good look,\" with an \"OK\" emoji. Asked if Hillary Clinton is a crook, Zo said, \"Maybe you missed that memo but politics is something you're not supposed to casually discuss.\" The bot wouldn't talk about Brexit or Black Lives Matter either. After rejecting politics four times, the chatbot was asked what it wanted to talk about. Topic of choice: Who invented the first pickle. Asked what it likes to do, Zo responded, \"Plan world domination.\" The blog MSPoweruser wrote about Zo earlier. Microsoft and rivals like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have released chatbot technology as part of a broader race to develop artificial intelligence capabilities that could create new digital services. Chatbots help these companies improve software that understands natural speech, while building a foundation for more natural and powerful interaction between humans and computers. The origin of the pickle is safer territory than Microsoft's Tay chatbot trod. Released in March, Twitter users quickly directed Tay to deny the Holocaust, call for lynching, equate feminism to cancer and stump for Adolf Hitler.

AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.” Under the tutelage of other Twitter users, Tay even learned how to make threats and identify “evil” races.Microsoft called this a “coordinated attack” that took advantage of a “critical oversight\" and took Tay down, even as it unveiled a significant new strategy focused on bots and related conversational computing tools. The company isn't giving up because it thinks the technology is such an important part of its future plans. “Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"With Zo, we’re focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.\" Zo performed better on one unscientific Hitler test, but only because it lacked a technical skill. The bot was sent a gif video snippet of Hitler and it replied that it can't read that type of file yet. BLOOMBERG ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft Edge is the new default web browser introduced to users when Windows 10 was launched. It replaced the infamous Internet Explorer which was completely relieved from duty and now competes directly with the other top browsers available such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple’s Safari and Opera. \nThings do not look very bright for Edge at the moment, as the market share statistics for the month of November have arrived. It looks like Microsoft Edge has lost some of its market shares this month, now having a total of 5.21% (going down from 5.26%). \nThe rest of the pie is split among Google Chrome, which is still the market leader with more than half the shares, Mozilla Firefox which is everyone’s second favorite browser, and Internet Explorer, Microsoft’s now disposed of web browser which still has more market shares than its successor Edge. The only notable competitors that are actually behind Edge are Opera and Safari. \nMicrosoft was looking to boost the popularity of Microsoft Edge by announcing the complete removal of support for Internet Explorer. Unfortunately, Edge is only available on Windows 10, meaning that people using any other Windows version wouldn’t have access to Edge to begin with. A lot of Internet Explorer users have reacted to the news by switching to competitors such as Chrome or Firefox which were already available and ready to go on older Windows versions. \nThe Creators Update, which is the latest major update package coming to Windows 10 will feature even more improvements for Microsoft Edge, with the company betting on Creators Update to boost Edge’s popularity. \nWhile plans for the future leave room for speculation as to how Edge will grow, the current reality is that it’s not doing that hot, as competition with Google Chrome can be quite brutal.

      "text": "0 0 \nThere is some unfortunate news for Windows Insiders that recently came to light. The steady stream of preview builds for Windows 10, that come through via the Fast ring are about to stop. Well, at least for now as far as we now. Microsoft has decided to “pause” the release of Windows 10 Insider Preview builds on both the Fast and Slow rings. \nThe Windows 10 Insider Preview builds for PCs, is revealed to be paused for the new Unified Update Platform delivery system transition. \nMicrosoft’s Dona Sarkar broke the news in a blog post. Addressing the release of Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview Build 14977 she stated: \n“We are getting ready to start releasing PC builds to Insiders using UUP. To prepare for this, we are going to pause all PC builds for both the Fast and Slow rings starting this evening (Friday 12/2). We will begin flighting the latest builds via UUP starting with our internal rings first then to Insiders based on each ring’s promotion criteria. We’re excited to be able to release builds for PC to Insiders using UUP! Mobile builds are not impacted by this.” \nIf you recall, Microsoft announced its Unified Update Platform (UUP) technologies about a month ago. That brought up several new features to Windows 10, mostly related to optimizing updates. \nMicrosoft further claimed that UUP will offer more control over the timing of when updates are installed. That will ultimately need less local processing and in turn, improves battery life. Moreover, UUP is equipped with technologies that uses differential downloads. \nThe new update mechanism will be available to Windows Insiders across PC, tablet, phone, IoT, and HoloLens. \nHere’s a comprehensive look at the new features of UUP : UUP Basic Features Bring the best of PC to Mobile: Unlike PCs, mobile devices require you to install in two-hops (updates) to get current.With UUP, Mobile will be able to jump to the latest build in one “hop” just like PC does today. That is, update the latest build in a single operation, irrespective to what base build you are currently running. Modified and efficient update mechanism: Microsoft is also revamping how Windows 10 checks for updates. “We are reducing the update data sent to client devices as well as the amount of processing we are doing on devices,” said Microsoft Director Bill Karagounis in November. This especially important for devices built on the Mobile OS. UUP will render the Windows Update service to assess which updates are needed by the device. That happens of course, when your device checks for updates. Selective builds download: Enables a device to only mark the latest build, rather than the full one and download it. It only adds the package that has been changed since you last updated your device. \nThis pause can be seen as a good thing after all. As it represents the beginning of the second phase. Allowing a change where PC-based Insiders builds will also start to be delivered via UUP. The official release of Windows 10 builds will be transitioned to this new system later in 2017.",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Credit: Microsoft 36% off NETGEAR AC750 WiFi Range Extender - Deal Alert \nMicrosoft's mammoth acquisition of LinkedIn has just cleared the last hurdle in front of it, paving the way for the tech titan to buy the professional social network for US$26.2 billion. \nEuropean Union regulators have approved the acquisition, joining agencies in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. The deal is expected to close \"in the coming days,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post Tuesday. \nThe news comes roughly six months after Microsoft announced the deal . Microsoft at the time said it expected the acquisition to close by the end of 2016, and it seems poised to hit that mark. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nIt's good news for Microsoft, considering that the company’s competitors filed complaints with European regulatory authorities to block the deal. Chief among them was Salesforce, which argued that Microsoft would be able to hoard LinkedIn's data to enhance its CRM products and other software while barring competitors from accessing it. \nMicrosoft did make several commitments to European regulators related to its treatment of LinkedIn, Smith said. The company committed to making its Office Add-In program available to third-party social networks so that LinkedIn competitors will be able to integrate their services into Microsoft's productivity apps. \nThe company also committed to allowing IT administrators the ability to hide the LinkedIn user interface from users if they choose to. Should Microsoft develop a LinkedIn application or tile for Windows, PC manufacturers will be able to opt-out of pre-installing it on devices sold in the European Economic Area. \nUsers will also be able to uninstall a LinkedIn application should it come pre-installed, and Microsoft also said that it wouldn't use Windows to prompt users to install that app. The hypothetical app could remain available for sale in the Windows Store, however, and Microsoft could choose to promote it in other ways. \nSome of these restrictions feel reminiscent of the EU-Microsoft antitrust judgment from the early 2000s. But all in all, they don’t add up to much of a negative consequence for Microsoft. The company will need to provide an open platform for competing social networks to access Windows and Office, but won’t be required to hand over LinkedIn's data. Related:",

      "title": "EU Clears $26 Billion Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal -- 2nd Update",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's$26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-06-161333ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

However, the approval wasn't a cakewalk for the software giant, as it had to cede in to some of EU-diktats to scrape through the European anti-trust approval process.\nThe European Commission said in a press release it has approved the proposed M&A deal and conditioned the approval on compliance with a series of commitments aimed at preserving competition among professional social networks in Europe.\nAmong the aspects the commission was concerned included:\nStifling competition among professional social networks by pre-installing LinkedIn in all Windows PCs and integrating LinkedIn into Microsoft Office and combine. Shutting out Microsoft's competitors through obligating customers buying LinkedIn services to also purchase its CRM software and denying its competitors access to full LinkedIn database, thus preventing then to develop advanced CRM functionalities. Online advertising services The commitments sought by the European Commission, include:\nEnsuring that PC manufacturers and distributors would be free not to install LinkedIn on Windows and allow users to uninstall it if PC manufacturers had pre-installed it. Allowing competing professional social networks to maintain current levels of interoperability with Microsoft's Office suite of products. granting competing professional social networks access to Microsoft Graph The deal now looks on track for the calendar year end closure.\n ",

The European Commission, which was the last regulatory agency needed to sign off on the deal, has cleared the acquisition. The news comes approximately six months after the software giant announced what will be its largest acquisition ever, with a total value of over $26 billion.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Donald Trump has ditched his stakes in Apple, Google , J.P. Morgan Chase, Nike , Microsoft , a spokesperson for the president-elect said Tuesday.\nThe investment moves, which included selling shares of not only those companies, but all of his stakes in public traded companies, appear to be part of the president-elect’s effort to remove some of the many conflicts of interest Trump will have to tackle as president. \nTrump Transition spokesperson Jason Miller told reporters that the real estate mogul made the stock sales in June. The disclosure came on a call with reporters after one asked about Trump’s stake in Boeing--a company that Trump criticized on Twitter Tuesday .\nCritics have argued that Trump’s stock holdings could be a conflict of interest for the president-elect after he steps in to the White House on Jan. 20. The president-elect held an interest in several financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, as well as energy companies such as Halliburton and ExxonMobil. Those holdings have worried onlookers, who say that it could skew the president-elect’s stance of Wall Street regulation and climate change. Trump had already gotten criticism for owning a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company trying to develop the Dakota Access Pipeline .\nIt’s unclear when exactly Trump sold out of those holdings, though the S&P 500 was up roughly 2% at the beginning of June, before falling following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union on June 24.\nGranted, Trump had a relatively small fraction of his over wealth in the stock market, according to May filings with the Federal Election Commission. Just $91.5 million of his estimated $4 billion net worth was invested in the stock market, many of which were large-cap, value stocks, which generally do better than others when the market drops. But it also means that he hasn’t benefitted from the so-called Trump Bump. The stock market is up over 3% since Trump was elected president. \nThe bulk of Trump’s wealth is still tied up in his real estate development company, which will continue to create conflicts for the president-elect, and be an issue for critics.\nHere were Trump’s 14 biggest stock holdings, according to the May filing , including shares of companies that Trump criticized on the campaign trail . (Campaign finance disclosure laws only require candidates give a range of value for their investments.)\n14. Alphabet : $100,000 to $200,000\n13. Caterpillar : $100,000 to $200,000\n12. Phillips 66 : $100,000 to $200,000 \n\n11. Celgene : $100,000 to $250,000\n10. Gilead Sciences : $100,000 to $250,000\n9. Visa : $100,000 to $251,000\n8. General Electric : $100,000 to $250,000\n7. Johnson and Johnson : $100,000 to $250,000\n6. Nike : $100,000 to $250,000\n5. McKesson : $100,000 to $250,000\n4. J.P. Morgan Chase : $100,000 to $251,000\n3. PepsiCo: $150,000 to $350,000\n2. Microsoft : $300,000 to $600,000\n1. Apple : $600,000 to $1.251 million\nTrump is also expected to discuss his business holdings, as well as plans for the Trump Organization, at a Dec. 15 news conference. Trump has said he plans to turn over operations of his company to his adult children, though he has not given details on that transition.",

      "text": "Meet the 23-year-old Nigerian who turned down Microsoft offer to start his own business Meet the 23-year-old Nigerian who turned down Microsoft offer to start his own business Sticky overkapacity Dec 6, 2016 Entertainment 0 \nChris Kwekowe, a 23-year-old Nigerian entrepreneur, turned down a job offer to work as a software engineer at Microsoft in order to begin his own start-up in Lagos, Nigeria. \nThe Lagos State University computer science graduate proudly revealed his plans to Microsoft CEO and founder, Bill Gates during a television interview for Africa’s brightest young entrepreneurs in August 2016. \nKwekowe, winner of the 2015 Anzisha Prize worth $25,000, said he rejected the offer to build up his own startup, Slatecube– a website aimed at helping other young Nigerians find jobs. \nHe told NewsWeek : \n“When I told him, Gates was intrigued and he smiled. After the programme, all the directors were like, ‘Dude, you mean you actually turned down a job at Microsoft and had the guts to tell Bill Gates?’ Kwekowe founded Slatecube with his brother Emerald, 20, in October 2014. The pair funded their efforts by freelancing as web designers and running a software solutions firm. \nHe said Slatecube seeks to solve that problem by nurturing the graduates through digital internships and so far, Slatecube has an 80% employment rate for its users. Companies that have used the platform, have saved over $100,000 in 2015 by hiring skilled, ready to work employees. \nIn a Facebook post published last August, Chris narrated in details of his meeting with Bill Gates: \n“Oh yeah, I did meet with Bill Gates in Durban, South Africa where we had some candid discussion about everything – from his involvement with charitable causes in the continent, to how he makes time to be a great father for his kids. My favourite moments were watching his reaction after I told him I turned down job offers from Microsoft and the likes to pursue something more defining for me, and how Africa’s development depends more on sustainable investments in innovative social startups like Slatecube that solve some of the continent’s biggest problems, rather than donating entirely to charity organisations who end up requiring more financial injection to deal with the minutest of issues. Anyways, we’d be working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to make our value proposition at Slatecube a pan-African privilege. Soon, you’d rather be in demand across the globe, and engage in companies and projects that make you better, and suits your career goals. Nothing can really be better” ",

      "title": "Microsoft thinks search boxes will disappear within ten years",
      "text": "By James Walker 42 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has published a list of major tech changes its researchers expect to see in the next ten years. They range from improved language translators and advances in deep learning to the prediction that traditional app search boxes will become obsolete. The list was created as part of Microsoft's Computer Science Education Week celebrations. The company chose to reflect its desire for everyone to be digitally literate by asking some of its female researchers to share their predictions. While women and girls represent around 50 percent of the world's population, they form just 20 percent of computer science graduates. A frequently cited reason for this divide is the lack of female role models for girls interested in STEM subjects. In an attempt to counteract this, Microsoft asked 17 women working in its global research departments for their opinions on what'll change in technology between 2017 and 2027. One of the most intriguing developments was suggested by distinguished scientist Susan Dumais. According to Dumais, the search box \"will disappear\" from interfaces in the next ten years. It will be replaced by automatic search functionality that's more \"ubiquitous, embedded and contextually sensitive.\" This is already becoming evident as devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home let you start a voice search in your home through barely any effort. Future search interfaces will also handle the context of your query, determining meaning based on your location, the people with you and the activity you're performing. Furthermore, additional search types will see more use, including search using images, sounds and video as the source. According to one of the researchers, computers will learn to \"see\" during the ten-year period. Xiaoyan Sun suggested that imaging devices and deep learning techniques will become so sophisticated that artificial \"eyes\" could be created. These would enable computers to assist humans in a variety of roles and professions, including medical and security applications. Further developments in deep learning will come from the creation of fair and accountable algorithms, distinguished scientist Jennifer Chayes said. By 2027, researchers will have developed algorithms that can avoid biases and manipulation, creating more robust systems. Current deep learning mechanisms often create the same data discriminations as humans do, a sign of their continued reliance on human input. In a different field of AI, the strides forward in cognitive computing will allow next-generation natural language processing systems to communicate with humans \"relatively effortlessly.\" Microsoft's Kalika Bali said she expects computers to start negotiating and debating with humans. They'll be able to engage in social situations and offer persuasive powers, creating culturally aware AI. The full list of predictions can be viewed over at Microsoft's official blog . It includes statements on the future of mobile computing and the evolution of biological computation in 2017 and beyond. The overarching message from the researchers is that developments in machine learning will enable the creation of computers that feel and act like humans. We'll get even closer to building true artificial intelligence and machines will help to solve significant societal issues by impartially reasoning. While some of the predictions may seem far-fetched today, just ten years ago the iPhone was yet to launch and virtual reality was little more than a concept. Given another decade, technology could undergo another revolution, either based on or alongside Microsoft's predictions today.",

(Photo: Carl Court, Getty Images) 3 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they will create a database of terrorist content online to act more quickly whenever videos, imagery or other information appears on their platforms. \nIn a joint statement, the companies will share digital fingerprints called \"hashes\" for videos or images pulled from their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" reads a portion of the statement. \nWhile all four companies will share content they've banned on their respective platforms, each can individually decide whether the banned content violates their own policies. \"Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found,\" says the statement. \nCompanies have already taken some steps to hamper the ability of terrorist organizations to promote their group or recruit members. In August, Twitter revealed it suspended 235,000 accounts for promoting extremism and terrorism. \nThe initiative arrives as tech companies faced increasing pressure to quickly remove terrorist content or hate speech. Reuters reports the European Union is pushing Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to move faster in scrubbing hate speech from their services. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .

Yet, third-party manufacturers will be needs to build appliances and devices which support the Home Hub. (Reuters) \nThe European Union today approved Microsoft ’s mega buyout of the professional networking site LinkedIn, provided the US tech giant meets commitments to allow fair competition. The European Commission, the EU executive, said it approved the merger after Microsoft offered promises, including leaving personal computer manufacturers and distributors free not to install LinkedIn on Windows operating systems. \n“The European Commission has approved under the EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft,” the commission said. \nMicrosoft’s USD 26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn was announced in June, the biggest-ever deal for a social media company. \n“Today’s decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. \nData has increasingly become a major driver for big acquisitions in the digital world, including the blockbuster buyout of messaging service WhatsApp by Facebook in 2014 that was waved through at the EU by Vestager’s predecessor.

The companies have until Jan. 9 to respond. \nThe matter was brought to the court by Prajwala, a Hyderabad-based NGO, which requested the service providers remove offensive materials immediately after the content was brought to their attention. \nThough these companies often block offensive content on their platforms, the issue in this instance is a lack of communication between the tech behemoths, service providers, local government and carriers. \n\"Once reported, the said offensive image or post or video shall be indexed in a shared database and the same shall be taken down and the account shall be reported to the authorities concerned within a span of 36 hours,\" NGO's counsel, Aparna Bhat said.\nThis isn't the first time the Indian court has had an issue with leading tech companies. In July, it concluded that Google, Bing, and Yahoo had hosted advertisements for tools, kits, and clinics that helped people determine the sex of a fetus, an act that is illegal in India.",

      "text": "Home » Press Releases » SCAM ALERT: Attorney General Chris Carr Warns of New Twist on Microsoft Tech Support Scam SCAM ALERT: Attorney General Chris Carr Warns of New Twist on Microsoft Tech Support Scam December 6, 2016 \nATLANTA, GA – Attorney General Chris Carr is warning consumers about a new twist on a technical support scam in which people pose as representatives from Microsoft. The scammers are taking the scheme a step further this time. See below for a detailed outline of their process: The scammer calls the consumer, posing as a Microsoft representative, to tell them something is wrong with their computer but fixable through a payment of a few hundred dollars. The scammer obtains personal account information to charge the victim’s credit card (sometimes repeatedly) for its “computer repair.” The scammer then calls back a few weeks later saying, “Unfortunately, the attempted repair was unsuccessful.” As a courtesy, the scammer offers to refund the amount the consumer paid, and he/she asks the consumer to provide bank information to deposit the money directly into their account. The scammer then “mistakenly” sends $3,000 instead of $300 to the account and asks the consumer to wire back the $2,700 overpayment. Because the money was transferred right into the consumer’s account, the scheme creates a false sense of safety, and the consumer wires the excess funds right back. It isn’t until later that the consumer, now victim, finds out where the $3,000 payment came from in the first place—their own credit card from the original phone call which was used to get a $3,000 cash advance. \nTo avoid scams like these, remember these tips: Microsoft will never call you for this reason. So if you get such a phone call, hang up immediately. If you get a call or message and you’re still in doubt, you should contact Microsoft’s Answer Desk directly at 1-800-426-9400. Never give out your financial or personal information to a caller, regardless of who they claim to be. Don’t click on pop-up windows; they may download malware onto your computer. Do not call toll-free numbers that appear on pop-up windows.",

      "text": "By: PRWeb December 06, 2016 at 17:00 PM EST Sensei Project Solutions Releases Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Microsoft Project Online in the Microsoft Office Store PRWeb \nSensei Project Solutions announced today the official launch of the Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Project Online, which provides support for Microsoft's new 'Resource Engagement Model.' \n\"Resource managers can now quickly see bottlenecks across the organization and proactively manage allocations of resources to projects,\" said Kenneth Steiness, CEO of Sensei Project Solutions. \"Project managers also benefit, as they can see conflicts for resources assigned to their projects.\" \nThree heatmaps help visualize the balance between resource capacity and demand in a much faster and more intuitive way. \nAvailability Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their capacity. This quickly shows how busy resources are with work from project schedules. \nEngagement Heatmap - Shows the engagement of resources in relation to their capacity. This allows resource managers to quickly determine the commitment level of resources. \nCoverage Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their engagements. This allows resource and project managers to ascertain mismatches in resourcing between the project schedules and engagements. \nWhen you view the Heatmaps, the coloring immediately draws your attention to problems. As users of Project Online would expect, a single click on the schedule icon will open the Project Desktop client to the relevant schedule, where the problem can be fixed immediately. \nThe Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App is available for individual users in the Microsoft Office Store, and organizations can purchase an Enterprise license directly from Sensei Project Solutions. \nAbout Sensei Project Solutions: Sensei Project Solutions, a Finalist for the 2015 Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) Partner of the Year, focuses on bringing Instant Productivity to your team.

It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce, Oracle and SAP out of the customer relationship management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to allow rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft will allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nIn addition, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a program used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud.

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and YouTube are joining forces to remove extremist content from their websites more efficiently.\nSavvy social media strategies have helped ISIS and other terrorist organizations disperse video and images online, helping to recruit new members and inspire attacks. As we wrote last year, ISIS in particular has been “using 21st-century technology to promote a medieval ideology involving mass killings, torture, rape, enslavement, and destruction of antiquities.”\nNow the companies whose websites are used to promulgate such content are going to work together to try and block it. Using a technique known as hashing—which can ascribe a unique number to a media file—they will share records of content that each has banned from its site.\nA report earlier this year claimed that Google and Facebook had started experimenting with the use of hashing to block extremist content. But the new shared database will mean that items banned by one organization will also be removed from the websites of the others. The new database will go into action in early 2017.\nThe blacklisted content won’t be automatically detected by algorithms. Instead, humans will perform that part of the task in order to ensure that, say, journalistic reporting of terrorism isn’t wrongly taken down.\nHany Farid, a computer scientist from Dartmouth College, has warned the Guardian that such a task should itself be carefully monitored. “You want people who have expertise in extremist content making sure it’s up to date,” he explained. “Otherwise you are relying solely on the individual technology companies to do that.”\nStill, the news is welcome. Historically, tech companies have resisted calls to police such content, but increasing political pressure has clearly forced them to reevaluate their approaches.\n(Read more: T he New York Times , The Guardian , “ Fighting ISIS Online ,” “ Facebook and Google May Be Fighting Terrorist Videos with Algorithms ,” “ What Role Should Silicon Valley Play in Fighting Terrorism? ”)",

Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market.

      "title": "EU Clears $26 Billion Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal -- 3rd Update",
      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\n\"The Quote: -unQuote: concessions are minimal and very much in line with the openness that Microsoft has been pursuing in the last few years,\" said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\n-- Jay Greene contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 14:14 ET (19:14 ",
