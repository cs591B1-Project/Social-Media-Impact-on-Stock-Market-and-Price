      "text": "Related Content View Photo FILE PHOTO: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders …\n\nBy Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp.\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis)",

Even sweeter, you should be able to stack the Cartwheel with this half-off promotion as they are two separate offers… WooHoo !\n\nCheck out this email from reader Adrienne – Tomorrow after 2PM at Target Starbucks, Frappuccinos are 50% off. There is also a 20% off Frappuccino Blended Beverages Cartwheel that is good till December 10th. I asked a Starbucks employee if the deal would work and he said he was talking about it with a coworkers earlier and they believe it will work, as it is 2 separate “offers” – a sale plus a Cartwheel! \n(Thanks, Adrienne!)

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nYou may well have a cup of coffee with you as you read this. \nRetail earnings for coffee brands have shot up 14.2 percent over the past four years alone, according to research from Packaged Facts. A third (34 percent) of coffee drinkers sipped theirs out-of-home in 2016, up from 30 percent in 2015, according to the 2106 National Coffee Drinking Trends Report. \nBrands like Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts are clearly conquering consumers’ wallets, but which of these are capturing their hearts on social media? We used proprietary data from social media analytics firm Unmetric to find out. Advertisement \nHere’s how Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, Peet’s, Caribou, Seattle’s Best, Tim Hortons and The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf stack up against one another in terms of user base, engagement and social reach. Starbucks unsurprisingly gets the most tweets, likes and shares on both Facebook and Instagram. But brands like Peet’s and Tim Hortons beat it in areas like engagement and sentiment. \nNumber of Followers \nWith over 36 million followers on Facebook, 11 million followers on Twitter and 12 million followers on Instagram, Starbucks has the largest social footprint, followed by Dunkin’. Interestingly though, Tim Hortons and Caribou trumped Starbucks in terms of percentage growth: Tim Hortons’ followers grew at the highest rate (nearly 20 percent) between January and December 2016 on Twitter, while Caribou saw the highest-percentage growth on Facebook in the same period (8 percent). \nEngagement With over 25,000 tweets, Starbucks was the most active brand on Twitter, but it was Bay Area-based Peet’s Coffee & Tea that had the highest average engagement, with a score of 278, according to Unmetric. On Facebook, Caribou Coffee published the greatest number of posts (323). But it was Seattle’s Best Coffee that had the highest average engagement, with a score of 977. \nSentiment Of the total volume of tweets individually received by these brands, The Coffee Bean had the highest negative sentiment (97) on Twitter between January and December 2016, according to Unmetric. On the other hand, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Tim Hortons received the most positive sentiment. \nSeattle’s Best Coffee received the highest percentage of positive sentiment (52 percent) on Facebook too, while Caribou and Tim Hortons had the most negative sentiment. \nResponse Time By responding to over 50 percent of its tweets within 15 minutes, Tim Hortons is the most attentive coffee brand on Twitter, followed by Starbucks, which replies to over 30 percent of its tweets in the same time frame. Seattle’s Best Coffee is the slowest to respond, taking over a day to respond to 60 percent of its tweets. Related ",

Doug Kass Dec5,20161:00AMEST \nDoug Kass shares his views every day on RealMoneyPro. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nMy Takeaways and Observations \nOriginally published Dec. 1 at 5:48 p.m. EDT What a strange day -- maybe even ominous. This table tells it all. The divergences I have been mentioning this week intensified today, with the technology-laden Nasdaq taken out to the shed and the Russell 2000 Index trading lower for the third consecutive day. Breadth was poor as were new highs and new lows. Moreover, put/call was still low indicating continued complacency. T he Good, the Bad and the Ambiguous from Wednesday's trading. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and the financials were upside leaders and carried the DJIA and led to slightly better relative performance for the S&P 500 Index. Tech led the downside in a vicious rotation away from the sector. It was short pressing time for me. Though I took off my Trade of the Week (short iShares Russell 2000 Index (ET ( IWM ) calls and long IWM puts) -- which worked like a charm and was quite profitable. I cleaned up tag ends in a number of very small shorts Thursday and took off five names from my Best Ideas List. Halved my favorite large-cap long, DuPont ( DD ) , and my favorite large-cap short, Coca-Cola ( KO ) , down to small size, based on changing risk/reward ratios. A short grows in Apple ( AAPL ) . I covered half of my remaining Starbucks ( SBUX ) short at around $55.25 after the Howard Schultz resignation announcement. Closed-end muni bond funds and more .",

      "text": "Doug Kass shares his views every day on RealMoneyPro. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings.\nMy Takeaways and Observations\nOriginally published Dec. 1 at 5:48 p.m. EDT\nWhat a strange day -- maybe even ominous. This table tells it all. The divergences I have been mentioning this week intensified today, with the technology-laden Nasdaq taken out to the shed and the Russell 2000 Index trading lower for the third consecutive day. Breadth was poor as were new highs and new lows. Moreover, put/call was still low indicating continued complacency. T he Good, the Bad and the Ambiguous from Wednesday's trading. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and the financials were upside leaders and carried the DJIA and led to slightly better relative performance for the S&P 500 Index. Tech led the downside in a vicious rotation away from the sector. It was short pressing time for me. Though I took off my Trade of the Week (short iShares Russell 2000 Index (ET ( IWM ) calls and long IWM puts) -- which worked like a charm and was quite profitable. I cleaned up tag ends in a number of very small shorts Thursday and took off five names from my Best Ideas List. Halved my favorite large-cap long, DuPont ( DD ) , and my favorite large-cap short, Coca-Cola ( KO ) , down to small size, based on changing risk/reward ratios. A short grows in Apple ( AAPL ) . I covered half of my remaining Starbucks ( SBUX ) short at around $55.25 after the Howard Schultz resignation announcement. Thoughtful \"El Capitan\" comments/input .\nClosed-end muni bond funds and more . Peak Refinancings . Danielle and the French Connection . The downside to lower tax rates for Citi ( C ) and the other financial intermediaries. Regarding the Donald Trump speech at the Carrier facility, I have some brief thoughts: I believe that speech was one of the more reckless speeches I have ever heard from a president or president-elect. Let me explain. To me it is chilling when companies are threatened -- and many Republicans and Democrats will think the same. To say, public/tax policy will made on the basis of making companies fearful is insane. A president should want to create a sustainable atmosphere in which companies will stay in the U.S., not participate in ad hoc or isolated and random attacks on companies. While the president has vast powers, I don't even think he has the \"authority to tax heavily at the border.\" What criteria is he basing such a decision on? This is going to be an eventful four years.",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAK\nAssociated Press NEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Starbucks 2.0: coffee giant plans to go more... | 3 hours ago | Vote 0 0 Starbucks 2.0: coffee giant plans to go more upscale STARBUCKS 2 Victor J. Blue,Bloomberg Pedestrians walk past a Starbucks coffee shop in New York. CEO Howard Schultz is planning the company's next move with the addition of outlets called Roasteries, targeting a more upscale market. By Craig Giammona Howard Schultz, the billionaire who built a caffeine empire by bringing Italian coffee culture to the American mainstream, is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. Schultz, who will become executive chair when he steps down as chief executive officer at Starbucks Corp. next year, says he'll focus on his three-pronged bet that the world's largest coffee chain needs to become more upscale. The program includes a line of premium coffee called Reserve, as many as 1,000 cafés that will showcase the new brand and flagship stores as large as 20,000 square feet called Roasteries. The 63-year-old executive will soon be free from the daily grind of running a $21-billion business, allowing him to devote his attention to a key initiative that's been slow to gain momentum over the past two years. \"When you're making an investment and taking a risk like this, there's no better person to spearhead it than Howard,\" said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., which tracks the restaurant industry. \"He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.\" With more shopping done online, Schultz has said he wants to emulate the brick-and-mortar retail experiences offered by innovators like Nike and Apple. Starbucks opened the first Roastery location two years ago, a 15,000-square-foot emporium in its hometown of Seattle, and is planning others in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The menu includes small-lot coffee from around the world that can sell for more than $20 a pound. The cavernous stores, where customers can watch coffee being roasted on site, are envisioned as high-end flagships for the company, but rollout has been slowed by high construction costs and trouble finding suitable real estate. Analysts are skeptical that a handful of Roasteries can move the needle for the massive company, which operates more than 16,000 cafés worldwide, including more than 1,200 outlets in Canada. Instead, they say financial growth is expected to come from the Reserve locations. The new cafés are planned to be similar to the Roasteries but without the actual bean-cooking operation. It's part of a move by Schultz to add different store concepts around the world and reimagine the 45-year-old chain. \"He's always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.\" Starbucks said Schultz wasn't available to be interviewed for this article. To be sure, there are risks in going more upscale. Some customers already balk at paying more than $5 for a coffee drink, and with rising health-care costs and stagnant wage growth causing anxiety among U.S. consumers, the effort could run into headwinds, particularly if there's an economic downturn, Bartashus said. Starbucks needs the Reserve cafés to work because there's more and more competition from local and regional chains that are pulling in younger customers. To secure the next generation of consumers, Starbucks has to convince millennials that it's a cool place for coffee — a difficult proposition after four decades that saw the company grow to become a mainstream brand like McDonald's. Starbucks is also pushing into the Chinese market, with plans to open hundreds of stores. Growing domestically won't be easy given the rise of competitors such as Blue Bottle, Stumptown and Intelligentsia, independent chains that cater to a premium audience. It's those chains that are pressuring Starbucks, in addition to mainstream competitors like Dunkin' Donuts or Coffee &Bagels, a new chain being developed by JAB Holding Co. The European investment firm backed by Austria's billionaire Reimann family has used acquisitions, including Stumptown and Krispy Kreme, to build its own coffee empire. When Schultz acquired the then-six-unit chain in the late 1980s, it wasn't typical for Americans to spend hours in a café sipping expensive coffee. That changed, and with Starbucks established as a daily ritual for millions of Americans, Schultz is once again focused on changing their habits. The move upscale is in line with where the restaurant has been heading in recent years, and it helps that Starbucks sells a product that most customers consume daily and consider an affordable luxury, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG Research. \"Being a premium brand is where it's at in this industry,\" he said. \"People gravitate to more and more expensive coffee.\" \nBloomberg",

      "text": "Loading the player... Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ), Facebook ( FB ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Starbucks ( SBUX ) and Foot Locker ( FL ) lead your stocks to watch this week.\nUlta Beauty Ulta went on a wild ride Friday, initially breaking out past a double-bottom entry at 268.88. Then shares reversed lower, found support at the 50-day line and ultimately closed down 1.6% at 253.39. The beauty products retailer reported another estimate-beating quarter late Thursday and issued strong Q4 guidance. See if the stock can continue to hold above the 50-day line and break out of the base.\nFacebook, Alphabet Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook have been notable losers in the postelection sector rotation . Facebook fell back below its 200-day line this past week, coming close to its Nov. 14 low of 113.55 — a level the stock hadn't seen since four months prior. Shares are now 13.5 below their Oct. peak. Alphabet lost support at its 200-day line on Friday, and is trading 9% below its high.\nStarbucks Starbucks is nearing a test of support at its 200-day line after retaking that level on Nov. 22. The stock has been consolidating, i.e. moving sideways, since October 2015 and is trading 10.6% below its high reached at that time. The late-Thursday announcement that CEO Howard Schultz will be stepping aside to become executive chairman is weighing on shares.\nFoot Locker After issuing estimate-beating earnings on Nov. 18, Foot Locker found support near the 50-day line and reversed to close the session higher. It soon after cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 73.47 buy point, and though the stock dipped below that level, it's now back in buy range.\nIBD'S TAKE: Want to be able to learn how to spot bases and buy points for yourself?

      "title": "Looking Forward From Starbucks' CEO Schultz's Departure",
      "text": "Looking Forward From Starbucks' CEO Schultz's Departure Dec. 5.16 \nNew CEO Johnson's technology experience should help the company to continue to succeed in digital payments. \nSchultz will stay with the company to focus on premium Roastery and Reserve brands. \nLarge-scale expansion into China continues to be the main driver of future value for Starbucks. The month of December started with Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz announcing he will be stepping down from his post (effective April 3, 2017). Schultz will remain with the company in the role of Executive Chairman and current Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will step into the CEO role. The stock fell around 10% after hours once the move was announced and eventually was down about 3.26% after-hours that Thursday evening. Starbucks is still a stock that is showing great promise for the future and I do not see this move having a negative impact on the future direction of the company. I believe it is especially important that Schultz will maintain a role within the company. He will continue to work in retail innovation, particularly regarding the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve brands. The Reserve shops are premium retail coffee shops where the average ticket price is four times the average ticket price of a traditional Starbucks. The Roastery is being described as a \"previously unattained level of premiumization.\" In a Fortune article, Schultz stated, \"we will also add Reserve bars into thousands of existing Starbucks.\" Starbucks is planning on adding over 20 Roasteries and over 1,000 Reserve stores. Schultz will continue to work on achieving the long-term goals of these brands, which are to help Starbucks continue to be a differentiator in the coffee industry. Click to enlarge ( Courtesy of Forbes) Kevin Johnson joined Starbucks in 2015 by becoming the company's president and chief operating officer. He had since been on the board of directors since 2009. It will be very beneficial for Johnson that Schultz will be remaining with the company. In a recent CNBC article, \"Schultz praised Johnson, noting that the last two fiscal years have been the best in the company's history in part of the COO.\" Johnson has experience at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and within the technology industry. Therefore, it is believed Johnson can help Starbucks continue to fully utilize consumer technology as it has recently done with the company's successful mobile order platform. Starbucks also has several positive things going for them as Johnson takes on the CEO role. One of these being the company's large-scale expansion into China. The company is currently in progress of doubling its store count in China to 5,000 within the next five years. Just this past June, Starbucks saw same-store sales in China increase by 7%. Starbucks will capitalize on China's immense population paired with the country's growth in coffee consumption. The company's Teavana brand has grown in sales in each of the past seven quarters. Starbucks is hoping that the intense popularity of tea in China should continue to grow this recently acquired brand. According to Forbes, the increase in sales of Teavana could increase the average spend per customers for Starbucks. Click to enlarge (Courtesy of Wall Street Journal) Starbucks has seen incredible success with its mobile order platform. 25% of the company's transactions now come from a mobile payment method. The emergence of Johnson as CEO could lead us to see Starbucks continuing to utilize technology as a large contributor to sales. Mobile payments for Starbucks could continue to rise to potentially half of the company's sales. Starbucks believes that the increase in smartphones being used in China will help play a positive factor in the company's expansion efforts. According to Bloomberg, the company has been expected to increase overall technology investments to over $300 Million in 2016. Given the consistency Starbucks has had in sustaining a high ROIC, the company should be able to turn this investment in value-add for the company itself and to investors. Click to enlarge (Courtesy of Bloomberg) I am bullish on Starbucks in terms of the long term, but I am still aware there are risks involved with the company. One of these risks is that large-scale expansion in China could not go as planned. We could potentially see this expansion not go well with the primary risk being the growth in coffee consumption could not grow in China as it is currently anticipated. It is also important to see how the Teavana brands fare in China as well. This could be the best indicator of how successful the large-scale China expansion will go. Another risk is the effectiveness of the new roles of Johnson and Schultz. Could we possibly see Schultz micro-manage Johnson from his role as Executive Chairman? Or could we see Schultz focus his career towards politics and take his focus off his new role? These are critical circumstances that we must keep an eye on in the future. Starbucks must also continue to keep its eyes on competitors. The coffee industry contains low switching costs so it is easy for competitors to switch to other companies such as Dunkin', McDonald's, and Keurig. Starbucks has seen double-digit revenue growth every year since 2012 and this trend is likely to continue into the future. Projections found on Yahoo Finance currently forecast an annual revenue growth of 16.85% for Starbucks over the next five years. This is compared to an industry projected annual growth rate of just 0.13%. Starbucks is going to see this growth through continuing to improve same-store sales and from reaping the benefits of the company's large scale expansion into China. According to Morningstar, the company has seen a ROIC of 23% or higher in six of the past seven years. This level of consistency makes the expansion into China look even more promising. The data pictured below shows the benefits long-term investors have received by holding Starbucks shares. The stock may receive some volatility here in the short term due to the CEO change, but there is strong reason to believe this is a stock that shows promising potential for long-term investors. Starbucks also has a nice 1.72% dividend yield to help provide short-term rewards for investors. This has also seen consistent growth over the past few years. Click to enlarge (Graphic from Morningstar) If your portfolio is built on long-term equities, then I would not recommend getting rid of Starbucks right now. Kevin Johnson has the experience and positive relationship with Schultz where his term as CEO should help the company continue to move in a positive direction. It is a positive factor that Schultz will stay with the company and continue to work on the company's Roastery and Reserve brands. It is also important to know just how wide of an economic moat Starbucks controls in the coffee industry. The Starbucks brand and continued innovation have far differentiated the company from others in the industry. The company's expansion in China and continued success with mobile payments should continue to help Starbucks differentiate itself from competitors and remain successful in an overall slow growing industry. Schultz is no longer CEO of Starbucks, but the company still has a very bright future.

      "title": "Starbucks 2.0: coffee giant plans to go more upscale",
      "text": "Howard Schultz, the billionaire who built a caffeine empire by bringing Italian coffee culture to the American mainstream, is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. Schultz, who will become executive chair when he steps down as chief executive officer at Starbucks Corp. next year, says he'll focus on his three-pronged bet that the world's largest coffee chain needs to become more upscale. The program includes a line of premium coffee called Reserve, as many as 1,000 cafés that will showcase the new brand and flagship stores as large as 20,000 square feet called Roasteries.\nThe 63-year-old executive will soon be free from the daily grind of running a $21-billion business, allowing him to devote his attention to a key initiative that's been slow to gain momentum over the past two years.\n\"When you're making an investment and taking a risk like this, there's no better person to spearhead it than Howard,\" said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., which tracks the restaurant industry. \"He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.\"\nWith more shopping done online, Schultz has said he wants to emulate the brick-and-mortar retail experiences offered by innovators like Nike and Apple. Starbucks opened the first Roastery location two years ago, a 15,000-square-foot emporium in its hometown of Seattle, and is planning others in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The menu includes small-lot coffee from around the world that can sell for more than $20 a pound.\nThe cavernous stores, where customers can watch coffee being roasted on site, are envisioned as high-end flagships for the company, but rollout has been slowed by high construction costs and trouble finding suitable real estate.\nAnalysts are skeptical that a handful of Roasteries can move the needle for the massive company, which operates more than 16,000 cafés worldwide, including more than 1,200 outlets in Canada. Instead, they say financial growth is expected to come from the Reserve locations.\nThe new cafés are planned to be similar to the Roasteries but without the actual bean-cooking operation. It's part of a move by Schultz to add different store concepts around the world and reimagine the 45-year-old chain.\n\"He's always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.\"\nStarbucks said Schultz wasn't available to be interviewed for this article.\nTo be sure, there are risks in going more upscale. Some customers already balk at paying more than $5 for a coffee drink, and with rising health-care costs and stagnant wage growth causing anxiety among U.S. consumers, the effort could run into headwinds, particularly if there's an economic downturn, Bartashus said.\nStarbucks needs the Reserve cafés to work because there's more and more competition from local and regional chains that are pulling in younger customers. To secure the next generation of consumers, Starbucks has to convince millennials that it's a cool place for coffee — a difficult proposition after four decades that saw the company grow to become a mainstream brand like McDonald's.\nStarbucks is also pushing into the Chinese market, with plans to open hundreds of stores. Growing domestically won't be easy given the rise of competitors such as Blue Bottle, Stumptown and Intelligentsia, independent chains that cater to a premium audience.\nIt's those chains that are pressuring Starbucks, in addition to mainstream competitors like Dunkin' Donuts or Coffee & Bagels, a new chain being developed by JAB Holding Co. The European investment firm backed by Austria's billionaire Reimann family has used acquisitions, including Stumptown and Krispy Kreme, to build its own coffee empire.\nWhen Schultz acquired the then-six-unit chain in the late 1980s, it wasn't typical for Americans to spend hours in a café sipping expensive coffee. That changed, and with Starbucks established as a daily ritual for millions of Americans, Schultz is once again focused on changing their habits.\nThe move upscale is in line with where the restaurant has been heading in recent years, and it helps that Starbucks sells a product that most customers consume daily and consider an affordable luxury, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG Research.\n\"Being a premium brand is where it's at in this industry,\" he said. \"People gravitate to more and more expensive coffee.\"\nBloomberg",

      "text": "November Portfolio Roundup: 2 Buys, 1 New Position (Seeking Alpha) \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is scheduled to host its Analyst Day on Wednesday. While investors are focusing on gaining an insight into the company’s ability to sustain Americas comps at 5 percent over the medium term, shares are likely to respond to any announcement of increased share repurchases, Cowen’s Andrew M. Charles said in a report. \nCharles maintains an Outperform rating on the company, with a price target of $66. Comps, EPS Growth \nThe focus of the Analyst Day will likely be learning about the drivers to reach and sustain 5 percent Americas comps, which would be comprised of 1 percent from beverage innovation, 1–2 percent from food innovation and 1 percent from Teavana. \n“This implies a 1–2 percent contribution from traffic that will be critical to prove reacceleration as the April shift in the MSR structure sacrifices at least 1 percent of traffic for mix growth,” Charles wrote. \nApart from comps, it would be interesting to know how Starbucks plans to return to the midpoint of 15–20 percent EPS growth in 2017, given the sales and labor headwinds. The company’s EPS growth could be backed by “more efficient G&A, increased share repurchases and high-flow thru of CPG licensed sales,” the analyst mentioned. Share Repurchases \nAdding debt to repurchase shares would help Starbucks return to its long-term 15–20 percent range for EPS growth in FY 2018, Charles mentioned. If the company were to spend $5.2 billion in share buybacks from Q2 2017 to Q1 2018, this could be accretive to its 2018 EPS by $0.07. \nAt last check, Starbucks shares were up 0.75 percent at $57.64.

      "title": "Starbucks: Abnormal Returns A Thing Of The Past",
      "text": "There could be cause for concern now that the founder is not at the helm. \nFounder CEOs and non-founder CEOs behave differently. \nAbnormal returns for Starbucks are a thing of the past. Shareholders and Wall Street are typically a bunch of fickle people. News of the CEO stepping down scared them as usual. But does it really matter? This time around, their jittery behavior is justified because the founder is involved. Corporate CEO Returns With regard to investing in Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), if your sole focus is the future return potential, then you are a bit late for that. There is a high probability that the large abnormal returns are over. According to well-known research, typically when founders are at the helm of their companies, the stock prices appreciates three times as much as do companies with non-founder CEOs. There is typically a performance disruption when a replacement CEO is at the helm. Click to enlarge (Source: HBR.org ) Founder CEO mentality Typically, founder CEOs take more risks than hired CEOs. Even as Howard Schultz steps down he is still taking an active role to trying to build out the stores. There is no focus on the stock price on his mind as is typical of founders . Founder CEOs differ from other CEOs in terms of motivation, knowledge, attitudes values, and culture. Schultz is more concerned about the customers and employees. Recall the stock market shock that occur 2015 of last year. Schultz told his employees to be mindful of the losses that many patrons possibly incurred. He identifies with the company. Founders' mentality captures the owner's mindset and goes against industry norms which is shareholder focused. It is this mindset that enables founders to make hard decisions affecting the long term outlook of the firm. These characteristics can be identified in a theory known as Organizational Identification theory. Some of the implications of this theory we have seen in Starbucks include high employee satisfaction , positive repuation , sustained competitive advantage, and a lack of selfish ambitions from Schultz. Due to the uniqueness of founder CEOs, they are considered a extremely valuable resource. The resource based view suggests that firms have sustainable competitive advantage as long as their resources are valuable, rare, non-imitable, and non substitutable. Replacing Howard Schultz as CEO, Starbucks may have lost some of its competitive advantage. On the flip side, because he is still with the company, as an individual, he can easily be tapped for his knowledge and experience when required. That is the resource. Ultimately, the CEO typically makes the final decisions. If the new CEO fails to use Schultz for his expertise, Schultz, though a valuable and rare resource, will not be able to benefit the company. Firm Performance I won't look at stock performance as an indication of how well the firm will perform in the future. It is a lousy short-term indicator. Instead, accounting ratios such as ROA and ROE give a better analysis of firm performance. Throughout Schultz's tenure, Starbucks has maintained consistent efficiency, 50% for ROE and 20% for ROA. Keep in mind, the new CEO is inheriting a different company from the one Schultz started, and he will approach the company differently from Schultz. It remains to be seen how efficient he can make the company. Click to enlarge (Source: Gurufocus ) Conclusion Replacement of the founder CEO will have an impact on the firm performance and stock performance. It is not a bad thing. Change occurs all the time. However, if you are concerned with stock performance, then I am afraid you have missed the out on the abnormal returns. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.  ",

The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology. \nThe original McCafe machines cost about $13,000 . \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in the face of growing pressure from falling food prices , which has resulted in more people eating at home over restaurants. \nNOW WATCH: 9 items you shouldn't buy at Costco \n",

      "text": "Mike Mozart/flickr \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in hopes of chipping away at Starbucks' coffee empire. \nThe company first launched its coffee brand, McCafe, eight years ago, and it now generates about $4 billion annually, or about 16% of sales per year. \nNext year it's relaunching the brand by upgrading its espresso machines and kicking off a marketing campaign that will highlight its competitive prices, Bloomberg reports . \nFor the first quarter of the year, McDonald's will offer a promotion for $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages, according to the report. \nThat's about half the price of Starbucks. \nStarbucks Pike Place brewed coffee costs $2.10 for a grande, and specialty beverages cost upwards of $4.25 for a tall. \nMcDonald's is also hoping to improve its specialty coffee beverages with new $12,000 espresso machines. The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology.",

      "title": "General Mills, Like Starbucks, Could Have a New CEO in 2017",
      "text": "It was just earlier this year that Starbucks ( SBUX ) reshuffled its management ranks to give a top lieutenant more responsibility, only to announce last week that long-time CEO Howard Schultz would be stepping down from the day to day grind and moving into the executive chairman role.\nNow, Cereal giant General Mills ( GIS ) may have just sent a signal that the handing off of the CEO baton from Ken Powell -- who has led the company since September 2007 -- is looming as well. General Mills today announced a new structure that will organize it into four segments: North America Retail, Europe and Australia, Asia and Latin America, and Convenience Stores and Foodservice. Each segment will have its own leader. Each will report directly to Jeff Harmening, General Mills' current president and COO. Global operations functions such as innovation, technology and quality and supply chain will continue to report to Harmening.\nLong rumored to be Powell's successor, Harmening, who like Powell has spent his entire career at General Mills, was promoted to his current role in July. Before that, he was COO of the company's U.S. retail business, overseeing areas such as baking, cereal, snacks and yogurts.\nAs part of the new structure, Powell will arguably take on a role that more closely resembles an executive chairman. His direct reports will include finance, legal, human resources, and external relations. Harmening will continue to report to Powell.\nA General Mills spokeswoman said in an email that today's news doesn't change Powell's role as chairman and CEO.",

      "text": "Mike Mozart/flickr \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in hopes of chipping away at Starbucks' coffee empire. \nThe company first launched its coffee brand, McCafe, eight years ago, and it now generates about $4 billion annually, or about 16% of sales per year. \nNext year it's relaunching the brand by upgrading its espresso machines and kicking off a marketing campaign that will highlight its competitive prices, Bloomberg reports . \nFor the first quarter of the year, McDonald's will offer a promotion for $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages, according to the report. \nThat's about half the price of Starbucks. \nStarbucks Pike Place brewed coffee costs $2.10 for a grande, and specialty beverages cost upwards of $4.25 for a tall. \nMcDonald's is also hoping to improve its specialty coffee beverages with new $12,000 espresso machines. The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology.",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Michael Kappel \nDecember 5, 2016 12:10 pm EST By Laura Northrup @lnorthrup espresso markup mccafe franchisees coffee machines mcdonald's \nJust like better burger joints have nibbled away at McDonald’s sandwich business, competitors with a wider variety of coffee options are attracting the caffeine-seeking consumers away from the Golden Arches. Now the fast food giant wants to re-establish its coffee bona fides, investing in equipment to help stores compete with the likes of Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nWhile Americans know McCafé as the brand on their brewed coffee or the occasional pumpkin spice latte, it’s a fancier line and even a standalone higher-end café in international markets. The Hong Kong branch teamed up with hazelnut confectioner Ferrero to make hazelnut-themed coffee beverages and confections a few years ago , for example. In Australia, the company used the McCafé brand on an experimental restaurant marketing healthier fare, calling it “The Corner by McCafé.” \nThat’s probably bad news to franchisees, who would like to do away with the whole McCafé line to simplify processes behind the counter. Instead, according to Bloomberg , what they’ll be getting are upgraded McCafé machines that make a wider variety of fancy beverages from the McCafé menu and cost $12,000. \nThat will only be good news to franchisees if the new machines are the product that was tested in Chicago earlier this year, which allows customers to press a button and make their own mochas and lattes . \nEspresso-based beverages have a higher markup, which is why fast food eateries push them. McDonald’s wants to sell more of them, and plans to increase its offerings of seasonal beverages, along with a better coffee rewards program. ",

      "text": "McDonald’s will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. (Associated Press file / PR Newswire) MONDAY, DEC. 5, 2016, 11:19 A.M. McDonald’s revamps $4 billion McCafe brand as it lags Starbucks By Leslie Patton Bloomberg Twitter \nMcDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand – part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain’s coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald’s offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn’t become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is “a very important piece,” Cunningham said. “It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.” \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald’s is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It’s also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald’s is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald’s isn’t alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle’s Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald’s sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall – the first time it’s done so in three years. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said “showcases the company’s passion for elevating the cafe experience.” McDonald’s now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald’s is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald’s diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that’s affordable and familiar, he said. \n“It’s going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,” Slabaugh said. “I don’t expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.” Published: Dec. 5, 2016, 11:19 a.m.",

      "title": "McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand as it lags Starbucks",
      "text": "The Washington Post McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand as it lags Starbucks McDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand — part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. 5   (mcdonalds.com) The company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. Coffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. McCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" Re-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. McDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. McDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. McDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand . The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. (Pedestrians walk past a Starbucks coffee shop in New York; the coffee company is targeted every holiday season for its politics. Bloomberg photo by Victor J. Blue) The chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants , said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald's sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall — the first time it's done so in three years. The company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said \"showcases the company's passion for elevating the cafe experience.\" McDonald's now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. In the U.S., McDonald's is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent -tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. But the typical McDonald's diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that's affordable and familiar, he said. \"It's going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,\" Slabaugh said. \"I don't expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.\" (c) 2016, Bloomberg · Leslie Patton / The Washington Post",

      "text": "svenska Starbucks' Schultz and What it Means for Consumer Packaged Goods Business Coffee giants made major gains away from stores and will thrive despite CEO stepping down, finds Packaged Facts News provided by Dec 05, 2016, 15:12 ET Share this article ROCKVILLE, Md. , Dec. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The holiday season didn't just ring in the news about the return of Starbucks' famed (and controversial) red cups. In other big news, longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz announced that he was stepping down as CEO of the company, effective April 2017 . Schultz plans on staying on board as Executive Chairman, turning the CEO reins over to Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson . Schultz's remarks about his departure mostly focused on his view that the \"U.S. was over-retailed\" and that to survive and succeed, retailers would need to change their physical presences into \"premiumized, experiential consumer venues.\" To this end, Schultz said that he would focus his attention on Starbucks reimagining of retail – the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve brands. Schultz said that the company's Seattle Roastery has become a laboratory for \"breakthrough innovation and experiential design\" that will lead to the next generation of Starbucks stores. Lost in this news are the incredible inroads that Starbucks has made in sales away from its stores, notes market research publisher Packaged Facts, which will release brand new reports on the coffee and tea industries within the next week, including the joint title Coffee and Tea: U.S. Retail Market Trends . View Packaged Facts' collection of coffee and tea themed market research reports at: http://www.packagedfacts.com/coffee-tea-market-c471/ . The company said that its consumer packaged goods (CPG) growth has been very strong. This has been achieved in the following ways: Starbucks has been the number one K-Cup brand for the 5 th consecutive quarter. Starbucks roast and ground coffee has been the top premium coffee brand, outpacing growth in the overall segment. Overall, it ranks as the number two coffee brand. The Starbucks ready-to-drink offerings such as Double Shot, Frappuccino and Chilled Multi-Serve, through its partnership with PepsiCo, are the leaders in ready-to-drink coffee. 80% of U.S. coffee occasions happen outside of coffee shops Starbucks has more than 500 Signature Aisles across grocery stores across the country The company also has new CPG offerings in China , Latin America and Europe . The company is also about to take on the ready-to-drink packaged tea segment, with the launch in the first half of 2017 of its premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas in the U.S. through its partnership with Anheuser-Busch. Starbucks is certainly \"firing on all cylinders\" in its CPG business, as Schultz said in an investor call earlier in 2016. It remains to be seen whether the company will continue to motor on without Schultz at the helm. Packaged Facts is betting the company's growth won't stall.

      "title": "Middle-Market Woes Inspire Starbucks's Bet on Luxury Coffee",
      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nAbout 25 years ago, Starbucks Corp. decided to become a public company on the bold idea that customers across the country would pay more than $1 for a cup of coffee.\nNow, Starbucks is betting people will pay as much as $1 an ounce.\nHoward Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global brand with more than 25,000 shops, said last week that he was planning to step down as chief executive to work on a project within Starbucks to build high-end coffee shops charging as much as $12 for 12 ounces of coffee.\nStarbucks plans to open 20 to 30 giant Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room outlets -- where rare, exotic coffee grown in small batches will be roasted on site and prepared using a variety of brewing methods -- as well as up to 1,000 smaller stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand.\n\"We've seen so-called 'indies' selling cups of coffee for a lot more than we're charging and creating an interesting buzz,\" Mr. Schultz said last week in an interview.\nSome experts say the company's plan to create a subbrand of luxury coffee shops aimed at the affluent is a good strategic move, given consumers' growing interest in better-quality coffee. They also point to a shrinking middle class with less discretionary spending power, which threatens demand for traditional Starbucks coffee.\nIn addition to coffee, the new stores will offer craft cocktails, informed by a new generation of high-end \"mixology\" bars and trendy watering holes that strive for a speakeasy atmosphere. Mr. Schultz said Starbucks executives studied such bars clandestinely.\nStarbucks has missed sales targets in its largest market -- the U.S. -- for four straight quarters, which it attributes to economic uncertainty, and has promised to return to its historic same-store sales growth rate of 5%.\nMr. Schultz said the company's plans for going upmarket took root three years ago when he noticed that consumers were significantly curtailing their visits to malls in favor of online shopping. He said Starbucks, which relies heavily on traffic from mall shoppers, needed to find a way to give people a luxurious experience worth leaving their homes.\nErich Joachimsthaler, chief executive of brand-strategy consulting firm Vivaldi, likens what is happening in the coffee business to what has happened in the beer industry, which has been hurt by the rise of craft breweries. \"They never protected themselves on the high end,\" he said of beer companies. \"I think Starbucks sees that the middle is slowing down.\"\nIt isn't just wealthy consumers who might be willing to pay more for coffee marketed as a more gourmet product.\nMillennials are a big force in the better-coffee movement, as they seek out quality products with a story behind them. Between 2008 and 2016, the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds who said they had bought a gourmet coffee beverage the day before rose to 36% from 13%, while the share of 25- to 39-year-olds who did so rose to 41% from 19%, according to the National Coffee Association.\nConsumers also have shown a willingness to pay lot more for such products. The average retail price that certain specialty roasters charge for lots of coffee that included growers' names was an average of $9.95 higher per pound than those that didn't, according to research group Transparent Trade Coffee.\nAndrew Hetzel, a consultant on coffee policy and international trade, said there is growing demand world-wide for higher-quality coffee. Citing data from various coffee trade groups, he said global consumption of specialty coffee is growing at 7% to 8% annually, compared with 1% to 2% for all coffee.\nStarbucks created the high-end coffee category but the landscape has changed drastically in recent years. Starbucks now finds itself in the middle of the market, with independent coffee shops and larger companies such as Blue Bottle Coffee Co. serving an ever more discerning customer while McDonald's Corp., Dunkin' Brands Group Inc.'s Dunkin' Donuts chain and convenience stores are offering coffee and espresso drinks on the cheap.\n\"In coffee you have to pick a path,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Jason West.\nStill, the only proof of the new Starbucks concept is the Seattle Roastery, a store it opened two years ago. Sales there are up 24% from a year ago and the average check is four times that of a traditional Starbucks.\nBrooke de Boutray, managing director and portfolio manager at Seattle investment firm Zevenbergen Capital, said the questions being asked now -- whether the Roastery model can be replicated and whether people will really shell out $6 to $12 for coffee -- are the same ones people asked when Starbucks went public in 1992 and its coffees ranged in price from 65 cents for drip coffee to $2.85 for espresso beverages. \"We talked to our clients in pension funds and they said 'Who in their right mind would spend $2 on a cup of coffee?' \" she said.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 14:56 ET (19:56 ",

      "text": "ePaper Foreign workers get to enjoy unsold Starbucks snacks Ms Dipa Swaminathan distributing some of the food items from Starbucks outlets to foreign workers (from left) Satish Kumar, 30; Sundara Murthy, 26; Vijay Kumar, 30; and Ganeshan Siva Kumar, 29. ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE Published http://str.sg/4QvB Copy In our annual Causes Week, back for its fifth year, we spotlight individuals and groups that are making a difference in the community, and look at how others might pitch in too. Kok Xing Hui \nLawyer teams up with 10 of the coffee chain's outlets in food redistribution programme \nForeign worker Murugan Ganeshan was pruning plants outside Capitol Tower in the punishing 4pm heat two Saturdays ago when a woman approached him. \nThe Indian national was initially puzzled. \nThen as lawyer Dipa Swaminathan, 44, explained that she was giving him free food from coffee chain Starbucks, he broke into a smile. \nMr Murugan, 46, who has been in Singapore for seven years, said he was delighted by her thoughtful gesture. \nWhile most Singaporeans have Saturdays free, most foreign workers continue toiling, constructing buildings and fixing roads. \nTo bring them a little joy, Ms Swaminathan has teamed up with 10 Starbucks outlets to give away unsold food items to migrant workers in the stores' vicinity. \n\"As you know, they would never be able to go into Starbucks and get a drink or muffin. What better thing to do than to take perfectly good food destined for the bin and to give them a snack,\" said the Singapore permanent resident. \nThis food redistribution project started by chance in May, when Ms Swaminathan visited Starbucks' Singapore Polytechnic outlet to buy coffee for parents of players on her son's tennis team. \n\"I saw they had a whole container full of pastries and I knew that they close at 4pm on Saturdays. So I asked if they were throwing away all the food and if they could give it to me instead and I'll go pass it to migrant workers,\" she said. \nShe paid for her coffee, drove out, and passed the pastries to workers mending the road. A Facebook post she put up then went viral. \n\"Some people thought it was a donation initiated by Starbucks and they were saying they will start patronising Starbucks because it is doing such a good thing,\" said Ms Swaminathan, assistant general counsel at Singtel. \n\"Using that, I wrote to Starbucks - including their worldwide CEO - and said, 'You've got so much good publicity out of this, why not consider doing it in Singapore?' \" \nSo from June, the Singapore Polytechnic outlet started passing the unsold food to the lawyer. And by October, the project had expanded to 10 Starbucks outlets in schools or in the business district - which are also stores that close earlier on Saturdays. \nThrough Facebook, Ms Swaminathan has mobilised a group of 10 to 15 volunteers to help her collect food from the various outlets each week, and later distribute it to workers nearby. \nShe estimated that each outlet passed the volunteers 20 to 30 items every week. \nEach week, the food goes out at random to workers nearby. \n\"Literally within minutes, it's donated because there are migrant workers everywhere in Singapore,\" she said, adding that the random distribution allows volunteers to reach different groups of workers instead of heading to the same work sites each week. \nDistributing the food immediately also means the pastry will not go bad before it reaches the workers. \nIn March, 7,600 Starbucks stores in the United States started donating ready-to-eat meals to food banks. \nThe coffee chain said it is thinking about how to extend this programme to Singapore. \n\"We are also encouraged that we have customers, like Dipa, who are passionate about these causes as well,\" said a Starbucks spokesman. \nMs Swaminathan has been helping migrant workers through several projects. \nEach Deepavali, she collects money from friends to buy and distribute phone cards to foreign workers in Little India so they can call home. \nShe also collects raincoat donations for foreign workers who have to work through bad weather. \nMr Murugan said: \"Usually, people here don't notice us and we don't receive goodies. \n\"But now, I'm happy to know there are (people) who care about us and appreciate our work.\" \n• For more information on Ms Swaminathan's work with migrant workers, visit itsrainingraincoats on Facebook. \nVIDEO Dipa Swaminathan delivers food to migrant workers. http://str.sg/4Qyh   'Foreign workers get to enjoy unsold Starbucks snacks'.

      "text": " Packaged Facts\nCoffee giants made major gains away from stores and will thrive despite CEO stepping down, finds Packaged Facts\nROCKVILLE, Md. , Dec. 5, The holiday season didn't just ring in the news about the return of Starbucks' famed (and controversial) red cups. In other big news, longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz announced that he was stepping down as CEO of the company, effective April 2017 . Schultz plans on staying on board as Executive Chairman, turning the CEO reins over to Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson .\nSchultz's remarks about his departure mostly focused on his view that the \"U.S. was over-retailed\" and that to survive and succeed, retailers would need to change their physical presences into \"premiumized, experiential consumer venues.\" To this end, Schultz said that he would focus his attention on Starbucks reimagining of retail – the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve brands. Schultz said that the company's Seattle Roastery has become a laboratory for \"breakthrough innovation and experiential design\" that will lead to the next generation of Starbucks stores.\nLost in this news are the incredible inroads that Starbucks has made in sales away from its stores, notes market research publisher Packaged Facts, which will release brand new reports on the coffee and tea industries within the next week, including the joint title Coffee and Tea: U.S. Retail Market Trends . View Packaged Facts' collection of coffee and tea themed market research reports at: http://www.packagedfacts.com/coffee-tea-market-c471/ .\nThe company said that its consumer packaged goods (CPG) growth has been very strong. This has been achieved in the following ways:\nStarbucks has been the number one K-Cup brand for the 5 th consecutive quarter. Starbucks roast and ground coffee has been the top premium coffee brand, outpacing growth in the overall segment. Overall, it ranks as the number two coffee brand. The Starbucks ready-to-drink offerings such as Double Shot, Frappuccino and Chilled Multi-Serve, through its partnership with PepsiCo, are the leaders in ready-to-drink coffee. 80% of U.S. coffee occasions happen outside of coffee shops Starbucks has more than 500 Signature Aisles across grocery stores across the country The company also has new CPG offerings in China , Latin America and Europe . The company is also about to take on the ready-to-drink packaged tea segment, with the launch in the first half of 2017 of its premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas in the U.S. through its partnership with Anheuser-Busch.\nStarbucks is certainly \"firing on all cylinders\" in its CPG business, as Schultz said in an investor call earlier in 2016. It remains to be seen whether the company will continue to motor on without Schultz at the helm. Packaged Facts is betting the company's growth won't stall.\nAbout Packaged Facts\nPackaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com, publishes market intelligence on a wide range of consumer market topics, including consumer demographics and shopper insights, consumer financial products and services, consumer goods and retailing, consumer packaged goods, and pet products and services.

      "title": "Starbucks' Schultz and What it Means for Consumer Packaged Goods Business",
      "text": "  15:12 PM EST Starbucks' Schultz and What it Means for Consumer Packaged Goods Business \nROCKVILLE, Md. , Dec. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The holiday season didn't just ring in the news about the return of Starbucks' famed (and controversial) red cups. In other big news, longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz announced that he was stepping down as CEO of the company, effective April 2017 . Schultz plans on staying on board as Executive Chairman, turning the CEO reins over to Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson . \nSchultz's remarks about his departure mostly focused on his view that the \"U.S. was over-retailed\" and that to survive and succeed, retailers would need to change their physical presences into \"premiumized, experiential consumer venues.\" To this end, Schultz said that he would focus his attention on Starbucks reimagining of retail – the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve brands. Schultz said that the company's Seattle Roastery has become a laboratory for \"breakthrough innovation and experiential design\" that will lead to the next generation of Starbucks stores. \nLost in this news are the incredible inroads that Starbucks has made in sales away from its stores, notes market research publisher Packaged Facts, which will release brand new reports on the coffee and tea industries within the next week, including the joint title Coffee and Tea: U.S. Retail Market Trends . View Packaged Facts' collection of coffee and tea themed market research reports at: http://www.packagedfacts.com/coffee-tea-market-c471/ . \nThe company said that its consumer packaged goods (CPG) growth has been very strong. This has been achieved in the following ways: Starbucks has been the number one K-Cup brand for the 5 th consecutive quarter. Starbucks roast and ground coffee has been the top premium coffee brand, outpacing growth in the overall segment. Overall, it ranks as the number two coffee brand. The Starbucks ready-to-drink offerings such as Double Shot, Frappuccino and Chilled Multi-Serve, through its partnership with PepsiCo, are the leaders in ready-to-drink coffee. 80% of U.S. coffee occasions happen outside of coffee shops Starbucks has more than 500 Signature Aisles across grocery stores across the country The company also has new CPG offerings in China , Latin America and Europe . \nThe company is also about to take on the ready-to-drink packaged tea segment, with the launch in the first half of 2017 of its premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas in the U.S. through its partnership with Anheuser-Busch. \nStarbucks is certainly \"firing on all cylinders\" in its CPG business, as Schultz said in an investor call earlier in 2016. It remains to be seen whether the company will continue to motor on without Schultz at the helm. Packaged Facts is betting the company's growth won't stall. \nAbout Packaged Facts \nPackaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com, publishes market intelligence on a wide range of consumer market topics, including consumer demographics and shopper insights, consumer financial products and services, consumer goods and retailing, consumer packaged goods, and pet products and services.

To draw customers away from its competitors, McDonald’s will highlight its price advantages over Starbucks with offers including $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages over the first quarter of next year.\nMcDonald’s has already begun competing with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts--this fall, the company sold pumpkin-spice lattes throughout the U.S. for the first time in three years. In Canada, McDonald’s sells Americanos and shots of espresso, and even has a standalone McCafe in Toronto.",

      "title": "Starbucks Vietnam to Support Training for Disadvantaged Youth",
      "text": "Downloads Starbucks extends commitment to creating opportunities and employment in communities around the world \nHANOI; Dec 5, 2016 — Starbucks Vietnam and The Asia Foundation, a nonprofit international development organization, today announced a one-year vocational training program in Hanoi to prepare young people from disadvantaged backgrounds for careers in Vietnam’s fast-growing food and beverage industry. The Starbucks Vocational Training program will engage 50 youth between the ages of 18 and 24, including those who have been affected by family violence, human trafficking, and poverty, in a training program where they will acquire the professional and life skills required to succeed in the retail sector. \nAs part of the program, youth will receive both classroom instruction focused on subjects such as customer service, English language learning, financial literacy, and work readiness, as well as on-the-job training. Starbucks partners (employees) will actively engage in the program, providing seminars and in store experience. Upon completion of the program, youth will receive six months of follow-up assistance to help them secure full-time employment. \n“Being an active part of the communities we serve in is intrinsic to who we are as a company,” said Mark Ring , president of Starbucks Asia Pacific. “As Starbucks continues to grow in Vietnam and across Asia, so too does our aspiration to build a different kind of company – one committed to performance that is driven through the lens of humanity – and being a positive force in building the future success of young people.” “We are proud to partner with The Asia Foundation and REACH to provide lifelong experiences and skills for disadvantaged young people,” said Patricia Marques, general manager for Starbucks Vietnam. \n“Youth in Vietnam represent a huge pool of talent for this dynamic country, but at the same time there are also challenges for many young people to gain access to work. We have created this project to build confidence, self-esteem and training, which will help them to succeed in the economy.” \nFigures from the General Statistics Office in 2015 indicate that the unemployment rate among youth is more than triple the overall unemployment rate, standing at 6.75%. While well-educated workers are able to access expanding opportunities in the private sector, for less educated workers, and particularly those from rural areas, it is much more challenging due to their lack of education, skills and business connections. This leaves them with fewer options and makes them more vulnerable to exploitation. “The gap between supply and demand in Vietnam’s fast-growing industries is an opportunity to provide disadvantaged youth with market-driven, practical vocational training. And by providing employers with skilled young people, we are proud to partner with Starbucks Vietnam to contribute to the development of a workforce that can help to meet the demands of Vietnam’s rapidly changing economy, while empowering some of the country’s most disadvantaged communities,” said Dinh Thi Kieu Nhung, The Asia Foundation’s project manager. \nStarbucks Vietnam and The Asia Foundation will implement this program in partnership with REACH, a local non-governmental organization specializing in providing vocational training, career advice, and job placement to some of Vietnam’s most disadvantaged youth. Funding for the project is supported by The Starbucks Foundation. About The Starbucks Foundation \nEstablished in 1997, The Starbucks Foundation believes in creating pathways to lifelong opportunities for underserved young people and developing social consciousness through community service to create a purpose driven workforce. The Foundation is proud to partner with organizations that are providing the training and experiences needed to help young people become job ready. The Starbucks Foundation gave $6.9 million to 128 nonprofit organizations in 2015. The Starbucks Foundation also supports employee engagement in their local community. Coming together in service represents a fundamental act of citizenship for individuals, businesses and community members to create a stronger, more cohesive society. About The Asia Foundation \nThe Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia. Headquartered in San Francisco, The Asia Foundation works through a network of offices in 18 Asian countries and in Washington, DC. Informed by six decades of experience and deep local expertise, the Foundation’s work across Asia addresses five overarching goals—strengthening governance, empowering women, expanding economic opportunity, increasing environmental resilience, and promoting regional cooperation. The Foundation receives funding from a diverse group of bilateral and multilateral development agencies, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In 2015, it provided more than $95 million in direct program support and distributed textbooks and other educational materials valued at over $10 million. About REACH \nEstablished in 2008, REACH is a local nonprofit organization that specializes in providing vocational training, career advice and job placement for Vietnam’s most disadvantaged youth. REACH provides practical training in areas including hospitality, tourism, hairdressing, nail art, sales, marketing, and web and graphic design across its centers in Hanoi, Da Nang, Hue, Hoi An, and Hai Duong. To date, REACH has trained over 6,000 youth with a very committed staff. Over 80 percent of its students have been placed in a stable employment post-graduation in the services sector such as bartending, sales, and web design. \nFor more information on this news release, contact Related News",

      "text": "A new star has risen to prominence on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX )'s horizon and those who have seen it (rather him) emerge from under the shadows of the company's celebrated founder Howard Schultz may be thirsting to know more about the new star.\nKevin Johnson, currently chief operating officer at the company, is set to take over the reins of the company on April 3, 2017. Analysts anticipate the transition to be smooth, as Johnson has been a board member for the past seven years and has been running the global business of the company alongside Schultz.\nBenzinga has profiled Johnson, the CEO-designate, for our readers:\nAppointed as president and COO of Starbucks in March 2015 after being a board member since 2009. In that capacity, he headed the company's global operating businesses, across the Americas, EMEA and China/Asia Pacific, as well as the company's supply chain, IT and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson took over from the then COO Troy Alstead, who wished to take a sabbatical to spend more time with family. Johnson was appointed CEO of Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR ) in September 2008. The announcement of his retirement in July 2013 took everyone by surprise, as the company had thrived during his five-year tenure, capitalizing on huge spending by telecom companies. He officially relinquished the CEO position at Juniper in January 2014. Prior to that, Johnson was employed at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for 18 years in varied capacities. When he left the software giant, Johnson was leading the platforms and services division, where he was responsible for Windows and online services businesses. Before that, he served as group vice president of Microsoft's worldwide sales, marketing and services and also oversaw corporate operations and IT functions that supported the work of Microsoft employees worldwide. A noteworthy development when Johnson was at Microsoft was its failed attempt to buy Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ) way back in 2008. In a memo explaining the botched deal, Johnson, who was helming Windows Live, said the failure to reach an accord regarding the price by the end of the April deadline had led to the withdrawal of the offer. Johnson has also served in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) systems integration and consulting business. Johnson And Starbucks\nJohnson, being a 30-year veteran in the technology industry, proved to be an asset for the coffee chain retailer in its pursuit of digital initiatives such as smartphone ordering and mobile coffee delivery. In a senior leadership announced in July this year with focus on its long-term strategy and innovation efforts, Johnson was assigned leadership of the Starbucks senior leadership team. This rejig followed the revenue miss in its second quarter.\nAt last check, Starbucks was up 1 percent to $57.78 after it dropped 2.22 percent on Friday on the announcement of the leadership transition.\n ",

I woke up today, and I really appreciated things a lot more,\" said Chase Richardson. \nHe's still recovering after the scare at the Gulf Coast Town Center store, where he went just after 10:30 Sunday night when he realized it was closed. \nAs he walked back to his car, he said a man in an SUV called him over. \n\"He said to me, give me your money. And I said what? And he flashed a gun at me,\" Richardson said. \"It's total body fear, like you freeze up immediately.\" \nHe said he reached into his pocket and gave the man $60, all the cash he had on him. \n\"Oh man, if I don't give him this money, or if I do he still might shoot me.\" \nStarbucks was packed with students and those doing their holiday shopping on Monday. They said they can't believe it happened in such a busy area. \n\"That is very scary,\" said Tracy Kujala. \nLee County deputies said there were employees inside the store when the robbery happened. \n\"The area that it was in over here was like pretty dark, so I think that maybe there was not a good line of sight,\" Richardson said. \nHe said he'd like to see more security in the area. He wants to see the gun-toting thief caught and is worried it might end differently for someone else. \n\"I just fear for anyone that, maybe he's having an off night, and he were to go do that, and someone made a move, I just hope that nothing happens to someone. Someone could lose their life.\" \nDeputies said the robber was described as white, thin and 5'10\". He was driving a black Jeep Cherokee. Most Popular Stories",

      "text": "Howard Schultz's Crowning Achievement as Starbucks CEO It’s not pumpkin flavored, and it doesn’t come in a cup December 6, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce | Mobile Share Print \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who announced Thursday he’s stepping down from his post to become the company’s executive chairman and devote his energy to such things as high-end Starbucks retail concepts, has racked up a host of impressive accomplishments. \nBut Starbucks’—and Schultz’s—most notable business achievement doesn’t involve anything in a cup, or the coffee giant’s reputation as “the third place,” or social activism. \nWhat has made Starbucks the envy of perhaps all US brick-and-mortar retailers is the company’s mobile payment system. Built as part of Starbucks’ loyalty program, it’s managed to hook Starbucks customers and allow the coffee giant to know who they are and lure them with incentives as a result. That’s contributed to Starbucks’ same-store sales gains and traffic. eMarketer estimates that Starbucks’ sales per square foot have risen to a record $781 in fiscal 2016, topping fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts. \n“It’s a crowning achievement of Howard Schultz,” said Richard Crone, CEO of Crone Consulting LLC, an independent advisory on mobile payment, in an interview. “He’s engaged his customers before, during, and after the Starbucks experience. Every one of those customers is known and contactable through that mobile app. No other retailer has accomplished what they’ve done in the shortest period of time.” \nMobile payments, introduced nationwide in 2011, now represent 25% of the company’s US transactions, up from 20% a year earlier, Starbucks said in November. In comparison, Apple Pay and Android Pay, both unveiled later than Starbucks’ mobile payment app, is each used by less than 4% of any available devices, Crone said. Major retailers are only just catching up. Walmart, for instance, introduced its Walmart Pay in December 2015. CVS Pharmacy rolled out CVS Pay in August. \neMarketer estimates total US proximity mobile payment transactions will almost triple to $27.67 billion this year. That’s less than 1% of the $4.84 trillion in US retail sales eMarketer projected. \nLast year, Starbucks rolled out Mobile Order & Pay nationwide. Customers ordering ahead on their mobile devices has risen to 6% of all Starbucks U.S. transactions. About 3,300 of its stores now handle 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In some 600 stores, that percentage is over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year, the company said. \n“The order ahead is a game changer,” Crone said, estimating that it could help increase same-store sales by as much as 40%.

      "text": "Posted on December 5, 2016 by Brian ( @NE_Brian ) in Mobile , Rumors | 0 Likes \nSeveral Starbucks employees have come forward with an apparent internal message pertaining to Pokemon GO. It points to something potentially huge happening with the mobile game later this week. \nAssuming the message is legitimate – which seems very likely at this point – Pokemon GO is receiving some sort of update on Thursday. It states that Niantic’s title “is about to expand with new Pokemon”– plus a new Starbucks beverage to celebrate. \nMost Starbucks locations throughout the United States will become either a PokeStop or a Gym. Additionally, after locating their relevant store within the game, visitors can unlock the Pokemon GO Frappuccino Blended Beverage. That being said, an additional note mentions that Starbucks customers will not need to play in order to unlock the new drink. \nHave a look at the full message below. \nWe’ve been hearing rumblings about a possible big update for Pokemon GO this month. There have been no official announcements, but the as-of-yet confirmed Starbucks email points to something notable. Thursday is only a few days away, so Niantic and The Pokemon Company may have something to say very soon.",

To draw customers away from its competitors, McDonald’s will highlight its price advantages over Starbucks with offers including $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages over the first quarter of next year.\nMcDonald’s has already begun competing with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts—this fall, the company sold pumpkin-spice lattes throughout the U.S. for the first time in three years.

      "text": "McDonald's coffee strategy targets Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts Monday Dec 5, 2016 at 11:59 AM Dec 5, 2016 at 11:59 AM By Leslie Patton, Washington Post News Service \nMcDonald's Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation's coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand -- part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin' Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. McDonald's is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. About Us",

When Starbucks first opened in 1971, all lattes and milk-based drinks were made with whole milk because former CEO Howard Schultz wanted use the milk that Italians drink with their coffee . \"Originally, Schultz only allowed whole milk in stores,\" because he strove to serve only \"Italian-style espresso drinks,\" NPR reported.\nWhile whole milk was the standard for more than 30 years, customers began to voice their opinions and demand a change, so Starbucks \"eliminated all artificial trans fat and made 2 percent milk the new standard for espresso beverages\" in 2007. What's interesting is that year was the first time that Starbucks actually started carrying 2 percent. If you asked for it before then, what you really got was a blend of whole milk and skim milk made by the barista. According to the Seattle Times , \"each reduced-fat latte at Starbucks was its own unique blend. Baristas poured a little from the whole-milk jug and a little from the skim-milk bottle until one-of-a-kind fat reduction was achieved.\"\nNow, it seems crazy to think there used to be limited options for the type of milk you wanted to order in your latte. Today, Starbucks's milks include whole, nonfat, 2 percent, soy, coconut, and, most recently, almond milk - Starbucks even uses separate milk steamers for dairy and nondairy beverages.

      "text": "LONDON — Cakes sold at leading coffee shops could contain \"staggering high levels\" of sugar with some containing as much as 18 teaspoons per slice — according to new research.\nThe research was conducted by the campaign group Action on Sugar (AoS) at Queen Mary University of London. It surveyed 67 cakes from 157 UK coffee shops and supermarkets.\nSEE ALSO: Your morning coffee could contain up to 25 teaspoons of sugar\nData on the product's nutritional information — found on labels and brand websites — were used by researchers to compare sugar content on servings of \"fruity cakes\".\nThe worst offenders According to AoS, among the worst offenders was Starbucks' Christmas Carrot Cake with 15 teaspoons of sugar (616kcal) per 146g serving — which equates to \"more sugar than five Krispy Kremes\".\nPret a Manger's Lemon Drizzle slice which contains a 18 teaspoons of sugar per 172g slice, which equates to \"more sugar than six Krispy Kremes\" and contains nearly 700 calories.\nPret a Manger's Double Berry muffins — which weigh 145g — contain 10 teaspoons of sugar (512kcal) per serving.\nA Krispy Kreme original glazed doughnut contains 12.6g sugar and 200 calories.\nThe news comes as the government publishes legislation imposing a tax on soft drinks.\nImage: Westend61 Images / AP Images\n'Extraordinary' findings The findings come as the government publishes \"sugar tax\" legislation which will see a levy imposed on drinks containing more than 8g of sugar per 100ml. The tax will be imposed on soft drinks manufacturers, rather than on consumers.\nGraham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Queen Mary University of London, told Mashable that the findings were \"extraordinary\".\n\"It's partly caused by the serving sized used in coffee shops. But, these cakes contain a lot of calories and a hell of a lot of sugar,\" MacGregor said.\nWhen asked about the accuracy of the findings, MacGregor said the data used comes from manufacturers' labels or websites, which are \"very tightly controlled\", but the ingredients cited \"may vary by very small amounts\".\nAction needed The campaign group is urging food manufacturers and cafes to reduce the amounts of sugar in products\n\"This country has one of the worst rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Europe. It's time the government took action,\" MacGregor said.\nMacGregor says that retailers and cafes must immediately start reducing the amounts of sugar and calories in these products.\n1000 calories in one sitting \"Considering most people are likely to buy a hot beverage to eat with their cake, it’s far too easy to visit a coffee shop and consume the best part of 1000 calories in one sitting,\" Kawther Hashem, AoS researcher, said in a statement emailed to Mashable .\n\"Everyone should be able to enjoy cake, but there is no need for just one slice to exceed an adult’s maximum daily recommendation of sugar by almost three times,\" Hashem continued.\nA spokesperson for Pret a Manger told Mashable that the Lemon Drizzle cake in question has been on trial in several regional shops.\nAfter the trial — which ends next week — the cake slices will no longer be available. \"We will revert back to only selling smaller, individual cake portions, instead of these larger slices,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The calorie information for our cakes continues to be displayed in shops, and the full nutritional information is available on our website,\" the spokesperson continued.\nStarbucks did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment.\nBONUS: Coffee with 80 times more caffeine than normal packs a serious punch",

      "text": "Pokémon Go leaks point to big Starbucks event in the works Could we see new Pokémon this week? share Michael McWhertor/Polygon Pokémon Go ’s first big sponsored promotion could launch later this week at Starbucks, based on images shared across Reddit . Several users have uploaded screenshots of special Starbucks iconography appearing in the Pokémon mobile game, which point to a Dec. 8 launch date. Based on the leaked images , which come from a webpage purportedly accessible by Starbucks employees, a large number of stores will become PokéStops or gyms as part of the event. Players who swing by their nearest participating Starbucks will receive a unique item: the Pokémon Go Frappuccino Blended Beverage. That’s not just an in-game item, according to the corporate info. Starbucks will also reportedly sell an actual version of the drink during the event’s duration. (There are no details on what goes into a Pokémon Go -flavored Frap.) The Pokémon Go Starbucks collaboration details, printed. Imgur via Reddit Beyond the special drink offer, however, the employee details suggest that there’s a bigger update involved. “The world of Pokémon Go is about to expand with new Pokémon,” the printout reads. Users datamined the game earlier this fall and found code for 100 new species of Pokémon already baked in — the entire second generation of monsters. It’s possible that the Starbucks event will anticipate this major release, based on this wording, although the notice doesn’t get anymore specific than that. Niantic, developer of the free-to-play smash hit, announced over the summer that it had plans to collaborate with corporate sponsors , much as it did with Ingress . In the developer’s earlier, location-based mobile game, these promotions involved turning real world retailers into places of note for players. The company hasn’t confirmed that Starbucks is Pokémon Go ’s first sponsor in the West, but we’ve reached out for comment. In Japan , McDonald’s worked with Niantic to transform some of its locations into PokéStops. More From Polygon",

      "text": "Tom Murray / Published December 6, 2016 in Climate / Politics Partnerships both Mike Mozart \nCorporate leadership is driven by long-term economics, not by short-term politics. \nThis is why more than 365 businesses and investors recently called on President-elect Donald Trump and other United States leaders to “strongly support” the continuation of low-carbon policies and U.S. participation in the Paris climate agreement. \nThese business leaders – from big brands such as Dupont, General Mills, HP Enterprises, REI, Salesforce.com and Unilever – know that the pathway to job creation and economic growth is accelerating efforts to curb climate change. Changing course or our pace, they wrote, “puts American prosperity at risk.” \nSmithfield Foods announcement yesterday that it will slash 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions from its entire supply chain is further evidence that corporate America gets it. \nIn coming weeks and months, sustained private-sector leadership of this kind will be critical for shaping the thinking of the next administration, and for keeping the country on track toward a clean energy economy where innovation and technology advancements are king. Businesses want to stay competitive \nCorporate America will be watching closely as the incoming administration develops a range of policy proposals in coming months on energy, trade, infrastructure, tax reform and more. \nBusinesses of all shapes and sizes understand the importance of regulatory certainty, economic stability, and commitments from our political leaders that the U.S. will remain competitive in an increasingly interconnected world. \nNations today are ramping up investments in clean energy technology and building new partnerships to meet their carbon emission goals. It’s not in America’s interest to fall behind in this race. \nNone of this is lost on corporate America – nor should it be lost on Trump who prides himself of his business acumen and who campaigned on making American industry stronger. The sustainability trend is accelerating \nOur corporate partners routinely stress the importance of regulatory certainty for business planning, investment decisions and job growth. I expect to see leading companies and investors continuing to stand up to support bedrock environmental protections critical not just for business, but also for public health and the overall economy. Several recent corporate announcements suggest their engagement is only accelerating. On Dec. 5, Smithfield Foods became the first major protein company to announce a greenhouse gas reduction goal throughout its entire supply chain, from feed grain to packaged bacon. By 2025, the company expects to cut emissions by 4 million metric tons – equivalent to removing 900,000 cars from the road for a year. Pepsi, which pioneered the concept of “performance with purpose” a decade ago, recently renewed its commitment to the philosophy with a new slate of sustainability goals. On the company’s impressive to-do list is a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent across the company’s value chain, including its agricultural supply chain, by 2030. Our long-time partner, Walmart doubled down on its commitment to sustainability leadership with a new set of 2025 goals in early November. The retailer committed to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 18 percent, cutting 1 billion tons of emissions from its global supply chain. That’s more than Germany’s annual emissions. Microsoft announced its largest wind power purchase agreement to date with a deal to buy 237 megawatts of capacity from projects in Wyoming and Kansas. As a result, Microsoft’s data centers will get about 44 percent of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year, and 50 percent in two years. \nWe believe that such business leadership – through science-based reduction targets, investments in renewables and operational and supply chain improvements that slash emissions – will continue to gain traction. \nAs my friend Andrew Winston pointed out in his recent blog for Harvard Business Review , the economics support it and customers want it. And why sustainable business will move forward no matter what. \nWe all stand to gain when they do.",

      "text": "\nData mining the game’s code has confirmed that over 100 new Pokémon from the Gold / Silver game generation will join Pokémon GO at some point, but when that would happen was still up for debate. It seems that now we know, although this data comes from an unlikely source—at least, at first glance.\nA purportedly leaked internal Starbucks marketing memo lays out not only the introduction of new Pokémon to the game, but Starbucks’ role in a promotion that will see most Starbucks locations in the U.S. becoming either Pokéstops or gyms. (If they’re not already, as my local Starbucks is.) There’s even a Pokémon-themed drink to go along with the promotion, if you were ever wondering what a Pokémon-flavored frappuccino would taste like. (It’ll taste like some combination of vanilla, blackberries, and raspberry, according to the guide.)\nSites across the Internet of varying credibility have been floating a rumor for some time that the generation 2 Pokémon would be coming in an update on December 7, and the Starbucks promotion is timed for December 8. Whether by coincidence or not, those dates seem to line up pretty well, so we could be looking at a whole new batch of Pokémon to catch later in the week, which would be a breath of fresh air to dedicated players who would at least like to see a bit more variety among the most common Pokémon while they hunt for the rare ones.\nThis kind of marketing promotion is nothing new to Pokémon GO, either, as many retail locations quickly caught onto the game’s popularity during its peak over the summer, and Japanese McDonald’s locations already got on board in an official capacity . There’s no need for players to buy anything at Starbucks in order to play (although you might want to anyway while you’re huddling inside for warmth), nor is playing the game necessary to buy one of the promotional beverages. It’s just a way for Niantic to get a little cash from Starbucks while Starbucks enjoys a bit of extra traffic at their stores.\n(via Eurogamer , image via The Pokémon Company)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "\nIt looks like the generation 2 Pokemon – Pokemon from Pokemon Gold/Silver , the hundred or so Pokemon that Johto introduced – will finally be making their way over to Pokemon GO , the extremely successful augmented reality mobile game starring Nintendo’s menagerie of critters, and far sooner than you expect. Like, this week soon.\nAs Eurogamer reports , leaked promotional material seems to indicate that the Johto Pokemon are being added to Pokemon GO as early as this Friday- and the update is coming in conjunction with Starbucks, who will see all of their stores become either gyms or coffee shops come Thursday. On the same day, there will be ‘more Pokemon’ added to the game.\nGen 2 Pokemon had already been found in the game’s code after one of the recent updates, so this doesn’t come as much of a surprise- in fact, it was only a matter of time. It will be interesting to see whether this update can revive the kind of insane hype that Pokemon GO had in its early days- while the game obviously remains successful, it doesn’t have that kind of hysteria surrounding it any more.",

      "text": "Share \nOn the heels of the announcement that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will step down in 2017 to take on the role of executive chairman, Bloomberg reported that his plans are to make the global coffee chain even more upscale. \nThe plan will include pushing worldwide growth of the company’s premium coffee line Reserve and the opening of 1,000 retail locations dedicated to showcasing the new brand. The larger flagship stores, called Roasteries, are expected to be as large as 20,000 square feet. \n“When you’re making an investment and taking a risk like this, there’s no better person to spearhead it than Howard,” Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., told Bloomberg. “He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.” \nStarbucks opened its first Roastery location two years ago in Seattle, with plans to open other locations in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The retail emporiums allow customers to watch coffee being roasted on site and will serve as high-end flagship locations for the company. There are also plans for new cafes that are similar to Roasteries but will not offer the bean-cooking operation, which Schultz said will add variety to the brand’s store concepts globally. \n“[Howard Schultz] has always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,” Jennifer Bartashus, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, explained. “The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.” \nStarbucks announced its new leadership structure last week, which it said will help to usher in a new wave a digital growth. As of April 3, 2017, Schultz will be replaced by Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination,” Schultz said in a statement. “The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry-leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUVs and ROI, both in the U.S. and around the world.” \n“As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,” he added. “This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”",

Management is expected to update on the company's long-term retail premiumization plan which features a broader-rollout of the Roasteries concept and Reserve store format. For the near-term investor, updates on the coffee chain's geographic traffic and comparable sales trends could move shares.
