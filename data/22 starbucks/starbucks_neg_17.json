      "text": "  An employee waited for President-elect Donald J. Trump to speak at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis on Thursday. Credit A J Mast for The New York Times Donald J. Trump has managed to keep about half of the 2,000 jobs at Carrier that Indiana stood to lose, and there is more to come , he said. While touring the factory floor at the heating and cooling company on Thursday, Mr. Trump indicated that he intended to follow through on pledges to impose stiff tariffs on imports from companies that move production overseas and ship their products back to the United States. The approach he took to the Carrier deal, however, was akin to intercepting a driver on his way to his car in a parking garage and trying to persuade him to stay parked longer, Justin Wolfers writes . But there is a reason parking businesses don’t do that. There are many more potential customers outside the garage, and they can attract them by offering a more convenient experience. A parking garage stays full and an economy stays healthy only if they are constantly refreshed, Mr. Wolfers says. It remains to be seen how Mr. Trump might focus resources on the potential entrepreneurs who could open businesses and refresh the economy. \n  Mr. Trump’s embrace of the Wall Street elite has already been noted and, indeed, Goldman Sachs executives do have a tradition of taking leading roles in public service, but another theme in his cabinet is a lack of directly relevant policy experience. There are exceptions, but Mr. Trump seems to be betting that nuts-and-bolts experience running government agencies just doesn’t matter, Neil Irwin writes . It seems that the swamp being drained is the one inhabited by wonkish technocrats who have devoted their careers to the details of policy making.

      "text": "Getty Images Schultz is moving to a new role but not leaving Starbucks, which is good news to analysts Outgoing chief executive Howard Schultz will be missed at Starbucks Corp., analysts said, but his replacement is seen as the right person to lead the coffee giant today.\n“We acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,” wrote Wells Fargo in a note published Thursday.\n“We expect the stock to react negatively to the news,” wrote Wells Fargo. “ We encourage investors to take advantage of any selloff ahead of next week’s investor day, which we expect will offer several positive catalysts to drive Starbucks’ stock back up.”\nStarbucks’ SBUX, -2.46% investor day event will take place Dec. 7. The company’s shares, which fell 4% in after-hours trading Thursday, sliding 2.5% in early trading.\nRead: Last time Schultz stepped down at Starbucks, shares cratered\nStarbucks announced late Thursday that Schultz will step down as CEO with Kevin Johnson, the company’s president and chief operating officer, set to step into the role on in April.\nJohnson has been a member of the board for seven years and has served in his current role since March 2015. Before joining Starbucks, he had a career in technology that spanned decades, including 16 years at Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.02% and five years as CEO of Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR, -0.69%\nHoward Schultz to Step Down as Starbucks CEO (1:32) Howard Schultz, who led Starbucks as it grew from local chain to global brand, said Dec. 1 he will step down as CEO in April. His next effort? Building the company's new venture: very-high-end coffee shops. Photo: Reuters\nSchultz will be named executive chairman, focused on developing the company’s Starbucks Reserve Roastery business and Starbucks Reserve stores, along with the company’s social impact efforts. The Roastery and Reserve stores offer a premium assortment of coffees and are meant to be “customer destination venues,” according to comments from Schultz posted on the Starbucks website about the transition.\nThe Seattle Roastery — there is currently only one—achieved a same-store sales increase of 24% last year and delivers a ticket four times the usual Starbucks cafe, Schultz said. The company plans to open at least 20 Roastery locations world-wide by the end of 2019, and at least 1,000 are planned for the years ahead.\nRead also: Starbucks to open Reserve Roastery in Tokyo in 2018\nWells Fargo analysts have confidence in Johnson, whose succession has been years in the making.\n“Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,” the analysts wrote.\nWells Fargo rates Starbucks shares outperform with a valuation range of $64 to $66.\nSchultz’s proximity to Johnson is also seen as an asset to analysts at The Buckingham Research Group.\nSee also: Why Apple Pay and mobile wallets never really took off despite all the buzz back in 2014\n“Our opinion is that Starbucks has a deep bench, Mr. Schultz will remain available and involved in important decisions and Mr. Johnson is well qualified to step into the CEO role,” analysts wrote in a note published Thursday. “We expect no change in execution or strategic direction as a result of the new leadership structure.”\nBuckingham Research rates Starbucks shares neutral with a $59 price target.\nSee also: It’s red cup season at Starbucks: Check out the 13 new holiday designs\nInstinet analysts believe Johnson’s background in technology is logical for Starbucks today. “With Starbucks’ business becoming increasingly more technology-oriented, Mr. Johnson’s tech background should serve him well,” analysts said in a note published Friday.\nAnd its analysts believe Schultz will stick around even after he’s vacated the CEO spot.\n“[W]e believe Mr. Schultz got certain non-Starbucks endeavors out of his system during his previous time as non-CEO, such as his 2001-2006 ownership of a National Basketball Association team,” Instinet said. The team was the Seattle SuperSonics.\n“We don’t expect Mr. Schultz to buy a major sports team again anytime soon — which we view as positive for shareholders as he transitions into an updated and still very important role within Starbucks,” Instinet said.\nInstinet rates Starbucks shares buy with a $70 price target.\nStarbucks stock is down 4.8% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.24% is up 7.4% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch If Italy rejects Renzi’s reforms, this is how to play stocks, says J.P.

Reserve cup, used for specialist coffee, on the counter at a Starbucks coffee shop in London, U.K. Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand’s “social impact agenda” that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Schultz was encouraged by the Reserve stores where the coffee is roasted and then brewed using a variety of methods by top Starbucks baristas recruited from around the country.\n“A 12-ounce cup of small-batch coffee brewed using a process involving a siphon costs $12,” the Journal reports.\nStarbucks had signaled the executive change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 per cent to US$56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company’s decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\nPostmedia A high-level Starbucks in Ottawa. “Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,” said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\n“We’re in a much better position on every level,” said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the “Great Recession,” when Starbucks’ stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above US$60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz’s status as a national figure.\n“The idea that he’s replaceable, I think that’s erroneous,” said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald’s Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world’s biggest restaurant company.\nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry’s stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.\nTed S. Warren/AP Photo New CEO Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.\nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp.\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the “merchant gene.”\n“Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,” said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n“I’m not leaving the company and I’m here every day,” said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson’s.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company’s loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.\n“He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,” a spokeswoman said.\n© Thomson Reuters 2016 with files from Financial Post Staff\n",

      "text": "By Sruthi Ramakrishnan\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said.\nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nThe company's shares were down 2.6 percent in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company.\nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged.\nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold.\n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note.\nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc , sets him up for the job, analysts said.\nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology.\nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit.\nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones.\nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp .\n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note.\nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added.\nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world.\nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia.\nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.\n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

      "text": "Starbucks'' Schultz Stepping Down as CEO to Focus on Higher-End Shops December 01, 2016, 04:35:00 PM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo Starbucks' Schultz Stepping Down as CEO to Focus on Higher-End Shops \nHoward Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of Starbucks Corp. to lead an effort at the company to build high-end coffee shops that will charge as much as $12 a cup, his next attempt to revolutionize the way Americans consume coffee. \nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the CEO role to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a director of the company for seven years before joining its executive team two years ago. Mr. Schultz, who is credited with taking the company from small beginnings to an international behemoth, began handing over daily oversight of the company to Mr. Johnson a few months ago. \nStarbucks's move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as \"Siren Works\"—after the mythological creature in the coffee chain's logo—is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee. \nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks after he steps down as CEO in April and said he has no plans to step away from the company. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best,\" he said in an interview. \nBut the big bet is based solely on Mr. Schultz's instinct that it is the right thing to do. \"There was no research,\" he said. Convincing his board and senior management team to create another brand wasn't easy. \nMr. Schultz changed the way Americans drink coffee and even socialize, creating what he called a \"third place\" where people could gather outside home and work. \nStarbucks showed Americans that coffee could be more ambitious than home-brewed Folgers. Mr. Schultz joined the original company as its marketing director in 1982 and, after a dispute with its then-owners, left in 1986 to open his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale. He later bought the Starbucks coffee business from the original owners, renamed his own shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe. \nMr. Schultz said the move to opening high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic change since it began opening shops overseas 20 years ago. Mr. Schultz said the approach would provide an experience that would entice consumers, who are increasingly shopping online, to leave their homes. \nAnalysts see plenty of risks for the new venture. If the economy falters, they say, investors won't be too keen on Starbucks spending what some estimate will be roughly $100 million a year building fancy new stores that may draw few customers. \nMr. Schultz was encouraged in part by the outsize sales performance of the company's first such shop, the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. There, coffee is roasted and then brewed using a variety of methods by top Starbucks baristas recruited from around the country. A 12-ounce cup of small-batch coffee brewed using a process involving a siphon costs $12. \nThe Roastery is the 15,000-square-foot embodiment of an idea Mr. Schultz dreamed up seven years ago. In his journal, he scribbled the words \"the Willy Wonka of coffee,\" thinking that someday he would build a grand temple to coffee. At that time, Starbucks was still the predominant place to buy a good cup of coffee. But the better-coffee market has since become crowded. \nNearly two years after the Roastery opened in an abandoned Volvo dealership in Seattle Starbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more like it, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. \nThe company plans to build as many as 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the Starbucks Reserve brand, with a logo that consists of a gold star and the letter \"R.\" The first two stores are slated to open in Chicago and Seattle in the summer. \nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its more than 25,000 Starbucks stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and variety of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores. \nMr. Schultz said he built his case for the new operation by studying other companies that have successfully extended their brands, such as Porsche's creation of a luxury sport utility vehicle, which was initially met with skepticism, and Nike's creation of the Air Jordan brand. \nCliff Burrows, who left his role running the Americas division, Starbucks's largest business, to join Mr. Schultz on the new project, said: \"I've worked with Howard a long time, and there are times he has a vision and clarity that those of us around him don't see but we accept it,\" he said. \nMoving too far upscale could be a distraction to the operation of Starbucks's traditional coffee shops. Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said: \"The menu is getting complex at Starbucks. If you're going to throw on top of that another level of premiumization and innovation and add an espresso bar, this could make things more challenging.\" \nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-01-161635ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "David Ryder | Reuters Howard Schultz \nShares of Starbucks took a tumble Friday, a day after CEO Howard Schultz announced that he would step down and President and COO Kevin Johnson would take the lead. \nBut most top Wall Street analysts, though surprised by the timing of the news, told clients impact on the coffeehouse chain's growth will likely be negligible. \nHere is what analysts are saying after the announcement: \nGoldman Sachs \nGoldman Sachs said Starbucks' conference call on Thursday reassured investors that leadership would not pivot from its in-store innovation, and that there was strong internal preparation for the change. \n\"Mr. Johnson has a technology background, and, per the press release, Mr. Schultz plans to focus on the premium reserve brand. That said, the call clearly indicated that the product innovation/consumer technology pipelines pipelines (e.g. comp drivers) have never been 'so robust,'\" Goldman said. \nGoldman added leaderships' discussion of enhancement in the company's global operations was also a positive. \nBMO \nBMO said it is optimistic about the leadership change and believes that Starbucks will not alter its long-term outlook or performance. But the company said the timing is likely to raise a few eyebrows from investors. \n\"The negative initial perception (and stock reaction) to the leadership transition is understandable and the timing likely will raise questions,\" the firm said. \"The transition of Howard Schultz...is likely to create a sense of trepidation among investors, particularly given the eventual deterioration in the company's performance after he last stepped down from the position.\" \nOppenheimer \nThe firm maintained its \"outperform\" rating on the company, saying Starbucks still remains well-positioned. \n\"While disappointing to see a visionary and founder step back from day-to-day operations, we believe the company is left in the capable hands of Mr. Johnson. And, we do not believe Mr. Schultz would step away from daily operations without feeling the same way,\" Oppenheimer said. \nGuggenheim \nGuggenheim said its greatest concern is that \"Starbucks is losing an irreplaceable merchant,\" but noted Johnson's strong leadership. \n\"[Johnson's] career prior to Starbucks includes 33 years in the technology industry which included 16 years at Microsoft and a five-years as CEO of Juniper Networks . Juniper shares appreciated 24 percent from Nov. 2008 to Jan. 2014 under Kevin Johnson as CEO, the S&P 500 increased 91 percent during that time frame,\" Guggenheim said. \nStifel \nStifel said it was not surprised by Schultz's decision to take a step back. It said any potential negative impact will most likely be felt a year or so from now. \n\"We view the timing as notable given the heightened level of strategic endeavors the company currently has ongoing. Additionally, while respectful of Mr. Johnson's prior managerial experience, Mr. Schultz is a visionary executive in retail and coffee with a unique understanding of consumer wants and is difficult to replace, particularly by a manager from a technology background, in our view,\" Stifel said.",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall Updated: December 1, 2016 — 6:53 PM EST Share Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan Reuters Mail icon \n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. \nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. \nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp . \nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\" \n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. \n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. \nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. \nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said. \n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis) More Coverage ",

      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nHoward Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of Starbucks Corp. to lead an effort at the company to build high-end coffee shops that will charge as much as $12 a cup, his next attempt to revolutionize the way Americans consume coffee.\nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the CEO role to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a director of the company for seven years before joining its executive team two years ago. Mr. Schultz, who is credited with taking the company from small beginnings to an international behemoth, began handing over daily oversight of the company to Mr. Johnson a few months ago.\nStarbucks's move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as \"Siren Works\" -- after the mythological creature in the coffee chain's logo -- is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\nWhile Starbucks continues to outperform the broader food retail industry, its sales growth has slowed in recent quarters.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks after he steps down as CEO in April and said he has no plans to step away from the company. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best,\" he said in an interview.\nBut the big bet is based solely on Mr. Schultz's instinct that it is the right thing to do. \"There was no research,\" he said. Convincing his board and senior management team to create another brand wasn't easy.\nMr. Schultz changed the way Americans drink coffee and even socialize, creating what he called a \"third place\" where people could gather outside home and work.\nStarbucks showed Americans that coffee could be more ambitious than home-brewed Folgers. Mr. Schultz joined the original company as its marketing director in 1982 and, after a dispute with its then-owners, left in 1986 to open his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale. He later bought the Starbucks coffee business from the original owners, renamed his own shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nMr. Schultz said the move to opening high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic change since it began opening shops overseas 20 years ago. Mr. Schultz said the approach would provide an experience that would entice consumers, who are increasingly shopping online, to leave their homes.\nAnalysts see plenty of risks for the new venture. If the economy falters, they say, investors won't be too keen on Starbucks spending what some estimate will be roughly $100 million a year building fancy new stores that may draw few customers.\nMr. Schultz was encouraged in part by the outsize sales performance of the company's first such shop, the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. There, coffee is roasted and then brewed using a variety of methods by top Starbucks baristas recruited from around the country. A 12-ounce cup of small-batch coffee brewed using a process involving a siphon costs $12.\nThe Roastery is the 15,000-square-foot embodiment of an idea Mr. Schultz dreamed up seven years ago. In his journal, he scribbled the words \"the Willy Wonka of coffee,\" thinking that someday he would build a grand temple to coffee. At that time, Starbucks was still the predominant place to buy a good cup of coffee. But the better-coffee market has since become crowded.\nNearly two years after the Roastery opened in an abandoned Volvo dealership in Seattle Starbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more like it, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year.\nThe company plans to build as many as 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the Starbucks Reserve brand, with a logo that consists of a gold star and the letter \"R.\" The first two stores are slated to open in Chicago and Seattle in the summer.\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its more than 25,000 Starbucks stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and variety of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores.\nMr. Schultz said he built his case for the new operation by studying other companies that have successfully extended their brands, such as Porsche's creation of a luxury sport utility vehicle, which was initially met with skepticism, and Nike's creation of the Air Jordan brand.\nCliff Burrows, who left his role running the Americas division, Starbucks's largest business, to join Mr. Schultz on the new project, said: \"I've worked with Howard a long time, and there are times he has a vision and clarity that those of us around him don't see but we accept it,\" he said.\nMoving too far upscale could be a distraction to the operation of Starbucks's traditional coffee shops. Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said: \"The menu is getting complex at Starbucks. If you're going to throw on top of that another level of premiumization and innovation and add an espresso bar, this could make things more challenging.\"\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 02, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

      "text": "tweet AP \nFILE - In this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) AP By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAK Associated Press   10:35AM NEW YORK -- Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nJohnson knows the company, and Schultz will be nearby if he's needed\nOutgoing chief executive Howard Schultz will be missed at Starbucks Corp., analysts said, but his replacement is seen as the right person to lead the coffee giant today.\n\"We acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" wrote Wells Fargo in a note published Thursday.\n\"We expect the stock to react negatively to the news,\" wrote Wells Fargo. \" We encourage investors to take advantage of any selloff ahead of next week's investor day, which we expect will offer several positive catalysts to drive Starbucks' stock back up.\"\nStarbucks' (SBUX) investor day event will take place Dec. 7. The company's shares, which fell 4% in after-hours trading Thursday, sliding 2.5% in early trading.\nRead:Last time Schultz stepped down at Starbucks, shares cratered (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/last-time-howard-schultz-stepped-down-at-starbucks-shares-cratered-2016-12-01)\nStarbucks announced late Thursday that Schultz will step down as CEO with Kevin Johnson, the company's president and chief operating officer, set to step into the role on in April.\nJohnson has been a member of the board for seven years and has served in his current role since March 2015. Before joining Starbucks, he had a career in technology that spanned decades, including 16 years at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and five years as CEO of Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)\nSchultz will be named executive chairman, focused on developing the company's Starbucks Reserve Roastery business and Starbucks Reserve stores, along with the company's social impact efforts. The Roastery and Reserve stores offer a premium assortment of coffees and are meant to be \"customer destination venues,\" according to comments from Schultz posted on the Starbucks website about the transition.\nThe Seattle Roastery -- there is currently only one--achieved a same-store sales increase of 24% last year and delivers a ticket four times the usual Starbucks cafe, Schultz said. The company plans to open at least 20 Roastery locations world-wide by the end of 2019, and at least 1,000 are planned for the years ahead.\nRead also:Starbucks to open Reserve Roastery in Tokyo in 2018 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/starbucks-to-open-reserve-roastery-in-tokyo-in-2018-2016-10-20)\nWells Fargo analysts have confidence in Johnson, whose succession has been years in the making.\n\"Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,\" the analysts wrote.\nWells Fargo rates Starbucks shares outperform with a valuation range of $64 to $66.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/8Ovqdi2imSF)\nSchultz's proximity to Johnson is also seen as an asset to analysts at The Buckingham Research Group.\nSee also:Why Apple Pay and mobile wallets never really took off despite all the buzz back in 2014 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-mobile-wallets-never-really-took-off-despite-all-the-buzz-back-in-2014-2016-11-14)\n\"Our opinion is that Starbucks has a deep bench, Mr. Schultz will remain available and involved in important decisions and Mr. Johnson is well qualified to step into the CEO role,\" analysts wrote in a note published Thursday. \"We expect no change in execution or strategic direction as a result of the new leadership structure.\"\nBuckingham Research rates Starbucks shares neutral with a $59 price target.\nSee also:It's red cup season at Starbucks: Check out the 13 new holiday designs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-red-cup-season-at-starbucks-check-out-the-13-new-holiday-designs-2016-11-09)\nInstinet analysts believe Johnson's background in technology is logical for Starbucks today. \"With Starbucks' business becoming increasingly more technology-oriented, Mr. Johnson's tech background should serve him well,\" analysts said in a note published Friday.\nAnd its analysts believe Schultz will stick around even after he's vacated the CEO spot.\n\"[W]e believe Mr. Schultz got certain non-Starbucks endeavors out of his system during his previous time as non-CEO, such as his 2001-2006 ownership of a National Basketball Association team,\" Instinet said. The team was the Seattle SuperSonics (http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?id=2525634&columnist=hughes_frank).\n\"We don't expect Mr. Schultz to buy a major sports team again anytime soon -- which we view as positive for shareholders as he transitions into an updated and still very important role within Starbucks,\" Instinet said.\nInstinet rates Starbucks shares buy with a $70 price target.\nStarbucks stock is down 4.8% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index is up 7.4% for the same period.\n-Tonya Garcia;\n 1117ET\n ",

      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nHoward Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of Starbucks Corp. to lead an effort at the company to build high-end coffee shops that will charge as much as $12 a cup, his next attempt to revolutionize the way Americans consume coffee.\nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the CEO role to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a director of the company for seven years before joining its executive team two years ago. Mr. Schultz, who is credited with taking the company from small beginnings to an international behemoth, began handing over daily oversight of the company to Mr. Johnson a few months ago.\nStarbucks's move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as \"Siren Works\" -- after the mythological creature in the coffee chain's logo -- is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\nWhile Starbucks continues to outperform the broader food retail industry, its sales growth has slowed in recent quarters.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks after he steps down as CEO in April and said he has no plans to step away from the company. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best,\" he said in an interview.\nBut the big bet is based solely on Mr. Schultz's instinct that it is the right thing to do. \"There was no research,\" he said. Convincing his board and senior management team to create another brand wasn't easy.\nMr. Schultz changed the way Americans drink coffee and even socialize, creating what he called a \"third place\" where people could gather outside home and work.\nStarbucks showed Americans that coffee could be more ambitious than home-brewed Folgers. Mr. Schultz joined the original company as its marketing director in 1982 and, after a dispute with its then-owners, left in 1986 to open his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale. He later bought the Starbucks coffee business from the original owners, renamed his own shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nMr. Schultz said the move to opening high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic change since it began opening shops overseas 20 years ago. Mr. Schultz said the approach would provide an experience that would entice consumers, who are increasingly shopping online, to leave their homes.\nAnalysts see plenty of risks for the new venture. If the economy falters, they say, investors won't be too keen on Starbucks spending what some estimate will be roughly $100 million a year building fancy new stores that may draw few customers.\nMr. Schultz was encouraged in part by the outsize sales performance of the company's first such shop, the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. There, coffee is roasted and then brewed using a variety of methods by top Starbucks baristas recruited from around the country. A 12-ounce cup of small-batch coffee brewed using a process involving a siphon costs $12.\nThe Roastery is the 15,000-square-foot embodiment of an idea Mr. Schultz dreamed up seven years ago. In his journal, he scribbled the words \"the Willy Wonka of coffee,\" thinking that someday he would build a grand temple to coffee. At that time, Starbucks was still the predominant place to buy a good cup of coffee. But the better-coffee market has since become crowded.\nNearly two years after the Roastery opened in an abandoned Volvo dealership in Seattle Starbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more like it, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year.\nThe company plans to build as many as 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the Starbucks Reserve brand, with a logo that consists of a gold star and the letter \"R.\" The first two stores are slated to open in Chicago and Seattle in the summer.\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its more than 25,000 Starbucks stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and variety of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores.\nMr. Schultz said he built his case for the new operation by studying other companies that have successfully extended their brands, such as Porsche's creation of a luxury sport utility vehicle, which was initially met with skepticism, and Nike's creation of the Air Jordan brand.\nCliff Burrows, who left his role running the Americas division, Starbucks's largest business, to join Mr. Schultz on the new project, said: \"I've worked with Howard a long time, and there are times he has a vision and clarity that those of us around him don't see but we accept it,\" he said.\nMoving too far upscale could be a distraction to the operation of Starbucks's traditional coffee shops. Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said: \"The menu is getting complex at Starbucks. If you're going to throw on top of that another level of premiumization and innovation and add an espresso bar, this could make things more challenging.\"\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\nDecember 02, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

      "text": "Starbucks' new Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa arrives along with a major pivot 1 hour ago Don't let the latest sweet seasonal drink distract you from these bigger changes at Starbucks Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media \nStarting today Starbucks, fans can pick up the latest treat, the Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa: steamed milk, white chocolate sauce and cinnamon dolce syrup topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon-sugar. And you can enjoy a plethora of Starbucks-brand flavored hot cocoa mixes and K-Cup pods galore, made with real cocoa and nonfat milk and... oh, by the way, did we mention Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down ? \nHe's not leaving the company, but his new role is all about creating major changes for Starbucks. \nMore: We tasted Starbucks’ newest home coffee system alongside the real deal \nAs executive chairman, Schultz will focus on Starbucks' high-end Reserve Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve retail stores. Reserve Roasteries? What does this mean? Is Starbucks getting even more expensive? \nWell, here's what's going on. Lately people have been moving away from hanging out in coffee shops and doing more ordering coffee online. So Starbucks wants to make the brick and mortar shop a more \"relevant customer destination.\" The Seattle roastery has been such a huge success as a retail experience — in terms of praise and sales —that they're going to open 20 more around the world by the end of 2019. And they're opening 1,000 more stores that take elements of the roastery. \nMore: All 13 of the new Starbucks holiday red cup designs \nThe roastery stores will focus more on premium coffee. Think: coffee obsessives brewing with fancy, precision equipment using select rare beans, small-batch-roasted right on the premises. So, you're probably wondering, is this coffee going to be even more expensive? \nYes, of course it's going to be more expensive — $6 to $9 a cup. But in spite of that, people are raving about the roastery experience . \nMore: Starbucks 'Evenings' — the coffee shop will now double as a happy hour spot \n\"This is like Starbuck's older, cooler sister, who went to Europe for college and came back even cooler, having left her awkward wannabe-hipsterness behind,\" says tourist from Australia Chantee F. \nNow, before you panic over coffee snobs hijacking your caramel lattes, remember the roastery store is just a new option you have in addition to your usual seasonal whipped cream-flavored whatever. No one is taking that away from you, and no one is making it more expensive (that we know of). This is just Starbucks growing itself in what seems to be fun and interesting ways. Tagged in",

      "text": "Daily grind ending for Starbucks CEO Associated Press Friday, December 02, 2016 Credit: AP file photo SMELL THE COFFEE: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will step down from day-to-day operations at the giant coffee chain to focus on innovation and social impact activities. comments NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced yesterday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.”\nStarbucks was criticized for having baristas write “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat,” saying: “It was one of my proudest moments.”",

      "text": "Business In this March 23 file photo, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Starbucks Corp., holds up one of the coffee company’s prepaid Visa debit cards. Johnson will become chief executive as of April 3, 2017. (Ted S. Warren / Associated Press) FRIDAY, DEC. 2, 2016, 8:20 A.M. Next Starbucks CEO brings tech savvy By Leslie Patton Bloomberg Twitter \nAfter turning Starbucks Corp. into the world’s largest coffee chain, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will hand the reins to a lieutenant who could solidify its role as a technology company. \nKevin Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks’ chief operating officer last year, will take the helm from Schultz on April 3. The move is a nod to the company’s growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world’s first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple and Google, and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source. \nSchultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand. \n“I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz, 63, said on a conference call after the change was announced Thursday. “But Kevin and the team are in charge.” \nJohnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. In 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \nThe CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. \nFor many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes — occasionally clumsily — such as racial strife and sustainability. \nSchultz will focus on expanding Starbucks’ Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. The executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks’ new higher-end brand. Schultz also will continue the company’s “social impact” efforts. \nAs CEO, he’s already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn’t always gone smoothly. Schultz’s idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticized as ham-fisted. \nInvestors weren’t anticipating Schultz’s departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. \n“The timing of this is a surprise,” she said. “I do think the ‘divide and conquer’ strategy is probably good for the company long-term.” \nStarbucks’ digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose 5 percent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 percent of U.S. transactions in that period. \nStarbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. \nSince Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. \nThough shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground during extended trading. As of 5:54 p.m. in New York, the stock was down 3.3 percent to $56.58. \nThis isn’t Schultz’s first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 — punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 — he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged. \nSchultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing. \n“The difference between then and now couldn’t be greater,” he said on Thursday. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.” \nThe company now has the “strongest leadership team in history,” he said. \nIt’s been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he’s repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn’t serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece. \nIt’s probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said. \n“Certainly, if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,” she said. “A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.”   8:20 a.m.",

      "text": "Global Energy  31pm GMT Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to stymie growth - analysts Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 19, 2014. REUTERS/David Ryder By Sruthi Ramakrishnan \nStarbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street's most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company. \nAnalysts, however, downplayed these concerns. \n\"Howard can't be in that position forever,\" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. \nHottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. \nJohnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks' board since 2009. \nHe also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \n\"Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks' post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,\" Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note. \nTo be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of at least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp. \nWells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavour. \nStarbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. \n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Gayathree Ganesan; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Global Energy News",

Media: Fortune NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson , who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Photo: Ted S.

Warren, AP Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" FindTheCompany | Graphiq \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority. ",

      "text": "Analyzing the top news stories across the web Dec. 2 2016 11:04 AM For the Second Time, Howard Schultz Is Stepping Down as Starbucks’ CEO Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz speaks during Starbucks annual shareholders meeting March 18, 2015 in Seattle, Washington. Stephen Brashear/Getty Images \nThis post originally appeared on Business Insider. \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down next year, the company announced on Thursday. Advertisement \nSchultz will be replaced by Starbucks' president and COO, Kevin Johnson, effective April 3. Johnson has been a member of Starbucks' board of directors for seven years. \nSchultz will be appointed executive chairman. According to the company, he will shift his focus to Starbucks' higher-end Reserve line and the company's social initiatives. \n\"As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson—our current president, COO, a seven-year board member, and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years—has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,\" Schultz said in a statement published on Starbucks' website. \nStarbucks shares were down roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. Advertisement \nIn a call with investors on Thursday, Schultz emphasized he would continue to play an active role in the business. \"I'm not leaving the company. I'm here every single day,\" he said. \nSchultz said that Johnson \"is better prepared on a go-forward basis than I am.\" \nAccording to Johnson, the pair began conversations in May about what future roles they wanted to have at the company. There are no other planned leadership changes. \nSchultz has been instrumental in growing Starbucks' business, joining the company in 1982 as director of operations. He became CEO of Starbucks Corporation in 1987 . Advertisement \nHe left the position of CEO once before, in 2000 . Schultz returned to Starbucks as CEO in 2008 after a hiatus during which he remained chairman to lead the company's financial turnaround. \n\"The differences between then and now couldn't be greater. In 2007, 2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies, especially consumer brands, and Starbucks was not immune,\" Schultz said in Thursday's call. \nSchultz said he believes Starbucks' management team today has capabilities and experience the company lacked in 2000. \n\"On a personal level, I don't think I was as prepared then as I am now, primarily because of my confidence in the strategy, my confidence in the team, and my deep deep respect for Kevin Johnson as a servant leader,\" Schultz said. Advertisement \nIn recent months, Schultz has emphasized the importance of Starbucks' premium Reserve brand, as well as the company's ethical responsibilities. \n\"It's clear to the me that the universal interest in premium retail experiences is not skewed to only the U.S.,\" Schultz told Business Insider in October . \"I think there is a bigger trend here—as companies face the threat of e-commerce and mobile shopping, the burden of responsibility of the bricks and mortar retailers is to create a very immersive, dynamic experience.\" \nSchultz is also known for his outspoken political opinions. The CEO has launched campaigns to address issues including racism, homelessness, and veteran unemployment. In September he endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. \nSchultz's political involvement has led some to speculate that his exit as CEO opens a door for him to run for president. Schultz denied that he had plans to run for public office in an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday. Advertisement \nWhen asked if he may change his mind in the future, he told the Times , \"That's the way I feel today.\" \nThe company announced the news via a release on Starbucks' website. Here's the release in full: \"Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) today announced that Kevin Johnson , president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \"Also effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz , chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve retail store format and the company's social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \"'Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV's and ROI both in the U.S. and around the world,' said Schultz. 'As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.\" As president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company's global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board. \"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard's commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” \nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015. \nKate is a retail reporter for Business Insider . She has previously covered food and franchises for Entrepreneur .

      "text": "Related Content Play Video Here's how two travelers from France made a huge deal wit...\nCNBC  0:57 \nHoward Schultz , the legendary leader of Starbucks coffee, is a billionaire three times over . He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention. \nThe news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants . \n\nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as the CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008. \nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing himself for a run for president of the United States in 2020. \nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story. \nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie. \nHis father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home. \nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees. \nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\" \nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home. \n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\" \nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\" \nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company. \nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores.\nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses. \nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company. \nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\" \nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far. \nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce. \n\nSchultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight. \n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\" \nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand. \nHe has accumulated a stack of awards, including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management. \nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \" For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice \" (2014) and \" Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul \" (2011). \nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence. \n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\"",

      "title": "Here’s What Wall Street Is Saying About Starbucks’ CEO Stepping Down",
      "text": "Long-tenured Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down next year from that role so he can spend more time focusing on the coffee giant’s push into more premium retail and coffee experiences. So how did Wall Street digest the news?\nStarbucks sbux stock slipped in after-hours trading on Thursday and shares were down around 2.5% in mid-day trading on Friday. The news is a jolt as Schultz has long been regarded as the visionary behind the Starbucks brand--getting well-deserved credit for helping greatly boost sales and store count globally in a competitive restaurant industry during his second run as CEO (he previously held the post between 1987-2000).\nSo what are analysts saying about the change? We’ve compiled some of their comments, which focus both on Schultz’s move and the skills that new incoming CEO Kevin Johnson brings to the table with his tech-focused expertise.\nBTIG: “The Announcement Investors Have Long Dreaded” \nThe firm, with a buy rating on the stock, says investor fears that Schultz stepping down--as he did in 2000 only to return in 2008 when the company was in trouble--are overwrought. “We tend to dismiss comparisons to Mr. Schultz's previous retirement as CEO as we believe the brand, retail offering and customer engagement are all much more established today. This provides us with some confidence that the near and long-term prospects won't change.”\nWells Fargo: “ D?j? Vu All Over Again” \nBonnie Herzog encourages investors to take advantage of any sell-off in the stock ahead of next week’s Investor Day event, which she believes will help lift shares again. “While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue.” Herzog adds Johnson’s technology background can help ensure Starbucks investments in mobile and digital remain a primary focus. She rates the stock outperform.\nBaird Equity Research: “CEO Transition Poses An Additional Risk” \nWhile the bank is “highly reassured” that Schultz will remain actively involved in Starbucks in the near term via his chairman role, “we acknowledge risk that the CEO transition announcement could serve as a precursor to him\nbecoming less involved over time.” Encouragingly, Baird says Starbucks is well positioned as the firm expects the specialty coffee category to post sales increases at an above-average pace in upcoming years, especially considering the low penetration for specialty coffee (consumed daily by 31% of population) relative to overall coffee consumption (59%).\nOppenheimer: “New Focus For Howard Schultz” \nCalling Schultz “one of the best CEOs we’ve ever covered,” the bank says it is encouraged that the executive will remain actively involved with a new focus surrounding “growing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries globally, the Reserve store format and social initiatives. As a result, he will no longer be involved in running the day-to-day operations of the company, but will remain an invaluable resource.” Oppenheimer added, “While disappointing to see a visionary and founder step back from day-to-day operations, we believe the company is left in the capable hands of Mr. Johnson. And, we do not believe Mr. Schultz would step away from daily operations without feeling the same way.”\nGuggenheim: “Schultz Stepping Aside Again, But is He Leaving on a High Note?” \nThe bank expressed some concerns Starbucks losing an “irreplaceable merchant,” especially as there are several risks that could pressure the stock, including minimum wage pressures, potential commodity cost increases, and worries sales growth could slow if food and mobile’s contribution to the top line loses momentum. Guggenheim also notes that new CEO Johnson previously served as CEO of Juniper Networks jnpr for five years between late 2008 through early 2014. What’s worrisome? The stock appreciated 24% over that period, underperforming the 91% increase for the S&P 500.\nBMO Capital Markets: “Optimistic This Leadership Transition Will Be Different Than the Last” \nLike many other Wall Street observers, BMO referenced the concerns about leadership transition after Schultz had to swoop back in to save the Starbucks brand in 2008. The bank says it is less worried about this succession because Johnson has been “co-authoring” the Starbucks strategy since becoming COO in 2015 and “his near-term focus likely will be on executing the already established strategy as he becomes increasingly acclimated to the CEO role. BMO advises investors keep an eye on the Starbucks Investor Day on December 7. “Management intends to share details for reserve stores, including the launch of a new product category,” the bank said.",

The Roastery and Reserve stores offer a premium assortment of coffees and are meant to be \"customer destination venues,\" according to comments from Schultz posted on the Starbucks website about the transition.\nThe Seattle Roastery -- there is currently only one--achieved a same-store sales increase of 24% last year and delivers a ticket four times the usual Starbucks cafe, Schultz said. The company plans to open at least 20 Roastery locations world-wide by the end of 2019, and at least 1,000 are planned for the years ahead.\nRead also:Starbucks to open Reserve Roastery in Tokyo in 2018 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/starbucks-to-open-reserve-roastery-in-tokyo-in-2018-2016-10-20)\nWells Fargo analysts have confidence in Johnson, whose succession has been years in the making.\n\"Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,\" the analysts wrote.\nWells Fargo rates Starbucks shares outperform with a valuation range of $64 to $66.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/8Ovqdi2imSF)\nSchultz's proximity to Johnson is also seen as an asset to analysts at The Buckingham Research Group.\nSee also:Why Apple Pay and mobile wallets never really took off despite all the buzz back in 2014 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-mobile-wallets-never-really-took-off-despite-all-the-buzz-back-in-2014-2016-11-14)\n\"Our opinion is that Starbucks has a deep bench, Mr. Schultz will remain available and involved in important decisions and Mr. Johnson is well qualified to step into the CEO role,\" analysts wrote in a note published Thursday. \"We expect no change in execution or strategic direction as a result of the new leadership structure.\"\nBuckingham Research rates Starbucks shares neutral with a $59 price target.\nSee also:It's red cup season at Starbucks: Check out the 13 new holiday designs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-red-cup-season-at-starbucks-check-out-the-13-new-holiday-designs-2016-11-09)\nInstinet analysts believe Johnson's background in technology is logical for Starbucks today. \"With Starbucks' business becoming increasingly more technology-oriented, Mr. Johnson's tech background should serve him well,\" analysts said in a note published Friday.\nAnd its analysts believe Schultz will stick around even after he's vacated the CEO spot.\n\"[W]e believe Mr. Schultz got certain non-Starbucks endeavors out of his system during his previous time as non-CEO, such as his 2001-2006 ownership of a National Basketball Association team,\" Instinet said. The team was the Seattle SuperSonics (http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?id=2525634&columnist=hughes_frank).\n\"We don't expect Mr. Schultz to buy a major sports team again anytime soon -- which we view as positive for shareholders as he transitions into an updated and still very important role within Starbucks,\" Instinet said.\nInstinet rates Starbucks shares buy with a $70 price target.\nStarbucks stock is down 4.8% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index is up 7.4% for the same period.\n-Tonya Garcia;\n 1117ET\n ",

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 7:31 PM. CST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO resigning, shifting focus to more upscale outlets By Beki Winchel   Tweet Starbucks is shaking things up—but not by changing the ingredients in its pumpkin spice latte. \nOn Thursday, the company’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, announced that he will step down on April 3. Starbucks’ chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, will take over. \nSchultz will stay on as executive chairman and “will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world,” the company said in a statement . \nIn a call with investors and reporters, Schultz further explained his vision for the company’s high-end coffee stores: Since its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become widely recognized as the world’s most immersive, coffee-forward retail experience. Executives from premier global retailers like Apple, Nike and Zara have shared with me their view that the Roastery delivers the best retail experience – in or out of coffee – that they have ever encountered. Our Roastery is attracting customers and visitors to Seattle alike, and casting a bright halo across the entire Starbucks global brand and ecosystem. With the Roastery, we introduced into the coffee category a previously unattained level of premiumization. Its success is unparalled, last year achieving a comp sales increase of 24% and delivering a ticket that is four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. The Roastery has become a learning laboratory for breakthrough innovation and experiential design and a beacon for the next wave of Starbucks global growth and evolution. Going forward, we will open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by the end of calendar 2019 alone. At the same time, elements of the Roastery are forming the basis of the 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores we will be opening around the world in the years ahead. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported : Starbucks’s move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as “Siren Works”—after the mythological creature in the coffee chain’s logo—is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin’ Donuts , which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee. \nExecutives’ desire to be creative \nIs Schultz’ focus on building Starbucks’ high-end offerings about more than just boosting the coffee chain’s bottom line? \nForbes’ contributor Richard Kestenbaum posited : I don't mean to disparage Starbucks, they created a new category in America, changed consumer habits and are enormously profitable. Those are all about the hardest things to do in business for any company. But when you look at where they are today and where the world is going, it's not surprising that a senior person in a dominant retail company would want to do something more innovative. \nKestenbaum continued: … New, creative retailers are much more like professional service organizations than they are like the old vertical structure with strict reporting lines and responsibilities. When you structure organizations horizontally instead of vertically and you get good people in the company, something amazing happens: creativity. And thus it becomes possible to build a big organization with creative people who can not only be successful and happy in their jobs but they can also offer consumers much more interesting products and environments. \n“One of the characteristics of having a horizontally-oriented organization chart is that it can't be grafted on to a traditional company,” Kestenbaum wrote. “It just won't fit and the two can't coexist.” \nThe move’s effect on Starbucks’ image \nIn his call on Thursday, Schultz gave Johnson a glowing recommendation: Kevin brings to the CEO role an unparalleled understanding of the market dynamics and strategic choices that have driven Starbucks to become one of the world’s most recognized and respected companies and brand. We share a passion for customer-focused innovation and a commitment to preserving Starbucks heritage. Our complementary backgrounds – my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin’s decades spent scaling global businesses – will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation. Kevin is, in every respect, a true servant leader and a person whose courage, compassion and empathy model the very characteristics we want for all partners and all our leaders. His approach to solving complex problems and his ability to bring out the best in people will continue to make all of us at Starbucks better in the same context that he has made me better. \nHowever, the endorsement didn’t calm investors, who sent shares tumbling after the announcement. \nThe reason for the anxiety lies in Schultz’ embodiment of Starbucks’ thriving reputation and business success. \nBloomberg reported : The CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. For many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes -- occasionally clumsily -- such as racial strife and sustainability. \n“I can’t try to be Howard. I’m not Howard,” Johnson told broadcasters on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” \nPerhaps that’s not such a bad thing—once confidence in Johnson’s leadership has been instilled. \nOn Friday morning, Starbucks’ shares were down 2.39 percent in pre-market trading.",

      "text": "Starbucks Just Released a New Hot Cocoa That Tastes Just Like a Snickerdoodle December 2, 2016 by Erin Cullum 76 Shares \nStarbucks has a brand-new seasonal drink that'll warm you up and satisfy your sweet tooth at the same time: Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa. The cocoa-cookie hybrid is made with steamed milk, white chocolate sauce, and cinnamon dolce syrup and topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. You can order the drink starting today, Dec. 2, at participating Starbucks locations in the US throughout the holiday season. This cozy beverage joins the lineup of Starbucks's other seasonal drinks, like Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Peppermint Hot Cocoa. Sipping on Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa and making a fresh batch of pumpkin spice snickerdoodles might be the coziest way to start your weekend morning this December. Related:",

(Starbucks Photo) Howard Schultz will be replaced as Starbucks CEO by longtime technology executive Kevin Johnson, a veteran of Microsoft and other tech companies. We discuss the implications of that change — and float a theory about Schultz’s future plans — on this “Week in Geek” segment of the GeekWire podcast this week.\nGeekWire also connected with several of Johnson’s former colleagues for this profile after the announcement was made. Former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, for example, had high praise for Johnson, saying will be “an amazing asset” as Starbucks CEO given his past experience in technology.\n\nIn streaming news, Netflix is finally allowing downloads , Amazon is making it easy to sign up for HBO Now , and DirecTV unveiled its new streaming service .\nPlus, we examine Seattle’s new status as the nation’s hottest housing market , discuss a newspaper publisher’s novel partnership with Microsoft , and explain why Amazon rolled out a giant semi truck on stage in Las Vegas this week. Check out all of GeekWire reporter Dan Richman’s coverage from AWS re:Invent .\nListen to the episode above or download the MP3 here . \nPODCAST SPONSORS \n\n",

      "text": "A \nREUTERS: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.5 percent at US$57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street's most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company. \nAnalysts, however, downplayed these concerns. \n\"Howard can't be in that position forever,\" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. \nHottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. \nJohnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks' board since 2009. \nHe also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc , which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \n\"Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks' post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,\" Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note. \nTo be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of at least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp . \nWells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavor. \nStarbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. \n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Gayathree Ganesan; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) - Reuters",

      "text": "Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company.\nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.\nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.\nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp .\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.\n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.",

      "text": "Starbucks Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa Review Read This Before You Order Starbucks's New Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa December 2, 2016 by Erin Cullum 0 Shares \nStarbucks released a limited-edition Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa for the holiday season, but is it any good? Our editors put it to the test to see if it lives up to our cocoa-cookie-hybrid dreams. The verdict? It totally does. The best part is the drink is nowhere near as sweet as we'd anticipated. It's like a cozy cup of (white) hot chocolate with a cinnamon kick that tastes like the holidays. The barista makes the hot cocoa by steaming milk with white chocolate sauce and cinnamon dolce syrup and then adds a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. \nYou can opt for whipped cream or no whipped cream, and the drink is just as satisfying with Starbucks's new almond milk . In fact, the nuttiness of the almond milk brings out the snickerdoodle flavor even more. \"The almond milk one tastes more like a snickerdoodle, but the regular milk is sweeter! Both are pretty delicious though,\" one commenter wrote. Some of our tasters claim \"it doesn't taste like a snickerdoodle, but more like Mexican hot cocoa,\" but almost everyone agrees \"it's not sickeningly sweet\" and it's \"actually kind of sophisticated for hot chocolate.\" Get it while you can, because this just might become your favorite Starbucks holiday beverage.

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nHoward Schultz' departure from the CEO job won't stop Starbucks from growing, analysts say. Late Thursday, Starbucks said that Schultz is stepping down as CEO on April 3rd to focus on new, high-end coffee shops, and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, is taking over. Johnson has worked with Schultz for nearly two years, and has a background in technology, including stints at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. Schultz said he had personally asked him to take the CEO gig, saying he would be a good fit at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. David Henkes of Technomic. (SOUNDBITE) DAVID HENKES, GLOBAL FOOD/BEVERAGE TREND WATCHER AND CONSULTANT, SENIOR PRINCIPAL, TECHNOMIC, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"There were some initial concerns about Kevin Johnson, and his retail background, and how well he actually understood the business, given his tech background. But it seems that, given the way Starbucks is trending, and all the tech investment, and, quite frankly, there's a huge tech platform that Starbucks has that drives a lot of their sales right now. It seems that Kevin is certainly well positioned, and will be a good addition to the ranks of CEO, and should help the business immensely. \" But the company's shares have traded down after the announcement. The last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled, and its stock has risen six-fold.

      "text": "Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to disrupt growth 8:02pm GMT - 01:30 \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain. Bobbi Rebell reports.   \nHoward Schultz' departure from the CEO job won't stop Starbucks from growing, analysts say. Late Thursday, Starbucks said that Schultz is stepping down as CEO on April 3rd to focus on new, high-end coffee shops, and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, is taking over. Johnson has worked with Schultz for nearly two years, and has a background in technology, including stints at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. Schultz said he had personally asked him to take the CEO gig, saying he would be a good fit at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. David Henkes of Technomic. (SOUNDBITE) DAVID HENKES, GLOBAL FOOD/BEVERAGE TREND WATCHER AND CONSULTANT, SENIOR PRINCIPAL, TECHNOMIC, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"There were some initial concerns about Kevin Johnson, and his retail background, and how well he actually understood the business, given his tech background. But it seems that, given the way Starbucks is trending, and all the tech investment, and, quite frankly, there's a huge tech platform that Starbucks has that drives a lot of their sales right now. It seems that Kevin is certainly well positioned, and will be a good addition to the ranks of CEO, and should help the business immensely. \" But the company's shares have traded down after the announcement. The last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled, and its stock has risen six-fold.  //reut.rs/2gW130H",

      "text": "What To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless? (Investor's Business Daily) \nOppenheimer said in a note on Friday that the CEO transition at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is unlikely to lead to any unexpected missteps, as chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, who is set to take over from Howard Schultz, was already involved in running the business on a daily basis. Johnson is set to become the CEO on April 3, 2017. \nGiving some background on CEO-destined Johnson, analyst Brian Bittner said he has been a board member for the last seven years and ran the company's global business with Schultz over the last two years. \nOppenheimer noted Schultz is to transition to the role of executive chairman and focus on Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, globally. With Schultz's focus shifting to growing Reserve Roasteries globally, the firm believes he will remain an invaluable resource. \nAlthough disappointed to see Schultz, whom the firm termed as a visionary, stepping back from day-to-day operations, it said it believes the company is left in capable hands. The firm maintains its Outperform rating and $65 price target for the shares of the company. \nAt last check, Starbucks was losing 2.43 percent to $57.08. Latest Ratings for SBUX",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step down in 2017 for new role leading social issues | Mic",
      "text": "TWEET Starbucks ' chairman and CEO Howard Schultz will be stepping down from his role in 2017, the company announced on Thursday, though he will not leave the company entirely. Schultz will hand over the reins to current president and COO Kevin Johnson. Schultz's new role at the company — the biggest global coffee brand with more than 24,000 stores in 70 countries — will be as executive chairman. The position, according to the New York Times , will allow Schultz to lead Starbucks' charge on social issues, along with the development of a \"superpremium line\" of coffee products and stores. \"Our complementary backgrounds — my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin's decades spent scaling global businesses — will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation,\" Schultz said in a statement . There has been increased speculation that Schultz will eventually assume a political career in the future , as the Times points out. Schultz was a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in this year's election, and has talked in the past about fixing the \"dysfunction in Washington.\" Speaking with Mic in September, Schultz cited \"fractured leadership\" in the United States as one of the reasons his company started \"Upstanders,\" an original series aimed at highlighting individuals making a positive change in their communities. After the announcement of Schultz's new role, shares in Starbucks were down by more than 3%, according to Business Insider . Though Starbucks has certainly had its share of controversies under Schultz's tenure, the CEO has been praised for his social stances. \nHoward Schultz is an actual role-model billionaire. His work on human rights and his treatment of his employees are American values. Since Schultz joined the company in 1987 — stepping down once as CEO for another executive position before returning in that span — Starbucks had grown into a company valued at roughly $85 billion, according to Forbes .

      "text": "ePaper Starbucks gets stronger tech shot under new CEO For many shareholders and customers, Mr Schultz (above) has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. Come April 3, Mr Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks' chief operating officer last year, will take the helm. PHOTO: REUTERS Published http://str.sg/4QEG Copy \nNEW YORK • After turning Starbucks Corp into the world's largest coffee chain, chief executive officer Howard Schultz will hand the reins to a lieutenant who could solidify its role as a technology company. \nMr Kevin Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks' chief operating officer last year, will take the helm from Mr Schultz on April 3. \nThe move is a nod to the company's growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world's first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple and Google, and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source. \nMr Schultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand. \n\"I'm not leaving,\" Mr Schultz, 63, said after the change was announced on Thursday. \"But Kevin and the team are in charge.\" \nMr Johnson, 56, who joined the board in 2009, previously worked at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. \nThe CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 per cent, even though Mr Johnson had been seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. \nFor many shareholders and customers, Mr Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. \nAnd he has used the company to pursue social causes - occasionally clumsily - such as racial strife and sustainability. \nMr Schultz will focus on expanding Starbucks' Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses providing tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail outlets. \nHaving both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. \"I do think the 'divide and conquer' strategy is probably good for the company long term.\" \nStarbucks' digital and tech prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose 5 per cent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments made up about 25 per cent of US transactions in that period. \nStarbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. \nSince Mr Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the United States and even tested delivery. It is also boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. \nBLOOMBERG   'Starbucks gets stronger tech shot under new CEO'.  ",

      "text": "Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to disrupt growth 1:32am IST - 01:30 \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain. Bobbi Rebell reports.   \nHoward Schultz' departure from the CEO job won't stop Starbucks from growing, analysts say. Late Thursday, Starbucks said that Schultz is stepping down as CEO on April 3rd to focus on new, high-end coffee shops, and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, is taking over. Johnson has worked with Schultz for nearly two years, and has a background in technology, including stints at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. Schultz said he had personally asked him to take the CEO gig, saying he would be a good fit at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. David Henkes of Technomic. (SOUNDBITE) DAVID HENKES, GLOBAL FOOD/BEVERAGE TREND WATCHER AND CONSULTANT, SENIOR PRINCIPAL, TECHNOMIC, (ENGLISH) SAYING: \"There were some initial concerns about Kevin Johnson, and his retail background, and how well he actually understood the business, given his tech background. But it seems that, given the way Starbucks is trending, and all the tech investment, and, quite frankly, there's a huge tech platform that Starbucks has that drives a lot of their sales right now. It seems that Kevin is certainly well positioned, and will be a good addition to the ranks of CEO, and should help the business immensely. \" But the company's shares have traded down after the announcement. The last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled, and its stock has risen six-fold.  //reut.rs/2gw6c2G",

(Courtesy of @aprilwhetsell on Twitter) Related Coverage Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation \nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) – Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug covered in sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival. But there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls”– and no such waterfall exists. #FAIL @Starbucks who reviewed the final design? Klamath Falls DOESN'T have a waterfall. The pic looks like you meant #multnomahfalls #oops pic.twitter.com/DTGZHeUg20 \nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge. Klamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon. \nStarbucks has not replied to a request for comment. \nThe coffee chain also sparked controversy last winter by choosing a simple red ombre for its holiday cup design.

      "text": "By Emma Lord 8 hours ago \nAs if the majesty of introducing not one, not two, but 13 holiday cups for us to enjoy this holiday season wasn't enough, it turns out we are all getting #blessed a fourteenth time by Starbucks' Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa , which just hit the menu on December 2. And there is plenty to get hyped about re: this new beverage. It is compromised of — (pause for a moment, to prepare your taste buds) — s teamed milk, white chocolate sauce, and cinnamon dolce syrup, topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon sugar, according to a Starbucks press release. All of that adds up to a whole lot of yum. ( Bustle has reached out to Starbucks for more details about the new addition and will update upon hearing back.) \nThis new addition to the menu joins its other Starbucks hot chocolate brethren , which at the moment include Hot Chocolate Chile Mocha, Peppermint Hot Chocolate, Peppermint White Hot Chocolate, and Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate. But this one comes with a happy twist: along with the announcement of the new flavor, Starbucks is starting a deal from December 2 through December 5 where any customer who purchases a hot chocolate can also purchase an additional cake pop for the mere price of one dollar in participating stores. Let this be a public service announcement to anyone and everyone within 50 feet of me for the next month: I am gonna get SO HYPED. \nCustomers will be able to enjoy this new addition in one of Starbucks' 13 new holiday red cups, all of which were selected from designs by artists all over the world. Starbucks was inspired by designs customers were sharing last year of their own doodles on 2015's classy and understated version of the red cup, which was simply red and didn't have a design, similar to the cups year round. And while all of the designs differ greatly, they are similar in their promotion of unity and the enjoyment of the holiday spirit. \n\"We hope that this year's red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,\" Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said of the decision to include 13 designs in this year's holiday cups. \nIn the meantime, get ye to your nearest Starbucks to try the new Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa — now you can have your cookie and drink it, too! \nImages: Courtesy of Starbucks; Giphy Must Reads ",

      "text": "Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to disrupt growth - analysts Sruthi Ramakrishnan Reuters SHARES \nDec 2 (Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.6 percent in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. \nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, sets him up for the job, analysts said. \nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp. \n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. \nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. \nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. \n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) SHOW COMMENTS",

      "text": "Howard Schultz steps aside as Starbucks’ chief Billionaire hands reins to right-hand man Kevin Johnson but retains chairmanship Read next by: Lindsay Whipp in Chicago \nHoward Schultz is stepping aside as Starbucks’ chief executive for the second time, as the billionaire who built the company into the world’s largest coffee chain hands the reins to his tech-savvy right-hand man. \nMr Schultz will retain his executive chairmanship and focus on the company’s premium roastery and retail store business. However, news of the transition on Thursday unnerved investors who sent the stock down 3.6 per cent to $56.41 in after-hours trading in New York. \n“While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,” said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo. \nSince Mr Schultz was reinstated as chief executive in 2008 to guide the company through the financial crisis, he has trebled Starbucks’ margin on earnings before interest and tax to 18.1 per cent. Its shares have surged nearly eightfold. \nMr Schultz is close to his successor Kevin Johnson , who has been credited with the success of Starbucks’ mobile payment app . It has helped put the company ahead of rival restaurant chains in adapting to an environment where technology and consumer data have become key to success. \n“The management team at the time [of the recession] was good, but didn’t have the experience to navigate [it],” Mr Schultz said. “Over a few years we’ve built, attracted and retained a great team. Kevin and I have had a 10-year relationship on the board and two inside the company.” \nAlthough in corporate governance terms a non-executive chairman is generally preferred as a way of maintaining independence for the board, in the case of Mr Schultz, “I think the market’s probably willing to overlook the board structure here, given the company’s success over the past decade or so,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar. Kevin Johnson © AP \nMr Schultz retained the chairmanship in 2000 when he exchanged his chief executive role for the title of chief global strategist. In 2008, he again took on the CEO mantle. \nCharles Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and a corporate governance expert, said the move appeared to be a “title swap” as the executive chairman is “still running the show”. His role as chief executive and length of time at the company would make it impossible for him to have independence. \nMr Schultz told investors that the company’s global strategy for the years ahead was already in place and that Mr Johnson was “better prepared” to implement it, given his understanding of technology and how to integrate it into the retail business. \n“I think I have an opportunity with the roastery and reserve brand to...really create premiumisation,” Mr Schultz said. \nStarbucks plans to open more than 20 roasteries by the end of 2019 and 1,000 reserve stores, which the company said have higher margins than typical Starbucks cafés. \nUnder Mr Schultz, Starbucks has opened 25,000 coffee shops in 75 countries. The company is even taking on Italy — seen as the home of coffee culture — by planning to open a café there. \nMr Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009 when he was chief executive of tech company Juniper Networks, and joined the coffee chain in 2015 as president. He spent 16 years at Microsoft and served as a member of the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee under the administrations of George W Bush and Barack Obama.  ",

      "text": "All eyes are on Kevin Johnson, who is poised to take the helm of Starbucks when its iconic CEO Howard Schultz steps away from that post in April. Johnson, the coffee giant’s COO, will move into the top position on April 3. and also hold onto the title of president.\nBut while Johnson’s strong technology background and leadership skills have been lauded by Schultz and other, past co-workers, investors seemed to be taking a wait and see attitude. Shares slid 2.2% to close at $57.21 on Friday, the day after the leadership change was announced.\n“I don’t think anybody’s going to be able to really fill Howard’s shoes,’’ says Peter Saleh, managing director, restaurants, for the global financial services firm BTIG. “I think the company will do just fine, because I feel like they are on more stable footing today than they’ve ever been. ... But Howard is a visionary, and I think the loss is being seen in a little bit of a negative light this morning by the overall market.’’\nThe stock price dipped 2.2% on Friday to close at $57.21, but Saleh said that was actually a more modest drop than he would have predicted with the company “changing leadership from someone who is extremely successful.’’\nBut in a call with investors Thursday, Schultz emphasized that he had personally asked Johnson to move into the CEO position. Johnson's knowledge of technology made him the “ideal CEO for Starbucks at this moment in our journey.’’\nUSA TODAY\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz stepping down\nJohnson started his career as a systems engineer for IBM. He went on to spend 16 years at Microsoft, engaging in global sales and marketing, and working his way from sales to running Microsoft's Platforms division. He then spent five years in Silicon Valley as CEO of Juniper Networks, a Sunnyvale, Calf.-company that develops networking products. When he left there in 2014, he was rumored as a candidate to succeed former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\nBrad Brooks, chief product, engineering and marketing officer at DocuSign, worked with Johnson at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. “There are few people you would strap on your soldier gear and go to war with,” Brooks says. \"Kevin is one of them.”\nBrooks also called Johnson a “superstar leader” whose business philosophy of the four Cs — courage, conviction, connections and communication — led to successful launches of Microsoft operating systems Windows Vista and Windows 7, and stewardship of Juniper after the financial markets meltdown in 2008.\nIn 2009, Johnson joined the Starbucks' board, and he became the coffee giant’s president and COO in March 2015, overseeing its businesses as well as the behind-the-scenes logistics of marketing, supplies and the company's online platforms.\n\"Given the seismic shifts in consumer retail behavior, we have seamlessly extended our brick-and-mortar experience to the digital world, and we are now focused on a multiyear strategy to elevate the entire brand,'' Johnson said during the investors call. He added that he and Schultz \"share common values, a love for the company, and a commitment to always do the right thing for our partners, our shareholders, the customers and communities we serve.\"\nKevin Johnson, Starbucks president and chief operating officer, is shown with Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer, in a Starbucks store at the corporate headquarters in Seattle in December 2016. (Photo: Joshua Trujillo, Starbucks)\nUmesh Ramakrishnan, senior partner at executive search firm Kingsley Gate Partners, says that he believes Johnson’s “skill set can be transformative, one that can move Starbucks from a legacy business to a company that takes advantage of a digital retail omnichannel business.’’\nSaleh, who maintained a \"buy\" rating for Starbucks, added that Schultz’s confidence in Johnson should calm investors.\nSchultz “basically grew this company from one or two stores to thousands globally,’’ Saleh says. “The vast majority of his wealth is in Starbucks. He must have a significant amount of confidence in Kevin and the management team around him to be able to step away and say, ‘Hey, I’m giving you my baby. Go run with it.’ ”\nUSA TODAY\nStarbucks posts record profits amid global expansion\nStill, following an executive like Schultz whose values, persona and entrepreneurial skills are so integrated into the company will require Johnson to clearly outline Starbucks' plans for growth. In addition, he will need to be a motivator, like his predecessor.\n“In the end, this is a people business,’’ Ramakrishnan says. “He needs to be able to inspire and encourage. Also, he needs to give every employee a reason to believe in the long term. During his tenure, Schultz implemented great employee retention policies like providing education. Johnson will do well to continue that tradition. ‘’\nContributing: Jon Swartz",

      "text": "Here's Why Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Just Stepped Down Food News 1 day ago \nEvan Lancaster \nAmerica's largest coffee chain just dropped some big news and it has nothing to do with secret menu items. \nIn a live webcast presentation followed by a conference call Starbucks' Coffee CEO Howard Schultz announced, Thursday, that he will step down as the company's Chief Executive Officer in April 2017. Current Starbuck's COO and executive Board member Kevin Johnson will be appointed as the coffee giant's new CEO. \n\"I sensed were the early signs of a seismic shift in consumer behavior – away from bricks-and-mortar and towards mobile and online retailing,\" Schultz explained. \"Today, that shift has taken firm hold around the world, both disrupting and redefining retailing and significantly reducing the consumer foot-traffic that traditional retailers have relied on for decades. \nSchultz will transition to a role as executive chairman, where he will focus on, \"Starbucks' next wave of retail innovation,\" Shultz said, according to a company press release . \nBoth Schultz and Johnson explained that they worked together to prepare for this transition and expressed confidence that this leadership change was the best option moving forward, considering changes coming to Starbucks' business model. \nSchultz explained that mobile and application based ordering is driving customers away from brick and mortar locations. To combat that shift, Starbucks will focus on deepening the customers experience through new retail strategies centralized around opening Starbucks Roastery and Reserve Stores and Reserve Bars on a international scale. \nStarbucks' Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve brand are brick and mortar storefront locations that feature deeper menu options, like cold brew and nitro brew, as well as coffee infused alcoholic beverages. \n\"Going forward, we will open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by the end of calendar 2019 alone,\" Schultz said during the Thursday afternoon conference call. \"At the same time, elements of the Roastery are forming the basis of the 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores we will be opening around the world in the years ahead.\" \nWhile specific details are still developing, Starbucks' plans to reveal — in detail — its revitalized business plan during an investors conference in New York, on Dec. 7.

      "text": "We tried Starbucks’ new Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa and here’s our tip to make it taste even better Love it or hate it, Pumpkin Spice Latte season is at a close. Although I, for one, will certainly miss the quintessential autumnal beverage, we’re moving into an equally exciting time of the year — holiday drinks at Starbucks . What’s better than something that actually tastes like a hug? Literally nothing, that’s what. So when asked to take Starbucks’ new Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa for a spin, I was super keen. When I go to Starbucks I usually reach for something caffeinated, which leaves my ‘hot chocolate’ portion of the food pyramid sadly lacking. I was REAL excited to have an excuse to taste test this red cup special. \nThe Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa consists of: “hot cocoa with steamed milk, white chocolate mocha sauce, and Cinnamon Dolce syrup. It’s then topped with whipped cream and a little bit of cinnamon sugar.” So, first thing’s first: (I’m the realest, AND) it does actually taste like a snickerdoodle cookie. The Cinnamon Dolce syrup is maybe the most significant flavor, so if you’re into that, you’re going to be into this, too. It mostly tasted like a white mocha PLUS (i.e. plus hoilday cheer.) The cinnamon sugar on the whipped cream was also dreamy and delicious and wonderful.\nHowever, if you don’t like sweet things — give this one a pass. “ Wow. This is SWEET. Even if you do like sugary drinks, I’d opt for a tall rather than a grande or, blood sugar levels forbid, a venti. If your complaints about the PSL are that it’s too sweet, then this is not the droid you’re looking for.\nBut if you’ve got a massive sweet tooth, this is a super legit option to ferry you to saccharine bliss on a cloud of cinnamon sugar and whipped cream. But here’s how to take this drink up a notch. Pro-tip: If you don’t love super sweet things but want to try this anyway, I added a shot of espresso about halfway through and it really cut the sweetness and, in my humble, caffeine-addicted opinion, improved it all around.\nThe post We tried Starbucks’ new Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa and here’s our tip to make it taste even better appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "A definitive ranking of Starbucks' 2016 holiday beverages Posted By Holly V. Kapherr on Fri, Dec 2, 2016 at 5:01 PM click to enlarge Image courtesy Starbucks We know Foxtail Coffee just opened (and we definitely encourage a visit because it's adorable and the java is A+), but if you haven't stopped by a Starbucks lately for a holiday drink, you really should. This year's new and returning Red Cup Coffees and non-coffee beverages are really getting sophisticated. And, #realtalk: A warm red cup full of corporate coffee is sometimes the only thing that makes throngs of shoppers and too-small parking lots even worth the trouble, and there's always a Starbucks nearby. So there's that. There are a ton of choices though, so here's our ranking of the Starbucks holiday drinks. Our No. 1 holiday coffee by far is the Holiday Spice Flat White . It. Is. So. Good. Here's why: The Christmas Blend espresso is infused with cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon and clove. It is only slightly sweetened, really letting the spices sing. Whether you get it with soy or regular or almond milk, it's a win. I was honestly jumping for joy when I saw that it had returned this year from last year's debut. The award for Best New Beverage goes to the Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew for all the reasons listed above for the Holiday Spice Flat White (it's basically the sister beverage), plus the fact that we're still having 85-degree days in December and an iced Peppermint Mocha is kind of gross. The Nariño 70 cold brew is slow-steeped and infused with spices, plus a douse of sweetened heavy cream. All the yes. The rankings (totally subjective, sorry guys): 1. Holiday Spice Flat White 2. Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew 3. Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa",

CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from his role to become executive chairman “and focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats,” the company announced Thursday. \nPresident and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, 56, will become the CEO for the coffee chain. He will assume full responsibility for Starbucks’ global business and operations, according to the company. \nThe changes take effect April 3. \nSchultz, 63, said he has no plans to step away from the company or run for political office, according to an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \nAccording to the Journal interview: “I don’t have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,” he said. “This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.” \nIn Thursday’s news release, Schultz said: “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nJohnson’s career also included a 16-year stint at Microsoft, where he led global sales and marketing, according to Starbucks’ news release. \nThis story will be updated.

Warren, File) Posted: Thursday, December 1, 2016 5:34 pm | Updated: 6:04 pm, Thu Dec 1, 2016. Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation Associated Press | 0 comments \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

Well, Universal Orlando Resort just received a new scepter in the form of an exclusive Starbucks mug that features the parks famous icons. \nThe three Starbucks on Universal property will carry this sure-to-be-in-demand beauty, so you should be able to find it in Universal CityWalk, Universal Studios Florida, and Universal’s Islands of Adventure. The mug depicts popular park icons like the classic arches, the towering lighthouse, and the rotating globe which has stood as the brand’s “mascot” since before the parks were even created. \nMade of a thick ceramic, the mug holds a full 14 ounces of life-giving caffeinated bliss. And the piece is microwave and dishwasher safe to boot. How that for putting a little frappe in your cappuccino?",

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) has a number of future plans in place to continue to grow the business and increase same-store sales, even as current CEO Howard Schultz is preparing to hand the reins of the coffee company over to current COO Kevin Johnson.\n\"I can't try to be Howard. I'm not Howard,\" Johnson said in an in-depth interview with Schultz on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier on Friday.\nJohnson intends to lead the company on its \"most ambitious strategic plan in the history of the company,\" he said. That plan includes \"elevating the brand,\" \"elevating the customer experience\" and \"amplifying Starbucks as a destination.\"\nSpecifically, Starbucks will be working to extend mobile pay to its license partners and other geographies, Johnson said. \"That's a big unlock,\" he said.\nSecond, Starbucks is going to expand its food options, Johnson claimed. Its breakfast sandwiches have been a success, but the next frontier will be whether it can \"crack the code\" on lunch options.\nThird, the company is working on building its upscale Starbucks Reserve brand by opening up 20 to 30 roasteries, as well as 1,000-plus stores in the same \"theme\" as the roasteries, Schultz commented. The stores will be about 4,000 square feet, which is twice the size of existing Starbucks stores, and will offer coffee that runs up to $12 per cup. In addition, existing stores will get Reserve bars added to them.\nSo far, the 15,000 square-foot Seattle roastery that opened about two years ago has \"far exceeded our expectations,\" Schultz claimed. \"It has four times the average ticket of a typical Starbucks store and has become a primary destination for every tourist in Seattle.\"",

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz announced on Thursday that he would step down from his position in early April, but this isn't the first time he's attempted the transition.\nSchultz first planned to leave the company back in 2000 when he became chairman, but he returned in 2008 to help fix falling sales. Looking back, there were two main issues that made that first transition unsuccessful, Schultz said in an in-depth interview along with his successor and current Starbucks COO Kevin Johnson on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday.\nFirst, he left at the start of the \"cataclysmic\" financial crisis and his company had \"a very difficult time navigating through that,\" Schultz said. \"We did not have the quality of the team. We didn't have the resources and the capabilities that we have now. We didn't have the leader.\"\nSecond, Schultz wasn't \"emotionally prepared to leave the company and not meddle\" back then, he said. This time around, Schultz has a full-time project ahead of him, with expanding the new upscale Starbucks Reserve Brand, which is expected to have as many as 1,000 locations.\nWhile Schultz says he is in a \"good position personally\" this time around, the reality of the change didn't hit him until he actually said the words on Thursday. \"When you're in front of everybody and you make the announcement and it's real, you realize you've crossed over the Rubicon.\"\nSchultz is \"at peace with it,\" he added. Starbucks is healthy, and Johnson is a trustworthy partner, he said.",

Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nThe company has credited the rewards program and app for helping its strong sales growth in the U.S., although expansion has slowed more recently. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in the leadership team. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.",

      "text": "Effective April 3, 2017, Starbucks ( SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz will hand the reins of CEO over to current Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, the company announced Thursday. Schultz will assume the role of Executive Chairman and spearhead innovation focused on the development of high-end roastery locations.\n\"I was a little bit surprised by the timing,\" Morningstar's R.J. Hottovy told CNBC Friday morning. \"I think the company set this transition in motion this summer when they reorganized the executive positions.\"\n Starbucks is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells SBUX ? Learn more now .\nStarbucks announced a reorganization this summer, giving Schultz oversight of day-to-day operations.\n\"I thought this might have been something we see a year or two down the road,\" Hottovy said.\nYet Hottovy came away \"impressed\" by Johnson from the CNBC interview that included both Schultz and the incoming CEO on Friday morning.\nHe said that while it is impossible to replace someone with the business acumen of Schultz, Johnson confidently answered crucial questions about the retail side of the company.\n\"I think that he accurately answered that you really can't [discuss] customer experience in the stores without the digital flywheel. I think the company is well ahead of the curve on that end,\" Hottovy noted.\nFurthermore, Schultz emphasized Starbucks' bench, which he has called the strongest in Starbucks' history.\n\"I think Howard's point about a deeper bench is absolutely true,\" Hottovy said. \"Every one of the positions they have, all these guys are at the top of their field.\"",

      "text": "Shares of Starbucks ( SBUX ) were down 2.8% Friday, the day after Howard Schultz, the CEO and face of the company, announced that he would be stepping down from his position effective on April 3 and would be replaced by COO Kevin Johnson. Schultz will remain executive chairman of the coffee company. The stock dropped as much as 10% when Schultz first made the announcement.\n\"When we got the news, I was immediately very disappointed because I love what Howard has done. He is iconic,\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"The natural reaction is to say, 'Wait a minute, he is Steve Jobs and you can't do Starbucks without Howard,\" he added.\nHowever, Cramer said he feels better now after interviewing Schultz and Johnson on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this morning because he realized Schultz \"really isn't going anywhere.\" Said Cramer, in the interview, Schultz effectively said, \"I'm still very much involved, but we do have technology problems. And Kevin is better at that.\"\nThe tech problem at Starbucks is currently its \"biggest problem,\" Cramer claimed. It hasn't fully worked out the mobile order because the lines are too long and the throughputs aren't good. Johnson may be better at fixing that issue because of his past experience as an executive at Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Juniper Networks ( JNPR ) . \"If you're going to figure out throughput, you're not going to be a coffee man...that's not a slight to Howard. That's a tech job,\" he explained.",
