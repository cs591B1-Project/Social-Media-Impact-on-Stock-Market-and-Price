      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nThree cruise lines also expected to announce new service to Cuba\nWASHINGTON -- General Electric (GE) and Google (GOOGL) are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. For the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Trump, the president-elect, will approach Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\"\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\"\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-pushing-cuba-on-deals-for-ge-google-1480546325?mod=MKTW).\n-Carol E.

      "text": "Fairfield Officials Prepare For Likely Job Cuts, Tax Hikes In Wake Of GE Move November 30, 2016 7:20 PM Filed Under: fairfield , Fairfield University , GE , General Electric , Lou Young , Michael Tetreas , Sacred Heart University \nFAIRFIELD, Conn. (CBSNewYork) — A suburban town is preparing for life after one of its biggest taxpayers picks up and leaves. \nAs CBS2’s Lou Young reported, it was a grey day in Fairfield after the departure of General Electric. \n“We need it here. They pay a lot of taxes,” Janis Torres said. \nThe now shuttered headquarters of the multi-national conglomerate already bears the name of non-profit Sacred Heart University as GE shifts jobs to Boston and other parts of Connecticut, and cashes a $31.5-million check for property that is now off the tax rolls. \nThe first selectman — Connecticut’s version of a mayor — is annoyed. \n“We met with GE; they were very private. It’s their sale, the town was not involved, however we did ask them please keep the property on the tax roles when they sell it. GE didn’t do that. They chose to make a deal in the best interests of GE, not the best interests of the town,” Michael Tetreas said. \nFairfield’s annual town budget is $290-million. GE paid $1.5-million, not a disaster, but an inconvenience. \nSacred Heart University, which is already in Fairfield and expanding into GE’s space said the long-term benefits will outweigh the short-term pain. \n“Our people, whether students or employees spend money in Fairfield. GE employees were going there, working there, eating there, and mostly getting on the parkway to get home,” Sacred Heart University, President John Petillo said. \nTown and company have had a kind of marriage for the last 42 years. You can even find a GE logo on the fancy electric car charging station in the center of town, but like any relationship that’s based partially on money, when there’s a breakup, there’s hard feelings. \n“When you take a million dollars in taxes away from me, I still have to make payroll. That’s a real challenge for the town and the taxpayers,” Tetreas said. \nFairfield can get some of the lost revenue from the state. It’s preparing to cut some town jobs and may have to raise taxes. \nPlanners say in the long run the attractive power of a growing Sacred Heart University and nearby Fairfield University will help the town more. \n“Knowledge based economy, and I think having two universities locally will work in terms of making that new economy,” Fairfield Economic Development Director, Mark Barnhart said. \nIt’s a possible silver lining in the shape of things to come. \nThe university said it plans to open up 400 additional undergraduate slots and hire 60 staff when it expands onto the new campus.",

Talent is our utmost priority in advancing outcomes and we are keen to harness additional talent from India, specialised in data sciences, analytics and product development space.” \nAnthony Thomas, group CIO at GE, said Bangalore is one of the six locations around the world that is focused on IT and software development for GE’s digital strategy. The Bangalore hub will join the company’s network of hubs in the US as well as Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and Budapest in Hungary. \n“GE is looking to hire talent that can fit our lean and agile culture and want to work in a unique global set-up that has a startup-like feel, within a large enterprise with access to R&D, engineering and manufacturing,” said Thomas. “For people who are willing to make an impact in technology-intensive industries, this 124-year-old startup is the place to be.” Read more about GE Predix GE’s digital division is now a fully fledged software business with the introduction of an asset performance management system. Global manufacturer GE has established a partner programme for its Predix platform to drive the value of analytics across the industrial internet. \nPeter Schumacher, CEO at management consultancy The Value Leadership Group , said GE had a long legacy in India. \n“GE’s large outsourcing contracts helped establish India’s enormous technology sector, and its investments in R&D and digital technologies are now contributing to Bangalore’s transformation into a global innovation hub,” he said. \nThe type of work GE performs in Bangalore goes beyond the areas of expertise that India is best known for, said Schumacher. “No other company has captured this opportunity more comprehensively and consistently than GE,” he added. “These investments have greatly expanded GE’s capabilities, enhanced its organisational agility and have given the company significant time-to-market advantages in high-value areas.” \nOver the past decade, Bangalore has seen growth in captive centres for research and development and corporate services from across sectors. Today there is a diverse talent pool in the city and other Indian cities, such as Pune and Hyberabad, which attracts multinational companies.

      "text": "Case study: Ocado uses machine learning to help customer services deal with email overload GE pushes ahead into the software market Docker storage: how to get persistent storage in Docker \nThe rise of flash storage has been a dominant theme in the datacentre in recent years. And rightly so, with performance in the order of 100 times better than spinning disk media. Download this free guide Hybrid Flash: The Essential guide \nThis guide offers a comprehensive survey of the hybrid flash storage market. We give the lowdown on hybrid flash products from the big six storage vendors and the startups and specialists. Start Download You forgot to provide an Email Address.

They do not have the characteristics to take advantage of the benefits of flash media. \nSo, the industry has come up with a standard, non-volatile memory express (NVMe), built for flash and complete with a number of performance advantages. \nNVMe is a standard based on p eripheral component interconnect express ( PCIe), and is built for physical slot architecture. As they launched PCIe server flash products, suppliers each developed proprietary protocols to manage traffic. NVMe is a largely successful exercise in the replacement of such disparate proprietary protocols with a true standard. \nNVMe also allows for the use of 2.5in format solid state drives via the U.2 connector on the card body. \nOf course, NVMe-equipped cards can be aggregated into an array-type format in a similar way to EMC’s DSSD D5 and startup E8’s D24 . In fact, NVMe format cards could be added to array controllers now. However, any such array product that wanted to take advantage of NVMe would require controller hardware that did not act as a bottleneck itself. Key benefits of NVMe over SATA and SAS \nIn short, NVMe provides much greater bandwidth than SAS and SATA, with vastly improved queuing. \nSATA, in its SATA III incarnation, provides 6Gbps and 600Mbps throughput. SAS provides 12Gbps and 8Gbps throughput. More on flash and PCIe storage We run the rule over PCIe SSD and assess its potential as a server-side alternative to all-flash storage, as cache in conjunction with shared storage and in hyperscale environments. The PCIe SSD market is still important , but PCIe flash drive makers are split between those that continue to develop their products and those for whom product evolution has stalled. \nNVMe has data transfer performance characteristics of PCIe Gen 3 and therefore has bandwidth of around 1Gbps per lane – up to 16Gbps in a 16-lane configuration. PCIe Gen 4 will likely double that and is set for release in 2017. \nAt the same time, NVMe is built to handle more queues than SAS and SATA at the drive, with 65,000 queues and 65,000 command queue depths possible. This compares to one queue for SAS and SATA, and queue depths of 254 and 32 respectively. \nThis means NVMe-equipped storage should not experience the performance degradation that SAS and SATA can go through if overloaded with I/O requests. NVMe key use cases \nIn summary, NVMe offers blistering performance for flash storage over the existing SAS and SATA drive connection protocols. Its ability to handle a high number of queues and commands makes it eminently suitable for applications that batter storage I/O with large queue depths, such as databases and some web operations. \nCurrently, however, it is mostly a server flash technology, although its use in arrays and hyper-converged infrastructure and as addressable shared storage (via NVMf – NVMe over fabrics ) is coming.

It is also working with Nokia itself, and Google. \nThe business will be led by Arto Nummela, currently Microsoft’s vice-president of mobile devices in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, himself a Nokia veteran. \n“Nokia has been one of the most iconic and recognisable phone brands globally for decades,” he said. “The excitement of reintroducing this much-loved, well-known and trusted brand to smartphone consumers is a responsibility and an ambition that everyone at HMD shares.” \nThe firm said it would develop an “exciting new consumer-centric product range” with a focus on quality and user experience. \n“We see this as a brilliant opportunity to solve real-life consumer problems and to deliver on the quality and designs that the Nokia brand has always been known for,” said Nummela. \nNokia Technologies interim president Brad Rodrigues added: “We have been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm shown around the world for the return of the Nokia brand to smartphones. The HMD Global team has the ambition, talent and resources to bring a new generation of Nokia branded phones to market, and we wish them every success.” \nThe Nokia name was retired from use on smartphones in October 2014, barely a year after its multibillion-dollar acquisition by Microsoft as former chief exec Steve Ballmer tried in vain to transform Microsoft into a devices and services business, a strategy subsequently reversed by current boss Satya Nadella. \nMany of the Nokia device employees laid off by Microsoft in several rounds of redundancies following the acquisition – which is now widely acknowledged as one of the most poorly executed tech deals in history – have subsequently found their way to HMD, and to other Finnish startups .

      "text": "Case study: Ocado uses machine learning to help customer services deal with email overload GE pushes ahead into the software market Docker storage: how to get persistent storage in Docker Download Current Issue \nCustomers of broadband internet service providers (ISPs) Post Office Broadband and Kcom have been hit by a cyber attack perpetrated by the evolving Mirai internet of things (IoT) botnet. It targeted consumer broadband routers, leaving large numbers unable to access the internet.

You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy . \nThe exploit targeted a vulnerability in Zyxel’s AMG1302-T10B wireless routers that caused them to crash and disconnect from the internet. The attack began over the weekend and is thought to have affected about 100,000 users. \nThe same attack is also understood to have hit routers issued to customers by German telco Deutsche Telekom earlier this week . These devices, sold under the brand name Speedport, were not made by Zyxel. \nThe attack exploited an unsecured transmission control protocol (TCP) port on affected devices. \nA Post Office spokesperson confirmed that an attack by an unnamed third party had disrupted services beginning on 27 November, affecting certain types of router. \n“Although this did result in service problems, we would like to reassure customers that no personal data or devices have been compromised,” the spokesperson said. “We have identified the source of the problem and implemented a resolution which is currently being rolled out to all customers. \n“We would like to apologise to any customers who have been experiencing issues with their Post Office broadband service. For those customers who are still having problems, we are advising them to reboot their router. \n“We constantly review our systems and processes to protect our customers against incidents of this nature. No other Post Office services were affected.” \nKcom, which provides the incumbent telecoms service in Hull and parts of East Yorkshire instead of BT, acknowledged that a number of its customers had been experiencing issues since Saturday 26 November. \nHowever, a spokesperson said, the ISP’s core network was not affected, and the vast majority of customers could now use their broadband as normal after it remotely applied a software patch for affected routers. Read more about Mirai Organisations with an online presence should prepare for terabit-class Mirai IoT botnet-based DDoS attacks that could knock almost any business offline or disable chunks of the internet . The Mirai DDoS attack on DNS firm Dyn at the end of October 2016 highlighted both the vulnerability of the world’s internet infrastructure and the dangers of leaving devices unsecured . A new nematode worm proof of concept could help the internet avoid the next massive Mirai IoT botnet DDoS attack, but experts are unsure of the legality of the option . \n“The cyber attack is not limited to Kcom customers,” said a spokesperson. “Large numbers of customers of other UK and European communications providers have also been impacted. We have provided formal notification of the attacks to the communications regulator, Ofcom, and will continue to work with other UK communications providers to ensure a consistent approach to mitigating this threat.” \nPavel Šrámek, malware analyst at Avast, said router suppliers needed to collaborate with the security sector to find solutions to make their equipment more secure, as such attacks were bound to recur, and could easily compromise other connected home devices. \n“Security software should be implemented directly in the router, which is the central point of the home network that connects all smart home devices to the internet,” said Šrámek. \nResearchers at security firm Flashpoint said up to five million routers could be vulnerable to the new Mirai code around the world. \nZyxel said the flaw meant unauthorised users could access or alter the device’s local area network (LAN) configuration from the wide area network (WAN) side, but said it was important to note that the vulnerability could only be exploited when certain functions, which are usually turned off by default, were enabled. \n“We are aware of the issue and assure our customers that we are handling the issue as a top priority,” the company said. “We have conducted a thorough investigation and found that the root cause of this issue lies with one of our chipset providers. \n“We have examined all CPEs within their warranty and support period, and are now in communication with all our service provider customers, rolling out a fix to the firmware affected.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

      "text": "Peter Lynch Chart of GE \nOn an international scale, 3-D printing is attracting investments from entire governments and causing companies to focus on opportunities outside of the U.S. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, along with other state groups, is putting together a framework for a project that will see some $313 million invested into 3-D printing research and development. Several sources have already projected that the market in China for 3-D printing will exceed the $3 billion mark through 2020. \nHeritage Printing Technology ( HAGE ) has been working to stay ahead of this move and recent announcements indicate the company’s focus is on the opportunity in China. The company recently announced a major Chinese distributor with a strong history of doing business is overseeing logistics in the Chinese market. Since the middle of November, Heritage’s share price has responded positively to corporate developments and industry expansion. Following lows on Nov. 11, the stock has increased by more than 65%. \nIn addition to advancements in China, news wires have been filled with recent announcements that General Electric is boosting its portfolio with plans to invest over $1 billion through the acquisition of several additive-manufacturing companies. The announcement in September caused many investors to begin looking more seriously at the industry itself. \nFacebook has been dabbling in the space through an acquisition approach as well. Even with the company being a social aggregator and engagement network, a recent play to bring internet to everyone around the world is not the only thing coming from the venture side of the tech giant. Late September marked the official move by Facebook to acquire Nascent Objects, a hardware company working to streamline the manufacturing process for “modular consumer electronics.\" \nAccording to reports, Nascent aims to make hardware just as quickly as software by using 3-D printing. Facebook's attraction to the idea comes as a direct result of its speculation on the growth that a 3-D ecosystem will have on consumers and businesses alike. Although it is an unlikely opportunity for investors, it appears that the 3-D printing arena could be gaining traction on multiple fronts. \nThis is not to say there is not more direct exposure to the 3-D printing arena outside of companies like Heritage. 3D Systems ( NYSE:DDD ) has seen a favorable recovery after a depressed few quarters. The recent appointment of a new CEO as well as improved conditions due to the company’s focus on expansion into the medical segment could present the most opportunity for the company. In fact, the stock has rebounded by as much as 23% since the beginning of November. \nThe company revealed its new medical software, DICOM-to-Print (D2P). The main purpose is to boost productivity for health care service providers. It can allow doctors to practice and blueprint surgical procedures by using 3-D anatomical models. \nSimilarly, Organovo Holdings ( NASDAQ:ONVO ) focuses on the medical space. But instead of being just an offshoot of its overall business model like 3D Systems, the company targets medical 3-D printing entirely. The company looks to bring what they call “bioprinting” technology to the medical market and actually create tissue on demand for medical applications in the field as well as for research purposes. Attention surrounding the company has built over recent weeks as it approaches its next earnings date. \nAnalysts have begun speculating on the results and some have even begun upgrading their ratings on the stock. Zacks Investment Research was one of these analyst firms upgrading Organovo from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating in a research report. Several hedge funds have also taken positions in the company, including D.E. Shaw, Arrowstreet Capital and AQR Capital Management. \nSimilar to what has been seen with 3D Systems and Heritage, Organovo has also realized a significant reversal in stock price during November. After hitting lows of $2.50 in early November, the stock has increased by as much as 36%. \nThese increases for the several 3-D printing stocks mentioned also have followed the overall trend within the market itself. Just track the 3-D printing ETF ( PRNT ), for instance. Since suffering a significant blow in late October, November has seen a much stronger response from 3-D printing bulls. The ETF has recovered by as much as 9.6% as of highs on Nov. 25. The top 10 securities tracked by the ETF include several mentioned here as well as K2M Group Holdings ( NASDAQ:KTWO ), Exone ( NASDAQ:XONE ), Voxeljet ( NYSE:VJET ) and Mentor Graphics ( NASDAQ:MENT ). The heaviest segment of the ETF is weighted in Hardware with 50% being accounted for. The remaining focus is on software, services and smaller holdings in scanning and materials. \nThis industry could be poised for a boost heading into 2017, especially considering the large influence by companies like GE, Facebook and HP. With many of these previously depressed stocks beginning to realize much stronger positive movement in the market, it would not be a surprise to see this continue as many manufacturing companies make the leap to additive manufacturing. \nDisclosure: The author owns 55,750 shares of Heritage Printing Corp. and ZERO shares in any other companies mentioned.",

      "text": "General Electric's (GE) CEO Steve Bolze Presents at Credit Suisse 4th Annual Industrials Conference (Transcript) Dec. 1.16 General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) Credit Suisse 4thAnnual Industrials Conference December 01, 2016 02:00 PM ET Executives Steve Bolze - President & CEO, GE Power Analysts Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Julian Mitchell Thanks everyone. So, it’s my pleasure to introduce Steve Bolze, in charge of GE’s power business. Steve’s going to talk for 15-20 minutes and then will do questions. Steve Bolze Perfect. Thank you. And pardon my voice, at least I have one a little bit today. But, what I’d like to go through is what’s going on with the power business at GE. What I would say is in many ways, it’s been a transformational year for GE, particularly so in our power business. I’d say, there are three key areas that have really been the most transformational, one of which is Alstom integration, which is well underway which you will see. The HA is proceeding very well. I’ll talk through that. And I’d say the third of which is the investments that are playing through on services and digital and how all that’s positioning us for growth. So, just as a reminder, our power business is about $28 billion of annual revenue for GE in 2016. It represents today about one-third of the world’s electrical generation with our customer base. So, it’s big part of the world’s power; it’s a diverse mix. And one of the things you have noted earlier this year is with the announced transaction with Baker Hughes, we will be announcing -- or we will be selling our water business later in 2017. So, that’s our power franchise. If you think about what we do and how we differentiate ourselves for our customers, it’s really on these three areas. One is differentiated products and solution services, one of which is global presence and talent, and one of which is digital capability. And as far as just highlights, what I would say is the Alstom acquisition, well underway. I would say, as I go around the world, and about 70% of our revenue is outside the U.S., strong customer acceptance on the rational of these two companies being together. And you all know about our global footprint and capabilities but the integration and synergies are well on track. Expanded plenty of capabilities, what we’ve got there in terms of scope, in terms of our steam business which I will talk through and then service upgrades. And last of which is big ongoing opportunities for margin enhancement and vertical integration, in-sourcing, and you see the brilliant factory work from GE and digital coming through. So, very much a more valuable business than it was a year ago and also well-positioned to lead. Now, setting back and looking at in the environment that we participate in, I was just recently at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, just a perspective on the market. I’d say, it’s a dynamic market but it’s characterized by slow growth. But within that slow growth, there are pockets of growth. And I’d say areas that we see right now are in pockets of Latin America; we see it in sub-Saharan Africa; we see it in spots of Asia, but there are places to win in a slow growth environment. Energy demand continues to grow 2% to 3% a year. Obviously the parts of the world are more so than others, particularly in the developing regions. And still remember, today, 1.2 billion people in the world do not have any electricity access, so still a lot of demand. The right hand side of this chart lays out where the kilowatt hours of power come from today. So, you see very much today is centralized power. But the point I know here even by 2025, a lot of the power in the world, over 85% will still be centralize. And you see the role that gas, coal play. And also while renewables is a big growth area, gas is actually the single biggest area of new power in the world. The other area that comes up, if you talk about the global power demand, this is the world of the impact of efficiency. That’s coming out of the top 21 standards as people are focusing to see on how to reduce their carbon emissions footprint, the big opportunity for our business stepping forward, as well as continuing to get more out of new installed based through services. And our digital investments have really positioned us well given more productivity solutions. So, talking about gas on this next page. The gas outlook, people always ask me about this. It’s largely a flat market in terms of gas new units, but it’s heavily switching towards each H-Class machines. You see roughly 32% of the market has been H-Class, we see that growing to close to 46% and closing around 50%. So, people are buying larger units. And if you think about half GE wins with the customer in this space, it’s really four key areas, it’s capital cost efficiency or dollars per kilowatt; it is footprint size, you want it to be smaller; third, which is flexibility, which gives you responsiveness to respond in cycles with renewable; and fourth of which is efficiency. What we have with the HA technology right now is the best dollars per kilowatt, the best power gen today, our operating flexibility is now at industry leadership, and you saw the world record performance announced earlier this year with EDF at our plant in Bouchain in France, which is 62.2% combined cycle efficiency was the highest of any plant in the world. Now, if we step through what Alstom brought to GE, it really strengthened our gas franchise. On the left hand side of this chart, you see a typical gas plant. That’s what our customers buy. And the blue represents where GE has historically been strong, the gas turbine, some of the control areas, some of the steams in the areas. What we’ve got from Alstom is a much bigger presence on the total plant. Many cases, we used to be 20% on order transaction for gas plant and now we’re close to 60%. The value of this is tremendous, in terms of almost half a point more efficiency performance, in terms of what we did and guarantee to customers. Cycle times and how we deliver, it’s very important to certain customers in terms of emergency power situations and our virtual plants and module areas really help us there. And third of which is more scale for volume and product cost out. By the way, each of the business areas in power on track for their synergies. Our overall target within GE was $1.1 billion of synergies this year; power was $777 million and we’re on track to meet if not beat that. Gas power way is significant on their track there and you see the expanded offering and improved performance coming through for customers. And HA platform, we launched this about 18 months ago. This platform is coming to market. We have 17 units that we’ve delivered through the third quarter; 25 will be the number for this year, that’s what we’re on track for. And when we talk about total margins being positive that’s on the U.S. side. And in the third quarter, we were positive and for the total year, we’ll be positive. And for a product scale investment like this to be positive and it’s really first year of introduction is a good thing. I would say all -- both our 50 hertz and 60 hertz units are now tested and the returns for 2017 will be better because we already see the product cost positions better for the U.S. and backlog that we’ll ship in 2017. You see the numbers there that we should be estimated to exit this year with for next year. And when you think about the HA, it’s not just the gas turbine but it’s the steams, the generators and the boilers that makes up the total plant. So, the HA platform, what I would tell you is it’s the right product at the right time in the market in it is delivering. This next one is our steam business. It’s one that some of you that were at our recent investor visits through [indiscernible] you heard the presentation from Andreas. He joined us from Alstom. This is largely the Alstom based business that we acquired but we also put our steam business from GE in it. We now have GE closed to a $3 billion equipment steam business and the associated service business is with our services business. But what’s interesting about this is roughly 30% of the world’s power is coal, so therefore steam power; and 30% of the world’s steam turbines is now GE; and 30% of the world’s boilers is now GE; and 50% of the steam turbines and all nuclear plants are GE. So, in terms of servicing, efficiency and such, this is the offering we have and that we’re very happy with the technology. If you think about how this business is positioned to win; it’s really two key areas, the first of which is the most efficient coal plant technology. You see this one listed here at EnBW. This is at 47.5% thermal efficiency; that’s the highest of any class of any steam plant in the world. You see that rolling through in the some of the big wins, you saw also from us earlier this year. On the other side, something that investors always worry about is the project execution capability here. It was very strong within the steam business and portfolio within Alstom, and you can see here the team just received the award from Asian Power for the Tanjung Bin project in Malaysia for the execution of that project. So, we’re happy with the technology here but not only does it play for new units, it plays for services, which is where I want to go to next. One of the core reasons why we made the investment of capital allocation in Alstom was for the service portfolio. Now, it gave us much stronger presence in the plant but it also gave us broader access to install base. If you think about the plant, the blue there is again is where historically GE was strong in services. And by the way, the combined service business now, if you look at the red, that’s where Alstom added strength. So, not only in gas for the Alstom units, but also much bigger in generator stream, boilers, total plant capability and also other OEM which is non-GE Alstom. We have now launched this year, less than now one year, we are little over one year in integration, but the Fleet360 is our total plant optimization service solution to our customers, and this is already having big impact. Now, our services business within power is about $16 billion of revenue and it represents a large part of our profitability. If you think about how we win in the marketplace, it’s through services technology. Now, a lot of you know, we focus significantly on providing upgrades to our install base. We have a continuing, very robust program for Advanced Gas Paths, AGPs. Last year 104 were shipped; we’re on track do the 135 to 150 this year. But, this program is broadly in GE. Paul McElhinney talked about this when you all were at -- those that were there in Baden. We have broader upgrades for non-F-Class machines, we have that also covering the combustion systems, the compressors, the flange units and now the steam units. If you look at the right hand side, this is how we are together with Alstom and GE coming together. We can now provide more gas upgrades for the Alstom gas from the facilities. In some cases, we are already under contract at two points of efficiency and extended life. Steam turbine upgrade areas are area of big focus for the historical Alstom business but within GE that’s expanding. You’d see the total plant solutions there. And I’m going to come back and talk a little more about what Predix is doing for our installed base because we are starting to see some big wins on that side. So, the service technology continues to expand. And when you think about where we take the business, this is one of the reasons why we bought Alstom. We got 50% more installed base in a single investment, basically 50 years of installed base in one investment. If you look at our investment in maximum installed base, it shifted there from just GE. You see GE and Alstom together, it’s a very nice diversified, and you see -- look at the opportunity that exists in the market, outside of GE and Alstom units, it’s bigger than the existing GE units. So, we have a much more capable service business, large installed base and it’s expanding for the total book. Now, in addition to the three core businesses, cost competitiveness is a key focus within power. We have talked to you historically about SG&A, which is cut down in the legacy business from 12% to 9%, that drove about $460 million of cost out to the operating line. Obviously, we went up a little with Alstom came to 11% of our sales and we’ll be working that down as we complete our restructuring. Product cost is really the bigger entitlement area as we go forward from margin accretion. I just pulled one example here. This shows you our product cost reduction curve for the last introduction of the 7F.O5 gas turbine versus how we are launching now the new HA. You can see that when the H was launched, the first unit was already at 10% less cost than the dollars per kilowatt in the F. And now today, our tank units [ph] shipping from the HA is already at the cost position of the 1,000 F machine. So, we are starting to see the benefits from the should cost work, our combined centers of excellences which is suppliers, product management, manufacturing and things all looking together, and this is a big margin accretion opportunity as going forward and it’s enabled even more so by the digital thread. Now, at the sometime, we are investing globally in our operations. To get lead in this business, you have to be local. And some of these are our historical factories but we do have factories all over the world. This matters to win. And the three things I’d just highlight here different from some of the previous discussions, one of which is our Dammam, Saudi Arabia facility, has now made its first heavy duty F-Class machine that is now shipped. Korea has now joined us because of the Doosan acquisition for the boilers that’s now part of GE. And the third piece is the Algeria facilities are coming up. So, will be able to continue to position for that large market opportunity. So, this is all about being local, high-quality and cost competitive. And as we look to the future, one of the areas is driving more variable cost productivity. And this is really where all of the investments from GE on additive and advanced manufacturing come in. On the left hand side, you see our new additive advanced manufacturing facility in Greenville, South Carolina. It is right next to our largest single heavy duty manufacturing plant in the world. So, we are already scaling up our first additive parts that are operational. And this technology is going to be well into the H-Class. If you look at the right hand side, Digital Thread, this is really more productivity enabled by some very large ERPs and simplifying our IT systems. In 2016 alone, this is $250 million dollars of productivity and we are connecting the whole enterprise here. So, these are big investments. This is about capturing that next level of margin accretion going forward. Now, the area I wanted to kind of close in on is really the last big area of transformation. But in my 23 years in GE and roughly 17 years in the energy industry, this is the biggest transformation that’s happening in the industry right now and will be over the next 20 years. This was really the topic of my keynote discussion at the World Energy Congress back in Istanbul. This is some work here that was done by the World Economic Forum. The $10 trillion of value can be unlocked by getting at digital and industrial coming together for more productivity in the industry. The view is that more than 75% of the unplanned downtimes can be avoided. There is more than 3 to 4 points -- or 3% to 4% of all electrical generation that never makes it to the consumer and industrial; it’s lost in transmission. And there are a lot of new business models coming up here. So, tremendous opportunity for more productivity in the space. In terms of the Power Digital offering, and you hear about the industrial internet, this is all about better outcomes for our customers. If you look at the left hand side of this chart, with hardware and software coming together, we are working with our customers on existing units getting to 5% better starting reliability, 10% less startup fuel, 1% more total plant availability, 1% more efficiency. These are big numbers for the installed base units and for our customers. And when you look at now applying this to our service backlog, our service backlog and power in $60 billion, only a small piece of that today is digital. But what we went through in terms of our contractual service model, multi-year models is where we’re going to deliver outcomes. And I thought the best example I can give from you is this next one in the case study at HUBCO. HUBCO is a Pakistan facility. And this is really a great case example of the power of the digital industrial impact and with one of our customers. In this case, we took Predix, we took the Digital Twin, we took understanding of a -- by the way, this is an installable [ph] plant. We went in there and we applied all of the thinking, and we’re talking about four points more efficiency out of the same plant today. If you look at that, it’s also a case example of using not only Predix, but Asset Performance Management, APM; outage optimization, this is the first major deployment of Neuco, a smaller company acquisition we did in Boston, and you see how that four points breaks out. What’s also we did here, this is the first example where we experimented with the new business model. As opposed to just selling subscription as a service, we actually guaranteed an outcome. And in this case, four points of efficiency over a 10-year period is worth $240 million to the customer. We will share in that savings. If we sold this under the prior model of license only, this would have probably been less than $15 million. There is tremendous value for our customers here. What’s nice about this one too, HUBCO is a subsidiary of Engro. Engro as a company in Pakistan is deploying Predix now across parts of their fleet, as well as in their operations for fertilizer, for food and other industrial businesses. These products scale not only in power, but across the industrial franchise. And the chart I’d leave you with on Power Digital is the same chart used recently, and we talked about it mine and machine is. This is real and is happening. Just within the power business, the power business is close to 40% of the entire revenue of GE’s digital franchise. And within that, a big chunk of that is our software enabled AGPs, but what I show you here is our pipeline of our services, our software oriented business within that number. We have this year -- we are going to be at $500 million of software only orders in power that were driven by digital, and you see the first half numbers there. This is growing over 50%. This is good margin business and those customers on the right, the majority of those were not with us as digital customers just a year ago. And you heard the announcement recently from Exelon, largest utility in U.S. is going to take Predix and scale across their gas, coal and renewables and nuclear franchise. So, just to come back to where I started, it’s really been a transformational year for us. But this is all about building a new GE Power business with Alstom and GE together. You know what the numbers were last year. This year with Alstom, we will go double-digit, both top and bottom-line. The legacy business will grow single digits this year, as we’ve discussed. You see what the margins rates look like there, attractive. And what I’d sum it up is it’s a great high return business within the Company, some clear competitive advantages in terms of technology leadership, globalization, services, digital, simplification and culture. And I would say the other of which is if we look at our capital allocation within the power business over the course of the last number of years is good returns on our investment and we’re positioning the business for not only the short but the long-term. So, with that, thanks for the time. And Julian, I’ll open it up for you and questions. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Julian Mitchell Thanks, Steve. Maybe, I guess firstly, talk a little bit about the AGPs. That’s an area we get a lot of questions on ourselves. The confidence in that 135, 150 number for the very short-term. And also I guess if you could try and scale -- you talked about the overall size of services, but then you talked about upgrades. Roughly what percent of your services revenue is upgrade specific activity, just say long term? Steve Bolze I would say this, on the AGP side, the AGPs, we did 104 last year, we’ll do between 135, 150; I think we’re 86 through the third quarter. Yes, they’re light in the fourth quarter but we know where they are, we know what we’ve got to do. So, I would also say as why has there been so much AGP growth is because it’s a very good return on investment for our customers. The 7S or 60 hertz AGPs are very good investment returns for our customers. Therefore, they’re deploying them across their fleets. So, I’d say yes, feel good about the 135, 150. Your discussion on larger upgrades, I’m not going to get into how much more revenue is that. But what I would tell you is AGPs are really, historically talking about, more on the F fleet, but you could apply them to the Bs and the E class which are the smaller units. The other thing we have a lot of update programs going for the combustion system. People have to do that given the emissions issues today, also have to upgrade your compressors which allows you get more life and output. And the other of which people are getting into is a lot of the F units that were put in during the “U.S. bubble”, are approaching towards their end of rotor [ph] lives. Those are now coming up to major upgrades. And then you see people doing what’s called Julian flange the plant where they literally take open units up, take the whole rotor compressor out and put a new one in. And in top case, they get 2, 3 points of efficiency. So, this upgrade program is a same philosophy we’re applying to Alstom units, same philosophy we’re thinking about as we think through how we proceed at other OEMs. Julian Mitchell Alstom, cost synergies, you sound very comfortable with. Revenue synergies, I think initially were targeted at about 200 million that’s sort of total Alstom inclusive of grid and so forth. Now, you’ve had it for about a year, how you’re thinking about the revenue synergy number? Steve Bolze What I would say is the Alstom integration is really getting traction. I would say to your point, the cost is how we built this synergy model. That’s well on track. I think we said $1.1 billion this year, $1 billion to $3 billion by 2020. I think it’s 2.5 by 2018 and power is 1.7 of it. And I can tell you, we’ll hit our synergies this year, maybe exceed, probably exceed. And then, we have good line of sight going in 2018. So, cost is straightforward to your point. The revenue: We always said revenue synergies would be an upside. What I would tell you this is already in 2016 in power, we have $85 million of revenue synergies. So, we are already seeing it coming into the business. A lot of revenue synergies, everybody else, as you go through these deals, when you get an order, you got to get it to flow through, the backlog and out. So, I think if we use this year as an indication, we are starting to get some. It was always positioned to be incremental. But as we look forward over the next two or three years, it’s happening. I would say that $200 million is reasonable number across the GE portfolio. And I would say in the power business, the area [ph] that we are getting them the most, one is selling them what’s called the steam turbine and this generates [ph] the bottoming cycle with the combined cycle gas, number one. Number two is selling more services to existing contracts we have. And the third of which is really as we start to think about of our three to five-year period, how we expand on the other OEM. So, I think right now, we feel pretty good about the revenue synergies; it’s starting to happen, I think it’s positioned to expand that. Julian Mitchell Within other OEM work, Alstom was somewhat unusual in the emphasis they placed on that type of activity; you know how good Alstom the biggest installed base in thermal power by a distance. So, is there a danger that as you try and get the other OEM book up, the industry and aftermarket gets dragged into some kind of price war on aftermarket? Steve Bolze Julian, I understand the concern. I would say a couple things, one of which is customers kind of while we have a certain portion of the world installed base with our customers, when you go to a customer, it could be a higher level. And I would say customers are pushing us to get involved with servicing on GE equipment, number one. Number two is not only did Alstom do it, and they had a very sizable business to do that, so do us. [Ph] So, it’s not like -- this is a capability that customers are looking for. But I would say that third thing is we are focused on a point of differentiation and it’s really going to be technology. So, how do you apply an AGP or and upgrades like thinking, not only the GE equipment and Alstom equipment, but anybody’s equipment. And there is a lot of our programmed investments that’s going and how we are able to do that. But, we want to have points of differentiation. And I think over time, you will see us be able to do that on even the higher technology on anybody’s installed base. What I would say is that we are expecting this to be a slower ramp up in some of our other business areas, because we got to make sure we do it right. It’s a $600 million business for us this year. Julian Mitchell Got it. And then, you touched on the more project type work that Alstom has brought. You have looked through the backlog that they brought for about a year now. How comfortable do you feel with the state of execution of that backlog and how has GE managed that transition to that EPC type activity? Steve Bolze We did an investor call on November last year. And we talked about when we closed, we had about 18 billion of the backlog. That is power but also grid, renewables et cetera. And about call out it, 25%, 30% of backlog is in power. I would say that the backlog in power has largely played out as expected. We knew everything -- not everything is perfect, but I would say, it’s largely played out as expected, number one. Number two is we brought and we built up a projects management process within GE. We hired a person in Colorado [ph] who did that for [Indiscernible] and put a big focus on this because we recognize there is risk. What I’d say is in power, we were concerned about the steam portfolio, some of the gas portfolio and extended scope but it’s largely played put as expected. And I would say, Julian, I would say, we’ve turned around and said this is now an added capability we have. Because when you bid some of these plant offering in the world, they want you to take more projects. Now, at the end of the day, not everybody wants to go as far as turnkey but to make it into a consortium or what’s the broader -- a credit package, but we see it right now -- it’s largely played out as expected and we’ve built the new capability in the Company. Julian Mitchell If you look at the -- you provided those maps on a typical gas, typical steam front and Alstom brought to you. Some of it, the equipment that broad includes things like boilers where I guess most of you in this room would probably assume the margin profile in the long run is lower OEM, so vis-à-vis a gas turbine. How does GE think about the very long run margin profile of power? Do you think that you will able to drag up those non-IGT product margins sort of same level as the IGT margins have been? Steve Bolze I would say this is our margin rates in aggregate in GE you saw on the charts where we’ve been around 20% for long time. If you look at boiler work, if you look at kind of steam work and things like that, it is a lower margin rate than gas, but it’s still good. Number two is what we worry. Having boilers as part of the GE portfolio, you do more of a total plant optimization. That’s why you saw the HUBCO example 4 points of efficiency. We could not have that if we just looked the gas turbine or machine turbine. [Ph] Same thing if we bid a new HA plant. The 62.2% at Exelon or at EDF is not where we started -- stopping, we’re keeping going. It’s giving us a really viewpoint into where we can increase our equipment business. I would say back to the margin rate of our total power business, we took a dip this year because Alstom came in. What we said out at synergies to improve it in services and gas, I think that’s happening. I think we’ll always be above the GE average because of scale, service portfolio, because of digital, we just got to run the right balance in the long-term. Julian Mitchell Okay. And I guess Jeff Immelt has talked firm-wide about this 50 bps plus gross margin improvement per year. If you strip out Alstom and you look at the base business, you had a headwind this year with HA, maybe $300 million or something EBIT hit; that goes away next year. So, should you be running at well above these things as 50 bps increase on the base business? Steve Bolze What I would is we -- the gross margin focus on the Company is one of the highest I’ve been in -- seeing in the Company since I’ve been here for 23 years. I would say, within power, Julian, you’re right, we did take a headwind this year with the HAs going through. We are seeing the units profitable in the third quarter but we are profitable as we look into total year. As we look at next year, we will see margin rate increase next year because of that. I would say listen, this is a big ongoing opportunity for us. A lot of it is -- the cost is in direct material, it’s sourcing. And I would say the other piece is I showed you on the chart some of the impacts we’re having on product costs on the HA. That is spreading out within the whole portfolio, steam, generators et cetera. So, I think we’ve got to work through some of the mix dynamics with services and equipment and Alstom and such. But given the focus on gross margin rate and product costs, you’ll definitely see an increase, because of the HA next year and then we just got to sort through the rates with mix. Julian Mitchell I don’t know if there are any questions in the audience. If not for now, one more from me would be around free cash conversion, it’s something people are sort endlessly fascinated by. In power specifically, where is that conversion roughly and maybe you can talk about Alstom because that’s sort of the headline number. And how much scope do you think there is for that cash conversion to improve? Steve Bolze I would say this, Jeff Bornstein our CFO said we’re at 85% of free cash flow conversion of the company, we power or below that. What’s driving that below that right now is one is a heavy investment cycle in the HA. One of that is also the restructuring we’re doing with Alstom. Those are two key drivers. Now, Jeff has also said that we’re trying to get to and we are committed to get 95% free cash flow conversion. We are a key part of getting there within the power business. The key tracks to get there, one, we are working through the restructuring. So, those are costs that do not repeat over time obviously. We get the benefits from that in cash conversion. Two of which is the HA investments start to come down. And I would say the third which is the backlog of new business. That’s how you get progress collections. And by the way, we talked about projects. Our backlog in our projects where business is now up close to over 40% this year. So we’re building backlog that gives you progress collections. So, it’s a combination of things but some of the headwinds go away restructuring HA, you get more cash and progress from backlog. And I’d say the last of which is this digital thread investment is getting us more line of sight between the order and the execution. And by the way a lot of the cash can be tied up in inventory or also in the supply chain with suppliers. And as we work cycle time, my counterpart in Alstom was Philippe Cochet, he is now driving productivity and global supply chain excellence in digital trends for the Company. So, those are the steps we have to walk through and will be a key part of the company to get to 95%. Julian Mitchell And on equipment manufacturing, you had -- the competitor is maybe a little bit behind on efficiency of steam and gas turbine in terms of efficiency rates. You’ve seen what’s the reaction on price or do you think price deflation has been pretty stable in recent years? Steve Bolze I would say is what we’re seeing is -- and we’ve discussed it when we go through our quarterly calls is we’re seeing it fairly stable right now. I think we’ve shown 1% to 1.5% of positive price for the last two, three quarters, that will move around on a little bit based on what on looks. But I would say it’s stable. You definitely need differentiation to drive price, and because there still is excess capacity in this. But we’re seeing a bit of -- we’re seeing stability, we’re seeing a little bit of left obviously, mostly driven by the HA. Julian Mitchell And water business is on the way out, where are we sort of in that sale process, expressions of interest? Steve Bolze To be clear, water is a good business and people recognize that. The interest in the water business has been very good. What I would say is it’s a business that is profitable; but it also is a business that we made a decision when we did Baker Hughes for capital allocation that it was better to sell the water business. It’s a good team; it’s a great platform but very good interest and it makes good EBITDA. So, I think it should be a good capital allocation move for GE; it will also be a good move for the business because at the end of the day, it also needed more scale to play in the market, it needed more scale. That’s where we were headed. And so, as we get the final proposal back, we can tell you little bit more about how that’s coming together. Julian Mitchell",

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nWASHINGTON -- General Electric and Google are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. For the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\"\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\"\nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\"\nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\"\nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\"\nOfficials from Google and Royal Caribbean didn't respond to requests for comment.\nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer.\nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue.\nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward.\nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island.\nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government.\nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased.\nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow.\nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba.\nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday.\nWrite to Carol E.

Note the lack of flash suppressor and three disked barrel cluster - 7.62x51mm NATO \nThe M134 Minigun is a six-barreled, electrically-driven rotary gun originally designed by General Electric. Essentially a miniaturized version of the 20mm M61 Vulcan chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, it was originally designed during the Vietnam War to provide a high-volume-of-fire weapon suitable for mounting on helicopters. Boasting a fire rate of up to 6,000 rounds per minute, the minigun proved far more capable than any single-barreled weapon in this role and, through numerous updates, remains in it to this day. \nA distinctive invention of fiction is the hand-held M134 minigun, a concept which was popularized by the film Predator . Physically demanding even for a slowed-down minigun firing blanks, such a weapon would be near impossible, and highly impractical for a human being to either carry or operate. This fact has not stopped it appearing frequently in other works, especially in video games. Generally such depictions will totally ignore the weapon's need for external power, and sometimes even forget it requires a source of ammunition. \nThe M134 Minigun and variants can be seen in the following films, television series, video games, and anime used by the following actors: Contents",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nThe 2016 operating results are important, but let's not forget that this company is going through a major transition. \nThe 2016 cash flow metrics are really not as bad as you might think. \nGE is a long-term buy. Let me start by saying that investors should stay up-to-date on a company's quarterly results, especially a company the size of General Electric (NYSE: GE ), because these three-month snapshots provide great insight into whether or not a company is on track to meet management's short- and long-term goals. However, I believe that some analysts are now placing too much emphasis on GE's 2016 quarterly results, especially the cash flow metrics, without first taking into consideration the company's restructuring efforts and the progress that has been made towards achieving management's long-term goal. I will expand on this topic throughout the article, but, in my opinion, this mindset is causing prospective investors to miss out on an opportunity to put money to work in a storied company that has great long-term business prospects in place. The 2016 Results, Not That Impressive But Does It Really Matter? GE has reported mixed results for the first three quarters of 2016, which has caused the company's stock price to underperform the broader market, S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), by a wide margin. GE Year to Date Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts For the most recent quarter, GE reported a top-line miss ($29.3b vs. $29.6b) but an EPS beat ($0.32 vs. $0.30). More importantly, management still expects for the company to achieve double-digit YoY operating earnings growth for full-year 2016 (now expects for operating EPS to be in the range of $1.48-$1.52 --narrowed from the previous estimate of $1.45-$1.55) and let's not forget that these \"new\" earnings will warrant a higher valuation due to the fact that over 90% is projected come from the industrial businesses (i.e. more consistent and less risky earnings). Another Seeking Alpha (\"SA\") author, Mr. Alessandro Pasetti , recently wrote a great article that detailed GE's 2016 operating results and covered the prospects of the company increasing its dividend later this year. After reading Mr. Pasetti's article, two things came to mind: (1) GE's revenue growth should be enough to please the company's long-term investor base and (2) the cash flow numbers are really not as bad as you might think. ( Full Disclosure: I would highly recommend for GE shareholders, and prospective investors, to read Mr. Pasetti's article). Revenue Growth Is The Key, For The Time Being Yes, we all want of our investments to be in companies that are able to always grow both the top-line and bottom-line numbers, but this is simply not reality; therefore, investors may have to be content with a company growing its top-line or its bottom-line during challenging times (or neither). This is currently the case for GE because earnings growth in 2016 has been hard to come by due to several factors (i.e. low commodity environment, macro concerns/uncertainty, major restructuring, selling financing assets, etc.). As such, GE reporting YoY revenue growth through September is great news, in my mind. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, GE reported an ~9% YoY increase in revenue. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3'16 10-Q --edited by author ) The Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare segments were the major contributors to the revenue growth over the first nine months of 2016, while, on the other hand, the revenue was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the Oil & Gas and Transportation segments. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3'16 Earnings Press Release ) The Transportation segment reported a slight decline in revenue (~$1b) but the Oil & Gas segment continued to experience significant headwinds and reported an ~$2.5b decline in revenue over the first nine months. The impact that the Oil & Gas segment has had on the company's consolidated results has already been well-covered here on SA (see this article for my thoughts), but it is important to note that GE was still able to \"squeak out\" almost double-digit revenue growth, even when one of its most-significant operating segments saw its revenue drop by over 20%. The Alstom ( OTCPK:ALSMY ) acquisition has contributed to the revenue growth, but the one thing that seems to be forgotten is the fact that GE has had to replace ~$30b in revenue from GE Capital. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3'14 10-Q --edited by author) GE has already sold ~$200b in financing assets so the company has made some significant progress in \"making up\" for the lost revenue in a few short years. So, earnings improvement/growth would be nice, but I am willing to look past the flat earnings as long as the company continues to show operational improvements and top-line growth because the earnings will eventually come, in my opinion. Moreover, GE has consistently met (or beat) the consensus earnings estimates over the last two years so the lack of earnings growth in 2016 should not [yet] be viewed as a concern. The Cash Flow Numbers, Not As Bad As You Might Think There have been at least two articles, including Mr. Pasetti's, over the last week that have highlighted that GE's operating cash flow figure is down significantly when compared to the prior year, as shown in the table below. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3'16 10-Q --edited by author ) The consolidated operating cash flow figure is indeed down big YoY, but I believe that the table below, which separates the industrial businesses from the financing businesses, provides more detail on the company's current state. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3'16 10-Q --edited by author ) The second table tells an entirely different story than the first table, in my opinion, but I do believe that there is a lot of noise in the numbers. As shown, GE Capital, and more specifically the cash used for discontinued operations, are causing the operating cash flow pressure. The kicker is the \"(Earnings) loss from continuing operations retained by GE Capital\" line item because this has had a material impact on operating cash flows for years. I believe Mr. Pasetti said it best \"certain operating cash flow items and adjustments that are virtually impossible to model accurately through to 2018\", when referring to the line item identified above. Investors should closely monitor this item going forward because it will be interesting to see where this number eventually settles once GE Capital, excluding the financing Verticals, is completely gone. There are a lot of moving pieces in GE's cash flow figures but this should be expected with the restructuring that the company is currently going through and this is the exact reason why I believe that investors need to take the current year cash flow numbers with a grain of salt. I am not recommending for investors to pay little or no attention to the cash flow metrics, but instead, let's remember to step back and take the numbers into context with what is really going on with the company. Bottom Line I have long stated that GE is a long-term investment and that the company's story will become clearer in 2018 , so I may be more willing than others to look past the current results due to my expectations. However, GE's results for each quarter of 2016 have shown that the company is progressing toward the more-industrial focused entity that it intends to be in 2018 and I believe that additional value is being created with the small tuck-in acquisitions that the company has made over the last twelve months. The 2016 operating results have not been great but the results have also not been terrible either. Management still expects for the company to reach $2.00 plus in operating EPS by 2018, so the long-term story appears to be intact. GE is trading at ~18x 2017E earnings and ~15x 2018E earnings, so long-term investors should treat any pullbacks as buying opportunities. We should get more color on fiscal 2017 when management provides the annual outlook on December 14, 2016. Stay tuned. Lastly, I fully expect for GE to raise its dividend later in December 2016 so investors may soon be getting paid more to wait for the company's long-term story to play out.

      "text": "White House Pushing Cuba on Deals for GE, Google By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nWASHINGTON — General Electric and Google are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three U.S. cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. For the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama’s policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama’s Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that “if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.”\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: “We continue to talk to Cuba and we’re in the middle of negotiations.”\nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is “in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.”\nShe added: “We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.”\nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises’ director of marketing, said: “We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.”\nOfficials from Google and Royal Caribbean didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nWrite to Carol E.

      "title": "Stocks to Watch Ahead of 3D-Printing Day (GE, HPQ)",
      "text": "Stocks to Watch Ahead of 3D-Printing Day (GE, HPQ) By Shoshanna Delventhal | December 2, 2016 — 11:32 AM EST \nOn Saturday, the world will celebrate 3D Printing Day, so named because Dec. 3 is the third (the 3) day in the only month starting in “D,” December, thus 3D Day. \nThis new “holiday” was in part popularized by General Electric Co. ( GE ), the industrial conglomerate making strides into the digital landscape via investments into emerging markets such as 3D printing for manufacturing. Here’s a list of some of the 3D printing stocks to watch going into 2017. Legacy Tech, Emerging Market: HP and GE \nAfter one year apart from its data-center and enterprise software arm, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. ( HPE ), PC and printing giant HP Inc. ( HPQ ) has attempted to reinvent itself by refocusing on core businesses. Waning demand in the PC and printing markets has been a blow to the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company’s bottom line. In order to boost printing revenues, which were down 14% in the fiscal third quarter and 8% in the most recent fiscal fourth quarter, HP Inc. has bolstered its position in the 3D-printing space. HP Inc.’s Multi Jet Fusion Technology is set to “reinvent how you prototype functional parts, delivering quality output, up to 10 times faster at half the cost.” \nGE announced plans to acquire to industrial-metal 3D-printing companies, Arcam and SLM Solutions, in deals worth a combined $1.4 billion. After the SLM buyout fell through, GE acquired Concept Laser to keep the firm on track with its goal to generate $1 billion in 3D-printing revenues by 2020. \nInstead of targeting the consumer market, HP Inc. and GE have worked to legitimize the viability of 3D printing for industrial manufacturing. (See also: Time to Invest in 3D Printing? ) 3D Printing Pioneers: Stratasys and 3D Systems \nWhile larger tech firm such as GE and HP Inc. have the benefit of big names and scale, Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and rival 3D Systems Inc. ( DDD ) maintain their pre-existing market share in the niche industry, along with their refined focus on solely 3D printing. The two have taken different strategies in the recent year, with 3D Systems deeming the consumer market dead, deciding to go all in with additive manufacturing, versus Stratasys’ continued push into both the consumer and industrial market. Rock Hill, SC-based 3D Systems stock, up 50% year-over-year (YOY) at a price of $13.47 per share on Friday morning reflects a $1.51 billion market cap. Rehovot, Israel and Eden Prairie, Minn.-headquartered company Stratasys stock, down 30% YOY at a price of $17.59 per share reflects a $925.2 million market cap. (See also: 3D Systems’ Growth Strategy Charges Ahead .) \nPrivate venture-capital backed Carbon is also positioned to be a big-time player, partnering with Ford Motor Co. ( F ) to develop 3D-printed prototypes for automobiles. Industry pioneers could be facing some challenges if larger tech players and Carbon succeed in launching speedier, lower-cost 3D printers for enterprise clients.

      "text": "Food We've Been Sold a Lie for Two Decades About Genetically Engineered Foods GE food has failed to achieve two of its primary objectives: higher crop yields and reduced pesticide use. Meanwhile, corporate profits have surged. \nMarch against Monsanto 2014-05-24 Photo Credit: Die Grünen Kärnten/Flickr CC [ Editor's note: The terms GE (genetic engineering) and GMO (genetically modified organism) are often used interchangeably, but their meanings are different. GMOs, which are produced when plant breeders select genetic traits that may also occur naturally, such as seedless watermelons and modern broccoli, have been around for centuries. The subject of much recent debate centers on GE foods, which have only been around in recent decades, and are produced by transferring genes between organisms. The resulting GE organisms—either plant-, or in the case of GE salmon, animal-based—would not otherwise occur in nature. This article is about GE foods .] In 1994, a tomato known as \"Flavr Savr\" became the first commercially grown genetically engineered food to be granted a license for human consumption. Scientists at the California-based company Calgene (which was scooped up by Monsanto a few years later) added a specific gene to a conventional tomato that interfered with the plant's production of a particular enzyme, making it more resistant to rotting. The tomato was given the all-clear by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Since then, both the United States and Canada have embraced the genetic engineering of food crops, while Europe has broadly rejected the use of such technology. Only five EU nations—the Czech Republic, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Spain—grow GE crops. And they do so in such minor amounts that all five countries make up less than 0.1 percent of GE cultivation worldwide. It appears that Europe has been right all along to renounce GE crops. An in-depth examination recently published by The New York Times found that GE crops have largely failed to achieve two of the technology's primary objectives: to increase crop yields and decrease pesticide use. Pesticides in particular have come under increasing fire in recent years, not only for their negative impact on human health and wildlife, but also for decimating populations of key food crop pollinators ; specifically, bees, which are responsible for pollinating a third of food crops. While consumer awareness of the effects of pesticides has grown, the ongoing battle over GE crops has largely zeroed in on whether or not such foods are safe to consume. But, as Times investigative reporter Danny Hakim points out in his article about the paper's analysis, \"the debate has missed a more basic problem \"—that GE crops have \"not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.\" Analyzing academic and industry research, as well as independent data, The Times compared results on the two continents and found that the \"United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields—food per acre—when measured against Western Europe.\" The paper also cited a recent National Academy of Sciences report that found \"little evidence that the introduction of GE crops were resulting in more rapid yearly increases in on-farm crop yields in the United States than had been seen prior to the use of GE crops.\" New York Times: Behind the times? For many farmers, researchers and activists, The Times' conclusion was not news. Ronnie Cummins, co-founder of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Minnesota, told AlterNet that the paper's analysis simply \"confirms what many of the world's best scientists have said for years: GE crops have benefitted no one except the corporations selling the chemicals required to grow them.\" \"I'm glad that the New York Times has now discovered what those of us in agriculture have known for twenty years, that the old and exaggerated claims of genetic engineering by Monsanto and their allies are bogus,\" Jim Gerritsen, an organic farmer, told AlterNet. \"They have not panned out and I'm glad that now the newspaper of record has made this clear to a lot of people,\" said Gerritsen, who has owned and run Wood Prairie Family Farm with his wife Megan in northern Maine for 40 years. \"A lot of us have been saying this for a long time.\" While it may not be news for many working towards a more sustainable food system, The Times story was unexpected. Andrew Kimbrell, the executive director of the Center for Food Safety, an environmental nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., told AlterNet that The Times' piece is \"a surprising ray of light illuminating the longstanding GE crops debate,\" noting that the paper \"for so many years had ignored the science about genetic engineering and bought the Big Lie\" that Monsanto and its cohorts have been telling the public for so long: \"that GE crops 'reduce pesticide use, increase yield and are key to feeding the world.'\" Seeing through Monsanto's propaganda These recent findings fly in the face of Monsanto's stated claim that \"the introduction of GM traits through biotechnology has led to increased yields.\" But the company is sticking to its guns. When shown The Times' findings, Robert T. Fraley, the company's chief technology officer, said the paper had selectively chosen the data in their analysis to put the industry in a bad light. “Every farmer is a smart businessperson, and a farmer is not going to pay for a technology if they don’t think it provides a major benefit,” said Fraley. “Biotech tools have clearly driven yield increases enormously .” On their website, Monsanto backs their claim by citing statistics reported by PG Economics, a U.K.-based agricultural industry consultancy. However, that firm that has been exposed as a corporate shill by Lobbywatch.org, a U.K.-based nonprofit that tracks deceptive PR practices. PG Economics has been commissioned to write reports on behalf of industry lobby group whose members include the \"Big Six\" agrichemical giants: BASF, Bayer, Dupont, Dow Chemical, Monsanto and Syngenta. \"Most of the yield advancement, since GE crops were first commercialized, is attributable to traditional breeding techniques, not the GE traits,\" Mark Kastel, co-founder of the Cornucopia Institute, a farm policy research group based in Wisconsin, told AlterNet. Kastel, who worked for several agribusiness giants, including International Harvester, J.I. Case and FMC, before making what he calls the \"paradigm shift to sustainable farming,\" said that since GE crops were introduced in the U.S., farmers have experienced boom-and-bust cycles and today are \"generally hurting,\" regardless of the scale of their farming operations. \"GE crops have not been a panacea for economic sustainability,\" he said. Instead, they have been a source of financial growth for the agrichemical industry. Kimbrell said that the Big Six \"make tens of billions of dollars in profits by selling ever more pesticides, especially herbicides. Why would they spend hundreds of millions of research dollars and then billions in advertising and lobbying to promote crops that actually 'reduce pesticides' and thereby destroy their bottom line? Are these companies committing economic suicide in an altruistic attempt to feed the world? Obviously not. You can accuse Monsanto of many things, including myriad corporate crimes over many decades, but altruism is not one of them. The vast majority of [genetically engineered crops] are not designed to decrease herbicide use, but to massively increase it.\" A toxic plague Hakim notes that, according to U.S. Geological Survey data, while insecticide use has actually fallen by a third since GE crops were introduced in the U.S. in the mid-1990s, herbicide use has exploded, growing by more than a fifth over that same period. French farmers, by contrast, have been able to reduce insecticide use by a far greater margin—65 percent—while decreasing herbicide use by more than a third. \"Although some insecticide use has been reduced, overall agrochemical applications have grown exponentially,\" said Kastel. American tomatoes may take longer to rot than their conventionally-grown European counterparts. It's a neat trick. But with GE tomatoes being one of the most pesticide-contaminated foods in the U.S. food supply—not to mention the fact they won't feed more people (there'll be a staggering 8.5 billion of us by 2030, 11.2 billion by 2100)—that's all the Flavr Savr is, a trick—and perhaps ultimately a dangerous one. While the real toll of industrialized GE agriculture on human and environmental health is hard to calculate, the track record is dismal. By some estimates, pesticides have killed an estimated 250 million bees in a just a few years. The New York Times reported that some commercial beekeepers have lost more than a third of their bees in 2013. Pesticides have also impacted populations of fish and amphibians. But it's not just wildlife that suffers. The general public is ingesting pesticides on a regular basis. Kastel notes that \"eaters are consuming copious amounts of biological insecticides built into the genome of corn,\" adding that \"the cumulative health impacts are unknown.\" People who live near GE crops have to contend with an additional health impact: \" pesticide drift ,\" agrichemicals blown into their communities by the wind. The heavy reliance on pesticides has started a vicious cycle, leading to the rise of pesticide-resistant superweeds. \"Weeds and insects are becoming resistant to the herbicides and genetic insecticides that are spliced into the plants,\" said Gerritsen. \"To combat resistance, some farmers are using a 'chemical cocktail' of multiple herbicides while biotech companies are introducing resistance to even more powerful and toxic chemicals.\" He estimates that there may be 60 to 80 million acres of farmland in the U.S. that have \"superweeds\" that have built up a resistance to RoundUp. Cummins said superweed resistance has forced farmers to \"use higher and higher amounts of increasingly dangerous poisons\" so that \"soils are eroded and degraded. Water is polluted. Foods are contaminated. And to what end?\" It may take years, even decades to fully understand the real ends, particularly the accidental by-products of industrialized agriculture. \"These chemicals are largely unknown,\" David Bellinger, a professor at the Harvard University School of Public Health, told The New York Times. His research has linked the loss of millions of I.Q. points among children 5 years old and younger in the U.S. to a single class of insecticides. \"We do natural experiments on a population,\" he said, referring to human exposure to agrichemicals, \"and wait until it shows up as bad.\" Activists of the world, unite Hakim also points out that \"profound differences over genetic engineering have split Americans and Europeans for decades,\" noting that anti-GE sentiment across the pond has been much more active, with Monsanto drawing the ire of thousands of protesters in cities like Paris and Basel, while GE opposition has been firmly established as a primary plank of the Green political movement. The prospect of a Monsanto-Bayer merger has only galvanized the opposition in Europe, even as activists recognize new and different kind of challenge ahead. Jan Perhke of the Coalition Against Bayer-Dangers, a German NGO, says that Bayer's diversification has made it a more difficult target than Monsanto, whose business is simple: GE seeds and pesticides. Monsanto, which has emerged as the primary worldwide target of the anti-GE movement, has been steeped in controversy recently, particularly since RoundUp's main ingredient glyphosate was deemed a \" probable carcinogen \" by the World Health Organization in 2015. \"We have tried to put the focus not only on Monsanto, and to let people know that behind Monsanto there are many agrochemical multinationals which are very big and also have very dangerous products ,\" Perhke told DW. There has been speculation that, if the merger goes through, Bayer will drop the Monsanto name, which would force activists to rebrand their campaigns. Many anti-GE activists can be found in Vermont, the first state to pass GMO-labeling legislation. In their 2016 report \" Vermont's GMO Addiction: Pesticides, Polluted Water, and Climate Destruction ,\" Regeneration Vermont, a nonprofit group that promotes regenerative agriculture, describes the terrible impact that chemical-based industrial agriculture has had on the state's economy and environment: The history of Vermont’s heavy adoption of industrial—or degenerative—forms of agriculture is also the history of its failure and decline. At every stage, beginning with chemical agriculture in the post-WWII era, the new techniques being promoted by the increasingly corporate and industrial agriculture came with mighty promises: Labor would be saved, yields would increase, bugs and insects would be eliminated, and pro ts would soar. Just get in line, and follow the edicts coming out of the USDA and the agricultural extension centers. But, more often than not, the promises were false—or short lived—while the damage was deep, most notably in the way further industrialization all but mandated the consolidation of Vermont’s farms. “Get big or get out” has been the dominant mantra in agriculture since the late 1950s. And it worked. Many did get big, but most got out. Vermont lost a staggering number of farmers as commodity dairy took over. More than 10,000 dairy farms were gone within a sixty-year period from the 1950s to today. … The true nature of GMO agriculture in Vermont today is a stark and dangerous difference from the promises of its corporate advocates. According to data collected by the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, pesticide use is up 39% and increasing rapidly while, at the same time, new pesticides are being added to the arsenal. Climate-threatening nitrogen fertilizers have been up about 17% per year in the decade of GMO’s rise to dominance (2002-2012) and climbing as our denuded soils require more and more inputs for high production. And the pollution to our climate, water and soil from these increases continues to rise, keeping us on a steady degenerative decline, environmentally, economically and culturally. Lining corporate coffers \"The great economic promise of genetically engineered crops has flowed, primarily, to bankers, suppliers and the biotechnology industry,\" said Kastel. \"Rather than improving the bottom line it enabled farmers to grow larger and automate crop production with fewer people involved.\" Those economic flows have benefitted the agrichemical industry greatly. Over the past 15 years, the combined market capitalizations of Monsanto and Syngenta have grown more than sixfold. And these companies are profiting on both ends. \"For Monsanto and the other chemical companies, genetically engineering crops is just another way to significantly increase profits,\" said Kimbrell. \"They sell the seeds and the poisons sprayed on those seeds. Great for their bottom line, terrible for the rest of us and the planet.\" If the mergers of Monsanto and Bayer on one side, and Syngenta and ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned agrichemical company, on the other, were to go through, the two newly-created behemoths would each have combined values to in excess of $100 billion—more than the GDP of over a hundred nations, including Puerto Rico, Kenya and Ukraine. Meanwhile, bees, who pollinate most of the food we eat (and all of our cotton), are dying in worrisome numbers, in part due to the increased use of neonicotinoids, a dangerous class of pesticides produced by Syngenta, Bayer and Dow Chemical, and commonly used on GE corn, soybean, canola and cereal, as well as many fruits and vegetables. But because bees do their work, or ecosystem services, for free, the estimated $15 billion in value that they give to society each year is not included in economic calculations. Is it too late? Even as crop yields have shown no improvement versus conventional methods, U.S. growers have increased their use of herbicides as they have converted key crops—including cotton, corn and soybean—to modified varieties. Meanwhile, American farmers have been overtaken by their counterparts in France, Europe's biggest agricultural producer, in the overall reduction of pesticides; i.e., both herbicides and insecticides. Is it too late for the U.S. and Canada to get off this ruinous track of industrialized agriculture? For advocates of sustainable agriculture, regenerative agriculture and agroecology—which seek to place farming within the context of natural ecosystems as opposed to objects of chemical-based production—the answer is a resounding yes. \"Research has shown that agroecologically based methods—such as organic fertilizers, crop rotation, and cover crops— can succeed in meeting our food needs while avoiding the harmful impacts of industrial agriculture,\" argues the Union for Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"As farmers incorporate these practices into their work, many benefits emerge: Less pollution. Healthier, more fertile soil that is less vulnerable to drought and flooding. A lighter impact on surrounding ecosystems, resulting in greater biodiversity. Reduced global warming impact. Less antibiotic and pesticide resistance.\" In fact, a 2015 global study conducted by researchers at Washington State University and published in the peer-reviewed Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences found that, despite lower yields, the profit margins for organic agriculture were significantly greater than conventional agriculture. Part of that increased profit margin may in fact come from not having to pay a premium for Monsanto's seeds and pesticides, a system that hasn't panned out as planned. \"Why would a farmer want to pay a premium for Roundup Ready soybeans if the Roundup is no longer working?\" Gerritsen says. \"What has been happening, widespread, is that farmers are going back to non-GE soybeans and growing them as they did before the Roundup Ready soybeans came in 20 years ago. Then, the best among them have figured out that there is a growing market worldwide for a non-GMO soybeans.\" He notes that some U.S. farmers raising conventionally grown, non-GMO soybeans have found competitive markets in Asia, where they receive a premium for their produce. An added benefit for these farmers is that they can save their seeds instead of having to buy them each season from Monsanto, which actually leases its seeds , as they have been regulated as intellectual property as opposed to being a part of the wealth of the commons, which seeds have been for thousands of years. But moving from industrial agriculture to organic farming isn't easy, especially when the transition period to get organic certification exposes growers to financial risk. The study's author's say that the impetus for change must come from policymakers, who should \" develop government policies that support conventional farmers converting to organic and other sustainable systems, especially during the transition period,\" a 36-month withdrawal period from the time a farmer last used an unapproved material, like a pesticide. But considering the powerful Big Ag lobby, getting policymakers to help farmers move to organic is a daunting task. Gerritsen acknowledges that \"it's hard to out-gun the tremendous resources of Monsanto and what basically amounts to a calculated propaganda effort to misrepresent reality, to gain position and dominance.\" He said that for farmers, \"it's a deck that has been stacked against them. Sadly, this is nothing new to agriculture. The history of agriculture's one where farmers who were spread out and independent by nature and by geography, have a hard time competing with the concentrated power structures within agriculture. This has gone on for 150 years. Only now, the accelerated rates of concentration is no more stark than in the seed industry. Just a small handful of companies now control the vast majority of world seed resources. Monsanto is chief among them.\" If regulators approve the $66 billion Bayer-Monsanto merger, the resulting corporation would have control of nearly a third of world's seed market and nearly a fourth of the pesticide market. \"In all probability one story, albeit a major one, is probably not enough to finally debunk Monsanto and friends’ Big Lie about GE crop technology,\" Kimbrell said about The Times' analysis. \"You will probably continue to see the common sense-defying claims for a while yet. But if as the Ancients said the truth is “like a lion—just let it loose.\" then maybe we can finally go past the already failed but still dangerous GE experiment and move to an ecological agriculture that really will reduce and eventually eliminate pesticides and provide a secure sustainable food future for us all.\" Whether or not the U.S. and Canada will move towards a more sustainable agricultural model remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: The 20-year-old experiment with genetically engineered crops has proven to be a false promise, suggesting that the creation of completely new organisms is better left in the hands of Mother Nature, not scientists in laboratories. \n\"When you begin to genetically engineer organisms by mixing plant and animal genes, you now have the ability to alter ecosystems, which can have unintended consequences,\" Robert Colangelo, founding farmer and CEO of Green Sense Farms, America's largest network of commercial and sustainable indoor vertical farms, told AlterNet. \"Mankind does not have a good track record when it tries to alter nature.\" \nReynard Loki is AlterNet's environment and food editor.

      "text": "- Published: 11:55 PM, December 4, 2016 \nThe passage of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, which allows for a reserved Presidential Election for racial minorities, has set a precedent (“EP changes passed after marathon debate”; Nov 10). \nLogically, this principle of a reserved contest could be extended to the General Election too. \nAlthough the Group Representation Constituency system provides a mechanism for ensuring minority representation, it has led to the impression that some candidates may have been elected by riding on the coat-tails of the political heavyweights in their team. \nAn alternative is to consider converting all constituencies into single member constituencies. Based on the percentage of minorities in the population, a corresponding fraction of constituencies can then be assigned to be contested only by minority candidates. \nThis arrangement for the GE, as with the coming Presidential Election, may encourage more minority candidates to step forward. \nWith minorities representing approximately a quarter of the population, this would potentially give each constituency an opportunity to be served by a minority Member of Parliament once every four elections. \nOver time, this would help engender greater trust in and appreciation of our MPs and fellow Singaporeans, regardless of their race.",

      "text": "GE, ADM among JPMorgan's stocks to short in 2017 (Seeking Alpha) \nThe OPEC deal may have finally marked a buying opportunity in oilfield service stocks after a multi-year slump in the global oil market. Bernstein analyst Colin Davies now has a positive outlook for North American oil field services stocks and has initiated coverage on nine of the biggest names in the space. According to Davies, stock selection remains important. He sees the recovery playing out in two distinct phases. Stock Selection And Recovery \n“We believe the recovery will spread more rapidly than consensus, beyond the favored plays such as Permian, to shallow/mid water and near field environments and eventually deepwater ,” he explained. \nBernstein is bullish on oil prices following the OPEC production cut and is calling for Brent crude to reach $60/bbl by Q3 2017, $70/bbl by 2018 and $80/bbl by 2019. 9 In Focus \nThe firm has initiated the following ratings and price targets: Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI ): Market Perform, price target $65.

      "text": "Dec 5, 2016 at 7:15 AM The Supreme Court Tackles The Political Riddle Of Race-Based Gerrymandering Facebook \nEvery 10 years, after the census is complete, legislators in statehouses across the country embark on a time-honored tradition: remapping the boundaries of their states’ voting districts, usually to the benefit of the people doing the remapping. Gerrymandering, the practice of painstakingly engineering districts to bestow an advantage on the politicians in control of the process, has been baked into the American political process since the 18th century — and legal challenges to the weird-looking maps that result have their own long history, too. \nBut not all gerrymanders are created equal, at least from a legal perspective. On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two gerrymandering cases, in which the plaintiffs claim that after the 2010 census, Republican legislators in North Carolina and both parties in Virginia deliberately packed black voters into a small number of congressional and state legislative districts. The plaintiffs in the two cases, McCrory v. Harris (North Carolina) and Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections (Virginia), claim that by concentrating black voters in a few districts in an effort to protect their majorities, legislators unfairly diluted black voters’ influence. The legislators, on the other hand, say they are merely complying with the Voting Rights Act, which requires states to create districts where minority voters can select their preferred candidate. The question at the heart of these cases is a political riddle: How much mandated racial gerrymandering is too much racial gerrymandering? More Politics \nIn 2011, Republican legislators in North Carolina increased the percentage of black voters in the two congressional districts designed to comply with the Voting Rights Act to just above 50 percent. Both parties in Virginia increased the percentage of black voters needed for 12 state legislative districts to at least 55 percent. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School, says that from a legal perspective, North Carolina and Virginia made a mistake when they created mechanical quotas for these districts. “The states are saying, ‘The Voting Rights Act made us do it,’ but the Supreme Court has said in the past that these kinds of crude mechanisms aren’t required,” he said. But in its decision, the Supreme Court could help state legislators struggling to draw lines that comply with the Voting Rights Act without running afoul of the Constitution. \n“It’s very hard to come up with a magic number that satisfies the statute and the Constitution,” said Nathaniel Persily, an election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School. The Supreme Court has ruled that in geographically compact places with large minority populations and high levels of racial polarization in voting, legislators must draw districts that ensure these groups are able to elect candidates to represent their interests. But districts that are drawn only with race in mind can also violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. \nCourts have been wrangling with the states for years about the appropriate ways to draw these boundaries. Partisan gerrymandering has largely been ruled acceptable, with the notable exception of a federal court ruling in Wisconsin in November. That’s left racial gerrymandering as the battleground. \nThe political ramifications of these two racial gerrymandering cases could be significant, because when it comes to voting rights, race and politics are hopelessly intertwined. The Voting Rights Act was designed to stamp out a practice, common in the South at the time, of spreading black voters too thinly among districts, where their votes would be overwhelmed by the white majority. But critics allege that Republican legislators, after sweeping statehouses across the South in 2010, are perverting the intention of the Voting Rights Act to suit their political ends. \nThere’s a reason, Stephanopoulos says, why the cases are being led by Democratic Party lawyer Marc Elias. Just as in the 1990s, Republicans fought back against Democrats’ efforts to create more minority-controlled districts, the Democrats are now using the racial gerrymandering claim to try to stop Republicans from compressing black voters — who reliably vote Democratic — into a small number of districts, a move that could lead to fewer minority legislators. \nPartisan battles aside, political scientists say that in order for the government to pay attention to minority communities, those districts need representatives who are accountable to them. Christian Grose, an associate professor of political science at the University of Southern California, studied congressional districts in the South and found that black legislators were likelier than white legislators — regardless of party — to allocate federal funding to historically black universities and heavily black communities. Another political scientist, Bernard Fraga, found that voter turnout was higher in more heavily minority districts, which also meant more minority elected officials. According to another unpublished 1 analysis, the overwhelming majority of minority legislators are elected from majority-minority districts; in 2015, 95 percent of all African-American state house representatives in the South were elected from majority-minority districts. \nThe catch is that to ensure legislators bring benefits to their communities, it’s not enough simply to elect more of the politicians minorities prefer — Fraga said the elections also need to be competitive. In a district that is 60 percent African-American, for example, an incumbent might reliably sail to victory each election season, without needing to work for her constituency’s votes. 2 \nPolitical scientists say that there are ways to evaluate whether a district packed with a majority of minority voters is really necessary under the Voting Rights Act — states just need to be willing to use them. David Lublin, a political science professor at American University, says that legislators should draw on sophisticated methods to help estimate the share of minority voters needed to elect their preferred candidate — which will inevitably vary according to the local context. (The local context can also change in any election, which is one limitation of these methods.) In states such as Virginia, where 37 percent of white voters cast a ballot for Barack Obama in 2012, the need for majority-minority districts may not be as great, because enough white liberal voters might be willing to vote for the candidate who minority voters also prefer. In Mississippi, on the other hand, where only 10 percent of whites voted for Obama in 2012, a solid majority of black voters could be very necessary to get a minority-preferred candidate elected. \nOther redistricting experts are urging the court to cast a skeptical eye not just on the data, but on the political context. North Carolina’s legislators are defending their actions in one of the two contested congressional districts by claiming that they were packing black voters because of their party affiliation, not their race. In an amicus brief, attorneys for NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice argued that the state’s political climate in the aftermath of the 2010 election undercuts this claim. “The legislature was cutting back early voting and doing other things that specifically disadvantaged African-Americans, which suggests that there was a real racial motivation in creating this district,” said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center. \nIf the Supreme Court rules against North Carolina or Virginia, the consequences would likely favor the Democrats. Last week, in another case , a federal district court ordered special elections for 28 additional North Carolina House and Senate districts using new legislative maps, saying that the original districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. When the ruling comes down sometime next year, the effect in these Supreme Court cases wouldn’t necessarily be immediate: Virginia’s map might not be redrawn in time for the next wave of state elections, in 2017. But advocates of more sweeping reform hope that cases like these will make the courts rethink whether it’s a good idea to allow incumbents of either party to maintain control of redistricting, or whether that task should go to people whose jobs don’t depend on the outcome. Footnotes The analysis is an update to a 2009 article by political scientists David Lublin, Thomas Brunell, Lisa Handley and Bernard Grofman. Fraga said it’s also important to pay attention to the amount of influence minority voters can wield in primary elections, but Grose added that because states’ rules for primaries vary, it’s more difficult for federal courts to establish guidelines for state legislators to use. \nAmelia Thomson-DeVeaux is a writer and reporter living in Washington, D.C. @ameliatd",

NXP is committed to finding and developing the best talent; talent that is not afraid of taking absolute personal responsibility; talent that will lead us to even greater levels of success. With 45,000 people in 35 countries collaborating intensively at every level NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) has a reputation for quality and excellence among engineers and customers alike. NXP continues to be the employer of choice for a growing number of industry-leading talent.Smart Antenna Solutions, RF Integration without compromise With 2B+ consumers coming online and over 50B connected devices, there is a massively growing demand for always-on connected devices. Consumers are also putting ever more pressure on wireless communications systems in terms of performance and reliability. For example, we don’t want our mobile signal to drop out in the middle of a call, or struggle with a slow internet connection, or have to wait to find a GPS signal when travelling. Many of today’s devices are addressing these challenges by moving to Active Antenna Systems, with their ability to handle Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) requirements. However, this adds even more complexity to the RF front-end, in addition to the ever-shrinking available footprint. And many existing solutions lead to too much compromise when it comes to getting the right balance of performance, reliability, flexibility, integration ease and cost-of-ownership. NXP has long been a key innovator in RF process and product technologies. In comparison to other process technologies, our SiGe:C QUBiC technology provides the highest level of integration without compromise. It enables the entire RF front end to be integrated onto a single IC while still delivering exceptional RF performance and lowest total cost-of-ownership. In fact, as we see the further repartitioning of RF and media functions in mobile phones and other connectivity applications to address consumer demands, NXP will continue to help our customers achieve even more Integration Without Compromise.

Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. The one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. Executives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector. The plant in Sroda Slaska , in the southwest, is to test and repair engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. Under communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies. Today's Deals",

Czarek Sokolowski AP Photo 1 of 2   WARSAW, Poland \nLufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday. \nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. \nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation. \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. \nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies. Related content",

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) \nWARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday. \nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. \nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential.

It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies. Tags",

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) . . Video Buy AP Photo Reprints WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. The one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. Executives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. The plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. Under communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.",

      "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday.\nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures.\nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies.\nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines.\nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland.\n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation.\nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential.\n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said.\nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.",

      "text": "Summary \nGE's Q3 industrial revenue rose 7% Y/Y. Organic growth was only 1%. \nSegment profit from industrial fell 7%. Predicting revenue and profit is difficult. GE's operations appear to be a black box. \nGE Capital provided a steady earnings stream that offset industrial's cyclicality. GE Capital is being shuttered. \nAt 27x earnings GE is a sell. Click to enlarge GE CEO Jeff Immelt. Source: Forbes General Electric (NYSE: GE ) has gone through a period of major upheaval. It has sold off it Appliances division because it did not meet the company's return hurdle. It also shuttering GE Capital -- its financing arm. What remains seems like a hodge podge of cyclical businesses. I believe GE is a sell for the following reasons: Anemic Growth The company's core industrial segment grew revenue Y/Y by 7% in Q3. That followed a 7% growth in the previous quarter. This is anemic for a former growth company like GE. The performance comes after trillions in stimulus efforts by central banks around the globe. In my opinion, low interest rates alone cannot drive manufacturing growth. The data is bearing this out. In October industrial production fell 4.2% from September to October. Over the past 10 years industrial production peaked in November 2014, just after the government finished its QE program. Sans QE industrial production, and GE's prospects, could be bleak. Six of the company's operating segments experienced revenue growth. Oil & Gas and Transportation were pariah's again. However, the company's organic growth was nonexistent. Orders were up 16%, but organic orders fell 6%. Excluding the Alstom acquisition organic revenue growth was only 1%; management is quick to point out that ex-Oil & Gas, organic growth would have been 6%. Acquisitions have always been a part of GE's core competency, but until the company can grow organically it is difficult to defend the stock. GE Remains Opaque I have tried to explain GE as a big industrial company that has been hurt by exposure to Transportation and Oil & Gas. The company might have solved its energy problems by merging it with Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ). The merger is expected to help GE add scale in the segment, ignite growth and generate over $1 billion in cost synergies. The cost synergies could improve margins and get returns on investment up to the company's internal expectations. That said, GE's earnings remain rather opaque. For the life of me I cannot explain how the company actually makes money. Despite the 7% growth in Industrial revenue, segment profit fell 7%; this follows a 5% decline in Q2. I assumed that top line growth would lead to margin expansion and profit growth. Four of the eight business segments -- Oil & Gas, Power, Energy Connections and Transportation -- experienced a decline in segment profit. I could not predict the company's earnings, or describe key drivers of earnings growth. GE's business model and its earnings remain a black box in that respect. The company has nearly $11 billion in cash and has generated year-to-date cash flow (excluding deal taxes) of $4.3 billion. Management has the capital to continue to invest in digital solutions and find the next growth market; at least that's what the investment thesis says. However, after management's foray into Oil & Gas I would not trust the company with my capital. Its 27x p/e multiple is also too expensive for the lack of earnings growth the company has exhibited. I would rather management produce growth prior to awarding the stock a robust multiple. Takeaway The steadiness of GE Capital provided a hedge against the potential lows created by GE's industrial segment. That hedge is now gone. Not only is the industrial segment demonstrating anemic growth, but it's earnings and key drivers are clear as mud. Sell GE. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.   it.   About this article:",

      "text": "By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday.\nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures.\nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies.\nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines.\nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland.\n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation.\nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential.\n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said.\nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.\n ",

He said it was a major project for Poland's economy. \nCompany executives said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and good location. \nThe plant in the Special Economic Zone near Legnica, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines. It will create hundreds of jobs and train new personnel. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

      "text": "Published on December 5th, 2016 | by Saurabh Mahapatra 0 \nDecember 5th, 2016 by Saurabh Mahapatra Originally published on CleanTechies . General Electric has become the latest foreign company to jump on the solar power bandwagon in Nigeria. According to media reports , General Electric has signed a memorandum of understanding with Nigeria to set up five solar power projects of 100 MW capacity each in the west African country. These projects will come up in the states of Borno, Kebbi, Nassarawa, Niger, and Taraba. Over the last few months, several foreign companies have either directly or in partnership with local firms signed agreements to set up large-scale solar power projects in Nigeria. In July, Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) signed the first power purchase agreements with solar power project developers. The NBET signed 12 PPAs with projects of 975 MW cumulative capacity. The developers will sell power from these projects at US¢11.5/kWh for a period of 20 years. A joint venture between Nigeria-based Nigus Greenergy and South Africa-based Volt Renewables signed an agreement to set up 300 MW of solar power capacity. Paris-based investment company GreenWish Partners and Dubai-based Phanes Group separately signed deals to install 100 MW and 300 MW solar power capacity, respectively. The development of solar power projects in Nigeria has the full support and regulatory backing of the government. Last year, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission approved feed-in tariff regulations for renewable energy sourced electricity. As per the provisions of the regulations, electricity distribution companies will be required to source at least 50% of their total procurement from renewable energy sources. The Commission has also mandated that the balance of 50% of the electricity would have to be sourced from Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company. Reprinted with permission.  ",

      "text": "SHARES Getty Images A Boeing employee drives a lift near a GE engine for a Boeing 777 airliner at the Boeing factory in Everett, Wash. \nDespite some global trade uncertainties created as a result of the U.S. election, Fitch Ratings boosted its overall outlook of the aerospace and defense industry to positive from stable on Monday. \nStill, Fitch said there are global trade risks ahead that could hurt commercial aerospace companies. Analysts have suggested that President-elect Donald Trump's talk about tougher trade policies with China, in particular, could impact some aircraft buying overseas. \n\"Revised trade policies emerging from the recent U.S. election could negatively affect the competitiveness of North American commercial aerospace companies,\" Fitch said in its 2017 Outlook: Global Aerospace & Defense report. \"More restrictive trade policies could also disrupt the global aerospace supply chain.\" \nOverall, the rating agency said it expects the stable outlook is justified given positive trends within aerospace and defense segments \"offsets political risks, new aircraft program ramp-ups and business jet sector weakness.\" \nOn the large commercial aircraft side, the ratings agency said the number of aircraft from Boeing and Airbus is expected to rise about 8 percent next year and grow by 4 percent in 2018. It also sees global airline passenger traffic trends supporting the positive trends as well as industry forecasts for improved global airline profits due to continued low fuel costs. \nFitch also observed there is additional political risk from the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank, which Boeing's commercial airplanes business and other manufacturers depend on for financing international customers. \n\"The future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) is another development to watch, as shutting the Ex-Im bank could negatively affect the competitiveness of U.S.-based aerospace manufacturers,\" said Fitch. \nSome lawmakers consider the Ex-Im Bank, which provided financing for just over 10 percent of Boeing's aircraft sales in 2015, a form of corporate welfare and would like to eliminate it. That said, backers of the financial institution say if that happens U.S. companies with international sales could potentially find themselves at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. \nAccording to Fitch, Airbus and Boeing combined had 12,345 aircraft on their order books as of October 2016, which it said was roughly equivalent to eight years' worth of deliveries. The total value of those orders was as much as $875 billion. \nAlthough the ratings agency didn't mention it, some industry analysts also have pointed to potential risk from higher interest rates that they believe could result in some airlines slowing their aircraft replacement buying programs. \nFor 2017 alone, Fitch estimated that around $120 billion to $125 billion in global financing would be needed for new commercial aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. \nMeantime, on the defense side Fitch said it sees 3 percent to 5 percent spending growth on a global basis over the next three years. It projected that the U.S. budget accounts for 45 percent to 50 percent of the total defense market, but added that the growth domestically is less than the international market. \nFitch said it expects the results of the U.S. elections could result in \"upside\" potential for U.S. military spending and more business for defense companies. \nAs reported, President-elect Trump has promised to increase the number of U.S. Navy ships and add more aircraft to the military. Also, he has pledged to boost the number of U.S. troops, which has been seen as a positive for both ammunition companies and missile manufacturers. \n\"Cost overruns or delays on new programs are risks to the outlook in both the commercial and defense sectors,\" Fitch said. \"On the defense side, risks include the budget cap overhang in the U.S., additional continuing resolutions and political disruptions.\"",

      "title": "New GE Analysis: Software and Hardware Upgrades Could Cut Global CO2 Emissions from Coal and Gas Power Plants by One Billion Metric Tons",
      "text": "Blog This \nGE today released a first-of-its-kind analysis of global power plants, which found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the world’s fleet of coal and gas plants can be reduced by 10 percent – the equivalent of removing 95 percent of cars off U.S. roads – when existing hardware and software solutions are fully applied. The analysis is the first to quantify the emission reductions of using existing technologies to upgrade the global fleet of coal and gas-based power plants. \n“The technology to make coal and gas more efficient is available now – countries and companies alike should be taking advantage of this to lower their carbon output,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. “These actions should be taken as a complement to continued investment in renewable energy sources as we all strive to find carbon reductions across the energy mix.” \nGE used a proprietary set of data for each coal and gas-fired plant in the world to uncover potential opportunities to improve plants’ heat rate and lower carbon emissions. The analysis comes as countries around the world are looking for climate saving solutions that will help them transition to a lower carbon energy future. \nPotential for Coal Plant Upgrades Coal power plants could be made approximately 4 percent more efficient with 2.5 percent in efficiencies coming from turbine and boiler upgrades, and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. The analysis also found that applying all potential upgrades to coal power plants can remove 900 million metric tons of CO2 (11 percent of total coal power emissions) – more than the annual CO2 output of the United Kingdom and France combined. China (296 MT) and India (143 MT) are two countries with big opportunities in the coal power sector. \nPotential for Gas Power Plant Upgrades Similarly, GE’s analysis estimates that gas-fired power plants could be made approximately 3.3 percent more efficient with 1.8 percent coming from hardware upgrades and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. These savings could reduce global gas power emissions by 203 metric tons or 8.8 percent. Russia (45 MT) and the U.S. (34) are two countries with big opportunities in the gas power sector. \n“Our goal is to provide technology solutions that best meet the needs of our customers and help reduce emissions,” said Paul McElhinney, president & CEO, GE Power Services. “Globally, carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired electricity generation can be reduced by 10 percent annually, and GE’s software and hardware upgrade solutions can help make this a reality with moderate investments in the installed base.” \nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 41 percent of global electricity generation comes from coal-fired power plants and 22 percent comes from gas-fired power plants. The IEA estimates that both fuels will see increased use over the next decade. For markets with significant energy needs and coal reliance, like China and India, upgrades to power plants can help provide cleaner energy options and help countries make progress towards their climate goals. With natural gas playing an increasingly important role in many markets around the world, there is also great opportunity to ensure that it too is being utilized as efficiently as possible. \nIn response to the findings, GE has set up a dedicated team to provide customers with holistic software, hardware and financing solutions for coal plant upgrades. \nAdditional findings from GE’s Global Power Plant Analysis include: Upgrades to the entire global coal fleet can save 494 million tons of fuel globally on an annual basis. In the European Union – where there is a goal to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 – these solutions can help drive efficiencies from coal reliant countries like Poland where coal accounts for 80 percent of electricity generation. In Africa, South Africa has the biggest opportunity for fuel and carbon savings (23 MT) coming upgrades in the coal power sector. \nTo learn more about GE’s Global Power Plant Analysis , visit http://www.gereports.com/ge-power-plant . \nAbout GE \nGE (NYSE:GE) is the world’s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive.

      "text": "  Lufthansa, GE invest in aircraft engine plant in Poland By Monika Scislowska   6, 2016 - 6:33am Poland's Deputy Prime Minister for economy, Mateusz Morawiecki announces Monday, Dec. 5, 2016 during a news conference in Warsaw, Poland, a major joint investment of some 250 million euros by Lufthansa and General Electric to build an advanced plant in southwestern Poland that will service engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets, starting in Sept. 2018. (AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) \nWARSAW — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said yesterday. \nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. \nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the US General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation.   \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. \nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.",

      "title": "New GE Analysis: Software and Hardware Upgrades Could Cut Global CO2 Emissions from Coal and Gas Power Plants by One Billion Metric Tons",
      "text": "SCHENECTADY, N.Y.- GE today released a first-of-its-kind analysis of global power plants, which found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the world’s fleet of coal and gas plants can be reduced by 10 percent – the equivalent of removing 95 percent of cars off U.S. roads – when existing hardware and software solutions are fully applied. The analysis is the first to quantify the emission reductions of using existing technologies to upgrade the global fleet of coal and gas-based power plants.\n“The technology to make coal and gas more efficient is available now – countries and companies alike should be taking advantage of this to lower their carbon output,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. “These actions should be taken as a complement to continued investment in renewable energy sources as we all strive to find carbon reductions across the energy mix.”\nGE used a proprietary set of data for each coal and gas-fired plant in the world to uncover potential opportunities to improve plants’ heat rate and lower carbon emissions. The analysis comes as countries around the world are looking for climate saving solutions that will help them transition to a lower carbon energy future.\nPotential for Coal Plant Upgrades\nCoal power plants could be made approximately 4 percent more efficient with 2.5 percent in efficiencies coming from turbine and boiler upgrades, and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. The analysis also found that applying all potential upgrades to coal power plants can remove 900 million metric tons of CO2 (11 percent of total coal power emissions) – more than the annual CO2 output of the United Kingdom and France combined. China (296 MT) and India (143 MT) are two countries with big opportunities in the coal power sector. Potential for Gas Power Plant Upgrades\nSimilarly, GE’s analysis estimates that gas-fired power plants could be made approximately 3.3 percent more efficient with 1.8 percent coming from hardware upgrades and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. These savings could reduce global gas power emissions by 203 metric tons or 8.8 percent. Russia (45 MT) and the U.S. (34) are two countries with big opportunities in the gas power sector. “Our goal is to provide technology solutions that best meet the needs of our customers and help reduce emissions,” said Paul McElhinney, president & CEO, GE Power Services. “Globally, carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired electricity generation can be reduced by 10 percent annually, and GE’s software and hardware upgrade solutions can help make this a reality with moderate investments in the installed base.”\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 41 percent of global electricity generation comes from coal-fired power plants and 22 percent comes from gas-fired power plants. The IEA estimates that both fuels will see increased use over the next decade. For markets with significant energy needs and coal reliance, like China and India, upgrades to power plants can help provide cleaner energy options and help countries make progress towards their climate goals. With natural gas playing an increasingly important role in many markets around the world, there is also great opportunity to ensure that it too is being utilized as efficiently as possible.\nIn response to the findings, GE has set up a dedicated team to provide customers with holistic software, hardware and financing solutions for coal plant upgrades.\nAdditional findings from GE’s Global Power Plant Analysis include:\nUpgrades to the entire global coal fleet can save 494 million tons of fuel globally on an annual basis. In the European Union – where there is a goal to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 – these solutions can help drive efficiencies from coal reliant countries like Poland where coal accounts for 80 percent of electricity generation. In Africa, South Africa has the biggest opportunity for fuel and carbon savings (23 MT) coming upgrades in the coal power sector.

      "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday.\nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures.\nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies.\nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines.\nThe plant in Sroda Slaska , in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland.\n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem , senior executive at GE Aviation .\nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential.\n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said.\nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.",
