      "text": "Just this month, Pfizer pledged a “major” commitment to humanitarian programs after a charity rejected its donation offer for 1 million free Prevenar 13 doses. But now, experts argue in The BMJ that the global health community shouldn’t continue to rely on “random acts of charity” in vaccine pricing.\nAuthors Els Torreele and Mariana Mazzucato didn’t mince words in their editorial , writing that the health community has seen an “unacceptable commodification of human lives by drug companies using monopoly pricing power to determine who lives and who dies.” Torreele serves as director of access to medicines, innovation and accountability at Open Society Foundations, while Mazzucato is an economics professor at the University of Sussex.\nInstead of the status quo, they argued, vaccine pricing should be transparent and take into account tax-funded research contributions while weighing manufacturing expenses and public health need.\nThe authors said the pneumonia vaccines from Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline “are likely to cost less than a dollar to produce,” and can be sold at $120 to $160 per dose in wealthy countries. Immunization requires at least three doses.\nPfizer’s Prevenar family is the best-selling vaccine franchise in the world, pulling in more than $6 billion in sales last year. Synflorix contributed $476 million to GSK’s top line in 2015.\nA Pfizer spokesperson told FiercePharma the pharma company works \"with a range of local and global partners, including governments, healthcare experts, and civil society organizations to address the most pressing unmet medical needs and determine the most effective way for a donation to meet the needs of affected communities.\"\nIn rejecting Pfizer’s donation offer back in October, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said “free is not always better” and that donations can delay vaccination campaigns and “undermine long-term efforts to increase access.”\nAt the time, Pfizer said it “strongly disagrees” with MSF’s position, adding that “donations play a crucial role in addressing humanitarian crises around the world.”\nOne month later, the company announced a longer-term arrangement, offering to price its vaccines at the “lowest prevailing global” cost for humanitarian emergencies. For the first year, it’ll donate all proceeds to “groups undertaking the difficult work of reaching vulnerable populations in emergency settings,” according to a statement . To get the program started, it'll donate some Prevenar doses.\nTiered pricing\nMSF celebrated the move after years of lobbying for lower prices and making arguments similar to those voiced by Torreele and Mazzucato in The BMJ. For one, the editorial points out “price discrimination” in the industry that allows providers to charge customers “differently depending on their ability or willingness to pay.”\nIt’s “controversial for any type of good,” but in the realm of public health, it’s an “extremely serious” matter, the authors contend.\nPfizer's spokesperson said on Tuesday that \"tiered pricing has the potential to significantly improve access to vaccines in emerging markets, while preserving the incentives for investment in innovation and new vaccine development.\" The approach is used in \"many industries\" and is supported by Gavi, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Nations, the company contends.\nThe pharma's humanitarian pledge followed another by GlaxoSmithKline, which markets the pneumococcal vaccine Synflorix. GSK said in September that it’ll supply the vaccine to nongovernmental organizations at $3.05 per dose so that displaced children can be protected.\n\"Through this new pledge, we hope to provide consistency and stability for those delivering healthcare to some of our most vulnerable communities,\" GSK CEO Andrew Witty said in a statement at the time.\nPneumonia kills 1 million children each year, and only 37% of the world’s children are being immunized with the vaccines, the BMJ authors report.\nEditor's note: This story was updated with a statement from a Pfizer spokesperson.",

      "text": "Pfizer Shares Gain After Upgrade (PFE) By Michael Kramer | November 29, 2016 — 11:00 AM EST \nShares of Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ) are receiving a boost this morning after it received two good pieces of news. The first part came in a press release today regarding its drug Avelumab, for the treatment of Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma. Pfizer in partnership with EMD Serono Inc., a part of Merck KGaA of Germany, announced the FDA had accepted Avelumab's Biologics License Application (BLA) for priority review. The FDA's priority review will reduce the review period to 6 months from 10 months. \nAdditionally, according to theflyonthewall.com, Pfizer is trading higher, after the stock received an upgrade this morning from analyst Geoff Meacham of Barclays to Overweight from Equal-weight. He also raised his price target to $38 from $37. The analyst noted his belief the company would be able to get greater use of its cash that is held overseas under a Trump administration. He believes this money could be used to acquire growth assets or return additional capital to shareholders. \nShares of Pfiezer have been under pressure since the beginning of August following their second quarter 2016 results, which failed to dazzle investors. (See also: Pfizer's Q2 Earnings, Revenue Beat Not Good Enough .) FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nAs the shares are currently trading around $31 and sit near their 52-week low of $28. Shares are currently trading at a 12x Forward P/E and a dividend yield of nearly 3.8%. Analysts expect PFE to earn $2.42 in the current Fiscal Year and $2.61 per share next year, offering an attractive near 8% growth rate.

      "text": "Follow For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – November 28, 2016 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) ( NYSE: PFE – Free Report ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) ( NASDAQ: MSFT – Free Report ), Priceline ( NASDAQ: PCLN – Free Report ), Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ) ( NASDAQ: EXPE – Free Report ) and United Continental ( NYSE: UAL – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: Top Research Reports for Today Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Pfizer ( NYSE: PFE – Free Report ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT – Free Report ) and Priceline ( NASDAQ: PCLN – Free Report ). Pfizer ’s shares have been showing some weakness recently. Pfizer’s third quarter results missed expectations for both sales and earnings. But the analyst emphasizes that Pfizer is strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals. The Sep 2016 acquisition of Medivation has strengthened Pfizer’s cancer franchise. Meanwhile, new products like Ibrance should do well and drive revenues. However, headwinds remain in the form of genericization, pricing pressure and rising competition, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. (You can read the full research report on Pfizer here . ) Microsoft ’s shares have gained more than 8% this year. Microsoft reported impressive first-quarter 2017 results driven by strong cloud growth. The analyst likes its continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. Additionally, the expansion of Microsoft HoloLens in 6 new markets will improve the company's position in the augmented and virtual reality space. Further, the anticipated completion of the LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) acquisition will boost Microsoft's presence in the social media market. However, execution and foreign exchange risks remain despite its cloud focus. (You can read the full research report on Microsoft here. ) Priceline shares have surged, increasing by more than 19% year-to-date. Priceline reported strong third quarter results. Both agency and merchant businesses showed strong momentum. The analyst likes Priceline’s strong position in international markets, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position. The secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growth opportunities in the domestic market are other positives. At the same time, weaker ADRs, macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.

      "text": " Shares of Pfizer ( PFE ) were higher in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, after its stock rating was upgraded to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight\" at Barclays earlier today. The firm believes the pharma company is now more likely to use overseas cash for \"productive M&A and return of capital to shareholders,\" the note said.\nThe biotech stocks have been taking part in the post-election Trump rally as people expect President-elect Donald Trump to cut back on regulation in the sector and to cut the repatriation tax to 10% so businesses can use that overseas money to reinvest in themselves.\nDespite the Barclays call, TIAA Global Asset Management managing director Stephanie Link prefers Allergan (AGN) over Pfizer, she said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" this afternoon.\nAllergan is down over 30% YTD and is trading at 12 times forward estimates, she noted. In addition, over 50% of its products aren't \"focused on the government reimbursement, and so they don't have as much pricing concern as some others.\"\nIn addition, Link likes Alexion (ALXN), which was upgraded to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight\" at Barclays this morning. This stock is also down over 30% YTD. \"Alexion and Allergan are so volatile, but you've got to stay patient on both of them,\" Link advised.\n(Pfizer is a holding in David Peltier's Dividend Stock Advisor. )\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.",

Following the government ban on fixed dose combination of Chlopheniramine Maleate+ Codeine Syrup, Pfizer had discontinued manufacture and sale of its popular cough syrup Corex, which had sales of Rs 244.48 crore in FY 2015-16. “Pfizer stands by the safety and efficacy of its current Corex Syrup formulation that has been duly approved by the central and state regulator,” the company said. All the new products under the Corex brand will be introduced with all due regulatory approvals in place, it added. “Pfizer remains committed to provide a more comprehensive set of solutions in respiratory indications, while ensuring minimal impact towards patients resulting from the discontinuation of manufacturing of the current Corex syrup formulation,” the company said.",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo - RTX2MJU3 \nPfizer Inc said on Wednesday its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG's blockbuster breast cancer treatment Herceptin met the main goal in a key study. \nPfizer tested the safety and effectiveness of the drug, PF-05280014, in combination with chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel against Herceptin and paclitaxel in previously untreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. \nBiotech drugs such as Herceptin are made in living cells, and then extracted and purified. They are more complex than traditional drugs and cannot be copied with precision. Their knock-off versions are called biosimilars and not generics. \nSeveral companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines. \nThe allure of biosimilars is clear, with insurers counting on the steep discounts. U.S. pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand-name drugs from their rosters. \n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Health News",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo - RTX2MJU3 \nPfizer Inc said on Wednesday its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG's blockbuster breast cancer treatment Herceptin met the main goal in a key study. \nPfizer tested the safety and effectiveness of the drug, PF-05280014, in combination with chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel against Herceptin and paclitaxel in previously untreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. \nBiotech drugs such as Herceptin are made in living cells, and then extracted and purified. They are more complex than traditional drugs and cannot be copied with precision. Their knock-off versions are called biosimilars and not generics. \nSeveral companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines. \nThe allure of biosimilars is clear, with insurers counting on the steep discounts. U.S. pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand-name drugs from their rosters. \n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Health News",

      "text": "Tweet Share Nov 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG's blockbuster breast cancer treatment Herceptin met the main goal in a key study. Pfizer tested the safety and effectiveness of the drug, PF-05280014, in combination with chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel against Herceptin and paclitaxel in previously untreated patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Biotech drugs such as Herceptin are made in living cells, and then extracted and purified. They are more complex than traditional drugs and cannot be copied with precision. Their knock-off versions are called biosimilars and not generics. Several companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines. The allure of biosimilars is clear, with insurers counting on the steep discounts. U.S. pharmacy benefit managers are already trimming brand-name drugs from their rosters.

      "text": "The purple pill has a new ad agency home. Pfizer moved its OTC heartburn drug Nexium from ad agency Leo Burnett to Grey after a review.\nLeo Burnett has had the account since 2013, when Pfizer was taking over from AstraZeneca as the drug moved from prescription to OTC. Adweek reported that the move is meant as a consolidation by Pfizer. Grey has worked with Pfizer since 1995 and already handles the Advil, Emergen-C, Preparation H, Robitussin and ThermaCare brands.\nA Pfizer spokeswoman declined comment, telling FiercePharma via email, “We don’t comment on supplier and vendor business relations.”\nPfizer has recently been considering making a move with its consumer unit, according to a Reuters report. Citing unnamed sources, the article stated a deal is not a certainty, only that Pfizer is “evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion.”\nNexium was a blockbuster on patent, but still continues to ring up sales. While protected under AstraZeneca, it took in $3.87 billion in 2013, its last full year without a generic competitor. AstraZeneca then tussled with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories in 2015 over the use of the color purple for its generic Nexium capsules, ending with the courts agreeing that purple was part of Nexium's trademark.\nSo far this year, Pfizer has spent $42 million on TV advertising for Nexium, according to data from real-time TV tracker iSpot.tv. Nexium 24HR is the top seller in the OTC heartburn category, according to IRI reported by Drug Store News, with sales of $311 million in the third quarter of 2016.",

      "text": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery Collaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights  00   ARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1,   IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. Immunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. Watson Health and Pfizer announce a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology. Shahram Ebadollahi, VP Innovations and Chief Scientific Officer at Watson Health, and Bob Abraham, Senior VP and Head of Oncology R&D at Pfizer, discuss the importance of this collaboration and the promise of Watson for Drug Discovery's cognitive capabilities to help Pfizer bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more... Using machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies, Watson for Drug Discovery can help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications by looking across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" Laurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" The newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" About IBM Watson Health Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": " 00 AM EST IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery \nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform.

IBM’s Deborah DiSanzo made the announcement at the 2016 Forbes Healthcare Summit. \nImmunotherapy is an approach that uses the immune system to fight diseases, unlike chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells. Immunotherapy works on cells in the immune system to combat cancer.

Watson will also be able to combine such a massive database with Pfizer’s own proprietary research information. ‘s president of worldwide research and development, said in an interview. “I read hundreds of papers over a few months, but I cannot read millions like Watson can.” \nWithout the cognitive computing and artificial intelligence IBM Watson brings to the table, Dolsten compared drug discovery and developing hypotheses as trying to find three trees that share similarities in a large forest. Inside Obamacare: The Fix For America’s Ailing Health Care System explores the ways the Affordable Care Act will impact your health care. \n“You could spend a lifetime looking for the trees that share the similarities,” Dolsten said. “The cognitive computing looks for patterns.” \nPfizer decided to collaborate with Watson after a potential treatment target emerged during a pilot program in the last year and a half, Dolsten said. \nPfizer was working on two products “outside of cancer” and fed information about that research into Watson, which later suggested a “very strong combination outcome” as a possible cancer treatment. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s own drug research team suggested a similar combination, giving the drug maker’s research team confidence it was headed in the right direction. “We’re now trying to validate it in animals,” Dolsten said in an interview. He wouldn’t disclose the product or when it may reach human trials. \nCancer is one of the world’s leading causes of death and it’s a rapidly changing field requiring a single researcher to look at several hundred pieces of medical research in a given year. Researchers and scientists “need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,” said Lauren O’Donnell, IBM Watson Health’s vice president of life sciences. \nThe drug discovery collaboration is the latest of IBM’s expansion into healthcare. IBM Watson already has other partnerships with companies like CVS to bring better care coordination and more personalize care to pharmacy customers. IBM Watson also has collaborations with , and to link health care companies to a new cloud-based architecture. ",

      "text": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery - Collaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights \nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA discovering new medicines is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "Pfizer, Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) recently announced that its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG’s ( RHHBY - Free Report ) breast cancer drug – Herceptin – has reached the primary endpoint in a pivotal study.\nPfizer shares rose 1.4% in November, comparing favorably with a decline of 0.3% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus | PFIZER INC Quote:\nComing back to the latest news, REFLECTIONS B3271002 study is a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus a combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Data from the study showed that the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was equivalent for PF-05280014 and Herceptin\nRoche’s Herceptin generated sales of CHF 6.5 billion in 2015 – more than 13% of the company total sales.\nWe note that Pfizer's biosimilar capabilities were significantly boosted by the Hospira acquisition in 2015. The company is expected to launch Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) / Merck & Co., Inc.’s ( MRK - Free Report ) blockbuster drug Remicade in the U.S. soon. Inflectra is the first and only biosimilar monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy and the second biosimilar to be approved in the U.S.\nOther than Herceptin, Pfizer’s biosimilars in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche’s Rituxan and Avastin, and AbbVie’s Humira.\nPfizer believes that the market for biosimilars is huge and can grow to $17–$20 billion by 2020.In the third quarter of 2016, Pfizer recorded biosimilars revenues of $83 million.\nIn fact, the pharmaceutical industry is awaiting a string of biosimilars, which are essentially generic versions of expensive biologic drugs.\nSeveral pharma as well as biotech companies are involved in the development of biosimilars. The first biosimilar to gain approval in the U.S. was Sandoz’s Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Neupogen. Zarxio was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015.\nOther approved biosimilars in the U.S. include Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept). Amgen’s Amjevita is an approved biosimilar version of Abbvie’s Humira. However, these have not been launched yet.\nPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Related resources \nARMONK, New York and NEW YORK - 01 Dec 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer’s research in immuno-oncology , an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body’s immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson’s machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nUsing machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies, Watson for Drug Discovery can help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications by looking across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. (Credit: IBM) \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient’s immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer’s proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n“Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,” said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. “With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.” \nLaurie Olson, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, “At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients .” \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization’s private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n“We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,” said Lauren O’Donnell, Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. “IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.” \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform.

      "title": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery",
      "text": " IBM\nCollaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights\nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology.\nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.\n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\"\nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\"\nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.\n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\"\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "Tech giant IBM ibm and flagship U.S. pharma Pfizer pfe this morning announced a wide-ranging new collaboration to help identify next-generation cancer treatments.\nPfizer will be harnessing the power of IBM’s Watson supercomputer to assist in drug discovery for cancer immunotherapies, which are medicines that use the body’s own immune system to help battle tumors.\nImmuno-oncology has become an increasingly popular field for biopharma companies. Firms like Merck mrk , Bristol-Myers Squibb bmy , Roche, and others have invested heavily in the space, including in a specific type of new cancer immunotherapy called “checkpoint inhibitors” that have been bringing in massive sales. Merck, BMS, and Roche have all had their flagship checkpoint inhibitors approved over the past two years, and Pfizer recently filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its own rival product.\nThese companies plan to build on these next-gen cancer medicines by discovering new molecules, developing new products, and testing out combinations of drugs to see which cancers they can treat most effectively. And that’s where Watson Health’s help will be critical. As IBM notes, the average researcher reads between 200 and 300 scientific articles per year. But the volume of cancer research data coming out on an annual basis dwarfs that, making it impossible for even scientists at a pharmaceutical titan like Pfizer to keep up with the mountains of new, potentially relevant information.\nWatson, with its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, will assist Pfizer researchers in identifying the most promising research, drug candidates, and therapy combinations.\nClick here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. \n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies like IBM Watson can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, in a statement. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.”\nIBM Watson is partnered with a bevy of major cancer institutes, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson, to assist in data analytics.",

      "text": "ARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --  IBM (NYSE:  IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool - tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.   \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA - discovering new medicines - is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery  is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated.  Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.  \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data.  The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. How Pfizer and IBM Are Teaming Up to Develop Next-Gen Cancer Drugs \nTech giant IBM ibm and flagship U.S. pharma Pfizer pfe this morning announced a wide-ranging new collaboration to help identify next-generation cancer treatments. \nPfizer will be harnessing the power of IBM’s Watson supercomputer to assist in drug discovery for cancer immunotherapies, which are medicines that use the body’s own immune system to help battle tumors. \nImmuno-oncology has become an increasingly popular field for biopharma companies. Firms like Merck mrk , Bristol-Myers Squibb bmy , Roche, and others have invested heavily in the space, including in a specific type of new cancer immunotherapy called “checkpoint inhibitors” that have been bringing in massive sales. Merck, BMS, and Roche have all had their flagship checkpoint inhibitors approved over the past two years, and Pfizer recently filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its own rival product. \nThese companies plan to build on these next-gen cancer medicines by discovering new molecules, developing new products, and testing out combinations of drugs to see which cancers they can treat most effectively. And that’s where Watson Health’s help will be critical. As IBM notes, the average researcher reads between 200 and 300 scientific articles per year. But the volume of cancer research data coming out on an annual basis dwarfs that, making it impossible for even scientists at a pharmaceutical titan like Pfizer to keep up with the mountains of new, potentially relevant information. \nWatson, with its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, will assist Pfizer researchers in identifying the most promising research, drug candidates, and therapy combinations. \nClick here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. \n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies like IBM Watson can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, in a statement. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.” \nIBM Watson is partnered with a bevy of major cancer institutes, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson, to assist in data analytics.

      "text": "Pfizer's Herceptin Biosimilar Meets Primary Endpoint in Study by Zacks Equity Research Published on December 01, 2016 Trades from $ 3 Pfizer, Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) recently announced that its experimental biosimilar of Roche Holding AG’s ( RHHBY - Free Report ) breast cancer drug – Herceptin – has reached the primary endpoint in a pivotal study. Pfizer shares rose 1.4% in November, comparing favorably with a decline of 0.3% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry. \nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus \n\nPFIZER INC Price and Consensus | PFIZER INC Quote \nComing back to the latest news, REFLECTIONS B3271002 study is a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus a combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Data from the study showed that the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was equivalent for PF-05280014 and Herceptin Roche’s Herceptin generated sales of CHF 6.5 billion in 2015 – more than 13% of the company total sales. We note that Pfizer's biosimilar capabilities were significantly boosted by the Hospira acquisition in 2015. The company is expected to launch Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) / Merck & Co., Inc.’s ( MRK - Free Report ) blockbuster drug Remicade in the U.S. soon. Inflectra is the first and only biosimilar monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy and the second biosimilar to be approved in the U.S. Other than Herceptin, Pfizer’s biosimilars in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche’s Rituxan and Avastin, and AbbVie’s Humira. Pfizer believes that the market for biosimilars is huge and can grow to $17–$20 billion by 2020.In the third quarter of 2016, Pfizer recorded biosimilars revenues of $83 million. In fact, the pharmaceutical industry is awaiting a string of biosimilars, which are essentially generic versions of expensive biologic drugs. Several pharma as well as biotech companies are involved in the development of biosimilars. The first biosimilar to gain approval in the U.S. was Sandoz’s Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Neupogen. Zarxio was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015. Other approved biosimilars in the U.S. include Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept). Amgen’s Amjevita is an approved biosimilar version of Abbvie’s Humira. However, these have not been launched yet. Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

      "title": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery",
      "text": " IBM\nCollaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights\nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology.\nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.\n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\"\nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\"\nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.\n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\"\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "title": "IBM unveils Watson for drug R&D, teams with Pfizer on oncology",
      "text": "IBM is launching the latest addition to the Watson family: Watson for Drug Discovery, which will use cognitive computing to help researchers zero in on new drug targets. First up is a collaboration with Pfizer, which will use the tech to boost its immuno-oncology research.\nWatson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based platform that will use deep learning, natural language processing and other cognitive reasoning tech to support researchers seeking new drug targets and new drug indications, IBM said in a statement. The platform has been fed more than 25 million abstracts, more than 1 million full-text journal articles and 4 million patents in order to streamline the drug discovery process. By contrast, a researcher will read between 200 and 300 articles in a given year, according to a 2015 PhRMA report.\nPfizer scientists will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze vast amounts of data–including medical literature and Pfizer’s own data–and test hypotheses to identify new drug targets and possible combination therapies for cancer, according to the statement. The platform will also help them select patients for clinical studies.\n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s worldwide R&D chief. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.”\nImmunotherapies, which include vaccines, immunomodulators and small and large molecules, induce the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The path forward in immuno-oncology includes matching treatments to specific tumor characteristics, resulting in more cancer patients receiving treatment and more effective treatments.\nIBM has embarked on a number of oncology collaborations, including a $50 million project with the Broad Institute to map out the genomes of thousands of drug-resistant tumors. With Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM offers Watson for Oncology, which will be deployed in 22 hospitals across China. It analyzes patients’ medical records and provides oncologists with evidence-based treatment options, thanks to training from MSK physicians. And that’s not all: IBM also has versions of Watson for clinical trial matching and genomics. The Department of Veterans Affairs is using the latter to expand access to its cancer precision medicine program.",

      "text": "Pfizer Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) announced positive top-line results from a phase III study evaluating its marketed drug, Lyrica (pregabalin), as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients suffering from epilepsy with partial-onset seizures.\nPfizer shares rose 0.9% in the past one month comparing favorably with a decline of the same magnitude for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.\nNote that Lyrica is already approved for various indications in more than 130 countries, including partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy, who take one or more drugs for the disease.\nThe 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study evaluated two fixed doses of Lyrica, both in the capsule form and oral solution, In the study, it was seen that adjunctive treatment with Lyrica 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency comparison to placebo, which was the primary efficacy endpoint. However, treatment with Lyrica 2.5 mg/kg/day resulted in a numerical reduction in seizure frequency, which was not statistically significant. Moreover, the safety profile observed in the study was consistent with the same in adults.\nThe study was conducted in 295 patients aged 4–16 years at 76 sites across 18 countries.\nPer the company’s press release, around 65 million people in the world suffer from epilepsy. In the U.S. alone, about three million people have epilepsy, of which approximately 10% or 300,000 are pediatric patients. It is also expected that one in 26 people will be diagnosed with epilepsy in the near future. Hence, a label expansion of Lyrica in the pediatric indication will give the company access to a huge patient population in the U.S. and globally.\nThe Lyrica Pediatric Epilepsy Program comprises a total of six studies in epilepsy patients receiving adjunctive therapy, of which three are completed and three are actively enrolling.\nLyrica generated revenues of $3.73 billion in the first nine months of 2016 up 4% on an operational basis from the year-ago period.\nPfizer has an impressive pipeline, with resources focused on the development of treatments in the fields of oncology, cardiology, metabolic disorders, neuroscience, pain, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation and vaccines, and immuno-oncology, each representing significant potential.\nPFIZER INC Price\nPFIZER INC Price | PFIZER INC Quote:\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Cloud Computing IBM Watson, Pfizer join forces on cancer drug discovery The new partnership is designed to drive Pfizer’s immuno-oncology research by tapping into IBM’s machine learning, cognitive computing and natural language processing technologies. 11:27 AM Share \nMikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, said leveraging Watson will enable Pfizer to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly. \nIBM Watson and Pfizer teamed up in a new arrangement that will bring supercomputing capabilities to cancer drug discovery. \nPfizer, in fact, will employ Watson for Drug Discovery’s machine learning, natural language processing and other cognitive reasoning technologies to identify new drugs, combination therapies and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmuno-oncology is an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body’s immune system to help fight cancer, the companies said. \nOncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson to analyze massive volumes of disparate data, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer’s proprietary data. Employing Watson, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights. \nAccording to Pfizer, many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n“Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,” Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Researchand Development, said in a statement. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.” \nThe newly-launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering designed to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. Part of Watson’s appeal is the volume of information it can absorb. \nThe average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year, while Watson for Drug Discovery has taken in 25 million Medline abstracts, more than a million full-text medical journal articles and 4 million patents, all of which is regularly updated, according to IBM executives. \nAlso, they noted, Watson for Drug Discovery can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.",

Please send the good word--or the bad--from your shop to Eric Sagonowsky ( email ) or Angus Liu ( email ), and we will feature it here at the end of each week.\nPfizer’s EVP Maddaluna is retiring after 41 years with the company\nPfizer\nAnthony Maddaluna , EVP and president of global supply, is retiring.\nPfizer’s executive vice president and president of global supply, Anthony J. Maddaluna , is retiring from the pharma giant after more than 41 years with the company. Succeeding Maddaluna is Kirsten Lund-Jurgensen , current VP of innovative health product portfolio management and consumer operations, effective the end of this year. Lund-Jurgensen is herself a Pfizer vet who joined the company from SmithKline Beecham in 1999 as VP of pharmaceuticals’ global supply chain management. FiercePharmaManufacturing\nTaro taps Sun Pharma CFO as new CEO\nTaro\nUday Baldota has been appointed new CEO.\nIf you still remember the high-profile merger battle between Taro and Sun Pharma a few years ago, you’ll know that it eventually didn’t go through, as the two parties announced termination of the merger agreement back in February 2013. Now that Sun owns 71.9% of Taro’s stock, the exec exchanges between the two is back on our radar. Taro just recently appointed Uday Baldota , current EVP and CFO of Sun Pharma, as its new CEO. In July, Taro announced that Kal Sundaram , the company’s current CEO is stepping down by the end of this year. Where is he going? Surprise, it’s Sun Pharma’s global headquarters, where he’ll assume an executive position. Later, an interim CEO was appointed by Taro to fill the gap between Sundaram’s departure and Baldota’s arrival around April next year. That person is none other than Sun Pharma’s North America CEO Abhay Gandhi . There are more serious problems awaiting the CEOs. The most pressing one is the upcoming DOJ price increase investigation, and subpoenas have already reached Taro and two senior execs. Release | Read more from FiercePharma",

(NYSE: PFE) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. Immunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind.1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" Laurie Olson, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" The newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year2, while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell, Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" About IBM Watson Health Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

Posted 05 Dec 2016 21:50 The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo A \nREUTERS: Pfizer Inc said on Monday its cancer drug, Bosulif, was found effective in a late-stage study on previously untreated patients with a form of blood and bone marrow cancer that is characterized by the abnormal production of white blood cells. \nMost people with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a genetic mutation, called the Philadelphia chromosome, which causes the bone marrow to make an enzyme that triggers the development of abnormal and unhealthy white blood cells. \nBosulif is already approved to treat adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. \nPfizer said on Monday it would work with regulators to seek approval for the drug to be used on previously untreated Ph+ CML patients. \n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza) - Reuters",

      "text": "Tweet Share Dec 5 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday its cancer drug, Bosulif, was found effective in a late-stage study on previously untreated patients with a form of blood and bone marrow cancer that is characterized by the abnormal production of white blood cells. Most people with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a genetic mutation, called the Philadelphia chromosome, which causes the bone marrow to make an enzyme that triggers the development of abnormal and unhealthy white blood cells. Bosulif is already approved to treat adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Pfizer said on Monday it would work with regulators to seek approval for the drug to be used on previously untreated Ph+ CML patients.

      "text": "Comment \nAs we reported late last month, Pfizer recently held a very quiet creative agency review in which it picked Grey to promote its anti-heartburn drug Nexium. The win was significant in that Pfizer spent approximately $66 million on paid media around the brand last year. \nThis week we’ve learned that Nexium was not the only brand involved in that review. Pfizer also sought a new lead agency to promote its Centrum vitamin line, and multiple sources tell us this week that it went to New York’s The Burns Group. \nA Burns Group spokesperson declined to confirm or comment on this story. Pfizer has not yet responded to a subsequent request, but the client generally maintains a very strict no-tolerance policy concerning media leaks. \nOne source with no connections to the Burns Group stated, on condition of anonymity, that the shop had won the Centrum business because the client preferred its work to that of another, unnamed party. Burns has experience working on related brands including Advil, Bayer and Similasan. \nPublicis Kaplan Thaler (now Publicis New York) and McCann won lead creative duties on Centrum in 2006 and 2008, respectively, when it was still owned by Wyatt. \nSeveral aspects of the review are unclear at the moment, such as which agency had been handling the brand in recent years and how Pfizer plans to market the vitamins moving forward. \nFor the record, we will always remember Centrum for the taglines “Always Complete. From A to Zinc,” and, of course, “It’s a great time to be silver!”",

This fuels the demand for travel vaccines as the prevalence of infectious diseases are specifically region prone, unlike that of other indications. As vaccines are largely used as a preventive measure against these known infectious diseases, the travelers are advised to follow the region-specific immunization plan. The market is growing because various government bodies have mandated the immunization of travelers visiting the infectious-prone areas with various types of vaccines. This, in turn, prevents the spread of infection and averts any chances of epidemic outbreaks.",

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo More LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said on Wednesday it had fined Pfizer (PFE.N) a record 84.2 million pounds ($106.54 million) for ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. The Competition and Markets Authority also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for its role in hiking prices of phenytoin sodium capsules in 2012. Pfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but sold the rights to Flynn in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared.

      "text": "Drugs giant Pfizer has been fined a record £84.2m by the UK’s competition regulator after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was hiked by up to 2,600%.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority , issuing its biggest ever fine, said the “extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds”.\nThe CMA also fined the drugs distributor Flynn Pharma £5.2m for charging excessive and unfair prices in the UK for phenytoin sodium capsules.\nCancer drug companies cut prices to win NHS approval Read more\nIt follows an overnight price increase for the drug of up to 2,600%, after the drug was deliberately debranded, the CMA said.\nUS-based Pfizer rejected the CMA’s findings and said it would appeal against the decision.\nThe amount the NHS was charged for 100mg packs of the drug was hiked from £2.83 to £67.50 before being reduced to £54from May 2014. As a result, the amount the NHS spent on phenytoin sodium capsules rocketed from about £2m a year in 2012 to £50m in 2013.\nThe CMA also found that Pfizer, best known for its mass-market drugs such as Viagra, was charging a far higher price for the anti-epilepsy drug in the UK than in any other European country.\nThe watchdog has ordered both companies to drop their prices.\nPhilip Marsden, who led the investigation for the CMA, accused the firms of exploitation and said there was no justification for such price rises. Phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug and there had been no recent innovation or significant investment, he said.\nMarsden said: “The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients. These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers.”\nPfizer said in a statement: “Pfizer refutes the findings set out in the Competition and Markets Authority decision. In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law.\n“Phenytoin capsules were a loss making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture.”",

      "text": "Market  08am EST UPDATE 1-Britain fines Pfizer record $107 mln for huge drug price hike \n(Adds Pfizer reaction, further details) \nBy Ben Hirschler \nLONDON Dec 7 Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment.

Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds ($106 million) and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \nThe authority says the companies intentionally rebranded a drug previously known as Epanutin so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the price of phenytoin sodium capsules increase from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million pounds in 2013. \nPfizer plans to appeal.",

      "text": "  9:06am GMT Britain fines Pfizer record $107 million for huge drug price hike The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo By Ben Hirschler | LONDON \nLONDON Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Jane Merriman/Keith Weir) Next In Health News",
