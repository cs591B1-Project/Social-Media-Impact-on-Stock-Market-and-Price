Is that how it works now at CVS? It did print my extra bucks after 2nd transaction. FrancesA \nThe barcode on the bottom left corner is the product code (?not sure if right term). The barcode on the top right corner is the unique code on the coupons . com coupons. You can print two coupons per computer for this site. Good luck – you may have to “educate” your cashier. judebluiz359 \nThe last few times I was at CVS the register rejected my second coupon also! The manager was called over and read the coupon and it said “one coupon per purchase”. She interpreted that to mean one per purchase not one per item. She said that CVS has changed their coupon policy and will not manually push through coupons if the register rejects them. CVS LINKS",

      "text": "Mark Wilson 12.05.16 8:00 AM \n\"Look, obviously this is something you can do at a CVS,\" says Uri Minkoff, creative director and CEO of Rebecca Minkoff. He’s introducing me to the new self-checkout system at the fashion company's Manhattan flagship store. It allows customers to buy anything from $200 handbags to $1,500 jackets, all on their own, all without dealing with a sales associate. \nMost sales pitches I’ve heard don’t start with such a disclaimer—\"clearly Duane Reade's been doing this with toothpaste forever!\"—especially not from a fashion brand that does more than $100 million in revenue a year. \n\"But it was this idea of, does luxury also include self-service?\" he continues. \"No lines? The comfort of being and dressing as who you are? Being able to be anonymous—and not being judged?\" And suddenly, I’m curious—is the option to check yourself out at CVS a bit, dare I say, luxurious ? \nMinkoff’s new system, developed by Y Combinator startup QueueHop, is an RFID security tag that attaches to all items in the store. When placed on a checkout table, the item appears on an iPad screen, allowing you to pay. And once you pay, you place the tag onto another table, which unlocks the tag from the merchandise, and allows you to go on your way. (And if you leave without paying for the garment or removing the tag, an alarm will sound at the door.) \nIt's worth noting that this tag is the first time that Rebecca Minkoff has used a clip-on anti-theft measure in a store, but Uri argues that it wasn’t a decision about reducing exorbitant amounts of theft—or what the industry calls \"shrinkage\"—nor was it an attempt to reduce employees, as head counts will stay the same. Instead, he says it was about pushing the consumer retail experience forward, and bridging the gap for people used to shopping online anonymously, who might also want to shop in a retail store with a similar solo mentality. \n\"When we were going through our initial technology layout, we took on the view that the millennial consumer either wanted to be treated like a celebrity—a VIP with full service—or anonymously. [We wondered] what if they could have the store to themselves after-hours? Or how could you approximate the online shopping experience that you’re checking out by yourself, and it’s very quiet?\" \nRebecca Minkoff already enables a style of full-service anonymous shopping with its dressing room mirrors, which allow shoppers to call for another size or clothing item without calling out to sales associates . Self-checkout takes that mentality to the extreme, essentially allowing a customer to shop in a boutique-sized store without neck-breathing service. Meanwhile, Uri insists that sales associates shouldn’t lose out on their commissions as a result; associates can mark in the system if they’ve helped a customer that they didn’t actually ring up later. \nBut that’s not to say associates won’t be affected by the update. In fact, Uri hopes that in removing security from the minds of their own employees, he can eliminate the implicit biases that might stop their employees from giving the best, friendliest service possible. \n\"I call it the Pretty Woman moment. [Julia Roberts] walks into the boutique in Beverly Hills, and they’re kind of judging her,\" says Uri. \"That became apparent to me when I was giving a talk in Boston. A girl approached me after and she said, 'Can I go into your store?' In her questioning, she wasn’t sure she was ‘good enough’ to come in. It hit me. We all have a store or two where we wonder, 'Are we dressed right?' when we go in there. \n\"Is that [customer] really going to buy?\" he continues. \"That whole mentality and tension, what if you could remove that from the experience?\" \nRebecca Minkoff’s new checkout was just installed this week to precede the remaining holiday rush. Uri admits that the company isn’t the first to enable the option—aside from CVS, Apple retail stores allow you to buy some items up to $100 on your own—but it may be the first company to enable self-checkout on some really expensive stock. And Uri hopes that other retailers copy the approach, killing lines, enabling anonymity, and letting technology police customers, rather than bias. \n\"Is this going to maximize our sales in a huge way? Probably not. Do we have a huge shrinkage problem? Probably not,\" says Uri. \"But we think it’s important for us to let our customer know that we get her.\"   Co.Design  ",

      "text": "Scam: No trace of Aloe Vera found in products at Walmart, CVS \n  JD Heyes Tags: aloe vera , NaturalNews.com , phony product , retailers 0   If you believed that you bought an aloe vera product at major retailers Walmart, CVS and others that actually contained aloe vera , think again. \nWhat you really bought was very likely only colored gel. \nResearchers examining samples of store-brand aloe vera gel at Walmart, Target and CVS found absolutely no hint of the plant in various lab tests, even though the product labeling all listed “ aloe barbadensis ” leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the primary or secondary ingredient after water. \nThere is no government watchdog agency that ensures aloe products are genuine, so that’s likely why the duping has been occurring, Bloomberg News reported . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not handle the approval process for cosmetics before they are sold, and has never fined any maker for selling phony aloe products. As it is, suppliers are essentially on an honor system, even though the total U.S. market for aloe-based products, which includes lotions and gels, vitamins and drinks, has grown by 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to data from SPINS LLC., a market research firm based in Chicago. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, a White Plains, New York-based firm that has done testing on aloe products. \nThe three chemical markers for aloe – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were all absent in tests for Walmart, Target and CVS aloe products conducted by a lab that was hired by Bloomberg News . Instead, three samples sent to the lab contained a much cheaper ingredient called maltodextrin, a sugar that is sometimes used to imitate aloe. \nGel sold at another retailer – Walgreens – only contained one of the markers (malic acid), but was devoid of the other two. Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant who is based in Chapala, Mexico, told Bloomberg that this would indicate that the presence of aloe could neither be ruled out nor confirmed. \nThe Target Corp. would not comment on Bloomberg’s findings. Meanwhile, spokesmen for Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said that their suppliers had confirmed that the products they were selling were authentic. (By the way, all aloe products at the Health Ranger Store are verified by us to be 100 percent authentic). \nBetween these four retailers, there are some 23,000 outlets. \nBloomberg News noted further: \n“The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.” \nThe lab where the product testing took place used a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance, which found additives like maltodextrin and others such as triethanolamine, which is an emulsifier. In the samples, lactic acid – an element that indicates the presence of degraded aloe vera – was not found. \nFruit of the Earth, based in Fort Worth, Texas, a brand that was founded in 1980, makes the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg . The company, in turn, said that its aloe supplier is Concentrated Aloe Corp., located in Ormond Beach, Fla. The latter said that it uses fair trade, organic aloe that is farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both of those companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said. “We stand behind our products.” \nMeanwhile, Tim Meadows, Concentrated Aloe Corp.’s president, said that the technique – nuclear magnetic resonance – used to test the products is not reliable for cosmetics, due to the presence of multiple ingredients that allegedly cause interference, making it impossible to test for aloe in finished products. \nHe also said that maltodextrin is not an adulterant – a term referring to a substance found within other substances – because it can be used during the drying process. And while some processing techniques for aloe remove acemannan, that does not mean that the aloe is not genuine, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” said Meadows, noting that the cosmetics industry “requires highly processed aloe.” He said that it was not clear how that affected acemannan. \nBloomberg noted that several law firms have filed suit against the four retailers, after separate testing also did not find aloe in their aloe products. \nSources:",

      "text": "Scam: No trace of Aloe Vera found in products at Walmart, CVS \nMonday, December 05, 2016 by: JD Heyes Tags: aloe vera , NaturalNews.com , phony product , retailers 0   If you believed that you bought an aloe vera product at major retailers Walmart, CVS and others that actually contained aloe vera , think again. \nWhat you really bought was very likely only colored gel. \nResearchers examining samples of store-brand aloe vera gel at Walmart, Target and CVS found absolutely no hint of the plant in various lab tests, even though the product labeling all listed “ aloe barbadensis ” leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the primary or secondary ingredient after water. \nThere is no government watchdog agency that ensures aloe products are genuine, so that’s likely why the duping has been occurring, Bloomberg News reported . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not handle the approval process for cosmetics before they are sold, and has never fined any maker for selling phony aloe products. As it is, suppliers are essentially on an honor system, even though the total U.S. market for aloe-based products, which includes lotions and gels, vitamins and drinks, has grown by 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to data from SPINS LLC., a market research firm based in Chicago. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, a White Plains, New York-based firm that has done testing on aloe products. \nThe three chemical markers for aloe – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were all absent in tests for Walmart, Target and CVS aloe products conducted by a lab that was hired by Bloomberg News . Instead, three samples sent to the lab contained a much cheaper ingredient called maltodextrin, a sugar that is sometimes used to imitate aloe. \nGel sold at another retailer – Walgreens – only contained one of the markers (malic acid), but was devoid of the other two. Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant who is based in Chapala, Mexico, told Bloomberg that this would indicate that the presence of aloe could neither be ruled out nor confirmed. \nThe Target Corp. would not comment on Bloomberg’s findings. Meanwhile, spokesmen for Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said that their suppliers had confirmed that the products they were selling were authentic. (By the way, all aloe products at the Health Ranger Store are verified by us to be 100 percent authentic). \nBetween these four retailers, there are some 23,000 outlets. \nBloomberg News noted further: \n“The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.” \nThe lab where the product testing took place used a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance, which found additives like maltodextrin and others such as triethanolamine, which is an emulsifier. In the samples, lactic acid – an element that indicates the presence of degraded aloe vera – was not found. \nFruit of the Earth, based in Fort Worth, Texas, a brand that was founded in 1980, makes the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg . The company, in turn, said that its aloe supplier is Concentrated Aloe Corp., located in Ormond Beach, Fla. The latter said that it uses fair trade, organic aloe that is farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both of those companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said. “We stand behind our products.” \nMeanwhile, Tim Meadows, Concentrated Aloe Corp.’s president, said that the technique – nuclear magnetic resonance – used to test the products is not reliable for cosmetics, due to the presence of multiple ingredients that allegedly cause interference, making it impossible to test for aloe in finished products. \nHe also said that maltodextrin is not an adulterant – a term referring to a substance found within other substances – because it can be used during the drying process. And while some processing techniques for aloe remove acemannan, that does not mean that the aloe is not genuine, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” said Meadows, noting that the cosmetics industry “requires highly processed aloe.” He said that it was not clear how that affected acemannan. \nBloomberg noted that several law firms have filed suit against the four retailers, after separate testing also did not find aloe in their aloe products. \nSources:",

      "text": "Scam: No trace of Aloe Vera found in products at Walmart, CVS share \nIf you believed that you bought an aloe vera product at major retailers Walmart, CVS and others that actually contained aloe vera , think again. \nWhat you really bought was very likely only colored gel. \nResearchers examining samples of store-brand aloe vera gel at Walmart, Target and CVS found absolutely no hint of the plant in various lab tests, even though the product labeling all listed “ aloe barbadensis ” leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the primary or secondary ingredient after water. \nThere is no government watchdog agency that ensures aloe products are genuine, so that’s likely why the duping has been occurring, Bloomberg News reported . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not handle the approval process for cosmetics before they are sold, and has never fined any maker for selling phony aloe products. As it is, suppliers are essentially on an honor system, even though the total U.S. market for aloe-based products, which includes lotions and gels, vitamins and drinks, has grown by 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to data from SPINS LLC., a market research firm based in Chicago. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, a White Plains, New York-based firm that has done testing on aloe products. \nThe three chemical markers for aloe – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were all absent in tests for Walmart, Target and CVS aloe products conducted by a lab that was hired by Bloomberg News . Instead, three samples sent to the lab contained a much cheaper ingredient called maltodextrin, a sugar that is sometimes used to imitate aloe. \nGel sold at another retailer – Walgreens – only contained one of the markers (malic acid), but was devoid of the other two. Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant who is based in Chapala, Mexico, told Bloomberg that this would indicate that the presence of aloe could neither be ruled out nor confirmed. \nThe Target Corp. would not comment on Bloomberg’s findings. Meanwhile, spokesmen for Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said that their suppliers had confirmed that the products they were selling were authentic. (By the way, all aloe products at the Health Ranger Store are verified by us to be 100 percent authentic). \nBetween these four retailers, there are some 23,000 outlets. \nBloomberg News noted further: \n“The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.” \nThe lab where the product testing took place used a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance, which found additives like maltodextrin and others such as triethanolamine, which is an emulsifier. In the samples, lactic acid – an element that indicates the presence of degraded aloe vera – was not found. \nFruit of the Earth, based in Fort Worth, Texas, a brand that was founded in 1980, makes the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg . The company, in turn, said that its aloe supplier is Concentrated Aloe Corp., located in Ormond Beach, Fla. The latter said that it uses fair trade, organic aloe that is farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both of those companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said. “We stand behind our products.” \nMeanwhile, Tim Meadows, Concentrated Aloe Corp.’s president, said that the technique – nuclear magnetic resonance – used to test the products is not reliable for cosmetics, due to the presence of multiple ingredients that allegedly cause interference, making it impossible to test for aloe in finished products. \nHe also said that maltodextrin is not an adulterant – a term referring to a substance found within other substances – because it can be used during the drying process. And while some processing techniques for aloe remove acemannan, that does not mean that the aloe is not genuine, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” said Meadows, noting that the cosmetics industry “requires highly processed aloe.” He said that it was not clear how that affected acemannan. \nBloomberg noted that several law firms have filed suit against the four retailers, after separate testing also did not find aloe in their aloe products. \nSources:",

      "text": "December 5, 2016 \nby: JD Heyes \n( NaturalNews ) If you believed that you bought an aloe vera product at major retailers Walmart, CVS and others that actually contained aloe vera , think again. \nWhat you really bought was very likely only colored gel. \nResearchers examining samples of store-brand aloe vera gel at Walmart, Target and CVS found absolutely no hint of the plant in various lab tests, even though the product labeling all listed “ aloe barbadensis ” leaf juice – another name for aloe vera – as either the primary or secondary ingredient after water. \nThere is no government watchdog agency that ensures aloe products are genuine, so that’s likely why the duping has been occurring, Bloomberg News reported . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not handle the approval process for cosmetics before they are sold, and has never fined any maker for selling phony aloe products. As it is, suppliers are essentially on an honor system, even though the total U.S. market for aloe-based products, which includes lotions and gels, vitamins and drinks, has grown by 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to data from SPINS LLC., a market research firm based in Chicago. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com , a White Plains, New York-based firm that has done testing on aloe products. \nThe three chemical markers for aloe – acemannan, malic acid and glucose – were all absent in tests for Walmart, Target and CVS aloe products conducted by a lab that was hired by Bloomberg News . Instead, three samples sent to the lab contained a much cheaper ingredient called maltodextrin, a sugar that is sometimes used to imitate aloe. \nGel sold at another retailer – Walgreens – only contained one of the markers (malic acid), but was devoid of the other two. Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant who is based in Chapala, Mexico, told Bloomberg that this would indicate that the presence of aloe could neither be ruled out nor confirmed. \nThe Target Corp. would not comment on Bloomberg’s findings. Meanwhile, spokesmen for Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., said that their suppliers had confirmed that the products they were selling were authentic. (By the way, all aloe products at the Health Ranger Store are verified by us to be 100 percent authentic). \nBetween these four retailers, there are some 23,000 outlets. \nBloomberg News noted further: \n“The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.” \nThe lab where the product testing took place used a technique known as nuclear magnetic resonance, which found additives like maltodextrin and others such as triethanolamine, which is an emulsifier. In the samples, lactic acid – an element that indicates the presence of degraded aloe vera – was not found. \nFruit of the Earth, based in Fort Worth, Texas, a brand that was founded in 1980, makes the gels for Walmart, Target and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg . The company, in turn, said that its aloe supplier is Concentrated Aloe Corp., located in Ormond Beach, Fla. The latter said that it uses fair trade, organic aloe that is farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both of those companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,” John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said. “We stand behind our products.” \nMeanwhile, Tim Meadows, Concentrated Aloe Corp.’s president, said that the technique – nuclear magnetic resonance – used to test the products is not reliable for cosmetics, due to the presence of multiple ingredients that allegedly cause interference, making it impossible to test for aloe in finished products. \nHe also said that maltodextrin is not an adulterant – a term referring to a substance found within other substances – because it can be used during the drying process. And while some processing techniques for aloe remove acemannan, that does not mean that the aloe is not genuine, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” said Meadows, noting that the cosmetics industry “requires highly processed aloe.” He said that it was not clear how that affected acemannan. \nBloomberg noted that several law firms have filed suit against the four retailers, after separate testing also did not find aloe in their aloe products. \nSources:",

The CEI is an annual national benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices pertinent to LGBT equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.\n\"Our company's success depends on the rich diversity that our colleagues, customers and suppliers bring to CVS Health,\" said Lisa Bisaccia , EVP and Chief Human Resources Officer for CVS Health and executive sponsor of the company's LGBT resource group. \"To sustain breakthrough innovation, we must seek out, listen to and leverage everyone's voices and ensure that every individual feels equally valued, respected and appreciated.\"\nCVS Health joins the ranks of 517 major U.S. businesses which also earned top marks this year.\nSome of the programs and initiatives that account for CVS Health's top score include:\ngender transition guidelines for colleagues and their managers who may be involved in a workplace gender transition; an inclusive benefits package which provides health insurance coverage for the medically necessary health care services that transgender people need, including transition-related treatment; support for PRIDE, a colleague resource group for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) colleagues and their allies, one of 13 national Colleague Resource Groups sponsored by the company; the CVS Health Supplier Ethics Policy that supports the inclusion of LGBT vendors and suppliers; and financial sponsorship and participation in annual LGBT-related and multi-cultural events and causes across the country. The 2017 CEI rated 1,043 businesses in the report, which evaluates LGBT-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBT community. CVS Health's efforts in satisfying all of the CEI's criteria results in a 100 percent ranking and the designation as a Best Place to Work for LGBT Equality.\nFor more information on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index, or to download a free copy of the report, visit www.hrc.org/cei .\nAbout CVS Health\nCVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health.

Main CVS building has new tenant 2016-12-06T17:22:21Z (WFIE) EVANSVILLE, IN (WFIE) - \nAfter around 10 years of being vacant, the old CVS building on North Main in Evansville officially has a new tenant. \nIt was announced at the Evansville Redevelopment Commission meeting Tuesday morning that DaVita Total Renal Care Inc. signed the lease for the building located at 800 North Main. \nThe building will be a Deaconess dialysis center. \nKelley Coures, with the Department of Metropolitan Development in Evansville, said everything seemed to fall in place perfectly because DaVita is known for re-purposing empty CVS buildings. \nPlus, the location is perfect for future patients. \n\"The bottom line is people were having to travel all the way to Gateway for their renal care, for their dialysis,\" said Coures. \"And by bringing this location closer to the neighborhood, it's much faster for someone to get there than it is to go all the way out to Deaconess Gateway. So it's a good deal for Deaconess, it's a good deal for DaVita, and it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" \nCoures said the renovation will cost DaVita ita around 1.5 to 2 million dollars. \nThe company has a 7 month renovation period to finish. \nCopyright 2016 WFIE.

Lane Lambert The Patriot Ledger @llambert_ledger \nHINGHAM – Police are looking for a man to interview about the theft of $576 worth of razor blades at a CVS pharmacy on Dec. 1. \nThis is the third time since the summer that the CVS at 86 South St. in downtown Hingham has reported a razor blade theft.Police Sgt. Steven Dearth said the man hasn’t been declared a suspect – not yet, at least – but he said “we’d like to identify him and speak with him.”The manager reported the theft of the Gillette Fusion blades on Dec. 3.The robbery occurred at about 5 p.m. Security-camera images show the man wearing black sweat pants, a black, zippered sweatshirt and a black, banded wool winter hat.The same CVS was robbed of $750 worth of razor blades on Aug. 19, also around 5 p.m. Dearth said the store was also robbed earlier in the summer. Suspects haven’t been found for either of those thefts.Dearth said the man police want to question about the Dec. 1 theft isn’t a suspect in the previous CVS robberies.Dearth said razor blades are an attractive target because “they're small, high in value, and easy to sell.” Quincy and other communities have also seen such robberies.Men's razor blades are the most popular item, Refill packs typically sell for $12 to $24, but can be as expensive as $40 for 8 blades. They’re typically sold cheaply or traded for other merchandise.Dearth asked anyone with information about the Dec. 1 theft to contact detective Daniel Leary or officer David Orlandi at 781-749-1212, or leave an anonymous tip at the department web site, hpd.org.

      "text": "BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (WDTN) – Thousands of pain pills are missing after a Beavercreek CVS pharmacy was robbed Monday night.\nWithin a matter minutes, 2 men came into the store. One jumped the counter and forced employees to open the safe. They got away with more than $10,000 worth of pain killers. Police are now looking into similar robberies and investigating for any possible connections.\nAt around 10:40 Monday night, surveillance videos shows both men walk into the CVS in the 1300 North Fairfield Road in Beavercreek. One man was dressed in all black, the other was in a red hoody and light-colored pants.\nIn another shot, the man dressed in all black quickly runs up to the counter and jumps over it. The same man then forces a CVS employee to walk toward the safe and the other employee in green to open it. The suspect in red walks up and gets ready to collect what’s inside.\nAfter a few moments the safe is open, and the suspects quickly collect everything inside, stealing thousands of oxycodone pills and oxycontin pills.\nIn another shot, both suspects are seen running from the store, one dropping something, the other picking it up. Police were able to recover some of the pills found just across the street at a construction site.\n“We don’t have any information that there were any specific threats,” Beavercreek Police Captain Chad Lindsey said. “There were no weapons involved. One of the males jumped over the counter and went back were the safe is a grabbed the employees.”\nNeither of the employees were injured. The CVS robbery is just one of a string of pharmacy robberies in the Miami Valley in the last few months. An armed robbery was reported at Wellness Pharmacy on Smithville Road in Dayton back on October 30th. And just a week before Thanksgiving, the Rite Aid on Wilmington was also robbed.\nPolice say the drugs are likely to end up on the streets.\n“More than likely the suspects are taking the pills to sell,” Captain Lindsey said. “To try and get however much they can for them.”\nPolice are now actively investigating to see if any of the robberies are connected. Police believe both men fled in a dark green 4-door car. If you have any information that could help, contact the Beavercreek Police at 937-426-1225.\n ",

Main CVS building has new tenant 2016-12-06T17:22:21Z (WFIE) EVANSVILLE, IN (WFIE) - \nAfter around 10 years of being vacant, the old CVS building on North Main in Evansville officially has a new tenant. \nIt was announced at the Evansville Redevelopment Commission meeting Tuesday morning that DaVita Total Renal Care Inc. signed the lease for the building located at 800 North Main. \nThe building will be a Deaconess dialysis center. \nKelley Coures, with the Department of Metropolitan Development in Evansville, said everything seemed to fall in place perfectly because DaVita is known for re-purposing empty CVS buildings. \nPlus, the location is perfect for future patients. \n\"The bottom line is people were having to travel all the way to Gateway for their renal care, for their dialysis,\" said Coures. \"And by bringing this location closer to the neighborhood, it's much faster for someone to get there than it is to go all the way out to Deaconess Gateway. So it's a good deal for Deaconess, it's a good deal for DaVita, and it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" \nCoures said the renovation will cost DaVita ita around 1.5 to 2 million dollars. \nThe company has a 7 month renovation period to finish. \nCopyright 2016 WFIE.

      "text": "In November, OptumRx and CVS Pharmacy announced that they are partnering to provide more convenient choices and lower costs for patients.\nOptumRx is UnitedHealth Group’s free-standing pharmacy care services business that manages more than one billion prescriptions annually. Last year, it formed a similar partnership with Walgreens.\nAdam J. Fein “The structure of the OptumRx deal amps up retail competition,” wrote Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting and CEO of Drug Channels Institute, on DCI’s web site. Now, OptumRx customers will have to choose either Walgreens or CVS as their sole provider for 90-day supplies, according to Fein.\nFein said CVS needed the partnership to gain scale, even thought it sacrifices some retail per-prescription profitability. Over the past five years, the share of 90-day scripts at chain stores has nearly doubled, from 6.5% in 2010 to an estimated 12% in 2015.\n“[Ninety-day] scripts still constitute the majority of mail pharmacy dispensing activity. But, the economic advantage of mail pharmacies is vanishing as payers allow community pharmacies to fill 90-day prescriptions for maintenance medications,” Fein wrote.\nThe latest deal signals CVS Health’s intention to re-engage with pharmacy benefit managers’ (PBMs) narrow networks, Fein said.\n “Together, the two companies will offer employers a new pharmacy network solution that provides eligible OptumRx members the option to fill 90-day prescriptions at prices equal to home delivery co-pay levels at CVS locations nationwide or through OptumRx home delivery,” OptumRx and CVS in joint statement.\nThe new partnership also enables OptumRx and CVS Pharmacy to leverage a shared pharmacy platform to develop new pharmacy and health solutions for clients and consumers.\n“Our new strategic relationship with CVS Pharmacy will benefit our clients and consumers by improving access to medications, driving better health outcomes, and reducing costs,” said Mark Thierer, chief executive officer of OptumRx. “By deepening our relationship, we can develop innovations that further modernize and enhance pharmacy care.”",

      "text": "Beavercreek CVS robbed of $10k worth of pain killers \nBEAVERCREEK, Ohio (WDTN) – Thousands of pain pills are missing after a Beavercreek CVS pharmacy was robbed Monday night. \nWithin a matter minutes, 2 men came into the store. One jumped the counter and forced employees to open the safe. They got away with more than $10,000 worth of pain killers. Police are now looking into similar robberies and investigating for any possible connections. \nAt around 10:40 Monday night, surveillance videos shows both men walk into the CVS in the 1300 North Fairfield Road in Beavercreek. One man was dressed in all black, the other was in a red hoody and light-colored pants. \nIn another shot, the man dressed in all black quickly runs up to the counter and jumps over it. The same man then forces a CVS employee to walk toward the safe and the other employee in green to open it. The suspect in red walks up and gets ready to collect what’s inside. \nAfter a few moments the safe is open, and the suspects quickly collect everything inside, stealing thousands of oxycodone pills and oxycontin pills. \nIn another shot, both suspects are seen running from the store, one dropping something, the other picking it up. Police were able to recover some of the pills found just across the street at a construction site. \n“We don’t have any information that there were any specific threats,” Beavercreek Police Captain Chad Lindsey said. “There were no weapons involved. One of the males jumped over the counter and went back were the safe is a grabbed the employees.” \nNeither of the employees were injured. The CVS robbery is just one of a string of pharmacy robberies in the Miami Valley in the last few months. An armed robbery was reported at Wellness Pharmacy on Smithville Road in Dayton back on October 30th. And just a week before Thanksgiving, the Rite Aid on Wilmington was also robbed. \nPolice say the drugs are likely to end up on the streets. \n“More than likely the suspects are taking the pills to sell,” Captain Lindsey said. “To try and get however much they can for them.” \nPolice are now actively investigating to see if any of the robberies are connected. Police believe both men fled in a dark green 4-door car. If you have any information that could help, contact the Beavercreek Police at 937-426-1225.",

      "text": "Wayland: Residents upset about actions at ZBA meeting about CVS Tuesday Dec 6, 2016 at 7:39 PM Dec 6, 2016 at 7:39 PM Brian Benson Daily News Staff @bbensonMWDN \nWAYLAND - Residents, frustrated with the tenor of a recent Zoning Board of Appeals meeting about a planned CVS, are urging selectmen to look into how that hearing was conducted. \nGretchen Dresens, among several residents who appealed a building permit issued for the 150 Main St. project, said she has \"extreme dissatisfaction\" with how the Nov. 29 meeting transpired. \n\"I don’t know what this board’s next step should be but you need to act on this,\" Nancy Leifer, who also filed an appeal, told selectmen on Monday. \nThe Zoning Board of Appeals rejected on procedural grounds three appeals by residents before hearing the substance of their concerns. Residents worry the CVS project does not fully comply with the town's zoning bylaw. \nThe ZBA found residents did not have standing to appeal or that the appeal was not filed on time with the town clerk. \n\nDresens has said she attempted to file the necessary paperwork on Aug. 17, but the town clerk's office was closed. She brought it to the town administrator's office and then took it to the Building Department. But, the paperwork never made it to the town clerk's office until Aug. 19, which was after the Aug. 18 deadline, according to Dresens and town documents. \nThe ZBA's rules and regulations indicate building staff would bring appeals to the town clerk's office, residents have pointed out at recent meetings. \nDresens said Town Administrator Nan Balmer told her that her office's stamp would be sufficient. Balmer said she never said that stamp could substitute for the town clerk's stamp. \nSelectmen several months ago recognized the timing problem and Balmer wrote a letter to the Zoning Board of Appeals in September explaining the situation, selectmen Chairwoman Cherry Karlson said. \nTown Clerk Beth Klein wrote a memo in September to selectmen outlining steps she took to notify people that her office would be closed part of the day while staff attended early voting training. Klein offered suggestions for improving procedures and communications, at least some of which are being or have been done, according to town documents. \nMolly Upton, who also filed an appeal, said the town should have a procedure through which Balmer can access the town clerk's office when it is closed. \nBalmer plans to look into how the town handles zoning appeals as it relates to town operations, Karlson said. \nBalmer on Monday said she plans to look into claims by some residents that information from the developer was not promptly included in town files for the appeals. \nResidents have also complained about ZBA Chairman Eric Goldberg's conduct at last week's meeting, including a response he delivered to a resident's letter about town counsel services. Leifer said she thought that \"rant\" was designed to intimidate people in the audience. \nSome residents felt Goldberg was essentially making all the decisions and talking when he should have been listening. \nAll board members voted on whether to reject each appeal after brief discussions. \nGoldberg declined on Tuesday to comment about the appeals because they are open matters. \nBrian Benson can be reached at 508-626-3964 or bbenson@wickedlocal.com.

      "title": "No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart, CVS - Bloomberg",
      "text": "November 22, 2016 — 5:00 AM EST November 22, 2016 — 5:00 AM EST \nThe aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. \nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. \nThere’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. \n“You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. \nAloe’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose— were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. 23,000 Stores \nTarget Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. \nWalmart Equate brand Aloe After Sun Gel Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \nThe four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. \nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. \nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. \nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. Raw Ingredients \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,’’ John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.’’ \nCVS brand Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel Source: CVS \nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,’’ Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.’’ \nThough it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. \nThe CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. Lawsuits Filed \nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. \n“No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. \nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. \nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. Beneficial Properties \nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. \nWalgreens Well brand alcohol free Aloe Vera Body Gel Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg \nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. \n“What you have there is not aloe,’’ said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.’’ Reliability Questioned \nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. \nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

      "text": "Walmart CVS Target Testing on store-brand aloe vera products sold at (from left) Walmart, CVS and Target found no evidence of aloe, according to a new report. First, there were reports of wood pulp in grated cheese. And now, this.\nA new Bloomberg News report raises doubts about store-brand aloe vera after tests it commissioned on products bought at Walmart, CVS and Target reportedly found no trace of their claimed prime ingredient ― aloe barbadensis leaf juice.\nInstead, the products were said to have contained cheaper maltodextrin , a sugar used as a food additive that Bloomberg said can imitate aloe.\nThree gels identified as failing Bloomberg’s tests are Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera.\nkaanates via Getty Images Aloe offers a wealth of health benefits, with it containing vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes and fatty acids, and minerals. Walgreens’ Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel was reportedly found to contain one of aloe’s three chemical makers, malic acid. Acemannan and glucose were not found, which Bloomberg said means the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out.\nThe report comes months after a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Texas-based company that manufactures aloe products for Walgreens, Walmart and Target. That company, Fruit of the Earth, responded to Bloomberg’s article by calling it utterly false.\nThe company argued in a statement to The Huffington Post that acemannan doesn’t equate to aloe, but said its tests nevertheless show Fruit of the Earth products do contain the chemical maker. The company said it would share its test results in the class-action litigation.\n“The true test of whether the product contains aloe is to trace the aloe ingredient from the aloe leaves, through processing, and to the manufacturer’s use of the aloe ingredient in the finished product,” the company said.\nAs for the presence of maltodextrin, Fruit of the Earth said a production step “uses maltodextrin to aid in the spray drying process.”\nWalmart and CVS appear to be taking their supplier’s word. A Walmart spokesman said in an email to HuffPost that the retailer would continue to sell the product. A spokeswoman for Target declined comment, citing the litigation.\nAloe vera, which contains vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes, fatty acids and minerals, has a range of health benefits. Acemannan has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and appears to promote cell growth, studies have shown.\nAlso on HuffPost Editors' Picks: New Drugstore Body Lotions Editors' Picks: New Drugstore Body Lotions 1 of 5 For normal skin...

      "text": "Follow Article \nCVS has moved for summary judgment in hopes of evading further litigation of a racial discrimination class action lawsuit. \nThe nationwide pharmacy chain is now bringing dual motions for summary judgment, one against each of the two named plaintiffs who claim CVS directed its anti-shoplifting staff to target Black and Hispanic persons. \nCVS claims the plaintiffs’ allegations are “legally irrelevant” and that they fail to show the company forced plaintiffs to work in a hostile work environment. \nPlaintiff Sheree Steele originally filed this CVS class action lawsuit along with three other CVS employees in June 2015. She claims CVS regional loss prevention managers, who train and supervise staff to guard stores against shoplifting, expressly direct their staff to target Black and Hispanic customers. \nSteele also alleges CVS retaliated against her for complaining about the situation by refusing to allow her to return to work after she took leave in July 2013. \nAfter the other original plaintiffs withdrew their claims in August 2015, Steele has since been joined by plaintiff Mominna Ansoralli. \nThe two plaintiffs say CVS specifically directs its market investigators to target Black and Hispanic shoppers as shoplifting suspects. They allege the company’s store managers and loss prevention managers “regularly direct extremely offensive and highly racist comments” toward her and other CVS market investigators. \nThey also argue the company’s policy and management’s allegedly racist comments create a hostile work environment for the two of them and for other potential Class Members. \nIn its motion for summary judgment, CVS argues that Steele’s allegations frittered away in her deposition. According to the company, management directed Steele’s attention to particular shoppers because of those shoppers’ suspicious behavior, never because of their race. \nAs for Ansoralli’s claims, CVS argues the racist comments and orders she alleges were apparently not targeted at her own race. \n“While Ansoralli alleged comments about blacks and Hispanics, she testified that she does not identify as Hispanic, and there is no evidence that she identifies as black,” CVS points out. \nCVS further argues that both plaintiffs’ claims for hostile work environment hold no water because neither plaintiff availed herself of the company’s internal complaint process before filing suit. The company says it’s therefore entitled to an affirmative defense under existing case law. \nThe plaintiffs are proposing to represent a Class consisting of all CVS market investigators, store detectives, and other employees with similar jobs who either have worked in New York City or who have worked under the same Regional Loss Prevention Managers as the New York City market investigators. \nThey seek a declaratory judgment stating that the alleged actions by CVS violate federal and state laws, as well as a court order requiring CVS to cease the actions complained of and to take steps to mitigate their effects. They also seek an award of damages, court costs, attorneys’ fees, and interest on all amounts due. \nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor, David E. Gottlieb, Michael J. Willemin and Kenneth Sommer of Wigdor LLP \nThe CVS Market Investigator Discrimination Class Action Lawsuit is Sheree Steele, et al. v. CVS Pharmacy Inc. , Case No. 1:15-cv-04261, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. We tell you about cash you can claim EVERY WEEK! Sign up for our free newsletter.

Show Caption Previous Next \nLEBANON, Ohio - A Florida man has repaid $22,000 and was sentenced to two years in prison for stealing Rogaine and other items from dozens of Ohio stores. \nAndres W. Arias, 36, of Boca Raton, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Warren County Common Pleas Court to engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine and Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell announced. \nArias worked within a criminal network between Florida and New Jersey to steal about $22,000 worth of merchandise from Walgreens stores in Cuyahoga County and Summit County, as well as stores in two southwest Ohio counties, officials said. \nAs part of the scheme, he flew to targeted cities, rented vehicles and drove to the stores. Once inside, he concealed items including Rogaine, Prevagen and Alli in false pockets in his pants and left without paying for them, and then shipped the stolen merchandise to associates in New Jersey who deposited money in his bank account, officials said. \n\"As a result of the hard work of law enforcement and prosecutors, this defendant, who stole thousands of dollars’ worth of merchandise from Ohio stores, has paid restitution and will be serving time for his actions,\" DeWine said.
