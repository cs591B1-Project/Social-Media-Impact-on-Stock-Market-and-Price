      "text": "0 \nIt was during E3 that Microsoft surprised and enthused gamers by making an unexpected announcement. That is, their plans to enter the custom controller business, making them the inaugural first party manufacturer to do so. Needless to say, it created quite a talking point, with everyone from collectors and enthusiasts to casual gamers wanting to design an Xbox One controller that would highlight their inner selves. \nThanks to Microsoft, We Got This Covered was able to obtain a code that allowed us to design, order and test out one of these Design Lab custom controllers for editorial purposes. I was lucky enough to get that opportunity – being the controller collector and obsessor that I am – and took to the process with much excitement. The result is something truly my own, which, while somewhat basic, advertises both my love of red and subdued personality. \nThe process is rather simple. To start, one must visit the Xbox Design Labs, wherein they’ll be presented with a decent amount of colour-coded options. It doesn’t take long – maybe five minutes or so – and is very easy to understand, as all you need to do is click on the colours you want each part to be, before hitting next. If you want a blue controller with pink triggers and shoulder buttons, so be it. Or, if you’re like me and want a heavy dose of red, that option is available too. As people have proven, there are a lot of possibilities to be discovered, allowing each gamer (and personality type) to be serviced. \nWhat’s nice is that, in addition to two-dimensional images, a 3D version of your creation can be inspected and rotated before purchase. It’s not exact, as the final product will likely look a bit different, but it’s a good guideline for what to expect. \nIn addition to being able to select the colours for each part of your controller, including the face and back plates, the triggers and shoulder buttons, and all of the face buttons, you can also opt to personalize it further, by adding a name or nickname of your choice. This moniker – which costs about ten dollars extra to add – is written in golden text near the bottom of the accessory, nestled in-between its d-pad and its right joystick. Whether you go that extra mile is entirely up to you (and your budget, of course), but it certainly adds another layer of personalization to the already unique process. \nWhen I ordered my controller, E3 2016 had just finished, and June was coming to a close. Although it was hinted that the thing may ship during August, that wasn’t the case. In fact, I waited a bit longer than some others did before getting mine, and kept an impatient eye out for a shipping notice. \nSpeaking of which, it’s important to state that these controllers are manufactured and shipped from China. That didn’t cross my mind until I saw the tracking number and plugged it in, but I ended up getting to watch as my creation went from China to the Phillipines and then on to Anchorage, Alaska, before coming home to Canada. The thing is undoubtedly more of a world traveler than its owner is, and I’m happy to report that – thanks to some smart packaging – everything arrived in perfect condition, within a really nice-looking box that’s unique to the Design Labs process. \nI’ve since opened and tested out my newfound friend, and am pretty happy with the results. The red – which I worried I’d maybe overused – looks great, and the grey backplate is perfectly fitting. It works very well, too, outside of having shoulder buttons that make a louder clicking noise than I was expecting. Hopefully they’ll quiet down over time. \nBeing that they’re the new and redesigned Xbox One S controllers, those who purchase these expensive toys can expect all of the bells and whistles that come with that. This includes Bluetooth, a refined form factor and etched in grips. The only downside is, unfortunately, said grips, because they’re not nearly as defined as they should have been. In comparison to the black rubber grips that the special edition Forza Motorsport 6 and Lunar White controllers had, these imitations leave a lot to be desired. It is what it is, though, and at least they’re kind of there. \nAlthough your mind was likely made up before you visited this article, I hope that I’ve shone some light on the simple process that is creating an Xbox One Design Labs controller. It’s an impressive, fun and exciting option, and one that has led to some gorgeous creations. The only true downside is how expensive it is, especially for us Canadians who are looking at well over $100 before taxes. This impressions piece is based on a product we were provided with.

      "text": "Print This week, Microsoft has made it possible for anyone to use Skype without creating a Microsoft account. Also, they have introduced useful updates to Cortana and the Photos app in Windows 10. Not only that, but they also joined the Linux Foundation, as a Platinum Member. To learn more about these events as well as other interesting news, read this week’s recap: Microsoft: the news of the week These articles are this week's most important news in Microsoft's ecosystem: Now anyone can use Skype right away - If you've ever wanted to make a call on Skype but just didn't want to deal with the hassle of creating a Microsoft account, today is your lucky day. Now anyone can start a conversation directly from the web. Watch the video below to learn how. Redmond delights: 10 reasons to be excited about Microsoft's future - Microsoft is a very different company today from what it was two decades ago. It’s less complacent; where once it could rely on huge revenues from Windows and Office sales, greater competition and the rise of highly capable free alternatives has pushed Microsoft to stop resting on its laurels. Windows 10 Photos app adds inking and new filters for everyone on PC - Alongside inking and pen support — which is a big deal in and of itself — this update includes new filters for some extra editing mojo. Cortana Skill Update: Helping you keep track of your to-do list - With the new list skill, Cortana can now easily and conveniently help you manage your lists and keep track of the things you need to do so you don’t have to.

Patch Tuesday overhaul: Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal - Over the past year, IT admins and security professionals have had to deal with massive changes in the way Microsoft delivers updates. Beginning in 2017, they'll have to adjust to a new format for security bulletins as well. Microsoft—yes, Microsoft—joins the Linux Foundation - Microsoft, the company that has built an empire on proprietary, closed-source software, has joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. WINDOWS INSIDER MEMBERS GET A SNEAK PEEK OF CREATORS UPDATE WITH OFFICE HUB - On Thursday, Insider members received an update to the Get Office app that is installed as standard on Windows 10. The app is still labeled as Get Office in most contexts — but upon closer inspection in Task Manager, it is actually referred to as Office Hub. Visual Studio Mobile Center introduced, aims to simplify mobile app testing - Visual Studio Mobile Center aims to simplify mobile app testing for Android and iOS app developers. The service can connect with GitHub, allowing developers to be able to get started very easily with their app’s GitHub repository. Once setup, developers can easily build the app for Android and iOS from Mobile Center on the cloud. After that, they can also test the app right from Mobile Center which is very neat. Microsoft is going to pretend to release Visual Studio for Mac - The biggest news is that Visual Studio is coming to the Mac—or, at least, a piece of software named Visual Studio is coming to the Mac. Microsoft has always had a surprising willingness to give different products similar names, a move that generally provokes more confusion than it does enlightenment. The same seems true here. Microsoft adds Outlook Customer Manager to Office 365 SMB plan - Microsoft is adding a new customer relationship management tool that is accessible via Outlook to its Office 365 Business Premium plan for no additional cost for subscribers.

      "text": "3.04 Click to enlarge As seen above, Microsoft (at the time of my initial forecast in 2014) had been trading at a PE ratio of 15.80. The stock currently trades at a ratio of 28.88 at the time of writing. I had anticipated that at a 10 percent growth rate in earnings, Microsoft would be set to see $3.53 in earnings for the year 2016. Instead, while earnings have beat expectations, EPS for 2016 has come in at $2.79. Dividends per share were slightly above the projected target at $1.47. If it is assumed that EPS would grow at 10 percent per year for the next two years (while actual dividends were higher than forecast, I leave projected dividends unchanged to allow for potentially lower dividend growth in the following two years), then the EPS for Microsoft in two years time would stand at $3.37, which at a 7% discount rate in the terminal year (discounting for two years instead of five) would come to $2.94 . On this basis (assuming a terminal P/E of 22 as a more conservative estimate): Current P/E Ratio: 22 Terminal P/E * Estimated 2018 EPS: 22*2.94 = $64.68 Present Value of Dividends per Share Through to 2018: $5.54 Target Price in year 2018: $70.22 While the boost in target price has resulted from increased earnings expectations on the part of investors (due to a higher P/E ratio), I expect that should Microsoft maintain sufficient earnings growth of an average 10 percent or greater, then it is likely that we could see the company maintain a P/E ratio of around 22-28 and a target price between $70-80 . Needless to say, cloud is what is propelling this company forward. The unique draw of Azure lies in its compatibility with different applications such as the .Net programming language and ability to develop hybrid apps. While Amazon Web Services technically has the largest server capacity in the cloud space, Azure has become renowned for its compatibility and flexibility with existing Microsoft customers. As a result, Azure is used by more than 80 percent of the world's largest banks, along with 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies using at least two different cloud offerings by Microsoft. In this regard, I expect that while competition for cloud services with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) continues, I do not expect that this will pose a significant threat to Azure, owing not only to the compatibility aspect of Azure but also that enterprises have already negotiated significant contracts with Microsoft allowing for lower pricing options than can be obtained from competitors. Previously, I was somewhat skeptical as to whether Microsoft's cloud initiative would ultimately lift the business as a whole. However, it is now clear that the company's efforts are beginning to bear fruit, and I expect further upside from here.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s efforts to make HoloLens a productivity platform appears to be gathering momentum, with the latest company to adopt the technology being industrial technology provider General Electric.\nAt the 2016 GE Minds + Machines conference held recently Colin Parris, the vice president of GE Software Research showed off how the Microsoft HoloLens could help the company “talk” to their machines and service malfunctioning equipment such as industrial steam turbines.\nThe feature use a GE technology called “digital twins”, which are digital replicas of the machines they sell packed with data such as potential parts breakdowns, financial forecasts and the best way to fix problems, and which can use real operational data to predict which parts are likely in need of servicing.\nPotential customers can “speak” directly to the digital twin and ask it questions about its performance and potential issues, and receive natural language answers back.\nUsing the HoloLens GE and its customers can use augmented reality to look inside those machines without having to actually touch them.\n\n“This is happening now,” said Parris who works in Niskayuna after he talked to a digital twin of a steam turbine at a customer site in Southern California. The Hololens allowed him to open up the turbine and look at the parts – and see exactly which part may need replacing.\n“What you saw was an example of the human mind working with the mind of a machine.”\nParris noted HoloLens had wide-ranging applications including helping with factory design, and could help teach workers how to assemble parts even before they ever step on a factory floor.\nThe HoloLens is now available in USA, Canada, Australia, Ireland, France, Germany, New Zealand, and the UK.

      "text": "Microsoft Xbox, PlayStation, Other Popular Twitter Accounts Hacked GO The hack occurred via Twitter Counter, the firm confirms Nov 20, 2016 08:58   Several high-profile Twitter accounts got hacked last night to start posting links to services that are supposed to help users get free followers. The hacked accounts included @PlayStation, Microsoft’s @XboxSupport, @Viacom, @ICRC (owned by the Red Cross), @Money and others, and all tweeted ads to websites whose purpose is to increase the number of followers for other accounts. The hack didn’t target the aforementioned accounts themselves, but Twitter Counter, a service that provides statistics of Twitter usage and monitors tweets reach and clicks. Hackers thus obtained access to linked Twitter accounts and managed to post messages on their behalf. Messi, Charlie Sheen accounts also targeted Twitter Counter confirmed in a tweet that the service experienced a breach, but reacted quickly to block the attack. Most tweets have already been removed, but engadget has managed to take a screenshot of one of them posted via the @PlayStation account. “We can confirm that our service has been hacked; allowing posts on behalf of our users! We have launched an investigation into this matter,” the company said in the tweet. “As of now, the hackers CANNOT post on our users' behalf anymore. We will keep you posted on any other updates!” A report from Digital Trends indicates that some other accounts were also targeted, including the one owned by US National Transportation Safety Board, Charlie Sheen, Lionel Messi, astronaut Leland Melvin, and Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton. Specifics on how many accounts were affected by the breach are not available right now, but the attack was specifically aimed at popular accounts. At this point, the attack should no longer pose a threat to accounts, but if you’re also using Twitter Counter, it might be a good idea to change your password just to make sure you are on the safe side. Also, have a look at your timeline because there might be some posts published on your behalf and linking to services to obtain free followers.",

      "text": "1 Skype for Linux hasn't been updated since 2014, and is slowly losing functionality, as Microsoft is implementing new protocols. It's very probable Skype for Linux can't do video calls anymore, because of the lack of updates. Make sure your camera works in another app, like Cheese. If it does, it's Skype that's the issue, and unfortunately, you're probably going to have to wait for Alpha to complete. – Zacharee1 Sep 14 at 23:57 1 Skype in Ubuntu may not be great but it can work correctly with the camera if the drivers work. You can test with a usb camera if you have one or make sure that the drivers are correctly installed. This may help help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam – Katu Sep 15 at 8:10 The webcam works fine with cheese. I've tested it on webcam test websites too and it seem okay. It's just doesn't work with Skype.

      "text": "Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nMicrosoft’s Surface line of Windows 10 hardware has been the topic of a great deal of discussion lately. The Surface Pro 4 , Surface Book , and now Surface Studio desktop are examples of the best that the Windows ecosystem has to offer, and Microsoft doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon.\nOne of the knocks against the Surface devices so far, however, has been in the firmware and drivers that Microsoft has made available. Battery problems, display unreliability, and more have been news as well, and Microsoft has been busy issuing updates to fix a variety of issues. On Thursday, Microsoft pushed yet another update with the release of Surface Book driver updates.\nMore: Surface Book with Performance Base announced alongside Surface Studio AIO\nThe last set of new drivers and firmware for the Surface Book came on October 28 with a long list of updates including everything from the UEFI firmware to a new Wi-Fi driver to new software to support the Surface Book with Performance Base. The updates for November are significantly less impressive.\nSpecifically, three drivers were updated for the Surface Book. First up is version 1.2.0.70 of the Intel Precise Touch Device driver, which is aimed at reducing false touch events when the Surface Book lid is closed. Next is a new driver for the dedicated Nvidia GeForce GPU, to version 21.21.13.6961 to improve system stability. Finally, the Surface UEFI drivers were updated to version 90.1380.768.0, also to improve system stability.\nYou can get these driver updates immediately by going to “All Settings” in the Action Center, then “Update & security,” then “Windows Update.” Hit the “Check for updates button to download the latest drivers.” If your system is configured to automatically download updates, you might already have them installed.\nOnce you reboot, if instructed, then you will have the latest and greatest set of drivers and firmware for your Surface Book. Microsoft has done a decent job of late in getting issues resolved, and so hopefully November’s updates will provide you with a more stable Windows 10 2-in-1 device.\nEverything you must know about Windows 10 Creators Update and Surface Studio The newest Surface driver update hopes to fix battery life, touch, pen, and more Unfortunately, Microsoft did not just tease a black Surface Book 2",

      "text": "Microsoft brings app updates for Bing, Cortana, Next Lock Screen By 0 \nMicrosoft may have gotten a lot of flack over the years (as do most huge tech brands, to be honest) but for the past years or so, they have been creating great mobile related products like apps and programs to adapt to the new digital lifestyle of users. And the apps that they’ve created continue with great updates so that they will also be able to adjust to what users actually need from their smartphones. They’ve released several updates for search app Bing, voice digital assistant Cortana, and lock screen app Next Lock Screen. \nBing may always play second fiddle to that other big search engine that we all use as a verb, but it continue to improve its app in the hopes that people will switch or make it their secondary search engine. The latest update adds more new features, including Bing 360 Search, which lets you search in the real world through augmented reality. You’ll be able to use it with Near Me and Camera Search. It also how has music search so you can look for songs and lyrics quickly, and a smoother and simpler Browser view. \nFor Cortana , it now has a new list skill which can help you in creating your to-do lists without having to type things out. Just ask Cortana to “create a list” for you and then add things to that list, whether it’s a Holiday list, a work-related task list or a grocery list. And if you already use Wunderlist, one of the more popular list apps out there, you will now be able to incorporate Cortana into it, so you can add due dates to your To-Dos and create shared lists from Wunderlist. \nLastly, Next Lock Screen , which both protects your device and gives you more ways to be productive as well, now supports volume controls on top of your lock screen, as well as more devices that have fingerprint unlock. The GPU performance has also been improved and more importantly, the memory usage the app consumes has been reduced. You can update all three apps now through their respective programs. TAGS",

      "text": "Reddit \nMicrosoft and HP are working on a consumer-tier Windows 10 Mobile phone, according to sources. This would follow the HP Elite X3 , a phablet with a hefty price tag and features like Continuum and HP Workspace. Details about this tipped consumer-tier Windows phone are still slight at the moment, though the same sources say Microsoft has announced a phone event internally for February 2017, highlighting a timeframe in which we may see this handset announced. \nThe information comes from WindowsArea.de , a reliable German website that has a good track record with such rumors, one that stresses the new information is very reliable. Specs for the phone weren’t included in the leak, so we still don’t know what kind of handset — nor price range — consumers can expect when ( if ) the phone is unveiled. \nThe report also claims that Microsoft has announced (internally) an event it is planning to hold in February 2017, which could indicate a timeframe for the phone’s launch. That would make sense, assuming the phone rumor is true, as the event could be held on or close to Mobile World Congress 2017, which itself starts on February 27. \nMicrosoft has not confirmed or commented on any of these rumors, and as always, take them with a grain of salt. The big question this rumor raises is whether consumers still have any interest at all in owning a Windows Mobile phone, and the answer may depend on what kind of handset the two companies launch. Check out the timeline below for more Windows 10 Mobile news! \nNote: the image above shows the HP Elite x3 Story Timeline",

      "text": "Jared Newman 11.20.16 5:00 AM \nAs a lifelong musician, at first I felt slighted by Microsoft's newfound emphasis on creativity. \nThe upcoming Surface Studio desktop is a clear nod to visual artists, with a massive touch screen for sketching, painting, and graphic design, while the knoblike Surface Dial peripheral seems perfect for tool selection in Photoshop. Both devices will be buttressed by the Windows 10 Creators Update, which includes new programs for 3D modeling and drawing. Those announcements seemed to leave musicians out of the picture, so I asked makers of music software and digital audio devices whether Microsoft had been neglecting them. \nIt turns out the answer is no. Instead of feeling abandoned, musicians are intrigued by the new hardware and encouraged by recent under-the-radar improvements for musicians in Windows 10. As a result, Windows could soon do for musicians what it appears to be doing for artists, even if Microsoft hasn't done much to publicize it. Captive Audience \nWith digital music, one of the biggest concerns is making sure the software communicates properly with keyboards, mixers, and other gear. This requires having the right drivers, which Microsoft traditionally hasn't done a great job of providing. \nBut Ernst Nathorst-Böös, CEO of Propellerhead (maker of the popular recording software Reason), says Microsoft is now addressing these issues in Windows 10. In September, the company started testing native support for low-latency USB audio so musicians won't have to rely on a litany of third-party drivers for their gear. \n\"You can rest assured that whatever you buy in terms of software and hardware will always work, and you will get the performance you need,\" Nathorst-Böös says. \nMicrosoft has also been boosting its support for MIDI , a decades-old protocol that's commonly used to control synthesizers, synchronize instruments, and trigger effects. This summer's Windows 10 Anniversary update, for instance, added support for Bluetooth LE MIDI, a protocol for wireless music devices. \nFor IK Multimedia, that's a big deal, as it will allow devices like the Blueboard—a foot-pedal controller for guitar effects—to work with Windows. (Blueboard currently works with Mac and iOS devices only, and IK Multimedia is working on Windows support now.) \nBetween Bluetooth LE MIDI and USB audio, the company can very quickly make its existing hardware available to more customers. \"A huge part of the market will be opened for us,\" says Alessandro Fiorletta, IK Multimedia's software development manager. \nBut Fiorletta isn't completely satisfied. He notes that earlier versions of Windows still make up a sizable chunk of the IK Multimedia's audience, and Microsoft probably won't bring its music improvements to those versions. But he acknowledges that at least the company has been listening to musicians' concerns lately. \n\"We've had a lot of discussion with Microsoft about these issues in the past. Now it seems they are finally addressing some of these issues, which is very important,\" Fiorletta says. Features in Windows 10 suggest Microsoft is paying more attention to musicians. Stoked For Surface \nDigital music companies don't feel they're being snubbed by Microsoft on the hardware side, either. Although artwork is the obvious use case for Microsoft's Surface Studio and Surface Dial, they could prove useful for music creation as well. \n\"[Microsoft is] kind of identifying that touch screens are great, but you just need more tactile control,\" Ryan Wardell, Avid's director of audio workstations and surfaces, says of the knoblike Dial peripheral. Although Avid hasn't decided whether to support the Dial in its Pro Tools music production software, Wardell imagines it could be useful for controlling different mixing parameters and selecting tools. \nPropellerhead's Nathorst-Böös is also excited for the Surface Studio's jumbo touch screen, and how it might interact with the Dial, though he balks at the $3,000 starting price tag. Propellerhead's Reason \n\"If you can bring that kind of technology and power downmarket and make it available to musicians, I think you could build amazing stuff for that, both for making music and for DJing,\" he says. \nThat's not to say Microsoft needs its own hardware to capture music creators. Despite the conventional wisdom around the creative appeal of Mac computers, music makers don't have the same loyalty to Apple's platform that visual artists do. All three companies that I spoke to say their desktop users are split about evenly between Windows and Mac OS X. \nRyan Wardell, Avid's director of audio workstations and surfaces, offers an explanation: Digital musicians tend to build their own computers. Doing so is a natural progression from the musical instruments, recording gear, and mixing tools they've already cobbled together. Avid ProTools \n\"A lot of musicians have a unique do-it-yourself mentality, so some people see their ability to extend that to building homegrown computers,\" Wardell says. \nThat's precisely what happened with Propellerhead's Nathorst-Böös. After 30 years as a Mac user, he recently built his own desktop PC for his home studio and dedicated it to music creation. \n\"I think Windows 10 feels great and looks great, and I could buy a really compact small stationary computer for my studio in my home,\" Nathorst-Böös says. \"It's less expensive than a Mac, and it's fast.\" Amplifying The Message \nGiven that music software and hardware companies are satisfied with Windows, perhaps Microsoft's problem is perception. This may be partly Apple's doing, as it's been casting Windows PCs as uninspiring spreadsheet machines for over a decade . \nBut Microsoft hasn't helped. While Apple has packed the Mac with creative programs like iMovie and GarageBand, Windows hasn't been nearly as ambitious with its own creative software, offering only light photo editing tools and a bare-bones voice recorder in Windows 10. \nAs for third-party apps, Microsoft occasionally trots out Staffpad in its marketing materials as an example of how Windows can be useful for musicians. But notation is just one facet of music creation, and it's of little use to electronic musicians, producers, and— as the old joke goes —guitarists like me. \nChange may be coming on this front as well. In a teaser video for the Windows 10 Creators update coming early next year, Microsoft briefly showed a program called Groove Music Maker , which looked similar to Apple's GarageBand. Just as Microsoft's Surface devices help establish the high end of Windows PCs, a program like Groove Music Maker could help send a message about music creation on Windows 10. \n\"I welcome that, even though it would be competition for us,\" Propellerhead's Ernst Nathorst-Böös says, \"because it helps people understand the idea that their computer can be a musical instrument and a music-making device.\" \nIK Multimedia's Fiorletta agrees. After more than a decade in the digital music business, he's still surprised that guitar players never think to liberate their instruments from the amplifier for recording or effects. \n\"They're not aware,\" he says, \"that the computers they have can be useful for playing music.\" Never miss a story.

      "text": "Microsoft Launches Windows Defender Hub for Windows 10 GO New Windows Defender companion app available for download Nov 20, 2016 14:40 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just launched a new Windows 10 app whose purpose is to help users discover the benefits of Windows Defender security solution and always stay up to date with the latest security trends with information provided by the software giant itself. Called Windows Defender Hub , the application is available in the Store with a free license and works exclusively on PCs - a universal app doesn’t make much sense since Windows Defender is specifically aimed at desktop computers. Windows Defender Hub isn’t a super exciting app, but more of a companion app for Windows Defender, bringing you needs and features to check system security status and to control Windows Defender. There are also tips that help improve the security of the computer, as well as blog posts published by Microsoft on the official blogs. “Help protect your device with the antimalware protection built in to Windows 10. It’s already on your device! There’s nothing to buy, no subscriptions, and no nagware,” the description of the app reads. “Windows Defender Hub gives you access to Windows Defender, so you can easily check your protection status or scan your device. Windows Defender Hub also brings you articles from Microsoft about malware and viruses and the latest security trends, even if you use another antivirus program.” Windows Defender vs. third-party security products The launch of the new Windows Defender app comes only a few days after security firm Kaspersky criticized the software giant for its aggressive push in Windows 10 to convince users to replace third-party antivirus solutions with its own product. Kaspersky calls for a thorough investigation from Russian and European antitrust bodies, as they believe that Microsoft hurts competition by forcing users to abandon third-party security products and switch to Windows Defender. Microsoft has until now remained completely tight-lipped on Kaspersky’s criticism, but said that it would collaborate with authorities across the world should any formal complaints be filed.",

      "text": "Microsoft Internally Confirms Consumer Windows Phone Due in February GO The phone, however, won’t be manufactured by Microsoft Nov 19, 2016 07:12 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Everyone’s waiting for Microsoft to at least confirm the existence of the Surface Phone, especially given the rumors of the imminent death of Lumia brand, but there’s good news for Windows Phone users anyway, and not necessarily thanks to the software giant. It looks like HP is now working on a consumer Windows phone that could see daylight as soon as early 2017, and judging from the success of the Elite X3, this could be a really exciting project. Details are very scarce right now, but German site Dr. Windows reports that HP is working with Microsoft on a Windows 10 Mobile device that’s specifically aimed at consumers - the Elite X3 is indeed a super-flagship, but it’s specifically aimed at businesses. The upcoming Windows phone could use technology from the Lumia lineup, including ClearBlack screens, and adopt features such as Glance screen - which is missing on the HP Elite X3, so HP is clearly aiming for consumers with this new model. Coming in February 2017 According to the same report, Microsoft has internally confirmed a Windows phone coming in February 2017, and it’s believed that this is the new HP model. The timing aligns perfectly with the Mobile World Congress, the same event that witnessed the introduction of the Elite X3, so it makes sense for HP to join the conference with another model for Windows Phone fans. Furthermore, a consumer phone from HP also comes in line with Microsoft’s plans of supporting the Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem and working with partners on new devices, as the company itself explained earlier this year. “We will continue to support and update the Lumia devices that are currently in the market, and the development of Windows 10 phones by OEMs, such as HP, Acer, Alcatel, VAIO, and Trinity; as well as develop great new devices,” the firm said in a statement sent to partners in May. It goes without saying that the arrival of a new consumer Windows phone from a company like HP is a breath of fresh air for Windows 10 Mobile, especially given the hard time the platform is going through at the moment. Users and developers alike are leaving for Android and iOS, so it’ll be interesting to see how many people would actually try the upcoming consumer phone from HP. Or better said, how many consumers will still be in the Windows Phone world at the time of its launch. Thanks for the tip!",

      "text": "0 0 \nWhen it comes to enhancing its virtual assistant , Microsoft has never let us down. Cortana can now manage and track your to-do lists. What more can a holiday person wish for in this frenetic season of celebrations? \nThe newly introduced features of the app are quite simple, yet constructive: Cortana is now able to create your Groceries to-do list, that includes keeping track of your shopping cart: what to add, what not to add and what is left to add. The shopping cart can further be organized by specific lists, and that too by voice commands . Moreover, the lists are customizable, editable and modifiable. Integration with the popular list-making app Wunderlist , that Microsoft acquired back in June 2015, allows Windows 10 users to sign in with their personal Wunderlist accounts by going to Cortana’s Notebook and then selecting Connected Accounts. This will enable users to set a due date to their tasks on the to-do list through its mobile app. \nYou can connect Cortana to your Wunderlist account or set up a new account for greater functionality and access the lists you already have if you’re a current Wunderlist user. Connecting to Wunderlist gives you the ability to add due dates to your To Dos and create shared lists from the Wunderlist app. \nThe feature is currently available in English only on Windows 10 PCs and phones, as well as on iOS and Android, but it is still uncertain when the feature will make it to Xbox One . \nIt is the perfect time for Cortana to become smart enough to lend you a helping hand in holiday errands. Not only it is convenient, but also considerate of Microsoft to upgrade its personal digital assistant with a new “to do list” skill just in time for Christmas. Check it out for yourself by saying “Hey Cortana, create a Holiday list”. \n ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft’s built-in antivirus, Windows Defender , is used by millions of people to protect their computers. Unfortunately, sometimes Windows Defender can’t do its job because of various errors. \nOne of the most common Windows Defender error messages is the following: “ This app is turned off by Group Policy “. This message appears if you installed another antivirus programs or an anti-hacking tool that isn’t fully compatible with Microsoft’s build-in antivirus. Windows Defender is turned off by Group Policy \n1. For the reasons unknown , my windows defender appears to have been deactivated. It says that is done for the reasons of some Group Policy. No such policy intimation given to me. Can this be reactivated and how soon? 2. Not able to download any updates for Windows 10.Please help. \nThe good news is that there are two workarounds available to solve this problem . The troubleshooting steps involve modifying the Group Policy path in the Registry or permanently disabling the option to turn off Windows Defender from the Group Policy. How to fix “This App Is Turned Off By Group Policy” for Windows Defender Solution 1 – use regedit \n1. Type regedit in the Search bar and hit Enter 2. Go to HKey_Local_Machine\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender 3. Delete the value in the DisableAntiSpyware key \nMore specifically, some users will see two options: 1. Under type, it says – REG -DWORD 2. Under Data, it says – (invalid DWORD (32-bit) value) \nDouble click on the REG -DWORD and a small window will open where you can delete the value or set it to zero. If you can’t change the key value, delete the whole key. Solution 2 – use the Group Policy \n1. Log in as an administrator. Type gpedit.msc in the Search bar and hit Enter 2 Go to Local Computer Policy > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender \n3. Select Windows Defender > in the right-hand panel, you’ll see the option “Turn off Windows Defender” 4. Double click to open it 5. In the new window > select Disable > click OK to save the settings. \nThere you go, use one of these two methods and the Group Policy will no longer disable Windows Defender. \n ",

      "title": "Maybe Microsoft Isn't Ignoring Musicians After All",
      "text": "As a lifelong musician, at first I felt slighted by Microsoft&apos;s newfound emphasis on creativity.\nThe upcoming Surface Studio desktop is a clear nod to visual artists, with a massive touch screen for sketching, painting, and graphic design, while the knoblike Surface Dial peripheral seems perfect for tool selection in Photoshop. Both devices will be buttressed by the Windows 10 Creators Update, which includes new programs for 3D modeling and drawing. Those announcements seemed to leave musicians out of the picture, so I asked makers of music software and digital audio devices whether Microsoft had been neglecting them.\nIt turns out the answer is no. Instead of feeling abandoned, musicians are intrigued by the new hardware and encouraged by recent under-the-radar improvements for musicians in Windows 10. As a result, Windows could soon do for musicians what it appears to be doing for artists, even if Microsoft hasn&apos;t done much to publicize it.\nCaptive Audience With digital music, one of the biggest concerns is making sure the software communicates properly with keyboards, mixers, and other gear. This requires having the right drivers, which Microsoft traditionally hasn&apos;t done a great job of providing.\nBut Ernst Nathorst-Böös, CEO of Propellerhead (maker of the popular recording software Reason), says Microsoft is now addressing these issues in Windows 10. In September, the company started testing native support for low-latency USB audio so musicians won&apos;t have to rely on a litany of third-party drivers for their gear.\n\"You can rest assured that whatever you buy in terms of software and hardware will always work, and you will get the performance you need,\" Nathorst-Böös says.\nMicrosoft has also been boosting its support for MIDI , a decades-old protocol that&apos;s commonly used to control synthesizers, synchronize instruments, and trigger effects. This summer&apos;s Windows 10 Anniversary update, for instance, added support for Bluetooth LE MIDI, a protocol for wireless music devices.\nFor IK Multimedia, that&apos;s a big deal, as it will allow devices like the Blueboard—a foot-pedal controller for guitar effects—to work with Windows. (Blueboard currently works with Mac and iOS devices only, and IK Multimedia is working on Windows support now.)\nBetween Bluetooth LE MIDI and USB audio, the company can very quickly make its existing hardware available to more customers. \"A huge part of the market will be opened for us,\" says Alessandro Fiorletta, IK Multimedia&apos;s software development manager.\nBut Fiorletta isn&apos;t completely satisfied. He notes that earlier versions of Windows still make up a sizable chunk of the IK Multimedia&apos;s audience, and Microsoft probably won&apos;t bring its music improvements to those versions. But he acknowledges that at least the company has been listening to musicians&apos; concerns lately.\n\"We&apos;ve had a lot of discussion with Microsoft about these issues in the past. Now it seems they are finally addressing some of these issues, which is very important,\" Fiorletta says.\nFeatures in Windows 10 suggest Microsoft is paying more attention to musicians. Stoked For Surface Digital music companies don&apos;t feel they&apos;re being snubbed by Microsoft on the hardware side, either. Although artwork is the obvious use case for Microsoft&apos;s Surface Studio and Surface Dial, they could prove useful for music creation as well.\n\"[Microsoft is] kind of identifying that touch screens are great, but you just need more tactile control,\" Ryan Wardell, Avid&apos;s director of audio workstations and surfaces, says of the knoblike Dial peripheral. Although Avid hasn&apos;t decided whether to support the Dial in its Pro Tools music production software, Wardell imagines it could be useful for controlling different mixing parameters and selecting tools.\nPropellerhead&apos;s Nathorst-Böös is also excited for the Surface Studio&apos;s jumbo touch screen, and how it might interact with the Dial, though he balks at the $3,000 starting price tag.\nPropellerhead&apos;s Reason \"If you can bring that kind of technology and power downmarket and make it available to musicians, I think you could build amazing stuff for that, both for making music and for DJing,\" he says.\nThat&apos;s not to say Microsoft needs its own hardware to capture music creators. Despite the conventional wisdom around the creative appeal of Mac computers, music makers don&apos;t have the same loyalty to Apple&apos;s platform that visual artists do. All three companies that I spoke to say their desktop users are split about evenly between Windows and Mac OS X.\nRyan Wardell, Avid&apos;s director of audio workstations and surfaces, offers an explanation: Digital musicians tend to build their own computers. Doing so is a natural progression from the musical instruments, recording gear, and mixing tools they&apos;ve already cobbled together.\nAvid ProTools \"A lot of musicians have a unique do-it-yourself mentality, so some people see their ability to extend that to building homegrown computers,\" Wardell says.\nThat&apos;s precisely what happened with Propellerhead&apos;s Nathorst-Böös. After 30 years as a Mac user, he recently built his own desktop PC for his home studio and dedicated it to music creation.\n\"I think Windows 10 feels great and looks great, and I could buy a really compact small stationary computer for my studio in my home,\" Nathorst-Böös says. \"It&apos;s less expensive than a Mac, and it&apos;s fast.\"\nAmplifying The Message Given that music software and hardware companies are satisfied with Windows, perhaps Microsoft&apos;s problem is perception. This may be partly Apple&apos;s doing, as it&apos;s been casting Windows PCs as uninspiring spreadsheet machines for over a decade .\nBut Microsoft hasn&apos;t helped. While Apple has packed the Mac with creative programs like iMovie and GarageBand, Windows hasn&apos;t been nearly as ambitious with its own creative software, offering only light photo editing tools and a bare-bones voice recorder in Windows 10.\nAs for third-party apps, Microsoft occasionally trots out Staffpad in its marketing materials as an example of how Windows can be useful for musicians. But notation is just one facet of music creation, and it&apos;s of little use to electronic musicians, producers, and— as the old joke goes —guitarists like me.\nChange may be coming on this front as well. In a teaser video for the Windows 10 Creators update coming early next year, Microsoft briefly showed a program called Groove Music Maker , which looked similar to Apple&apos;s GarageBand. Just as Microsoft&apos;s Surface devices help establish the high end of Windows PCs, a program like Groove Music Maker could help send a message about music creation on Windows 10.\n\"I welcome that, even though it would be competition for us,\" Propellerhead&apos;s Ernst Nathorst-Böös says, \"because it helps people understand the idea that their computer can be a musical instrument and a music-making device.\"\nIK Multimedia&apos;s Fiorletta agrees. After more than a decade in the digital music business, he&apos;s still surprised that guitar players never think to liberate their instruments from the amplifier for recording or effects.\n\"They&apos;re not aware,\" he says, \"that the computers they have can be useful for playing music.\"",

      "text": "ID2Office Plugin Updated for InDesign File Conversion to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Keynote Posted on November 20, 2016 \nWhile Adobe InDesign is ubiquitous in office environments for creating a wide range of corporate publications, it's often necessary to move data out of InDesign so that it can be used in presentations, reports or other internal documents. The task can be an ugly one, so you'd think a dedicated tool to speed the process and maintain as much formatting as possible would find a ready audience. Despite that, Recosoft states that ID2Office is unique in its capability to export InDesign data to Word, PowerPoint Keynote formats. \nSuch a conversion wouldn't have much value if formatting wasn't preserved. Recosoft claims that ID2Office converts the text, associated fonts and styles, paragraph structure, corresponding property information, frames linking information, tables, graphics and other InDesign object and document properties to the matching export format object and file properties, thereby converting every page into an equivalent page in the resulting file. Options are provided for fine-tuning such aspects of the conversion as image type, image resolution, frames linking and paragraph spacing. Also of note is the ability to export to Apple Keynote format (in the Professional version); the ability to convert InDesign nested tables to nested tables in Word, and also represent them as separate table objects in PowerPoint and Keynote; and support for Microsoft Word 2010-2013 format. \nVersion 2.2 supports the new InDesign 2017 file format and has been augmented to convert style sheet properties defined in InDesign tables into Microsoft Word style sheet properties, while paragraph rules are converted to Word paragraph borders. In addition, it's said conversion fidelity has been improved in several ways when exporting InDesign files to Word, PowerPoint and Keynote formats. All that is great, although it also indicates how little is new in InDesign CC 2017. This lack of innovation has reached the point where Adobe seems to want us to reconsider QuarkXPress as an InDesign alternative. Sure, why not? \nID2Office Standard for Mac and Windows InDesign CS6-CC 2017 can be purchased on the Recosoft site for an annual subscription of $199, with the Mac-only Professional edition priced at $249. Trial versions are available for download.",

      "text": "Microsoft may have gotten a lot of flack over the years (as do most huge tech brands, to be honest) but for the past years or so, they have been creating great mobile related products like apps and programs to adapt to the new digital lifestyle of users. And the apps that they’ve created continue with great updates so that they will also be able to adjust to what users actually need from their smartphones. They’ve released several updates for search app Bing, voice digital assistant Cortana, and lock screen app Next Lock Screen.\nBing may always play second fiddle to that other big search engine that we all use as a verb, but it continue to improve its app in the hopes that people will switch or make it their secondary search engine. The latest update adds more new features, including Bing 360 Search, which lets you search in the real world through augmented reality. You’ll be able to use it with Near Me and Camera Search. It also how has music search so you can look for songs and lyrics quickly, and a smoother and simpler Browser view.\nFor Cortana , it now has a new list skill which can help you in creating your to-do lists without having to type things out. Just ask Cortana to “create a list” for you and then add things to that list, whether it’s a Holiday list, a work-related task list or a grocery list. And if you already use Wunderlist, one of the more popular list apps out there, you will now be able to incorporate Cortana into it, so you can add due dates to your To-Dos and create shared lists from Wunderlist.\nLastly, Next Lock Screen , which both protects your device and gives you more ways to be productive as well, now supports volume controls on top of your lock screen, as well as more devices that have fingerprint unlock. The GPU performance has also been improved and more importantly, the memory usage the app consumes has been reduced. You can update all three apps now through their respective programs.",

      "text": "Microsoft has helped well-known legally bling Scottish landscape artist Keith Salmon add a sound element to his landscape paintings.\nSalmon creates ethereal, moody abstracts of skylines and mountains inspired by the rugged highlands in his country and as his eyesight has diminished through diabetic retinopathy he has learnt how to smash paint into texture and scratch pastels for scribbles to evoke less a depiction of place and more an exquisite experience of the wild.\nWith Microsoft’s help he has debuted an installation which uses sound to enrich his art even more, with proxemic audio to interpret two-dimensional images.\nCalled “The Oregon Project,” it uses four Kinects, 15 overhead speakers and 54 soundtracks to produce an acoustic and spatial interpretation of three drawings Salmon did of the beautifully remote Hells Canyon area in Oregon.\n\nIn front of each drawing is a 3D space containing 18 soundtracks that can be played. The Kinects track movement to trigger different sounds, making the art lively and interactive for people with and without vision. From afar, observers can hear birdsong, rushing water and grass swishing in the wind — recorded in Hells Canyon by Salmon and his collaborators.\nMoving closer activates digital tones matched to Salmon’s palette of blue, green, brown and ochre. Stand even closer and you can hear Salmon working in his studio as he scribbles pastels on paper, in an experience that parallels how a sighted person can see details when leaning in. The Kinects also track hand waves to change what you hear, helping observers become part of the piece and make their own acoustic mixes with movement. At the exhibit, adults triggered sounds primarily by walking, while kids jumped and waved their arms to produce a different blend of noise.\n“As a way of moving from an outer to inner layer to the drawings, natural sounds to industrial sounds works really well,” Salmon says. “It has a wonderful, atmospheric, spacey, landscape-y feel that pulls the whole thing together.”\nMany museums offer experiences for people with visual impairment, from detailed audio descriptions of art to special events where people can touch sculptures with gloved hands. But the researchers wanted to create a more personalized experience that was still communal, and something less directed and curated by docents.\n“It would be great to think that in a few years, you might go to a national museum or art gallery and this technology would be there as part of the experience,” says Salmon.\nThe installation premiered in Seattle at the 9e2 exhibit of art and technology as a powerful new way for Salmon to create and for people with low vision to experience and enjoy visual art. The “Oregon Project” will be on display at the Tent Gallery at the Edinburgh College of Art in Scotland in April of 2017.\nRead more about the work at Microsoft here .\n",

      "title": "Microsoft starts shipping pre-ordered Surface Studios",
      "text": "\nIf you’re lucky enough to have purchased a Surface Studio shortly after launch, check your emails, Microsoft has apparently begun shipping those pre-orders this week.\nTurret reports that some early purchasers have received an email notifying them that their package has been processed and will be out for delivery the week of November 21 (this week).\nThe Surface Studio has already been reviewed this past week, with critics praising its beautiful design and gorgeous screen but panning it for its high price and relatively long in the tooth internals (which links back to the price).\nUltimately, the biggest question potential Surface Studio buyers should face is not whether they want it, but whether they need it. The breadth of the Windows ecosystem already contains several beautiful All in Ones already, many of which are already suited towards the general consumer and are already cheaper.\nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio inhabits a unique space, much like its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, as a device which is a derivative of a main stream product (laptops for the Surface Book, ultra books for the Surface Pro) but being laser focused towards a particular demographic – in this case creatives like artists and archaeologists. Anyone can love and use this product, but it would be most valuable in the hands of someone who uses it to its potential.\nYou can still purchase the Surface Studio from Microsoft’s store link here , but deliveries are now slated for early 2017.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nGive Microsoft credit for not giving up. Even though Google’s Chrome has a massive share of the browser market ( 2 billion installs served , as McDonalds used to say), the Redmond campus continues to press forward with its Edge browser. Being the kindly tech big brother that it is, Microsoft would just like to let you know that in its opinion, Edge is a “safer” browser than Chrome or Firefox. Yes, Opera browser fans, we acknowledge your passion, but at least Microsoft didn’t single you out. \nNeowin reminds us of those past pesky Windows 10 notifications that used to remind you Chrome was draining your battery faster than Edge . They’re back, and this time Microsoft is touting its Internet Explorer successor as a “safer” alternative. In the past, Windows Tips were used as an instructional means to educate users about the OS. However, with notifications such as these, it’s easy to see that the educational aspect has been blurred, and it is now little more than a commercial for their nascent software. \nVentureBeat says this new “tip” has just rolled out this month, and appears just above the Edge taskbar icon. In case you didn’t know this — it points out that the browser blocks “21 percent more socially engineered malware.” You can turn off this notification, too. Go to Settings > System > Notifications > Disable “Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows.” \nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Edition aims to knock down ransomware \nObviously, it is in Microsoft’s best interests to promote its browser, and its latest OS is one prime piece of tech real estate for such a task. However, given the enormous and seemingly insurmountable lead that Chrome has, and with others like Firefox, Opera, Safari, and even work-in-progress effort Vivaldi out there, is Microsoft just howling at the moon here? \nFor a little nostalgia, look at the IE market share from 4 years ago . Hmmm, if you look at that pie chart and put Chrome where IE shows, it would pretty much reflect present day, yet we now know where IE has ended up. Maybe Chrome’s lead isn’t so impervious?",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Todd Holmdahl will direct Microsoft’s quantum computing efforts. Credit Ian C. Bates for The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today’s digital computers. There is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible — and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics. Microsoft’s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs. In the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company’s approach is based on “braiding” particles known as anyons — which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions — to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles. Leading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today’s digital systems. Unlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an “entangled” state — physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined — with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits. Microsoft began funding research in the field in 2005 when it quietly set up a laboratory known as Station Q under the leadership of the mathematician Michael Freedman. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Microsoft now believes that it is close enough to designing the basic qubit building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete computer, said Todd Holmdahl, a veteran engineering manager who will direct the Microsoft effort. Over the years, he has led various Microsoft projects, including its Xbox video game machine and the yet-to-be-released HoloLens augmented reality system. “Once we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,” Mr. Holmdahl said. There is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created. A variety of alternative research programs are trying to create qubits using different materials and designs. The Microsoft approach, known as topological quantum computing, is based on a field that took on new energy when this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists who had done fundamental work in forms of matter that may exist in just two dimensions. Mr. Holmdahl’s project will also include the physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University, Charles M. Marcus of the University of Copenhagen, David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of E.T.H. Zurich. They will all become Microsoft employees as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group that Microsoft recently created under the leadership of one of its top technical employees, Harry Shum. Microsoft’s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits. “The magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,” Dr. Marcus said. The researchers recently made a “remarkable breakthrough” in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story So far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today’s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor’s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes. That would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition. More immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility the physicist Richard P. Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982. For his part, Dr. Kouwenhoven said, “My dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.”",

      "text": "New project to be key demo platform for Microsoft HoloLens Monday, 21 November 2016, 1:29 pm \nMEDIA RELEASE \nMicrosoft NZ announces strategic partnership with AV/VR Garage to build Kiwi investment in Mixed Reality technology innovation \nNew ATEED project to be key demo platform for Microsoft HoloLens in New Zealand \nAUCKLAND, 21 November 2016 – Microsoft New Zealand announced today that it will be the first global technology brand to officially partner with the new Auckland-based Augmented and Virtual Reality development facility, AV/VR Garage, through which it will introduce the new Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Holographic technology to the growing Kiwi community of Mixed Reality innovators. \nThe AR/VR Garage – established by Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) as part of the region’s wider innovation network – has been set up to accelerate and showcase the development of New Zealand’s AR/VR capability with a view to creating globally significant outcomes across key sectors. \nThe AR/VR Garage is connected to world leading international associations, societies and multinationals looking to utilise emerging technologies to transform their areas of influence. The Garage includes project research and development space where virtual teams from around the world can collaborate on complex proof-of-concept and prototyping innovations, as well as co-location space for Auckland’s burgeoning AR/VR community. \nChris Auld, Director of Developer Experience for Microsoft New Zealand, says the company is excited about the potential for the strategic partnership with AR/VR Garage to build the profile for Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Holographic technology, both with developers in New Zealand, and commercial customers and partners here and around the globe. \n“Since announcing last month that the world’s first self-contained holographic computer, Microsoft HoloLens, is available for pre-order in New Zealand with devices starting to ship in late November, the interest and demand for demonstrations from local developers has been significant.” \nAuld says Microsoft HoloLens will be showcased within the AR/VR Garage and used by start-up companies on their own applications, but will also be used in collaborative projects aimed at developing world leading outcomes and applications. \n“We are proud to be one of the inaugural strategic partners for this initiative, and are looking forward to HoloLens finding its place in the pipeline of innovative project opportunities within the state-of-the-art facility that ATEED has established in the AR/VR Garage,” says Auld. \nDean Butchers, GM of Business Attraction and Investment for ATEED, says he warmly welcomes Microsoft’s strategic partnership with the AR/VR Garage and believes it will be an ideal complement to Microsoft’s mixed reality strategy by enabling it to further build networks in Auckland’s AR/VR industry. \n“We are delighted to now have one of the world’s leading technology companies become an AR/VR Garage partner, and we look forward to the expertise, vision and global connections that Microsoft will bring to the facility,” says Butchers. \nButchers says Augmented and Virtual Reality have the potential to become the next big computing platforms globally, in the process creating new markets and disrupting existing markets. \n“As the technology advances, price points decline and new applications for the technology are established, AR/VR will become a multi-billion-dollar industry, and ATEED is determined to help position Auckland and New Zealand at the forefront of this wave,” says Butchers. \nSince it opened in September, the AR/VR Garage has established strong working alliances with emerging global industry leaders. The Garage will be the Oceania base of the influential VR Society, which already has chapters in Beijing and Canada, and last year secured about US$170 million of VR projects for its global members. \nFor more information about the AR/VR Garage, visit: http://www.arvrgarage.nz \n- ENDS -",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft partners with D-Link to deliver speedier Wi-Fi in rural regions Microsoft has joined forces with networking equipment maker D-Link to deliver faster Wi-Fi to rural communities around the world. | Topic: Networking \nMicrosoft is partnering with networking equipment manufacturer D-Link to deliver speedier Wi-Fi to rural communities around the world, D-Link chairman John Hsuan announced in Taipei on Monday. \nDubbed \"Super Wi-Fi\", the wireless infrastructure is set to be based on the 802.11af protocol, and will take advantage of unused bandwidth in the lower-frequency white spaces between television channel frequencies where signals travel further than at higher frequencies. Latest Australian news ​Centrelink payments overhaul heads interstate seeking talent \nA pilot of the first phase is commencing in an unnamed American state, with trials also slated to run in three other countries. \n\"D-Link sees ourselves at the very heart of this kind of technical innovation and development. We also acknowledge that we have a role to play in helping all countries and future generations better connect,\" said Sydney-based D-Link managing director for ANZ Graeme Reardon. \n\"Our goal is to use all of our 30 years' experience and expertise and our global footprint to help deliver Super Wi-Fi as a technological platform for growth to the world's underdeveloped regions.\" \nThis is not the first time Microsoft has used white spaces to take advantage of local mesh networks with low-cost radios; in 2015, Microsoft used white spaces radio to help with disaster recovery in the Philippines . \nIn the same year, students at a remote Ghanaian college became the first people in Africa able to buy internet connectivity delivered using Microsoft-backed TV white spaces, after the Ghanaian regulator granted the first licence to operate a commercial white spaces network on the continent. \nEarlier this year, Microsoft's plan to connect 1 billion people in India using white spaces ran into trouble, however. Microsoft had requested that the Indian government allot unused spectrum so that it could provide last-mile connectivity in the remote regions of the country, but the government rejected the plea upon pressure from local telecommunications firms, which demanded unused spectrum to not be given for free to any organisation. \nA few months later, the Indian government decided to conduct experiments using TV white space technology, allotting 127MHz of spectrum to eight local organisations. \nMicrosoft is not the only company looking at ways to expand internet availability, with Google's Project Loon taking a different approach by releasing balloons that act as extenders for broadband penetration. In February, Google started testing its air-balloon beamed internet service in Sri Lanka, after striking a deal for spectrum with the government. \nSky and Space Global earlier this year also announced plans to provide mobile coverage for remote regions globally by launching 200 nano-satellites into space off the back of Virgin Galactic's LauncherOne vehicle. \nAustralian Securities Exchange-listed Sky and Space aims to build a wholesale narrowband low-cost voice and data network through the provision of satellite services that it will sell to telecommunications providers throughout equatorial Asia, South America, Central America, and Africa, as well as to shipping companies and airliners operating in those areas. \nRemote coverage in Australia is also being expanded by the federal government's mobile blackspot program. The first round of funding was opened in December 2014, with Telstra and Vodafone Australia securing AU$185 million in government funding to build or upgrade 499 mobile towers across Australia. \nThe Australian government then announced the second round of the program in early December last year, providing a further AU$60 million to those participating, and the Coalition in May pledged to spend an additional AU$60 million to fund a third round of the mobile blackspot program to build or upgrade a further 900 mobile towers.

      "text": "E-mail \nWhile Sony has had the jump on Microsoft by up to a year with the recent release of the PlayStation 4 Pro, the latter’s forthcoming Xbox One upgrade, codenamed Scorpio, is expected to beat out its rival in terms of power when it is released next year. The Scorpio, which packs in 6 TFLOPS of computing power , will have a “significant advantage” over the PS4 Pro, according to Mark Williams, Technical Director at VooFoo Studios, developer of Mantis Burn Racing . \n“It has generally been more difficult to reach 60fps on Xbox One than on PS4, so Scorpio will be a very welcome change,” Williams told GamingBolt . “I’ve yet to see the functional differences in the Scorpio GPU, so it remains to be seen how much of a difference there will actually be, but Scorpio definitely has a significant advantage in terms of memory bandwidth, so we’ll definitely be seeing higher fidelity games on there.” \nWilliams also claimed that, while the Scorpio will be slightly hamstrung by the fact that it will only be able to run standard Xbox One-compatible games, comparing the graphical output as being akin to the same game running on different PC graphics cards. \n“Yes, definitely,” he added. “We have to maintain parity from a functional and gameplay point of view, but we can really go to town on ramping up the visual quality. It’s like having a PC game where you get a new graphics card and now you can ramp all the graphics settings up to maximum – it’s the same game, but it looks a hell of a lot nicer.” \nRecent reports suggest that the Scorpio will be out in time for Christmas 2017. Xbox head Phil Spencer said : “We want to give you the information to make that decision. We also want to go talk to the developers that are out there today, that are building games for next holiday, and say here’s what you’re going to have at your disposal on the console side.”",

      "text": "[Return to Assistive Technology: LSU Overview] Converting PDFs from Microsoft Office Software Adobe Acrobat software has an application that works with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that allows you to make PDF documents accessible. This creates a \"tagged\" document that is accessible to assistive technology. Tags in a PDF allow you to control the reading order of the document. Use headings to format the document and allow for accessible navigation of the file. It may be necessary to disable PDF integration with web browsers because it can be difficult for the visually impaired and can throw off screen readers. Accessible Content in PDFs When using an image in a file converted from Word, Excel, or PowerPoint be sure to add a text description for that image. Depending on the length of the description, it may be necessary to explain the content of the image in a paragraph leading into or following the image. Some PDF documents are in a format that reads them as an image. In order for the screen reading software to recognized the file, it is necessary to apply Optical Character Recognition to the document. This will allow the accessibility software to read the text that is actually on the page instead of the image as a whole. Some OCR programs include OmniPage, ABBY FineReader, and the Text Recognition tool in Adobe Acrobat.",

      "title": "Microsoft Spends Big to Build a Computer Out of Science Fiction",
      "text": " count=\"244\" data-total-count=\"244\">SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of today’s digital computers. There is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum computers, superpowerful devices that were once the stuff of science fiction, are possible — and may even be practical. If these machines work, they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial intelligence, as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics.\nMicrosoft’s decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology companies, including Google and IBM, which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs.\nIn the exotic world of quantum physics, Microsoft has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path. The company’s approach is based on “braiding” particles known as anyons — which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions — to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles.\nLeading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum machines, both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as qubits that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for today’s digital systems.\nUnlike conventional transistors, which can be only on or off at any one time, representing a digital 1 or 0, qubits can exist in superposition, or simultaneously in both states. If qubits are placed in an “entangled” state — physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined — with many other qubits, they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously. A quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of qubits.\nMicrosoft began funding research in the field in 2005 when it quietly set up a laboratory known as Station Q under the leadership of the mathematician Michael Freedman.\n Microsoft now believes that it is close enough to designing the basic qubit building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete computer, said Todd Holmdahl, a veteran engineering manager who will direct the Microsoft effort. Over the years, he has led various Microsoft projects, including its Xbox video game machine and the yet-to-be-released HoloLens augmented reality system.\n“Once we get the first qubit figured out, we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of qubits in a rather straightforward way,” Mr. Holmdahl said.\nThere is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created.\nA variety of alternative research programs are trying to create qubits using different materials and designs. The Microsoft approach, known as topological quantum computing, is based on a field that took on new energy when this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists who had done fundamental work in forms of matter that may exist in just two dimensions.\nMr. Holmdahl’s project will also include the physicists Leo Kouwenhoven of Delft University, Charles M. Marcus of the University of Copenhagen, David Reilly of the University of Sydney and Matthias Troyer of E.T.H. Zurich.\nThey will all become Microsoft employees as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group that Microsoft recently created under the leadership of one of its top technical employees, Harry Shum.\nMicrosoft’s newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable qubits.\n“The magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and superconductors,” Dr. Marcus said. The researchers recently made a “remarkable breakthrough” in their ability to control the materials used to form qubits, he said. Most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures.\n So far, there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than today’s digital computers. One early effort, known as Shor’s algorithm, would be used to factor numbers, giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes.\nThat would potentially have world-shaking consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers. Other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning algorithms, which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition.\nMore immediately, however, these tools might advance the basic understanding of physics, a possibility the physicist Richard P. Feynman mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in 1982.\nFor his part, Dr. Kouwenhoven said, “My dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum physics.”",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nThe 2016 American Music Awards red carpet were wet, as Los Angeles delivered an uncharacteristic downpour on the music event held at the Microsoft Theatre. \nLady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Sting, Taraji P. Henson, Tim McGraw and John Legend & Chrissy Teigen were among those who stopped to show off their award show finery. \nThere were acres of leg and plunging necklines on display, though often paired with umbrellas and warm coats, as the celebs attempted to navigate the downpour. \nWho looked best when the weather was at its worst (at least for keeping your red carpet look undampened)? Check out the photos and see who looked best, who looked worst and who could handle Z LaLa’s wild, swooping hairdo at the big event. Advertisement",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) Jordan Strauss \nIdina Menzel, right, arrives at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is still demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nProducer Diplo echoed that sentiment. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is still demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nProducer Diplo echoed that sentiment. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is still demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nProducer Diplo echoed that sentiment. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

      "text": "COMMENTS SteveÂ Granitz/WireImage Idina Menzel attends the 2016 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on Nov.Â 20, 2016 in Los Angeles. \nThis weekend's news cycle was surprisingly dominated by Broadway, after VP-elect Mike Pence attended Hamilton on Friday night (Nov. 18) and was booed by his fellow audience members . After sounding off about the situation on the red carpet ahead of the American Music Awards on Sunday night, Broadway vet Idina Menzel shouted out the Hamilton cast and mocked the situation while presenting an award at the AMAs. \nMenzel presented an award with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who joked that he was not getting an invite to Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in January. \"I know how you feel,\" Menzel quipped. \"Us unsafe, scary theater people wouldn't be invited to the inauguration, either. I love you, Hamilton !\" \nOn Friday night, the Hamilton cast acknowledged Pence's presence at their performance and issued a statement about his anti-inclusive politics; Trump took to Twitter to denounce the speech as Pence being \"harassed.\" On the AMAs red carpet, here's what Menzel had to say about the situation to Billboard: \n\"I think they were extremely courageous, 100 percent appropriate. The theater is not just about about being a safe place but its about being thought-provoking, educating yourself, empathy, learning to step in other peoples shoes, stories and existence. If you're not prepared to do that you need to open your heart. That's what the theater is all about. Plus I think they were eloquent and non-antagonistic. I just wish the future would embrace the arts and freedom of speech and welcome it and celebrate it because that's what makes a great country. That's what our leaders should be excited about. Unfortunately things get a little cheapened these days.\"",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is still demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nProducer Diplo echoed that sentiment. \n\"People can say whatever they want.

I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

      "title": "Apple MacBook Pro, Microsoft Surface Book: Specs, Features Comparison; Check Out Which One Stood Out",
      "text": "Apple MacBook Pro, Microsoft Surface Book: Specs, Features Comparison; Check Out Which One Stood Out By Amy Westerly ,   10:20 pm Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book will go head to head to find out which is better.(Photo : The Computer Guy/YouTube) \nPeople are wondering which is better now that the two giants are giving all they've got with Apple MacBook Pro vs Microsoft Surface Book going head on. But when their specs and features are compared, which do you think is better? Find out below. Advertisement \n— VR-Zone (@vrzone) November 7, 2016 \nJust when we think that things can't get any better, Microsoft and Apple, the industry's two major juggernauts, each pull rabbits out of their hats. After four years making diehard fans wait, Apple finally introduced an upgraded version of their premier laptop, the MacBook Pro. \nNot to be outdone, Microsoft, a newbie in the hardware department, responds with an upgrade its own. The Microsoft Surface Book launched last year receives a major power boost this year. Both laptops Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book bring new features that's sure to please their respective followers. \nSo how do these two gadgets Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book compare when they go head to head? Let's find out. \nThe new Apple MacBook Pro went through a complete makeover. Apple made it almost as thin and light as the MacBook Air. But it packs more punch under the hood. \nThe Apple MacBook Pro also sports Apple's high-resolution Retina display. The key feature of the new MacBook Pro however is the new Touch Bar. This feature replaces the traditional mechanical function keys with a line of digital keys that change in function depending on the app being used. \nOn the other hand, the Microsoft Surface Book is the product of Microsoft's vision to build the \"ultimate laptop,\" per Business Insider . The result is a laptop that possesses a lot of processing power, a large, and beautiful touchscreen display, with a Surface Pen stylus for sketching and writing. \nThere are options that allow the Microsoft Surface Book user to choose configurations that can satisfy the most power hungry pros this machine is intended for. Some models of the Microsoft Surface Book are equipped with a dedicated GPU, a must for gaming or visual-oriented work. \nIn fact, just recently, Microsoft introduced a Surface Book with the Performance Base package, a top-of-the-line edition with even more power under the hood, reported by NeuroGadget . But the Microsoft Surface Book's best-selling feature is its ability to transform into a fully-functional tablet made possible by its detachable screen. \nThe Apple MacBook Pro runs on Apple's new operating system for Macs, the MacOS Sierra. The Microsoft Surface Book meanwhile is the perfect showcase device for Microsoft's Windows 10. It makes use of all of Windows 10's features with gusto including its touch function. \nThe Apple MacBook Pro, oddly enough, sports only one port and that is the Thunderbolt 3 which is USB-C standard compatible. It uses this one port for everything from charging to communicating with other devices. \nThe problem arises when you have to use older Apple devices on the MacBook Pro, which would entail the user to have a collection of dongles, adapters, and cables to solve connectivity issues. Good thing is it comes with a standard headphone jack. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book in contrast hosts a bevy of ports to handle external devices that pros are known to favor including a headphone jack of course. However, it lacks the future connectivity standard that a USB-C port offers and which is favored by Apple and Google. \nAs this standard gathers momentum as a de facto connectivity protocol, the Microsoft Surface Book is in danger of being \"left behind\" by its rival. \nThere are a host of other features that make the job of picking one laptop over the other that much more difficult. But in the end, the choice ultimately boils down to personal preference. The Microsoft Surface Book gets a slight edge though over the Apple MacBook Pro for the simple reason that it is more \"playable\" because it runs Windows 10 and the host of connectivity options that it comes with can't be beat by Apple's \"forward thinking\" port options that would leave most pro users wanting. \nSo which do you think is better, Apple MacBook Pro or Microsoft Surface Book? Lave your comments below. \n ",

      "text": "ADB, Microsoft, Lao PDR Collaborate to Expand Economic Opportunities for Youth News from Country Offices | 21 November 2016 Print \nVIENTIANE, LAO PDR (21 November 2016) – The Asian Development Bank (ADB), Microsoft, and the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) of Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) have signed a letter of intent to collaborate and develop a technology platform to provide Lao youth with access to online technical and vocational training resources and employment services. \nThe document was signed by Kongsy Sengmany, Vice Minister of Education and Sports on behalf of the Government of Lao PDR, Rena Chai, Microsoft’s Marketing and Operation Lead, and Noriko Ogawa, Deputy Director General of ADB’s Southeast Asia Department. \n“ADB recognizes that inclusive education is essential to build the human capital needed to drive innovation, increase productivity, and accelerate private sector development,” said Ms. Ogawa. “Integrating an innovative technology platform into our education sector assistance programs will help deliver longer-lasting benefits to the Lao economy.” \nThe platform — called YouthWorks — supports government efforts to use information and communication technology to boost access to education and employment services. It will provide an online localized knowledge repository and open-access courses, career guidance, and job placement services, free of charge. YouthWorks empowers job seekers and entrepreneurs to develop the skills and knowledge needed to find decent jobs. \nThe collaboration is in association with the ADB-financed Second Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Project. The platform complements project efforts to increase access to quality TVET programs and career guidance services. \nADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB in December 2016 will mark 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2015, ADB assistance totaled $27.2 billion, including cofinancing of $10.7 billion.",

In addition to the star-studded telecast, a lot happened outside the Microsoft Theatre in downtown L.A. over the course of Sunday night (Nov. 20), from the red carpet leading up to the show to all the action in the press tent and beyond. \nBelow, we gathered up some moments you might have missed if you just watched at home: \n4:07 p.m.: Idina Menzel stops to chat with Billboard on the red carpet about the Hamilton cast making a statement to vice president-elect Mike Pence and Donald Trump's outcry afterward. \"I think they were extremely courageous, 100 percent appropriate,\" she says of her Broadway peers. \"The theater is not just about about being a safe place, but it's about being thought-provoking, educating yourself, empathy, learning to step in other people's shoes, stories and existence. If you're not prepared to do that, you need to open your heart.\" \n4:24 p.m.: Shawn Mendes chats with Billboard on the carpet about scoring his second No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. \n4:51 p.m.: John Legend walks over to Tim McGraw to say hi and is introduced to Tim's daughter Maggie on the red carpet. A photo posted by Billboard (@billboard) on Nov 20, 2016 at 4:52pm PST — Silvio Pietroluongo (@silpiet) November 21, 2016 \n6:23 p.m.: Favorite song- country winner McGraw talks football with CAA's Rob Light backstage. — Katie Atkinson (@ktatkinson) November 21, 2016 \n6:30 p.m.: Zayn embraces girlfriend and AMAs co-host Gigi Hadid after his big win as new artist of the year. \n7 p.m.: The Chainsmokers -- who won favorite artist - electronic dance music -- address their mini-beef with Lady Gaga on Twitter last month while chatting with press backstage. \"I haven't seen her, but I'd say 'what's up,'\" Alex Pall says with a laugh, with Drew Taggart adding: \"I think we're cool. I think we resolved it on Twitter.\" The Chainsmokers address Lady Gaga Twitter beef backstage at #AMAs : \"I think we're cool. I think we resolved it on Twitter.\" @billboard pic.twitter.com/8NS3IfKG6b — Katie Atkinson (@ktatkinson) November 21, 2016 \n7:24 p.m.: After winning favorite duo/group - country, Florida Georgia Line reveal their next single backstage. \"We're shooting a music video in early January with some good friends of ours. About five of them,\" Brian Kelly teased, before Tyler Hubbard filled in the blanks: \"'God, Your Mama, and Me.' Blessed to put that out. Backstreet Boys are huge inspirations to us. That'll be a great time.\" -- @FLAGALine reveal their next single & video backstage at #AMAs : \"God, Your Mama, and Me\" with @backstreetboys pic.twitter.com/P5HtpwhTCs — Katie Atkinson (@ktatkinson) November 21, 2016 \n7:50 p.m.: FGL take a break from interviews to watch DJ Khaled 's performance on the monitor backstage.

I then turned off the game and logged back in and all progression from that play session was lost, no new rank no unlocked medals and no kills records for a new gun i used. Also a dog tag I unlocked is still locked. I went back into a game to see if it would update but it still shows the progress of the medals at the same spot before play and my rank is still 19. How often does the bug occur? Rarely (0% - 9%) Steps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Look at the other posts What happens when the bug occurs? Lose all progression for a time Please select your region North America In what game mode did the bug occur? Team Deathmatch AMD or Nvidia Model Number N/a Enter RAM memory size in GB N/a \n‌",

      "text": "\nWe already know that Microsoft Research is working on quantum computing. Station Q Santa Barbara is a Microsoft Research lab located on the campus of the University of California focused on studies of topological quantum computing. The lab combines researchers from mathematics, physics and computer science and collaborates with academic researchers both locally and around the world to understand how topological phases of matter can be used to built a robust, scalable quantum computing architecture.\nLast year, Microsoft released its LIQUi|> (Language-Integrated Quantum Operations) simulator available to the masses, letting virtually anyone with a modern laptop or desktop explore the capabilities of quantum computing.\nMicrosoft today announced that they are doubling down on its quantum computing research. They are making a strong bet that it is possible to create a scalable quantum computer using what is called a topological qubit. Microsoft is bringing the following key people to lead this research project,\nLongtime Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl – who has a history of successfully bringing seemingly magical research projects to life as products – will lead the scientific and engineering effort to create scalable quantum hardware and software. Marcus is the Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices . Kouwenhoven is a distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and was founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. Troyer is currently a professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, one of the leading universities in the world. Among his areas of expertise are simulations of quantum materials, the testing of quantum devices, optimization of quantum algorithms and the development of software for quantum computers. Reilly , an experimental physicist, is a professor and director of the Centre for Quantum Machines at the University of Sydney in Australia. He leads a team of physicists and engineers working on the challenges of scaling up quantum systems. Read more about this story here .",
