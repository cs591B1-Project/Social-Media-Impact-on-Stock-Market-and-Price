      "text": "\nOh, you'll have to pay extra for roaming data outside the U.S — the question is how much.\nThe editors here at Android Central tend to travel a lot for this job, and that isn't limited to staying in our home country. And when we travel, we need to have our phones with us and connected to data — that's kind of what we do. We're no strangers to dealing with roaming internationally, and thankfully for us the U.S. carriers are getting on board with everyone's tendency to get out of the country and see the world with their phones and tablets at their side.\nGone are the days of astronomical pay-per-megabyte rates, limited roaming carrier agreements and poor options from some of the carriers. Two of the big four carriers are now offering some sort of free international roaming, with the other two coming around to friendlier pricing structures and fewer restrictions on how we use our data we bought. Even prepaid carriers are getting in on the action with some international calling plans.\nEven with all of these changes, international data still isn't cheap. Your best bet is to find a local prepaid SIM card when you travel and pop it in your unlocked phone . But that's not always easy — and there's really something luxurious about stepping off a plane, firing up your phone ... and it just works.\nAnd so we've gathered up the international data rates for the four major U.S. carriers — Sprint, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile — plus Google's own Project Fi offering. Each carrier does things slightly different, whether it's buying data ahead of time, loading up full-speed data passes once you're already gone or setting up a monthly roaming add-on.\nHere's how each of the carriers handles international roaming.\nAT&T AT&T changed its international roaming strategy back in 2014, and while the prices have changed a bit the idea is still the same. You can now buy one-off data packages — called \"AT&T Passport\" — for use internationally in over 200 countries for a 30 day period, and if you travel often you can have them auto-renew every month.\nThe data allotment is fixed with hefty overages, you get unlimited international texting, and as you go up to higher packages you also get lower per-minute calling rates.\nHere's how it breaks down:\n$40 for 200MB of data, 25 cents per MB overages, $1 per minute calls $60 for 300MB of data, 20 cents per MB overages, 50 cents per minute calls $120 for 800MB of data, 15 cents per MB overages, 35 cents per minute calls Thanks to competition from the likes of T-Mobile and Sprint, AT&T now also offers free use of your phone while traveling to Mexico . If you have a Mobile Share Advantage plan with at least 10GB of data, you get free talk, text and data use while in Mexico, including calls and texts between Mexico and the U.S.\nT-Mobile T-Mobile offers free international data roaming on its postpaid plans when traveling in over 140 countries worldwide. But it comes with a caveat — speeds are limited to 2G, or around 128 Kbps, much slower than what you'd be used to back home. But hey, it's free.\nIf you need faster speeds (we wouldn't blame you if you did), you'll have to pay for a data pass to bump up your speeds — though the actual speeds you'll get will depend on the country and your phone's radio bands. The passes:\n$15 for 100MB of data to use for one day, speeds reduced to 2G afterward $25 for 200MB of data to use for seven days, speeds reduced to 2G afterward $50 for 500MB of data to use for 14 days, speeds reduced to 2G afterward The $15 plan can be good to use in a pinch, but the best value is going to come from getting the more expensive plans that let you use the data for a longer period of time. Also remember that once you buy a data pass, it'll work to give you faster data speeds in any country that T-Mobile offers the service — you don't need a new pass for a new country. T-Mobile will also often run limited-time offers where it opens up full-speed data in certain regions for all customers, so double check the deals before you pay for a pass unnecessarily.\nStarting in mid-2015 T-Mobile also threw another wrinkle into this plan by extending unlimited full-speed data and unlimited talk/text to both Canada and Mexico as part of its Simple Choice (and later T-Mobile ONE) plans. No more dealing with high-speed data packages when you hit the countries bordering the U.S.\nSprint After having some of the most woeful offerings in the business, Sprint refreshed its international data plans in April 2015. Much like T-Mobile, Sprint offers free 2G data roaming in Latin America, Japan and Europe — 152 countries in total, check with Sprint for the full list — with the option to purchase 3G-speed data packs if you need a faster connection:\n$15 for 100MB of data to use for one day, speeds reduced to 2G afterward $25 for 200MB of data to use for seven days, speeds reduced to 2G afterward $50 for 500MB of data to use for 14 days, speeds reduced to 2G afterward Now that Sprint has upped the number of countries it offers international data in the only real downside here is the speeds offered. Sprint's free data is capped at 64 kbps, half of T-Mobile's speeds, and its paid offering is only sold as a \"3G\" speed, coming up short of everyone else.\nVerizon In November 2015 Verizon drastically revamped its international options with its new TravelPass service. The gist is you pay a little bit per line per day, and voice and data usage comes out of your domestic bucket, just like if you were at home.\nIn Canada and Mexico, it's $2 a day, per device. Elsewhere in the world , it's $10 a day, per device. If you have a 12GB or larger data plan, the $2 per day fee for Canada/Mexico roaming is waived, which is a nice treat to the high data users out there, but no level of plan gets you around the $10 per day international fee elsewhere.\nIf you travel internationally frequently but don't use as much data, you may consider Verizon's \"monthly international travel\" add-on for your account instead. This fee is tacked onto your monthly bill to give you international access in 140+ countries, without the per-day payment mentioned above. There are two pricing levels:\n$25 per month for 100MB of data, $1.79 per minute talk, 50 cents per text sent / 5 cents per text received $40 per month for 100MB of data, 100 minutes, 100 texts to send / unlimited texts to receive Data overage is charged at $25 per 100MB, which makes this monthly offering far less interesting for most people when compared to the daily rates above.\nGoogle Project Fi If you're using Google's own carrier, Project Fi, things are pretty simple when you take your phone abroad. Much like T-Mobile and Sprint, Project Fi offers roaming in a robust number of countries — now totaling over 135 — at no additional cost. Though it used to offer slower 256 kbps speeds, with the addition of a roaming deal with Three, Project Fi customers now get HSPA-like speeds (2 to 10 mbps) and simply pay the same $10 per gigabyte rate as you do when you're in the U.S.\n$10 per gigabyte, no restrictions on usage or speed Unlimited calling to/from U.S. while on Wi-Fi Unlimited incoming calls from U.S. while on Wi-Fi Varying calling rates when calling internationally on Wi-Fi 20 cents per minute when calling internationally on mobile data Unlimited texting in any supported country Where things get a bit confusing is on international calling. Because Project Fi allows for calling over Wi-Fi as well as cellular networks, it offers lower rates over Wi-Fi (fewer routing costs) and varying rates depending on where you're calling. You can always call to/from the U.S. for free over Wi-Fi, but that call may cost you a few cents per minute if you call internationally over Wi-Fi. Calls over mobile data will always cost you a somewhat-steep (but cheaper than others) 20 cents per minute. It's best to keep an eye on when you're calling over Wi-Fi versus cellular data to limit your additional costs.\nThe bottom line When traveling outside the United States, it's usually cheaper to get a local SIM card, if you can. We also recommend staying on Wi-Fi whenever possible — make use of Wi-Fi calling on Sprint, T-Mobile and Project Fi, or try a VoIP solution like Skype or Hangouts .\nIf you just have to have data, though — and there's nothing wrong with it so long as you're willing to pay — it's important to do the math. The good news is that there are options, and the options have gotten much better over the years. Not that you'll likely have much of a choice when it comes to switching carriers just for overseas use, but comparisons are good.\nAnd as always, if you have any questions about using your phone overseas, check with your carrier. Here's where you can dive deeper into each of the carrier's offerings:\nAT&T international roaming information T-Mobile international roaming information Sprint international roaming information Verizon international roaming information Project Fi international roaming information ",

      "text": "Comment Carriers T-Mobile and Verizon are offering free flagship smartphones like iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 by trading in eligible phones. Fernando Cesar Nox via Flickr \nT-Mobile is offering one of the best Black Friday deals for smartphone users. On the other hand, rival carrier Verizon is looking to match that up with its own free smartphones by trading in another flagship device. However, their deals are not entirely similar. If you want more options, you have to pick one over the other. \nT-Mobile offers a free iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 Edge or LG V20 when you trade-in another iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 Edge or LG V20. You can get a free iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 when you trade in Apple iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 Plus, another iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge +, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, LG V20 or LG G5. \nAccording to Tech Times , customers are required to have an eligible unlimited plan. They are qualified provided that they trade-in a fully paid off. They need to \"agree to stay on T-Mobile's network for two years\" through on the T-Mobile One unlimited plan or on the Simple Choice Unlimited plan. This is the only time you can get the full credit for the free smartphone you have chosen. T-Mobile will also cover the cost of the smartphone with 24 monthly bill credits. For more details, you can check their website if you have not yet done that. \nVerizon also offers the same 12 eligible phones for trade-in as T-Mobile, with the addition of Moto Droid Turbo 2. It's also applicable to other free devices that include iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Moto Z Droid and Moto Z Droid Life. In addition, you will also get a $200 Visa prepaid card. That is if you actually have switched from a different carrier to Verizon and purchased a smartphone on a device payment. The said offer is only valid for up to four lines. \nVerizon requires you to sign up for a 24-month installment plan as they cover the payment for the phone each month. Though customers with less than full two years stay will not be able to get full credit for a phone. \nAccording to Fortune , T-Mobile and Verizon has offered a free iPhone 7 with trade-in deals back when the Apple flagship device was first released. Apparently, T-Mobile said that such offer \"greatly increased demand compare to sales of last year's iPhone 6s\". As for Verizon, it only \"modestly affected demand\". With the Holiday season, these kind of deals will likely attract customers. ",

Most recently, he worked at AwesomenessTV — majority owned by Comcast, with stakes held by Verizon and Hearst — overseeing business development, technical operations, and partner acquisition for the company’s multichannel networks. \nBefore joining AwesomenessTV in 2015, Woolf was executive producer and editor-in-chief at DreamWorks Animation’s “YouTube Nation” where he oversaw video curation, development, writing, production, post-production, programming, partnerships, social media, channel management, talent booking, and rights and clearances. \nWoolf also formerly worked at Blip, now part of Disney’s Maker Studios, where he led the creation of Blip Studios original production unit. has been a Streamy Awards blue-ribbon panel member since 2012 and is the co-creator of web series “Epic FU.” \nWoolf’s hiring comes after Verizon tapped Ivana Kirkbride as Go90’s chief content officer.

      "text": " 40 pm \nThe # HTC # OneM9 with # Verizon branding is now selling on eBay for just $149.99 . The smartphone is unlocked as well, which is a bonus at this price point. This gives you the liberty to choose any carrier you want, including the likes of AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk etc. Deals like these seldom come our way, so be sure to snatch it up while you still can. \nThe One M9 is HTC’s early 2015 flagship and has the hardware to rival the best in the industry today. This includes a 5-inch Quad HD display, a 20-  4-  Snapdragon 810 SoC, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of   5.0   2,840 mAh battery. \nThe handset is available in Gunmetal Gray from the seller, so there aren’t a lot of choices on offer here. If that’s not much of a caveat for you, be sure to check out the phone from the link below.",

This might be a relatively old smartphone in the market, but at a price of well under $100, this is a deal worth looking at more closely. The LG G3 is one of the few devices out there that comes with laser autofocus on board, allowing you to get better and improved focus on your subjects. \nThe smartphone is packing a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, a 13-megapixel rear camera, a 2.1-megapixel front camera, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, the quad-core Snapdragon 801 SoC, Android 4.4 KitKat (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 3,000 mAh battery. Given the kind of hardware it’s packing on board, not a lot of people would want to miss out on this deal. \nIt’s likely that the seller only has a limited number of stocks available at their disposal, so be sure to get the smartphone quickly.",

      "text": "by Valerie Richardson November 25, 2016, 4:25 pm \nThe first-gen # Verizon # DROIDTurbo is now available on eBay for just $99.99 . The smartphone might be well over two years old in the industry, but is still a worthwhile handset for the price. The DROID Turbo used to be Verizon and Motorola’s flagship offering not so long ago, so it might still be fresh in some people’s minds. \nThe handset is an exclusive with Verizon Wireless, so you cannot use the phone with any other networks, The DROID Turbo comes with a 5.2-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display, a 21-megapixel rear camera, a 2-megapixel front camera, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of non-expandable storage, a quad-core Snapdragon 805 chipset, Android 4.4 KitKat, and a 3,900 mAh battery. The phone is splash resistant as well, so the occasional drop of water or any such elements shouldn’t harm the device. But we have to warn users against testing its water resistance as this has damaged a lot of phones in the past. \nHit the link below for further details on the device.",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Get extra data for sending digital holiday gift cards with Verizon Messages+ \nJust in time for holiday shopping, Verizon and six major retailers are making it more rewarding to give a digital gift card to friends and family. From November 25 through December 31, you’ll receive 1 GB of bonus data with any qualifying digital gift card purchase. \nHere’s how it works: earn 1 GB of data by using the eGift tab on the Verizon Messages+ app to send a $50 electronic gift card to Sephora, Cabela’s, Chili’s, Bass Pro, Lowe’s or Macaroni Grill. You can send these to anyone (regardless of their wireless provider) in about five clicks using the Verizon Messages+ app. Limit 1GB of data per participating brand. \nVerizon Messages+ eGift cards are convenient for last minute gifting and customers can pay with their Verizon account or credit card. A National Retail Federation survey says gift cards top the list of most requested items during the holiday season and digital gift cards are the fastest growing segment. \nWhile the extra 1 GB of data is a limited time promotion, the Verizon Messages+ applets you send an eGift from more than 45 retailers to anyone (on any service provider) – right from your phone. \nThis promotion is offered to Verizon postpaid wireless consumer subscribers with a qualified plan. Limitations, restrictions, eligibility requirements and text messaging rates apply. Read this next",

      "text": "EDITORIAL: Union strikes out on unemployment 6:55 p.m.   Buy Photo Striking Verizon workers hold a rally in front of the Statehouse in Trenton on April 25 (Photo: Tanya Breen/staff photographer) Buy Photo 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBoth houses of New Jersey’s Democratic-controlled Legislature recently passed a bill that would have allowed striking workers to collect unemployment benefits. \nFortunately, a clearer head prevailed — that of Gov. Chris Christie, who not only rejected the measure with a conditional veto, but sent it back to the Legislature with a revision that would close off an existing provision allowing striking workers to collect unemployment benefits if the strike “doesn’t substantially curtail the operations of the business.” \nChristie’s revision, according to his veto message, would amend “the language of the current law to make it clear that all striking workers are disqualified from receiving benefits.” \nIf Christie had decided to sign the bill, New Jersey would have become just the second state in the nation, behind New York, to authorize unemployment benefits for striking workers. Why have the other 49 states chosen not to do so? Because unemployment benefits are not paid out to workers who have voluntarily left their jobs. Strikers also don’t meet the requirement of looking for a new job and being available to go to work for a new employer during a strike. \nDemocratic lawmakers, in an obvious attempt to curry even more favor with New Jersey’s unionized workers, introduced the bill in May, soon after Verizon’s 4,600 unionized workers in New Jersey walked off the job in a strike involving nearly 40,000 telecommunications employees in several states. \nAfter the state Senate approved the bill in August, Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, said it would “allow workers to express their rights without being starved back to work.” \nBut as Christie rightly noted in his veto message: “Striking workers, no matter what effect their actions have on the operations of their employer, by definition, cause their own unemployment by choosing not to work.” \nIt also should be noted that members of the Communications Workers of America, the union representing Verizon’s striking employees, were able to draw from a $400 million strike fund. It provided employees with $300 a week after the third week of the strike, which lasted six weeks. If the strike had lasted more than eight weeks, the fund would have provided workers with $400 a week. A separate plan also provided employees with health insurance coverage for the duration of the strike. \nMost states pay unemployment benefits to those who lose their job due to a lockout resulting from a strike. When an employer locks employees out, they are no longer eligible to work at that job, so they meet the definition of unemployed. Verizon workers did not. They chose to stop working. They gambled that the work stoppage would cause the company enough harm that it would eventually buckle to their demands. Both sides in the Verizon strike claimed they won important concessions. \nPredictably, the unions were quick to pounce on Christie for his rejection of the measure. Hetty Rosenstein, director of the communication workers’ New Jersey chapter, called his veto “anti-worker,” “anti-democracy” and “anti-speaking up for your rights.” No, it was “pro-common sense.” And “pro-fairness” to those who have actually lost their jobs. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/2g0XPf5 TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Verizon Hires Ex-AwesomenessTV Exec Steve Woolf as Go90 Head of Programming Updated: November 25, 2016 — 1:40 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Steve Woolf, formerly global head of networks at AwesomenessTV, has joined Verizon's Go90 mobile-centric video group as head of programming. \nAt Verizon, Woolf will oversee all programming for Go90 and related networks on the platform. Most recently, he worked at AwesomenessTV -- majority owned by Comcast, with stakes held by Verizon and Hearst -- overseeing business development, technical operations, and partner acquisition for the company's multichannel networks. \nBefore joining AwesomenessTV in 2015, Woolf was executive producer and editor-in-chief at DreamWorks Animation's \"YouTube Nation\" where he oversaw video curation, development, writing, production, post-production, programming, partnerships, social media, channel management, talent booking, and rights and clearances. \nWoolf also formerly worked at Blip, now part of Disney's Maker Studios, where he led the creation of Blip Studios original production unit. He has been a Streamy Awards blue-ribbon panel member since 2012 and is co-creator of web series \"Epic FU.\" \nWoolf's hiring comes after Verizon tapped Ivana Kirkbride as Go90's chief content officer this summer. Kirkbride, a former exec on YouTube's originals team, had most recently worked at video startup Vessel, which Verizon acquired last month. \nGo90 is overseen by Verizon Entertainment GM Chip Canter, who joined the telco earlier this year. Canter previously worked at NBCUniversal as senior VP of product and business development for digital distribution.

Verizon has the best network, hands down. Somewhat better than AT&T, and it completely smokes T-Mobile and Sprint. And you get what you pay for.

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nIf you closely follow smartphone deals, you know that the US unlocked models of Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge don't often go on sale. However, for Black Friday, several retailers are handing some pretty nice discounts and freebies out for them. We're also seeing some discounts on American carrier and international dual SIM models. \nLet's start with the US unlocked Galaxy S7 (SM-G930U). Samsung.com is not only taking $120 off the S7's MSRP of $669.99, making the price $549.99, but is also throwing in a free Gear VR gift pack (it's not clear what exactly the gift pack includes, although it's likely free Oculus content) and a white wireless charging pad (not of the fast charging variety). It's worth noting that the Gear VR being included is the improved, darker-colored 2016 model. Black Onyx appears to be the only color available, and the offer ends today (11/26). \nB&H has also discounted the Black Onyx US unlocked S7 by $120 to $549.99 and is including the same Gear VR gift pack, but is throwing in some different free things - a black Samsung fast wireless charging pad, the black (mostly useless) OEM keyboard case, and a transparent OEM case with gold accents - in place of the standard white wireless charging pad. This deal ends tomorrow (11/27), although the Gear VR gift pack will continue to be included until the 28th. \nLike Samsung.com and B&H, Best Buy is offering the US unlocked Galaxy S7 for $549.99 , but has the Gold color available in addition to Black Onyx. However, there are no freebies included. If you're okay with a refurbished unit , you can save an additional $50 and get one for $499.99. \nInterestingly, Samsung.com has some pretty intriguing offers for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge carrier models . AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon models (all of which have slightly different prices) of the S7 and S7 edge aren't technically discounted, but they're all eligible for $250 eCertificates towards future purchases on Samsung.com and the Gear VR gift packs that have been mentioned a few times now. It's worth noting that the new Blue Coral color is available on all four carrier models of the S7 edge. These promos all end on November 28th. \nLastly, B&H has some pretty substantial price cuts for the international, dual SIM unlocked models of the S7 (SM-G930FD) and S7 edge (SM-G935FD). The S7 Duos is being discounted $200, from $699.99 to $499.99, and the S7 edge Duos is being discounted $250, from $799.99 to $549.99. A free Samsung fast charger (QC2.0-capable) is included with both devices. Source:",

      "text": "Terps' Kevin Huerter reflects on game-winning block VERIZON CENTER — Four thoughts following Georgetown's 85-72 over Howard Sunday afternoon, a victory that came after concluding the Maui Invitational with two lopsided losses. * Winning trumps losing, but not all W's are created equal. The Hoyas (3-4) led 16-0 just over four minutes into the game. Impressive start? Oh, yeah, but things were rather meh from there. The lead grew to 19 at 37-18 with under eight minutes left in the first half. That's a fact. Howard (0-5) played with more energy and aggression after that strong start by Georgetown. Maybe that's not a fact, but that's a fair statement. The Hoyas pressed successfully early. The Bison flipped the script. Georgetown ended with more turnovers (18-17). The Hoyas had the clear size advantage, yet only outrebounded the MEAC program 33-32. The Hoyas, a 19-point favorite according to Las Vegas types, have more talent. That typically means putting the opponent in tough spots where fouls come into play, and yet Howard attempted more free throws (26-24). Apologies for the Debbie Downer opening -- again, winning is good and the Hoyas still haven’t played a game with their main rotation intact. However, based on this performance, the Hoyas aren't on track for a wow campaign just yet. Is that a fact? No, but that's a fair statement. * Akoy Agau's work was arguably the most promising aspect of the victory. Starting for a second straight game, Agau scored nine of his 14 points during that opening frenzy. He surprisingly led the Hoyas with five assists, matched three others with a team-high six rebounds and went 6 of 8 from the free throw line. Most of all, the big man was active. Scratch that. Most of all, Akoy Agau competed. After the disastrous second half against Wisconsin and the overall debacle against Oklahoma State, that's something coach John Thompson III \"absolutely\" desired. Nobody is suggesting anything in the realm of Agau's work puts him in line to be the next big interior thing at Big Man U; Thompson also noted Agau led the Hoyas with four turnovers. With the low bar set after this SMH start, providing energy and a competitiveness spirit is something worth celebrating. * Isaac Copeland (facial injury) didn't play after suffering what the school describes as a \"facial injury\" mere minutes into the 27-point loss to Oklahoma State on Wednesday. I tweeted this before tip-off and then I forgot about the Hoyas playing without their former 5-star recruit until I saw him suited up in the final minutes. Copeland can score and run the court. Here's the thing: I'm not sure how much he was missed beyond fouls and pure depth. He's got game. It's doubtful, per Thompson, that Copeland plays in Wednesday's matchup against Coppin State, the second straight against a MEAC program and the middle contest of the three-game homestand. What he provides with individual offense can be found elsewhere; Rodney Pryor dropped 26 points against Howard and L.J. Peak had 14. Copeland spaces the floor. So does Marcus Derrickson, who drained two 3-pointers late in his return after missing the previous four games. Copeland has the needed athletic gifts for superior rebounding and defense, but Akoy tops him in effort. Whenever Copeland returns, he'll play. How much, we'll see, especially when realizing 1) His minutes dropped in four straight games (37, 32, 24, 17) even before the injury; 2) JTIII has other options if the Copeland who had zero rebounds against Wisconsin shows up and 3) frontcourters Bradley Hayes, Derrickson and Reggie Cameron, who returned Sunday after an extended leave of absence, have all missed multiple games. * I live for rotation talk. Sometimes I fear Thompson's rotations will be the end of me. Wow, that's harsh. Apologies. Still... All I wanted to see was Georgetown use four perimeter players with one tall guy. Why? Everybody, including the head coach, recognizes these Hoyas are best when picking up the pace. And yet...Thompson continues using at least two bigs at all times. Remember the Kaleb Johnson at the 4-spot talk? The only four involving the sophomore wing Sunday involved his minutes. Point guards Jagan Mosely and Jonathan Mulmore played a combined 18 minutes. That's in large part to heavier workload for Tre Campbell, who had four 3-pointers, but also Thompson sticking with traditional lineups. It's not that going small is the automatic answer. It's that an all-court lineup, one that can press, run, spread the court and hopefully defend seems most interesting especially when this squad struggles generating offense in half court looks. Pryor and Peak on the wings. Campbell, Mosely or Mulmore at point guard. Johnson in the frontcourt with Agau or Derrickson. Try this look against Coppin State or Elon next week, Coach. Just a thought. Also, my sanity may depend on it. Image:",

      "text": "0 Verizon iPhone 7 - Does it come Factory Unlocked? I have an upgrade available on my Verizon family plan, was going to use it to buy an iPhone 7 and then sell it since no one on the plan will be upgrading for awhile. I was just curious, does the the Verizon iPhone 7 come factory unlocked so it can work on any US carrier (or carrier in other countries)? I'm guessing that once it is activated on the Verizon network it is locked to that network, but didn't know if it can work on any network before activated. I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question, i've never really done anything with iPhones before. Any thoughts would be great! Thanks,",

      "text": "Twitter News Feed Item Riverbed Teams Up With Verizon to Deliver AWS Direct Connect Bundle to Enhance Network Connections to the Cloud November 28, 2016 08:30 AM EST Blog This \n(AWS re:Invent 2016) - – Riverbed Technology, the application performance company, is joining forces with Verizon Enterprise Solutions to deliver an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Direct Connect Bundle solution to support hybrid architecture deployments. With this solution, enterprise customers can connect their branch offices and data centers to AWS environments through managed, secure and optimized network services. \nTweet This: Riverbed & @verizon deliver @awscloud Direct Connect Bundle to enhance network connections to the cloud: http://rvbd.ly/2ghaHfY #reInvent \nAnnounced at AWS re:Invent 2016 in Las Vegas, this AWS Direct Connect Bundle combines Riverbed’s industry-leading SteelHead™ WAN optimization solution, Verizon’s Secure Cloud Interconnect and Virtual Network Services solutions, and AWS Direct Connect solution into a single offering. \nAs enterprises continue to drive cloud-first strategies, organizations with multiple locations ranging from headquarters to branch offices need to ensure that all of their employees have secure, fast, consistent network access, regardless of their location and device. The increasing mobility of employees, combined with the rise of the hybrid architectures, where applications and data are hosted in both the data center and the cloud, has complicated network traffic and application delivery, adding strain to the traditional network. \nAs a result, more businesses are transitioning to the cloud to leverage the capacity and cost economics of Internet broadband and complement highly reliable multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) based networks. According to a recent IDC study, wide area networking (WAN) optimization is an increasingly critical element in the realization of hybrid architecture environments for enterprises worldwide. 1 This provides high performance for all applications, whether hosted on-premises or in the cloud. \n“Riverbed has a long history of teaming with service providers such as Verizon to provide highly-scalable networking solutions for our joint enterprise customers,” said Phil Harris, senior vice president and general manager, Service Provider Segment Vertical and Strategy at Riverbed. “Working with cloud services providers like AWS is a natural extension of these solutions and meets the needs of today’s hybrid networking environments, allowing businesses to support their digital transformation initiatives.” \nVerizon’s Virtual Network Services (VNS) and Secure Cloud Interconnect solution enable enterprise customers to leverage universal customer premises equipment (uCPE) to provide managed connectivity to their employees over a secure, efficient and high performance network.

      "title": "Verizon: eCommerce Black Friday Traffic Surged 9% From Last Year",
      "text": " 42 AM EST Verizon: eCommerce Black Friday Traffic Surged 9% From Last Year \nFrom Zacks : According to a recent report by U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc . ( VZ – Free Report ) Enterprise Solutions’ third annual Verizon Retail Index, the average daily eCommerce traffic volumes to U.S.-based retailers on Black Friday were up 9% year over year. \nMeanwhile, peak ecommerce volumes were 39% higher than 2015 levels, indicating increased consumer engagement through digital platforms. Moreover, Thanksgiving (Nov 24) drove eCommerce traffic by 10% year over year while peak eCommerce volumes were 22% higher than 2015 levels. \nVerizon is known for its diversified business model, which covers varied fields like communications, technology, wireless industry, Internet of Things (IoT) along with the media video and digital platform. Toward this end, the telco recently reported heavy eCommerce (Electronic commerce) and mCommerce (Mobilecommerce) traffic on Black Friday (Nov 25), courtesy of the promotional offers. \nThe weekend before Thanksgiving also witnessed a moderate 15% hike in daily eCommerce traffic volumes to U.S.-based retailers compared to 2015 levels. Peak eCommerce volumes showed a 35% year-over-year rise, implying encouraging response by consumers to the deals offered by retailers. However, mCommerce traffic was down 2% year over year while peak mCommerce volumes were up 2% from a year ago. \nThe Verizon Retail Index specializes in consumer ecommerce traffic during the holiday shopping season. The index also tracks eCommerce traffic across Verizon’s broadband networks. The index also monitors network traffic throughout the holiday shopping season, including events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nThe next edition of the Verizon Retail Index will reveal digital shopping activity figures for the Nov 26–27 weekend and is scheduled to be released today. The escalation in eCommerce and mCommerce traffic on Black Friday implies that the telco’s efforts to expand and strengthen its digital-video network have paid off. Verizon has also been engaged in a number of digital ventures. \nRecent Events \nThis September, Verizon entered into a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM – Free Report ) , to develop its IoT platform, ThingSpace. Meanwhile, Verizon’s rival AT&T Inc. ( T – Free Report ) partnered with Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO – Free Report ) to launch an all-in-one IoT Starter Kit. Notably, these telecom companies are looking for alternative sources of revenue to offset the decline in their legacy businesses like fixed-line services. \nVERIZON COMM Price",

      "text": "More Articles » \nRetailers aren't the only ones paying close attention to shopping holidays. Network operators are also weighing the effects that bargain hunters are having on Internet traffic. \nAccording to the Verizon Retail Index, which monitors ecommerce traffic across the company's networks to the top U.S.-based online retailers – a group that includes Amazon, Wal-Mart and Apple – e-commerce traffic was up 9 percent this past Black Friday (Nov. 25) compared to last year. At its peak, traffic jumped a whopping 39 percent, indicating that retailers are effectively connecting with today's tech-savvy consumers, said Michele Dupré, group vice president, retail, distribution and hospitality, at Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \n\"Retailers have learned to engage consumers in a digital world given shopper response to Black Friday offers,\" said Dupré in a statement. \"The focus on refining the digital experience however must strike the right balance with engagement strategies that make stores destinations.\" \nOn Thanksgiving Day, e-commerce traffic jumped 10 percent compared to last year, with a 22-percent increase in peak traffic. The prior weekend saw increases of 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively. \nContrary to generally accepted notions about mobile devices and their impact on the retail industry, Verizon witnessed a 2-percent decline in mobile commerce traffic leading up to Thanksgiving. Mobile commerce peak traffic jumped a slight 2 percent. \nGenerally, things are looking up for U.S. online retailers this holiday season. \n\"Retailers have refined their digital strategies. They recognize consumers still get excited about Black Friday deals, yet are enticing and rewarding early shoppers. It's too soon to tell what the season will bring, but early results are encouraging,\" stated Dupré. \nCIOs and IT managers, meanwhile, may want to ready themselves for the impending crush of online shoppers. \nOn Black Friday, the Macy's website (also among those tracked by the Verizon Retail Index) had trouble keeping up with online orders, reported Bloomberg . Visitors of both the desktop and mobile versions of the company's site were met with delays and technical problems. \nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) expects 122 million shoppers in the U.S. to fill up their virtual shopping carts on Cyber Monday (Nov. 28) this year, up slightly from 121 million last year. Most of those shoppers (98.6 million) plan to use their home PCs while 11.2 million will be scoping out bargains on their work PCs. Twenty-three percent of Cyber Monday shoppers, or more than 28 million people, said they will use a mobile device to land a deal, a drop from last year's 29.6 million. \nPedro Hernandez is a contributing editor at Datamation.

      "text": "\nCyber Monday 2016 is full of online discounts and deals for tech gift buyers to sift through, and one of the better ones is over at Best Buy today. You can snag the Verizon prepaid version of the Moto G4 Play for a mere $34.99 right now from the retailer’s website. That’s a huge $50 price cut from its normal $84.99 cost.\nSee also: The best Cyber Monday 2016 tech deals \nWhile you can purchase the phone from Best Buy without having to sign up for service with Verizon, it’s likely that it is locked onto the carrier, at least for a few months. However, this is an excellent price for a second phone in case your primary device fails, or if you just want to use it at home on your Wi-Fi network.\nAs a reminder, the Moto G4 Play has a 5-inch 720p IPS-LCD display, a quad-core 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of onboard storage with a microSD card slot to add up to 256G of additional storage. It also has an 8MP rear camera and a 5PM front-facing camera, along with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. We gave it a review of 7.5/10 back in September, but that was when it was priced at $149.99. This Cyber Monday price tag at Best Buy makes it a much more affordable, and desirable, lower-end Android phone.\nGet it at Best Buy Next: Best Verizon prepaid Android phones 2 weeks ago ",

      "text": "Motorola Moto G4 Play for Verizon pre-paid just $35 at Best Buy Motorola Moto G4 Play for Verizon pre-paid just $35 at Best Buy Posted: Tags : Motorola - Motorola + Android - Android + Deals - Deals + \nPick up the Moto G4 Play for $35 from Best Buy for Verizon's pre-paid service Imagine the smile you will see when the recipient of your holiday gift opens the wrapping to find there is a new smartphone inside. Now, we understand that not every person you're buying a gift for should be rewarded with a smartphone. But if you know someone using Verizon's pre-paid network, you can buy them the Motorola Moto G4 Play from Best Buy for just $34.99. And if you don't know anyone who could use the phone, you could buy it for yourself.For the same price that it would cost you to buy a box of Jujubes, a small popcorn and a small Coke at the movie theater (Ok, we are exaggerating a little), you can purchase a new smartphone lock, stock and barrel. And you don't even have to activate the phone with Verizon to take advantage of the deal, although it is locked to Big Red.Best Buy normally asks $84.99 for the phone, so you are saving $50 or 58% The Moto G4 Play comes with a 5-inch LCD screen carrying a 720 x 1280 resolution screen. Driving the handset is a Snapdragon 410 chipset containing a quad-core 1.2GHz CPU and the Adreno 306 GPU. 2GB of RAM is inside along with 16GB of internal storage. Those seeking additional storage can take advantage of the 128GB capacity microSD slot on board the device. The 8MP camera on back of the phone has an f/2.2 aperture, and there is a front-facing 5MP snapper for selfies and video chats. Keeping the lights on is a 2800mAh battery. Android 6.0 is pre-installed.For $35, this would make a good device to use as a back up, or you can use it with your Wi-Fi service at home to receive data. If interested, click on the sourcelink.

      "text": "The new package is implemented as a virtual network function within Verizon's VNS and Secure Cloud Interconnect environments. Application performance optimizer Riverbed Technology has joined with Verizon Enterprise Solutions to produce a new Amazon Web Services Direct Connect Bundle networking package for hybrid cloud deployments. Using this setup, enterprises can connect their branch offices and data centers to AWS environments through a centrally managed, secure and optimized network service that hasn't been available previously. The announcement was made Nov. 28 on Day 1 of the Amazon re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. The AWS Direct Connect Bundle combines Riverbed's SteelHead WAN optimization software, Verizon's Secure Cloud Interconnect and Virtual Network Services solutions, and AWS Direct Connect solution into a single point-of-control product.Verizon's VNS and Secure Cloud Interconnect enable enterprise users to deploy universal customer premises equipment for providing managed connectivity to their employees over a secure, efficient and high performance network, Riverbed said.The new package is implemented as a virtual network function within Verizon's VNS and Secure Cloud Interconnect environments. Inside it, Riverbed's WAN optimizer accelerates application performance in the cloud, fixing bandwidth and latency issues, to improve end-user experience and productivity. SteelHead accelerates access for users from virtually any location, and it speeds up data migration to the cloud, Riverbed said.

      "text": "Nov 28, 2016 1:16pm Image: Verizon Wireless \nVerizon has tapped Steve Woolf of AwesomenessTV to oversee programming for its Go90 effort, Variety reported . \nWoolf had served as global head of networks at AwesomenessTV, a digital video company owned by DreamWorks Animation that targets teens and preteens. Verizon bought a 24.5% stake in Awesomeness TV earlier this year in a deal that valued the business at $650 million. \nWoolf was in charge of business development, technical operations and partner acquisition for AwesomenessTV’s multichannel networks, according to Variety. He has also worked at DreamWorks’ “YouTube Nation” and Blip, which is now part of Disney’s Maker Studios. \nThe hiring underscores Verizon’s ambitious effort to expand its OTT video offering by recruiting video executives and adding content partners. In July, the nation’s largest carrier named former YouTube executive Ivana Kirkbride as chief content officer for Go90, and last month Verizon launched Stream Pass , which offers zero-rated live sports video streams from the NBA, NFL and other leagues through the service. \nVerizon launched Go90 more than a year ago, targeting millennials and other young consumers with an OTT video service designed primarily for mobile viewing. \nThe service appears to have struggled to gain traction. UBS analysts said in July that Go90 had gradually picked up steam but faced “ an uphill battle” against established mobile video and social networking apps and services. \nUBS said in July that Go90 had risen to #202 among free apps in Apple’s App Store in early April, but had since fallen out of the top 500 free apps. While UBS' analysis was limited to Apple's storefront, the firm said it has found that iOS download trends are similar to those in Google's Play store. \n\"With these rankings, we remain convinced that Go90 has an uphill battle if it is to become a meaningful competitor to the established mobile video and social networking leaders, namely YouTube, Facebook, Instagram (owned by Facebook), Snapchat, Netflix and Hulu,\" the analysts wrote. \nVerizon views Go90 as a key component of a growing digital media business that includes AOL and is likely to eventually include Yahoo. Whether Verizon can capitalize on that effort is far from certain, of course. But the nation’s largest mobile network operator is clearly willing to bet heavily that it can successfully expand beyond its core mobile business. Read more on",

      "text": "Deal: Verizon Offers “Free” Phones, $99 Google Home – 11/28/16   Alexander Maxham \nVerizon has announced their Cyber Monday deals, and there are some pretty amazing ones up for grabs today, for Cyber Monday. First of all, those that didn’t get the Google Home for $99 on Black Friday, you’re still in luck. Verizon is offering it for $99 still, however that deal ends at midnight tonight. They also have the Fitbit Charge 2 available for $129, Amazon does have it cheaper but if you’re already purchasing from Verizon it may be simpler to just pick it up from Big Red. \nNow when it comes to new smartphones, Verizon is offering up the Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Samsung Galaxy S7, Lenovo Moto Z, Apple iPhone 7, and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus for free when you trade in a qualifying smartphone. Now you’ll be getting a monthly bill credit for this trade-in, which means you’ll be stuck with Verizon for 24 months. If you are not looking to leave Big Red, then this is a great deal. Other smartphone deals include the iPhone SE for $5/month and the Lenovo (Motorola) Droid Turbo 2 for just $10/month for 24 months. \nYou can check out all of these deals and plenty more by hitting the link down below. The majority of these end at midnight tonight, so you’ll want to grab them before they are gone.",

      "title": "Verizon Walmart Exclusive Prepaid Plans Now With More Data",
      "text": "Last month, Verizon partnered with Walmart as they launched a series of prepaid plans exclusive to Walmart customers. At the time it was launched, Verizon included a couple of plans as options for users to choose from: the $50/month plan that came with 5GB of data and the $70/month plan with 10GB of data and international calls to Mexico and Canada. The two plans also included unlimited talk, text and international text with data carryover for one billing cycle.\n\nEver since then, Verizon has added a couple of prepaid plans to its own roster of options. The new plans it added are somewhat similar to the ones it exclusively offered to Walmart customers.\n\nA few days ago, a Reddit user noticed that both Verizon and Walmart have already increased the data allotment included on the Walmart exclusive prepaid plans. Instead of offering 5GB and 10GB of data, the plans now come with 7GB and 12GB, respectively. No other changes were made to data carryover and international talk (for $70 plan) and text. \n\nAs of this writing, the plan is not advertised on Walmart's website. If you are interested in this plan, you will have to go to their store to purchase it.\n\nSource: BestMVNO PrepaidPhoneNews.com Some Rights Reserved . ",

      "text": "Verizon has a big axe and it has been using it to cut price trees down at the base. It did so for the Pixel . Now, Best Buy Mobile has smothered the costs to get the Moto G4 Play on Verizon’s prepaid service and the Moto Z Droid .\nWhile Verizon is still offering the Moto Z Droid at $26 per month over a two-year device payment plan ($624), Best Buy has taken it down to just $4.99 per month ($119.76). For some odd reason, you’re also able to acquire the Moto Z on a two-year postpaid contract for $201.99.\nThe Moto G4 Play also gets a $50 price slash, now priced at $34.99. Just so we’re clear, this phone was at $50 this past weekend . You can grab the deal here .\nBoth deals don’t have end dates, but we’d hope that if you do decide on acting on this deal, you’d be quick about it — especially with the sporadic Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals going on.\nThe post Best Buy offering Moto Z Droid, Moto G4 Play on Verizon at deep discounts appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "T-Mobile vs AT&T vs Verizon Cyber Monday Deals Gadget Review - Your lifestyle gadget site \nThe clock is now ticking as Cyber Monday comes to a close. If you’ve just returned home from work and are browsing online, debating on which wireless carrier Cyber Monday deal to go with… we’ve listed out all the noteworthy bonuses and offers each respective carriers are giving for Cyber Monday 2016.\nNote that arguably T-Mobile vs AT&T and rest may have the best iPhone 7 deal this Cyber Monday. While most carriers are only providing incentive in terms of an iPhone 7 – T-Mobile is straight up discounting the phone so you can now get a 128GB iPhone 7 for $100 off . This deal is time sensitive and will expire later tonight when the clock strikes midnight.\nT-Mobile Cyber Monday Deals T-Mobile Cyber Monday Deal: iPhone 7 $100 Off — $649.99 (list $750) T-Mobile Cyber Monday Deal: iPhone 6s $100 Off — $449.99 (list $550) T-Mobile One Cyber Monday Deal: Unlimited Everything – $35/Line + $800 Bonus T-Mobile One $800 Bonus Verizon and AT&T Cyber Monday Deals Verizon Wireless Cyber Monday Deals: Free iPhone 7 / Galaxy S7 Trade-In AT&T Switch Promo: Up to $650 Credit AT&T Buy LG G5, Get $300 Bonus or Free LG G Pad X 10.1 T-Mobile is also offering all qualifying sign-ups with the opportunity to earn $800 MasterCard prepaid card as a switch/sign-up bonus incentive. This compares to their regular offer of $650 – you’re getting an extra $150 in value thanks to Cyber Monday.\nOn the other spectrum (hehe), AT&T Wireless is currently offering up to $650 in credit. While they are running a few other promotions, the other good pick is an AT&T LG G5 sign-up bonus of either a $300 Visa prepaid card bonus, or free LG G Pad X 10.1. Personally, we’ll go with the cold hard cash option.\nAt the end though, the deals are all valid and decent when compared to their usual suspects. Verizon offers free iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 when you trade-in a qualifying phone (usually only last-gen flagship phones will qualify).\nThe post T-Mobile vs AT&T vs Verizon Cyber Monday Deals appeared first on Gadget Review .",

      "text": "128GB Google Pixel XL shipments delayed until December 26th by Verizon 128GB Google Pixel XL shipments delayed until December 26th by Verizon Posted: Tags : Verizon - Verizon + Android - Android + Google - Google + More than two weeks ago, we passed along a screenshot of a text message received by a Verizon customer who had ordered the 128GB Google Pixel XL . This is the top-of-the line model and has been in heavy demand forcing Verizon to push back shipping dates. Our source decided to see what was going on with his order, which was supposed to ship on November 26th after the original delay of more than two weeks.After putting in a call to Big Red on November 26th, he was told that the phone would not ship until December 26th. He also received a text message with the same bad news. According to a phone conversation that our reader had with a Verizon customer service rep, the November 26th arrival date that was sent to him earlier this month was a mistake; the December 26th date was the actual ship date. Our source ended up cancelling his order. He was looking to replace a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and didn't want to carry it around any longer than he had to. So he went with the Motorola Moto Z Force Droid instead.The Pixel line is shaping up to be a winner. Yesterday, we told you how brokerage house Morgan Stanley expects Google to sell $3.8 billion worth of the smartphones next year . As great as that is for Google, if enough units aren't built, the customers end up having to wait. \nVerizon subscriber finds out that his 128GB Pixel XL isn;t arriving until after Christmas PhoneArena is on Instagram . Follow us to stay updated with fresh news and flashy media from the world of mobile!Thanks for sending this in!",

      "text": "Verizon Appoints New Exec to Steer Go90 (VZ) By Donna Fuscaldo | November 28, 2016 — 10:11 AM EST \nVerizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ) may not be launching an over-the-top streaming service or spending billions of dollars to acquire a content provider like rival AT&T Inc. ( T ) is. But that doesn’t mean the U.S. wireless carrier isn’t going after content, it’s just betting the growth will be with millennials and less traditional content providers. \nThat may be the strategy behind its most recent appointment of Steve Woolf to head up all programming for Go90, Verizon’s free, ad-supported streaming video service targeted at mobile users. Woolf is the former head of networks at AwesomenessTV, the youth-focused digital media company Verizon purchased a 24.5% stake in this past summer for $159 million. In addition to the investment, Verizon said it was partnering with AwesomenessTV to create a short-form mobile video content service. \nPrior to working at AwesomnessTV, Woolf was executive producer and editor-in chief at YouTube Nation. The appointment of Woolf, which was reported by Verizon, comes on the heels of Verizon hiring Ivana Kirkbride, a former executive at YouTube, as the chief content officer at Go90, this past summer. Going After Millennial-Focused Content Providers \nWhile Verizon rival AT&T is betting that a big acquisition in the form of Time Warner ( TWX ) will propel it into a leadership position as more consumers opt to cut the cord on their set-top box and satellite-TV service for mobile services like Netflix and Hulu. (See also: Verizon: Loser in AT&T-Time Warner Deal? ) \nVerizon sees that as its future as well, but is taking a slower, less headline-grabbing approach when it comes to content. Verizon thinks the day will come when media will be turned on its head by upstart media companies and it wants to be there when that happens. While Verizon’s investments may not be household names, they do have tens of millions of younger followers. Its latest media purchase was in late October, when it acquired the team behind Vessel , the internet video startup. Vessel, which launched in March 2015, charges $2.99 per month for its service. Vessel aimed to ink deals with content creators to post videos in advanced of going live on other websites like YouTube, according to The Wall Street Journal. \nThe startup has raised a total $132.5 million in two rounds of venture funding with the most recent round happening in April 2015. In that round, it raised $57.5 million. Its VC backers include Benchmark, Bezos Expeditions, Comcast Ventures, Greylock Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, Saban Capital Group and Third Wave Digital. Verizon pointed to what it says are two strengths of Vessel: content discovery and user-experience management, for the acquisition.

      "text": "Verizon Delays Shipment of 128GB Google Pixel XL To 12/26/16 November 29, 2016 - Written By Shaun Lee \nGoogle first introduced its latest smartphones, the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL at an event held in San Francisco over a month ago. Both models are pretty similar devices with an almost identical design language for the most part though the Pixel XL is the larger of the two and features a 5.5-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) display, while the Pixel, which happens to be the smaller model, comes with a smaller 5.0-inch 1080p display. The Pixel devices were made available for purchase from the Google Store right after the announcement and a few weeks later, both devices were available from Verizon. However, demand for the Pixel line has been high ever since the announcement, and the devices have been constantly selling out. The top of the line Pixel XL model which comes with 128GB of internal storage has been especially popular which has forced Verizon to push back its shipping dates. \nThe 128GB Pixel XL was already out of stock before it officially went on sale at Verizon back in late October and the carrier said that shipping of the device would be delayed by over a month. Now, it has been over a month and one reader of PhoneArena decided to check the status of his 128GB Pixel XL order, which was supposed to be shipped to him on November 26. The reader called up Verizon customer service on November 26th regarding his order and was told that he will not be receiving his device till December 26th, a whole month away. The customer service representative went on to say that the original November 26th shipping date sent to him was actually a mistake and December 26th is the actual shipping date. The reader then decided to cancel the order and purchase a Moto Z Force Droid instead. \nGoogle’s Pixel devices have been selling like hotcakes ever since its announcement and Google is expected to sell somewhere between 5 to 6 million of the smartphones in 2017. The company is also expected to sell 3 million or so units during the final quarter of 2016. If the sales projected become a reality, the firm will see close to $4 billion in total revenue from its Pixel smartphones alone. Post navigation",

      "title": "Verizon Pixel XL 128 GB Shipment Delayed Till Late December : TECH : Tech Times",
      "text": "Verizon Pixel XL 128 GB Shipment Delayed Till Late December 29 November 2016, 6:47 am EST By Sumit Passary Tech Times Verizon has delayed delivery of the 128 GB Pixel XL smartphone once again. Customers who preordered the Pixel XL may have to wait until Dec. 26 to get their new phone. ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nVerizon customers will have to wait until Dec. 26 to get delivery of the 128 GB Pixel XL. \nGoogle announced the Pixel and the Pixel XL smartphones on Oct. 4 and the handsets hit the shelves on Oct. 20. Both the devices have top-notch features that attract many customers. Pixel XL Specs \nThe phablet boasts a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with a display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. The device comes running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4 GB of RAM. \nThe Pixel XL is one of the few phones that runs on Android 7.1 Nougat . \nThe Pixel XL is available with 32 GB and 128 GB internal storage options. Both models are selling like hotcakes but it seems that the 128 GB model is particularly in high demand. Verizon Pixel XL 128 GB Shipment Delayed Again \nCustomers who initially preordered the 128 GB Pixel XL in late October were expecting to get delivery of the handset by Nov. 11. However, the shipment was delayed till Nov. 26. Now a report from PhoneArena suggests that customers will have to wait another month to get their hands on the new Pixel XL 128 GB model. \n\"According to a phone conversation that our reader had with a Verizon customer service rep, the November 26th arrival date that was sent to him earlier this month was a mistake; the December 26th date was the actual ship date,\" says PhoneArena. How Is The Delay Affecting Pixel XL Sales \nAlthough the Pixel XL is one of the best smartphones available in the market, now everyone would haveto wait a long period of time to get deliveries. Many smartphone enthusiasts who have ordered the Pixel XL are complaining on social media about the delay. \n\"128 GB Black Pixel XL 10/19 order. 11/18 original ship date. 12/26 new ship date. Going to call Business support tomorrow,\" complained a redditor. \n\"Ordered it the same date as you, as of this morning it says my estimated shipping date is 12/26/16,\" grumbled another redditor. Pixel XL Alternatives \nThe global recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 created a great opportunity for Pixel XL to entice phablet users. However, the delay in Pixel XL's delivery is diverting customers to other devices. \nThe HTC 10, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, OnePlus 3, Huawei Mate 8 and Nexus 6P are some of the alternatives that customers can opt for if they do not want to wait another month for the 128 GB Pixel XL. \nIt remains to be seen how swiftly Google is able to address the high demand of Pixel XL.

      "text": "\nCustomers buying their new Pixel XL from Verizon are increasingly reporting longer and longer shipping delays, with some customers seeing their delivery date pushed back a month already. The latest revelation sees text messages stating that deliveries won’t arrive until near the end of December, and potential buyers looking to pick up a phone will have to wait until next year.\nAt the time of writing, Verizon’s website states that regular Pixel orders will still be posted out in a timely manner. However, the 32GB Pixel XL won’t ship until January 11th 2017, while the 128GB model will be delayed until January 13th. However, given that existing customers are still receiving text messages pushing back their shipping schedules because of stock shortages, these dates could turn out to be optimistic.\nThis isn’t the first time that Verizon’s Pixel XL has been delayed. Two weeks ago , we saw a similar situation where a Verizon customer received a two week shipping delay on the date that the package was supposed to arrive. Back then, phones were tipped to be arriving in early December, so the delays only look to be growing.\nSee also: Google Pixel phones predicted to sell 3 million units in 2016, up to 6 million in 2017 14 hours ago Perhaps we shouldn’t be too surprised at the situation, as Google has often struggled with stock shortages for its smartphone line-ups. The Pixel series looks to have been a particularly big hit for the company this year, with estimates putting Google at 3 million units sold in 2016, and 6 million projected for next year. Although this isn’t a great excuse for a stock shortage. In total, phones could generate $3.8 billion in revenue for Google next year.\nIf you’ve been hit with one of Verizon’s delays, let us know in the comments below.",

      "title": "Report: Verizon's Pivot Into Media is Slow Going & Risky -",
      "text": "by Karl Bode Tuesday Nov 29 2016 08:30 EST \nVerizon's shift from broadband into the content and advertising industry will be a glacial-affair and comes with significant risk, notes Barclays. With both wireless and fixed broadband growth slowing, Verizon recently acquired AOL and Yahoo in the hopes of becoming a major player in the media and ad space. But the company's Yahoo deal arrived with significant baggage in the form of an undisclosed hack and an domestic surveillance scandal . Meanwhile, Verizon's attempt to create a new streaming video service targeting Millennials has been a huge \"dud\" according to Verizon's own business partners. \nA new report by Barclays argues that Verizon's grand strategy could still pay off, but it will be a slow uphill climb -- and still faces a significant risk of implosion. \n“Although MediaCo will likely face tough competition and high execution risk, in the mid-term we believe its strategy can still benefit from a large and growing digital ad market, even if it remains in a distant third position,” Barclays said. “That being said, the initiative is unlikely to drive a material financial benefit for several years and still comes with high execution/adoption risk. Thus we believe its strategy bears monitoring as the divergent video/media strategies of all distributors—all still unproven—will clearly drive meaningful longer-term competitive implications.” \nWall Street doesn't appear to notice that, after being a pampered telecom duopoly for the better part of a generation, Verizon just isn't all that good at innovation and disruption , especially in the content and media space. You'll recall the company's first foray into media (Sugarstring) was a bit of an embarrassment, after Verizon was caught informing writers they couldn't write about net neutrality or domestic surveillance (both issues Verizon consistently finds itself at the center of). Verizon's history is also littered with similar failures, from its streaming joint-venture with Red Box, to the company's attempt to build and operate its own app store. To succeed in media and advertising, Verizon's going to need to shed a significant amount of its anti-competitive, duopoly DNA -- given it has spent the lion's share of the last thirty years primarily focused on lobbying and turf protection for its legacy broadband business.",

      "text": "Verizon Pixel XL shipments facing delays, possibly until early 2017 Verizon's Pixel XL is delayed due to supply shortages \nWhen Verizon started selling the Google Pixel a while ago, the Pixel XL 128GB was immediately sold out. \nIf you’re wondering whether those lucky individuals managed to get their hands on the Pixel XL 128GB, the answer is – not yet. It appears that customers who have ordered a Pixel XL are being forced to wait longer than initially expected. \nWhile Pixel orders seem to go out in a timely manner, the Verizon website states that the 32GB Pixel XL won’t start shipping until January 11, while the $128GB model will be delayed until January 13. That’s more than a month and a half away. \nSome customers like one Phone Arena reader, has received a text from the carrier, alerting him the Pixel XL will be delayed due to insufficient supply and is due out on 26 December 2016. It’s a more optimistic estimate. \nAnyway, if you still haven’t ordered a Pixel, maybe you should take a minute to consider whether you really want to buy it from Verizon . After all Google itself offers it and the Project Fi, as well. But a major difference is that the Pixel you would be getting from Verizon will come with a locked bootloader. \nOn top of that the Verizon option comes with pre-installed apps (or bloatware) like Verizon Messages or Go90. \nIf you worried you won’t be able to pay for the Pixel outright, let us remind you that Project Fi offers 24-month interest-free financing plans.",

      "text": "While Google can reportedly expect pretty hefty Pixel-generated revenue through the end of next year , the latest 2016 sales prediction of around 3 million units is actually lower than the previous “up to” 4 mil unofficial forecast .\nBut that may have nothing to do with the mass appeal of the Pixel and Pixel XL phones . After all, Verizon can’t sell something it’s not able to procure and ship in a reasonable time frame. Sooner or later, prospective buyers will lose their patience and look elsewhere for a Galaxy Note 7 replacement or Android-powered iPhone 7 alternative.\nThat Big Red customer interested in a 128GB Pixel XL and made to wait a couple more weeks than initially anticipated ultimately picked up a Moto Z Force Droid, for instance. Who can blame him when VZW again delayed the top-of-the-line 5.5-incher’s delivery, this time all the way through December 26?\nOther early Pixel XL adopters are likely in similar positions, whereas new orders get even worse shipping estimates. Namely, “by” January 11 (yes, 2017) as far as the 32GB XL is concerned, and January 13 for the 128 gig configuration.\nWith sweet Black Friday weekend deals from Verizon decidedly in the rearview mirror now, your safest bet is to head over to the Google Store, or try your luck at Best Buy. The “normal-sized” Pixel, meanwhile, is available essentially everywhere with fast delivery in both 32 and 128GB SKUs.\nThe post Verizon pushes back Pixel XL deliveries up to an extra month, new orders get January ETA appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "November 29, 2016 7:55 AM Verizon, T-Mobile want to bring cell coverage to Mount Rainier National Park A rendering from the National Park Service shows the proposed locations for cell phone antennas on Jackson Visitor Center at Mount Rainier National Park. National Park Service Courtesy A rendering from the National Park Service shows the proposed locations for cell phone antennas on Jackson Visitor Center at Mount Rainier National Park. National Park Service Courtesy 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story \nImproved cellphone coverage could soon be coming to the most visited part of Mount Rainier, the national park announced in a statement released late Monday. \nVerizon and T-Mobile have applied to install wireless communication facilities at Paradise, a year-round destination on the mountain’s south side. Cellphone coverage is notoriously sketchy at and around this location where most climbing expeditions and many rescue operations are launched. \nThe service would not require building towers at Paradise. Instead, the equipment would be placed in the attics of the Jackson Visitor Center with antennas mounted on the interior of the east and west ends of the building. The antennas would be behind fiberglass panels designed to match the exterior of the building. \nAt Sunrise, the second-most visited area of the park, cellphone coverage is available thanks to towers outside the park. \nThe lack of cell coverage at Paradise and along the road above Longmire is not a new concern. \nAfter ranger Margaret Anderson was shot and killed by a visitor in 2012, a board of review recommended the park update standard operating procedures related to communication during crisis. \nIn a 2012 interview park superintendent Randy King told The News Tribune that several agencies responding to the shooting, including the FBI, had trouble communicating in the park because of the lack of cellphone reception. Park officials communicate by radio. \nWhile comprehensive coverage of the park might prove too challenging, King said in the 2012 interview, “But I think you could at least (provide coverage) within those high-activity, high-visitation corridors.” \nAn illustration showing predicted coverage from the proposed antennas shows the potential for cellphone reception between Paradise and Longmire. \nUnder the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the National Park Service considers all such proposals. The application from T-Mobile and Verizon triggers the National Environmental Policy Act so there will be a two-week period for public comment. Through Dec. 12, comments may be issued by mail (Superintendent, Mount Rainier National Park, 55210 238th Ave. E., Ashford, WA 98304) or at parkplanning.nps.gov/ParadiseCellular .",

      "title": "Verizon, T-Mobile want to bring cell coverage to Mount Rainier National Park",
      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nImproved cellphone coverage could soon be coming to the most visited part of Mount Rainier, the national park announced in a statement released late Monday. \nVerizon and T-Mobile have applied to install wireless communication facilities at Paradise, a year-round destination on the mountain’s south side. Cellphone coverage is notoriously sketchy at and around this location where most climbing expeditions and many rescue operations are launched. \nThe service would not require building towers at Paradise. Instead, the equipment would be placed in the attics of the Jackson Visitor Center with antennas mounted on the interior of the east and west ends of the building. The antennas would be behind fiberglass panels designed to match the exterior of the building. \nAt Sunrise, the second-most visited area of the park, cellphone coverage is available thanks to towers outside the park. \nThe lack of cell coverage at Paradise and along the road above Longmire is not a new concern. \nAfter ranger Margaret Anderson was shot and killed by a visitor in 2012, a board of review recommended the park update standard operating procedures related to communication during crisis. \nIn a 2012 interview park superintendent Randy King told The News Tribune that several agencies responding to the shooting, including the FBI, had trouble communicating in the park because of the lack of cellphone reception. Park officials communicate by radio. \nWhile comprehensive coverage of the park might prove too challenging, King said in the 2012 interview, “But I think you could at least (provide coverage) within those high-activity, high-visitation corridors.” \nAn illustration showing predicted coverage from the proposed antennas shows the potential for cellphone reception between Paradise and Longmire. \nUnder the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the National Park Service considers all such proposals. The application from T-Mobile and Verizon triggers the National Environmental Policy Act so there will be a two-week period for public comment. Through Dec. 12, comments may be issued by mail (Superintendent, Mount Rainier National Park, 55210 238th Ave. E., Ashford, WA 98304) or at parkplanning.nps.gov/ParadiseCellular .",

The unlocked Pixel and Pixel XL phones work on T-Mobile and AT&T, which is why the former has already outed an interesting offer for those who want to bring their own device on its network.

      "text": "Comment Sprint \nIt is that time of the year again, and if you have missed some decent Black Friday deals , fret not. There is always Cyber Monday to bail you out, in a sense, so let us take a look at what Sprint and Verizon are able to offer. \nSprint's Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday from Sprint will certainly see a smattering of smartphones being offered with a lower cost of ownership. Hence, now is a good time as any -- heck, a better time than any, to pick up one of those smartphones that you have always lusted after but never really got down to it. \nFancy picking up the HTC Bolt for free? This can be yours with a monthly fee of $25 without having to remain bogged down by an annual service contract. The HTC Bolt can also be purchased outright on a 2-year service agreement for $199.99 a pop, not too shabby at all. \nExpect the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to retain their popularity as always, and you will be able to pick up either handset for nothing. That comes with a caveat, however, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus retailing for $27.09 and $32.09, respectively, across 18 monthly payments. If you want the iPhone 7 for $199.99 and the iPhone 7 Plus for $319.99, then be prepared to stick to a 2-year service agreement -- for the 32GB model, of course. There are 128GB and 256GB model options, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus retailing for $299.99 and $399.99, and $419.99 and $519.99, respectively, across a 2-year service agreement. \nSamsung has not been forgotten by Sprint this Black Friday, where you can be a proud new owner of the Galaxy S7 edge for $349.99 on a 2-year agreement. The , Galaxy S7 is a wee bit more affordable at $199.99. Those who want a 24-month payment will be able to bring home either handset for nothing, but bear in mind the Galaxy S7 edge and Galaxy S7 will retail for $33.13 and $28.96 monthly, respectively, over the time span of 24 months. \nVerizon Cyber Monday Deals How about Verizon and their collection of handsets for Cyber Monday ? The iPhone 7 can be yours for $27.08 a month, but of course, this would mean being stuck with a 24 month contract to Verizon, where you also have the option to pick it up for $649.99 outright. Those who prefer to walk on the side of Android can always check out the flagship Samsung Galaxy S7 model for $28 a month across a 2-year agreement, although picking it up as an unlocked device will set you back by $672. \nAnother handset that will certainly pique your interest witin the same price bracket will do well with the Google Pixel that will also cost the same as the iPhone 7 on a 2-year agreement at $27.08 per month. Walking with Lenovo's Motorola Moto Z Droid would mean forking out $26 per month for 2 years, or picking it up outright for $624 a pop. Alternatively, if you want to get a Daydream View for 50% off , make sure you purchase a Pixel handset first, now how about that? Those who are on a tight budget can settle for the Verizon Hum that costs all of just $29.99 with a 2-year contract. \nSo how have you found some of the Sprint and Verizon Cyber Monday deals listed so far? Are they to your taste, or you expected better bargains? ",

      "title": "Verizon offering half-off Daydream View with Google Pixel purchase, other accessory discounts",
      "text": "0 \nAfter offering upgrade deals on phones like the Pixel, Moto Z Droid, and iPhone 7, Verizon now has special accessory offers for several of its devices. \nVerizon is now offering discounts on accessories for phones like the Pixel, Moto Z Droid, and Galaxy S7. For example, you can get 50 percent off the Daydream View VR headset when you buy a Pixel or Pixel XL, which would bring the cost of the Daydream View to $40. \nYou can also get half-off a Moto Mod with the purchase of a Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid, or Moto Z Play Droid. That means that you can get the Hasselblad True Zoom for $125, JBL SoundBoost for $40, Mophie Juice Pack battery for $40, Tumi Wireless Charging Power Pack for $45, or a Tumi Style Shell for $30. \nIf you’d prefer a new Galaxy smartphone, Verizon will sell you a Samsung Fast Charge Wireless Charging Stand for half-off ($35) with the purchase of a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge. \nAlso of note is that Verizon is still offering discounts on flagship smartphones with device trade-in. New customers can get up for $400 off devices like the Pixel, Pixel XL, and Moto Z Droid with eligible trade-in, while existing customers can get $300 off the cost of those devices. The Galaxy S7 and HTC 10 are also available for $300 off with trade-in for new and existing customers. \nIt’s worth noting that these discounts require device payment plans and are applied as monthly bill credits.

Contributed photo \nPiedmont Action To Health recently granted $5,760 to Culpeper County Library to purchase 12 Verizon hot spot devices. Patrons are able to check them out for a week at a time. \nCulpeper County Library patrons are checking out more than books, magazines and movies: They are now able to borrow mobile hot spot devices, enabling them to access the internet at home or wherever they are. \nThanks to a $5,760 ‘Make It Happen’ grant from the Warrenton-based Piedmont Action to Health Foundation, the library recently purchased 12 Verizon mobile hot spots to help those with limited or no internet access connect to the web. \nThe hotspots have unlimited data plans and the general public with a library card may borrow one for one week at a time. To access the internet via a hot spot, the borrower must use his or her smart phone, tablet or laptop. \nSix mobile units will be available for library patrons to check out and the other six units will be reserved for patients with a medical referral from Novant Health UVa Health System Culpeper Medical Center. \nThe hospital will implement a referral system in order to utilize the six hotspots reserved for medical need, according to Laura Loveday, Culpeper County comprehensive planner. \n“Patients who do not have access to internet services, but require connectivity for medical reasons will be referred to the library to check out a unit for a specified period of time. Patients or family of patients that need to augment their existing service due to data caps and restrictions will also be eligible for referral through this program,” explained Loveday. \nThe purpose of the ‘Make it Happen’ grant is to help “foster the can-do attitude of our region and promote creativity,” reads a statement on the PATH Foundation’s website. \n“Internet accessibility has become a necessity in today’s world and that can be a problem for rural areas. The PATH Foundation funded the Culpeper County Public Library to pilot a mobile hot spot grant to offer a solution for those people without broadband access,” explained PATH Foundation spokeswoman Amy Petty. “These hot spots can help patients visit with health care providers online, students doing research for homework and employees working from home.” \nLibrary director Susan Keller said this is just a small step to help bridge the digital divide. \n“Most people agree that the internet is vitally important, but there are those who cannot afford the internet, or maybe can access the internet but cannot afford unlimited data. This is one small step to help those people that may live in an internet dead zone,” said Keller. \nKeller added the mobile hot spot borrower must be at least 18 years old and one device can serve up to 15 people who are utilizing their mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets or laptops. \nLoveday said internet connectivity is a necessity these days. \n“More than ever before, the ability to connect to the internet is affecting our community, and there is much debate on how best to address the issue,” said Loveday. “Access restrictions typically fall into two categories, affordability and availability. The internet hotspot loan program focuses on overcoming the obstacle of affordability.” \nFor eligibility, grant recipients must be recognized as a non-profit, religious institution or a local government entity and projects must address community challenges or create new opportunities (no past or ongoing programs will be considered), according to the foundation’s website. \nAnd the project must benefit those who live in the foundation’s services areas of northern Culpeper County, Fauquier or Rappahannock. \nEstablished in 2013 — but with a legacy of community philanthropy since 1954 — the PATH Foundation was created as part of the Fauquier Health Foundation as a joint venture between Fauquier Health and LifePoint Hospitals. \nFor more information about the hot spot devices call Culpeper County Library at 540/825-8691. \nRhonda Simmons can be reached at or 540-825-6397.

      "text": "Should Investors Hang Up On Verizon? Nov.29.16 Summary \nVerizon has $220 billion in total liabilities vs. just $22 billion in shareholder equity. \nInterest expense is now on the rise from the second-half 2016 jump in bond market rates. \nVerizon's relatively weak stock price may be a harbinger of future downward price moves. Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) shares have traded relatively weak the last 3-6 months, as have most interest rate sensitive, capital intensive businesses like utilities, REITs, and telephone/cable communication providers. The sharp \"unexpected\" jump in interest rates globally since mid-summer is causing Wall Street to re-discount earnings and cash flow values for high dividend payout, heavily indebted businesses like Verizon. As noted on the chart below, the company's stock price has underperformed the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, Dow Jones Industrials, and Russell 2000, while largely mimicking the Dow Jones Utility average the last six months. Click to enlarge In terms of Verizon's $100 billion net debt load, $220 billion in total liabilities vs. just $22 billion in shareholder equity (negative -$101 billion \"tangible\" book value) on its balance sheet as of September 2016 , the corporation is one of the highest leveraged enterprises in America. Ongoing capital expenditures, $17 billion annually of late, and continuing investment requirements to keep the company's communication networks working smoothly and technologically up to date means new debt accumulation is inevitable. All told, ANY rise in borrowing costs moves to the bottom line (business earnings) rapidly, as new debt and debt rollovers at maturity become more expensive. Already, the huge liability numbers for the corporation are holding the stock price back on a long-term basis. Look at the weak Verizon equity performance below vs. the S&P 500, Dow Utility average, plus overly leveraged sister phone giants AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) since April 2013: Click to enlarge Today's high dividend yield of 4.6% and 14x multiple of GAAP earnings may look appetizing at first glance, but a large jump in interest rates during 2017 and/or economic recession could torpedo the underlying worth of Verizon's shares quickly. To boot, the dividend payout is an elevated 70% of GAAP earnings; not much room for error. An old real estate axiom is investors earn their profits on the buy, not necessarily the sell. Whether it's a low price or particularly good terms or purchasing at a cycle bottom, getting a good deal upfront is paramount. Many stock market traders understand profits follow those patiently waiting for the right set-up. Verizon's latest bump higher back to its 200-day moving average since the November election may provide such a setup for long investors to sell into or shorts to enter new positions. A variety of negative factors from a continuation of rising interest rates, a stagnant economy with increased competition affecting demand for Verizon telephone and communication products, or even a general stock market sell-off, could lead to much lower quotes in coming months. Click to enlarge I have been intensely researching and experimenting with my Victory Formation momentum-based system to develop successful entry setup situations. The current opening in Verizon fits well with some of my more profitable pattern setups in 2016, and I recently purchased some 2017 put options on Verizon. As a way to control my downside if Verizon's price actually rises from $51 this week, while leaving potential profits quite high using leverage, long put options (at the money roughly) offer a speculative way to play future downside in the company's stock quote. Note: In terms of portfolio creation, small option position sizes are a requirement when compared to overall portfolio value. For example, my current Verizon put position represents about 1% of my financial assets today. The odds of success in any single at-the-money long option position are considerably less than 50/50 statistically, as you are paying a time premium, either in calls or puts, and being wrong means you lose your entire investment. Selling Verizon to invest in another blue-chip equity, selling your shares for cash, or even going short may prove a sound move for traders and speculators the next 3-6 months. My momentum system is highlighting a great point in time and price to re-evaluate your view of this overly leveraged company. Historically speaking vs. decades of past trading with stronger underlying financial metrics, Verizon is at much greater theoretical risk of cutting its dividend or even filing bankruptcy when the next recession develops than ever before. At a minimum, I would expect Verizon's enormous funding needs to slow equity appreciation against the average blue-chip investment going forward. If you believe interest rates have finished rising and the U.S. economic future is bright next year, I am guestimating market typical performance for Verizon's common stock in 2017, as large debt overhangs any outsized up-move.

      "text": "Deal: Half Off Daydream View, Moto Mods at Verizon – 11/29/16   Alexander Maxham \nVerizon has had a pretty impressive Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend full of deals . From offering the Google Pixel for just $9.99/month , to offering free smartphones with a qualifying trade in. Now Verizon is looking to spice things up a bit with accessories for their most popular Android devices. Starting with the newly launched Daydream View. Those of you that are looking to buy the Google Pixel or Pixel XL, but missed out on the free Daydream View promo that Google and Verizon were doing when the devices launched last month, well you’re still in luck. Verizon is offering the Daydream View for half off, for those that buy either the Pixel or Pixel XL on Verizon Edge. The Daydream View typically costs around $79.99, so that means you’ll be getting it for about $40. Not a bad price for a new virtual reality headset. \nThose that may be more interested in the Droid lineup will love this next promotion that Verizon is running. When you buy the Moto Z Droid, Moto Z Force Droid or Moto Z Play Droid, you can get half-off any Moto Mod. That means you can get the Mophie Juice Pack, Tumi Wireless Charging Power Pack or the JBL SoundBoost for $40, the Tumi Style Shell for $30 or the Hasselblad True Zoom for just $125. \nIf you are looking to pick up the Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge from Verizon, you can get 50% off the Samsung Wireless Charging Stand from Verizon. These two smartphones are two of a very small group of smartphones still using wireless charging. This promo takes the price from $70 to just $35 for the Samsung Wireless Charging Stand. Finally, you can still trade in a smartphone and get up to $400 off any new smartphone from Verizon. That includes the Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7, the Moto Z Force Droid and many others. Now that offer is only good for new customers, but existing customers can get up to $300 off for trading in their smartphone, which is still a great deal. Keep in mind that to get this promo for trading in your current smartphone, you do need to sign up for Verizon’s installment plan, also known as Verizon Edge.",

      "text": "0 Verizon in Pittsburg, NH I know this is a long shot, but I heard that Verizon just added a tower in Pittsburg, NH which previously had no cell coverage from any provider. Has anyone been up there since this was installed? I'm curious as to what parts of town it covers and what sort of speeds people have gotten. I've climbed a cellphone tower Join Date I've climbed a cellphone tower Join Date Originally Posted by WiredGuy Where did you hear about this? It was in the news last year that cellular coverage was coming to Coos county, including Groveton (already live), Pittsburg, and one other area. I had a friend who visited there last weekend and she confirmed she now got service with Verizon in the center of town, but she's not a phone geek so I have no idea on the speed or how far into Pittsburg the coverage is. I also posted on Reddit and received a comment that the new Verizon tower is here: http://i.imgur.com/TbJ5Sm4.jpg",

By Nov. 29, 2016 5:57 p.m. ET Text Size Medium Large Verizon’s offerings seem a little dated in the wake of AT&T’s TV-streaming announcement. Photo: Pixabay \nAnalysts have spent much of the day assessing the meaning of AT&T ’s new live streaming service known as DirecTV Now. \nAnd while there’s debate about just how revolutionary the service is , there’s little question that the other wireless carriers suddenly seem a little behind the times. \nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche assessed the implications for the rest of the wireless industry. \nSprint and T-Mobile are basically unaffected, Fritzsche writes, because they offer cheaper plans than AT&T and Verizon . “We still believe the more price conscious wireless shopper will be attracted to the current offerings of these two carriers.” \nBut Verizon could be in tough spot following the launch of DirecTV Now “For Verizon, the ‘narrative’ has admittedly gotten to be a harder one,” Fritzsche says. “We would not be surprised if AT&T’s recent moves (with this [DirecTV Now] launch and the announced Time Warner deal) push Verizon toward a more transformational path / potential acquisition.” \nAT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner has much of the media and technology world rethinking their merger strategy . \nFritzsche points out that Verizon’s strength remains its strong wireless service. “Network strength is still a key factor in the wireless game -- and we do not believe Verizon has stumbled there (at all).” \nBig Picture: AT&T’s new streaming-TV service leaves the other wireless carriers looking a little dated. Verizon could be pushed to make a big acquisition. \nMore from Barron’s Next:",
