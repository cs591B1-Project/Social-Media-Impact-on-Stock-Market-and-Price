(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) MONIKA SCISLOWSKA The Associated Press \nWARSAW, Poland (AP) - Lufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday. Mail icon \nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. \nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation. \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. \nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies. Published: ",

Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. The one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. Executives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. The plant in Sroda Slaska , in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem , senior executive at GE Aviation . Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. Under communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.

      "title": "New GE Analysis: Software and Hardware Upgrades Could Cut Global CO2 Emissions from Coal and Gas Power Plants by One Billion Metric Tons",
      "text": "SCHENECTADY, N.Y.- GE today released a first-of-its-kind analysis of global power plants, which found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the world’s fleet of coal and gas plants can be reduced by 10 percent – the equivalent of removing 95 percent of cars off U.S. roads – when existing hardware and software solutions are fully applied. The analysis is the first to quantify the emission reductions of using existing technologies to upgrade the global fleet of coal and gas-based power plants. \n\n“The technology to make coal and gas more efficient is available now – countries and companies alike should be taking advantage of this to lower their carbon output,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. “These actions should be taken as a complement to continued investment in renewable energy sources as we all strive to find carbon reductions across the energy mix.” \nGE used a proprietary set of data for each coal and gas-fired plant in the world to uncover potential opportunities to improve plants’ heat rate and lower carbon emissions. The analysis comes as countries around the world are looking for climate saving solutions that will help them transition to a lower carbon energy future. \nPotential for Coal Plant Upgrades \nCoal power plants could be made approximately 4 percent more efficient with 2.5 percent in efficiencies coming from turbine and boiler upgrades, and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. The analysis also found that applying all potential upgrades to coal power plants can remove 900 million metric tons of CO2 (11 percent of total coal power emissions) – more than the annual CO2 output of the United Kingdom and France combined. China (296 MT) and India (143 MT) are two countries with big opportunities in the coal power sector. Potential for Gas Power Plant Upgrades \nSimilarly, GE’s analysis estimates that gas-fired power plants could be made approximately 3.3 percent more efficient with 1.8 percent coming from hardware upgrades and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. These savings could reduce global gas power emissions by 203 metric tons or 8.8 percent. Russia (45 MT) and the U.S. (34) are two countries with big opportunities in the gas power sector. “Our goal is to provide technology solutions that best meet the needs of our customers and help reduce emissions,” said Paul McElhinney, president & CEO, GE Power Services. “Globally, carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired electricity generation can be reduced by 10 percent annually, and GE’s software and hardware upgrade solutions can help make this a reality with moderate investments in the installed base.” \nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 41 percent of global electricity generation comes from coal-fired power plants and 22 percent comes from gas-fired power plants. The IEA estimates that both fuels will see increased use over the next decade. For markets with significant energy needs and coal reliance, like China and India, upgrades to power plants can help provide cleaner energy options and help countries make progress towards their climate goals. With natural gas playing an increasingly important role in many markets around the world, there is also great opportunity to ensure that it too is being utilized as efficiently as possible. \nIn response to the findings, GE has set up a dedicated team to provide customers with holistic software, hardware and financing solutions for coal plant upgrades. \nAdditional findings from GE’s Global Power Plant Analysis include: \nUpgrades to the entire global coal fleet can save 494 million tons of fuel globally on an annual basis. In the European Union – where there is a goal to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 – these solutions can help drive efficiencies from coal reliant countries like Poland where coal accounts for 80 percent of electricity generation. In Africa, South Africa has the biggest opportunity for fuel and carbon savings (23 MT) coming upgrades in the coal power sector.

      "text": "Today’s GE is a different place from the GE you may have known 10 or even five years ago. I’ve just helped open a new site in Cincinnati that houses our Global Operations Center for the U.S. and Canada. More than just another location for a global tech company, it reflects what we’re working hardest at as we head into 2017, and how we want to get there. We&apos;ve built open and coworking spaces, we&apos;re streamlining our shared services (HR, legal, accounting, finance, supply chain, and operations), and now we&apos;re looking for entrepreneurial problem solvers who can find new, efficient ways of getting things done.\nData is the most valuable language you can speak today. It wasn’t always that way. The GE your parents and grandparents remember was a company made up of regional offices reporting to a central headquarters, with management responsibilities laid out in a neat corporate hierarchy. These days, we&apos;re becoming more streamlined, simpler, and faster. As our business changes, we need to hire a workforce that&apos;s comfortable with this new way of working. With that in mind, here are some of the key traits and job skills we’re looking for in new hires right now. \n1. Comfortable Crunching Data Not everybody is a software engineer, but every single person at Global Operations understands their part in GE&apos;s transformation into a digital industrial company. Whether you’re in HR, accounting, or operations, being able to analyze and understand data is critical. We produce massive amounts of data every day and need to use it as efficiently as we can.\nFor example, our HR leader in Cincinnati is a chemist by training. She&apos;s able to harness the immense amounts of data at her disposal to make informed decisions around recruitment and retention. It&apos;s not the traditional career path we might&apos;ve looked for in an HR leader a generation ago, but it&apos;s a skill set that couldn&apos;t be more valuable right now, and the organization benefits from her expertise.\nSo even if you don’t have a degree in engineering or your job description doesn’t include data processing, we want to see how you use data every day. I look for candidates who can explain how they turn their work into actionable insights—or who can tell us how they think data might help them do their jobs better. Data is the most valuable language you can speak today.\n2. Humility And A Willingness To Experiment Startups are known to encourage failure in the search for solutions, but we’ve learned that big companies need to do the same. Structurally, we’re a flatter organization these days—we knew we needed to be in order to generate better ideas, work more collaboratively, and retain the best talent. And culturally, we’re now more accepting of failure in the pursuit of an idea.\nWe’re more likely than we’ve ever been to hire someone who fits our culture and shows promise, even if they aren’t traditionally \"qualified.\" The result is that the kind of person who succeeds at GE is humble. We want people who are comfortable being a little uncomfortable, who thrive in the ambiguity of a less hierarchical structure, and are prepared to fail—repeatedly—because we know it takes trial and error to bring ideas to life. \nDon’t be afraid to talk about a time you failed at something. We want to hear the thought process that led to that setback and what you did next. Tell us about the time you had a great idea but weren’t sure how to make it happen, and the way you eventually did.\n3. Proof Of Promise (Including Unconventionality) At all of GE&apos;s Global Operations sites, our interest in people who take risks is matched by a willingness to take risks on others . We’re more likely than we’ve ever been to hire someone who fits our culture and shows promise, even if they aren’t traditionally \"qualified.\"\nMaybe you don’t have an MBA, or you aren’t fluent in spreadsheets. But if you’re a curious team player and an innate problem solver who isn’t afraid to mess up now and then, we want to talk to you. To be sure, plenty of companies like to say this, but not all of them can walk the walk. At GE, that often means helping people make lateral moves that wouldn’t have been open to them within the company years ago.\nRelated: I Hire Engineers At Google—Here&apos;s What I Look For (And Why) LinkedIn&apos;s Top Three Secrets To Getting Hired In 2016 GM To Top Tech Talent: Ditch Silicon Valley For Detroit These Companies Are Vacuuming Up Everybody Else&apos;s Tech Talent For example, one Cincinnati team member is currently part of the human-resources leadership program but started out in finance and audit. Despite an unconventional background, we helped this person transition to HR because of their strengths and interest in managing human capital and recruiting new talent. Another great example: an electrical engineer who started out building engines in our aviation business moved onto project management after showing a knack for understanding the larger supply chain.\nToday, GE spends $1 billion a year helping to train and develop raw talent into teams of highly efficient, creative, and driven people. We’d rather hire someone promising (and then invest in them to fulfill their promise) than to make only \"safe\" hires who meet but don’t exceed expectations.\nAfter all, you need creativity and a grasp of today’s global context to thrive in the new GE. We want people who can show us a better way to operate and bring new ideas to the table—we can’t continue to innovate any other way.",

Czarek Sokolowski AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story WARSAW, Poland \nLufthansa and General Electric will jointly invest some 250 million euros ($270 million) in Poland to build a plant that will service aircraft engines starting in 2018, authorities said Monday. \nMateusz Morawiecki, Poland's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, told a news conference that it was an \"excellent\" project and a result of the government's strategy of pursuing and developing modern technology ventures. \nThe one-year-old government wants to give Poland's economy a boost to offer attractive jobs and prevent young people from emigrating. It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation. \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. \nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies. Related content",

      "text": "IRVINE, Calif.- Today, GE Ventures announced the launch of Menlo Micro, a new spinout from GE’s Global Research Center, which has re-invented one of the most fundamental building blocks of electronic systems – the electronic switch . The company’s disruptive Digital-Micro-Switch platform is strongly positioned to enable end products serving multiple industry verticals – including today’s mobile communications networks to future next generation 5G mobile networks and industrial IoT markets. Menlo Micro is also backed by strategic investments from semiconductor solutions provider – Microsemi Corporation (Nasdaq: MSCC), materials science powerhouse - Corning, as well as Paladin Capital Group, who combined with GE Ventures, are investing $18.7 million in Menlo Micro.\nThe fundamental electromechanical relay hasn’t experienced significant innovation in the past 50 years. While superior high-power handling and electrical performance have allowed electromechanical relays to continue to flourish in many market segments, their limitations in size, speed, cost, and reliability present major challenges to system designers. Menlo’s unique approach to solving problems through advanced material science allows it to offer unprecedented power handling (kilowatts) and superior electrical performance in a micromechanical device with the size, speed, cost and reliability of a solid-state device. This enables dozens of high value applications including DC, AC and RF products, covering such diverse markets as battery management, home-automation, electric vehicles, medical instrumentation, and wireless base stations.\n“GE’s transformation to become the world’s premier digital industrial company requires innovation at many levels, from software and analytics to sensing and connecting the physical and digital worlds,” said Risa Stack, General Manager of New Business Creation for GE Ventures. “With the creation of Menlo Micro, and the scale-up of the Digital-Micro-Switch technology, GE will be able to accelerate its digital initiatives across multiple businesses, from Healthcare to Aviation to Energy Management and beyond.”\nGE, with its broad expertise in advanced materials, MEMS processing, and high power system design, has invested over 12 years of R&D into the Digital-Micro-Switch technology, producing over 60 patent families, and a series of GE-qualified DMS products. Now, Menlo Micro will focus on bringing this revolutionary technology to the broader market, expanding development of the technology and its reach across industries.\n“Menlo Micro’s DMS technology allows us to create something which is as close as possible to the ‘ideal switch.’ Not only has it been proven to be reliable, with tens of thousands of units already shipped in the field, but it truly is a scalable design platform. This will give us the ability to address applications from milliwatts to kilowatts, and bring disruption to many different end markets,” said Russ Garcia, CEO of Menlo Micro. “This is truly an exciting time, and we are excited to get this unique technology into the hands of the world’s most creative system designers, to see what amazing products they can create, enabling the future power of IoT, communications and beyond.”\nMenlo Micro is led by Russ Garcia, chief executive officer; Chris Keimel, co-founder and chief technology officer; Chris Giovanniello, co-founder and senior vice president product development & marketing; and Jeff Baloun, senior vice president of manufacturing operations. The company can be found online at www.menlomicro.com and @menlomicro on Twitter.\nAbout GE Ventures\nGE Ventures identifies, scales and accelerates ideas that will help make the world work better. Focused on the areas of software, advanced manufacturing, energy and health care, GE Ventures combines equity investing, new business creation, licensing and technology transfer to deliver an innovation platform designed to drive growth for partners and GE.

      "title": "GE Ventures, Microsemi and Corning Partner to Launch Menlo Micro and Next Generation of Electronic Switching",
      "text": "IRVINE, Calif.- Today, GE Ventures announced the launch of Menlo Micro, a new spinout from GE’s Global Research Center, which has re-invented one of the most fundamental building blocks of electronic systems – the electronic switch . The company’s disruptive Digital-Micro-Switch platform is strongly positioned to enable end products serving multiple industry verticals – including today’s mobile communications networks to future next generation 5G mobile networks and industrial IoT markets. Menlo Micro is also backed by strategic investments from semiconductor solutions provider – Microsemi Corporation (Nasdaq: MSCC), materials science powerhouse - Corning, as well as Paladin Capital Group, who combined with GE Ventures, are investing $18.7 million in Menlo Micro. \n\nThe fundamental electromechanical relay hasn’t experienced significant innovation in the past 50 years. While superior high-power handling and electrical performance have allowed electromechanical relays to continue to flourish in many market segments, their limitations in size, speed, cost, and reliability present major challenges to system designers. Menlo’s unique approach to solving problems through advanced material science allows it to offer unprecedented power handling (kilowatts) and superior electrical performance in a micromechanical device with the size, speed, cost and reliability of a solid-state device. This enables dozens of high value applications including DC, AC and RF products, covering such diverse markets as battery management, home-automation, electric vehicles, medical instrumentation, and wireless base stations. \n“GE’s transformation to become the world’s premier digital industrial company requires innovation at many levels, from software and analytics to sensing and connecting the physical and digital worlds,” said Risa Stack, General Manager of New Business Creation for GE Ventures. “With the creation of Menlo Micro, and the scale-up of the Digital-Micro-Switch technology, GE will be able to accelerate its digital initiatives across multiple businesses, from Healthcare to Aviation to Energy Management and beyond.” \nGE, with its broad expertise in advanced materials, MEMS processing, and high power system design, has invested over 12 years of R&D into the Digital-Micro-Switch technology, producing over 60 patent families, and a series of GE-qualified DMS products. Now, Menlo Micro will focus on bringing this revolutionary technology to the broader market, expanding development of the technology and its reach across industries. \n“Menlo Micro’s DMS technology allows us to create something which is as close as possible to the ‘ideal switch.’ Not only has it been proven to be reliable, with tens of thousands of units already shipped in the field, but it truly is a scalable design platform. This will give us the ability to address applications from milliwatts to kilowatts, and bring disruption to many different end markets,” said Russ Garcia, CEO of Menlo Micro. “This is truly an exciting time, and we are excited to get this unique technology into the hands of the world’s most creative system designers, to see what amazing products they can create, enabling the future power of IoT, communications and beyond.” \nMenlo Micro is led by Russ Garcia, chief executive officer; Chris Keimel, co-founder and chief technology officer; Chris Giovanniello, co-founder and senior vice president product development & marketing; and Jeff Baloun, senior vice president of manufacturing operations.

The upgrades can help plant owners meet greenhouse gas regulations, including those in the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. But it also helps them save money. \nGE's new products, which include advances in software and augmented reality technologies, have been applied to both natural gas and coal plants. \nTrump has vowed to pull the United States from the Paris accord and lift sanctions that hurt the coal industry and coal burning power plants, seen as the major producer of greenhouse gases. \nThe GE Power unit in Schenectady is GE's largest. The Schenectady campus is home to GE Power's executives along with the company's steam turbine and generator plants. The company's wind and energy storage units also have a large presence in Schenectady. \nMcElhinney told Reuters that in the coming weeks GE will announce power contracts worth $500 million, including a $300 million deal to upgrade two power plants in the U.K. \n• 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison",

The upgrades can help power plant owners meet greenhouse gas regulations, including those in the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. But it also helps them save money.\nGE's new products, which include new advances in software and augmented reality technologies, have been applied to both natural gas and coal plants.\nTrump has vowed to pull the United States from the Paris accord and lift sanctions that hurt the coal industry and coal burning power plants, seen as the major producer of greenhouse gases.\nGE's GE Power unit in Schenectady is its largest. The Schenectady campus is home to GE Power's executives along with the company's steam turbine and generator plants. The company's wind and energy storage units also have a large presence in Schenectady.\nMcElhinney told Reuters that in the coming weeks GE will announce power contracts worth $500 million, including a $300 million deal to upgrade two power plants in the U.K.\nFollow @larryrulison",

      "title": "Software and Hardware Upgrades Could Cut Global CO2 Emissions from Coal and Gas Power Plants by One Billion Metric Tons",
      "text": "Source: Smart Grid Observer \nDecember 6, 2106 -- GE today released a new analysis of global power plants, which found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the world's fleet of coal and gas plants can be reduced by 10 percent -- the equivalent of removing 95 percent of cars off U.S. roads -- when existing hardware and software solutions are fully applied. The analysis is the first to quantify the emission reductions of using existing technologies to upgrade the global fleet of coal and gas-based power plants. \n'The technology to make coal and gas more efficient is available now -- countries and companies alike should be taking advantage of this to lower their carbon output,' said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. 'These actions should be taken as a complement to continued investment in renewable energy sources as we all strive to find carbon reductions across the energy mix.' \nGE used a proprietary set of data for each coal and gas-fired plant in the world to uncover potential opportunities to improve plants' heat rate and lower carbon emissions. The analysis comes as countries around the world are looking for climate saving solutions that will help them transition to a lower carbon energy future. \nPotential for Coal Plant Upgrades: Coal power plants could be made approximately 4 percent more efficient with 2.5 percent in efficiencies coming from turbine and boiler upgrades, and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. The analysis also found that applying all potential upgrades to coal power plants can remove 900 million metric tons of CO2 (11 percent of total coal power emissions) -- more than the annual CO2 output of the United Kingdom and France combined. China (296 MT) and India (143 MT) are two countries with big opportunities in the coal power sector. \nPotential for Gas Power Plant Upgrades: Similarly, GE's analysis estimates that gas-fired power plants could be made approximately 3.3 percent more efficient with 1.8 percent coming from hardware upgrades and 1.5 percent coming from software improvements. These savings could reduce global gas power emissions by 203 metric tons or 8.8 percent. Russia (45 MT) and the U.S. (34) are two countries with big opportunities in the gas power sector. \nAccording   Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 41 percent of global electricity generation comes from coal-fired power plants and 22 percent comes from gas-fired power plants. The IEA estimates that both fuels will see increased use over the next decade. For markets with significant energy needs and coal reliance, like China and India, upgrades to power plants can help provide cleaner energy options and help countries make progress towards their climate goals. With natural gas playing an increasingly important role in many markets around the world, there is also great opportunity to ensure that it too is being utilized as efficiently as possible. \nAdditional findings from GE's Global Power Plant Analysis include: Upgrades to the entire global coal fleet can save 494 million tons of fuel globally on an annual basis. In the European Union -- where there is a goal to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 -- these solutions can help drive efficiencies from coal reliant countries like Poland where coal accounts for 80 percent of electricity generation. In Africa, South Africa has the biggest opportunity for fuel and carbon savings (23 MT) coming upgrades in the coal power sector. \nAdditional information about the Global Power Plant Analysis is available at http://www.gereports.com/ge-power-plant .

      "text": "Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant technology, is branching out from its first home, the Echo series of devices , and finally starting to show up in third-party products. So far, we’ve seen a watch and an intercom, but GE may have the brightest idea yet: an LED lamp.\nGE, which announced the new “C by GE” desktop lamp on Wednesday, says the illuminator is just the first in a series of connected products to come.\nLooking a little like a silver Amazon Echo with a glowing ring attached to it, the C lamp integrates the Alexa voice service and backs it up with a microphone array and speakers. It is the first Alexa-connected lamp that does not need another third-party hub to work or control other smart-home devices that work with the ever-growing list of Alexa Skills. You can also, of course, control the lamp itself with your voice.\nAmazon’s Alexa lets users ask general questions, control smart devices, make shopping lists, play games, stream music and more. The functionality is greatly enhanced when owners have an Amazon Prime account, which costs $99 a year.\n“This introduction is the first in a suite of connected products we’re incubating to create simple, connected experiences that elevate what you can do at home,” Jeff Patton, general manager of connected home products for GE Lighting told Mashable. “Part of our incubation process involves embedding ourselves in homes, and as part of these living labs we quickly confirmed that voice is a powerful means to delight consumers and amplify smart home adoption.\"\nThe unusual-looking lamp was designed, in part, by Richard Clarkson who may be best known for his cloud lamp, which is essentially a whimsical, hanging cloud light fixture that can produce storm-like effects on your ceilings and walls. Clarkson was clearly interested in changing things up as the C by GE lamp’s design has virtually no relation to anything you’d see in nature.\nWhile still in development, the final C by GE lamp will offer the equivalent brightness of a 60-watt bulb and should be between 14-18 inches tall and about 13 inches in diameter.\nThis isn’t the first time an appliance manufacturer has promised deep Alexa integration. In 2015, Samsung told me they were bringing the first Alexa-enabled refrigerator to market , only to pull back on the announcement at the last minute, without any explanation. GE, though, has Amazon’s full support on this project. Perhaps 2017 will be a big year for third-party Alexa integration.\n“We believe that voice is the most natural and convenient user interface, and the new GE LED lamp with Alexa makes it easy for customers to not only control smart devices throughout their homes, but also do things like listen to music, check the daily news or request a ride – using only their voice,\" Aaron Brown, director of Amazon Alexa, told Mashable .\nThe lamp goes on pre-order early in 2017. Pricing has not been set.",

Between Amazon’s own Echo offerings and an ever growing array of third-party participation, the steady home automation takeover of the company’s AI assistant appears to be going about as well as could be expected. \nBetween Alexa connected washing machines and a detergent ordering Dash-enabled dishwasher, GE’s already firmly aboard the Amazon train. The company’s latest offering, announced this morning by way of a Facebook Live demo, is the “first announced use of AVS embedded within a lighting product,” according to GE. \nMore to the point, the C by GE LED Lamp is essentially a table lamp that will tell you the weather. It’s kind of like an Amazon Echo That also has a LED ring that arches over the top of the base/speaker. It’s still a prototype right now, but it should give you a pretty good idea of what the final version will look like. \nThe system was designed by Richard Clarkson, the dude who keeps making various tech products that look like actual clouds . No word on pricing yet, but pre-orders are set to open early next year, with shipping beginning in Q2. The lamp is the latest offering from C by GE, the technology giant’s smart lighting department that also produces light bulbs akin to Philips’ Hue. 0",

Next up: a high-tech table lamp.\nGE this morning unveiled a new LED table lamp with Alexa inside , as part of GE Lighting’s “C by GE” brand. The company says it’s the first time the Amazon Alexa Voice Service has been used within a lighting product, allowing users to ask questions, control a connected home, and other standard Alexa features.\nGE says it’s designed in part by Richard Clarkson , the designer of “The Cloud” ceiling fixture.\n“We’re excited to work with GE Lighting to bring Alexa to their LED lamp and enable new types of voice experiences,” said Aaron Brown, Director of Alexa, in a news release. “Voice is the future of home automation and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp, provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes.”\nThe base of the Alexa-powered LED lamp. (GE Photo) The product will be available for pre-order in early 2017, and it’s scheduled for release in the second quarter.

      "text": "Apple Music reaches the 20 million subscriber mark Posted GE puts Amazon Alexa inside a funky table lamp \nApple Music’s growth has been nothing if not steady since launching in June of last year. The streaming service hit 13 million paid subscribers in April and beat the 17 million mark in September. \nThis week, the company announced a nice round milestone, telling Billboard that it now counts 20 million paid members among its ranks, making that a 15-percent increase in three months. That’s about half of what Spotify has (as of September), but the Swedish music service adgot a half-dozen year head start in front of Apple’s OS-embedded offering. \nEddy Cue had some interesting figures to share around the announcement. Apparently half of the service’s subscribers are located outside the US, thanks to the fact that Apple Music is currently available in more than 100 countries. Also, confirming a key shift in the way music is consumed, 60-percent of subscribers haven’t actually purchased any music from iTunes in the past year. \nThe exec also used the opportunity to talk up recent Grammy nominee Chance the Rapper, whose recent mixtape Coloring Book debuted exclusively on the service. “It’s been quite a year,” Cue told Billboard. “We were thrilled to see that we could take [artists’] passions and drive them all the way to No. 1. Chance the Rapper, who we put on Apple Music exclusively, hit the top 10 on the Billboard charts [based on streams alone], and I can’t recall that being done before.” 0",

      "text": "CLEVELAND , Dec. 7,   GE is working to unleash the ultimate living experience through a suite of connected products designed to make your life simpler and help you do more. First on that journey is a contemporary LED table lamp that embeds Amazon Alexa Voice Service (AVS) directly inside, allowing you to use a light to order your dinner, listen to the latest headlines, preheat your oven or give a host of other voice commands.\nThe voice controlled light source with microphones and a speaker is the first announced use of AVS embedded within a lighting product, bringing the skills you'd find in a traditional Amazon Echo product without the need for a stand-alone Echo unit, hub or even a smart phone. Homeowners need only plug in the C by GE lamp and connect to Alexa to unleash a whole new world of tech functionality and smart device interoperability throughout the home.\nView a video of the prototype of the lamp in action, here . \nContinue Reading\nGE's C by GE table lamp with Alexa \"This integration is so much more than connecting lighting to voice integration,\" says Jeff Patton , General Manager Connected Home Products, GE Lighting. \"It's really about simplifying and extending an experience for consumers, allowing them to add smart capabilities throughout the home through a really simple form factor Consumers don't need a cell phone, a special switch or a hub. They just need their voice.\" \nThe company is incubating a suite of connected products, through GE Lighting's C by GE brand, and working with ecosystem partners to create a seamless connected experience that elevates what you can do at home, helping you free up time, add security, enable broader control and have fun doing it.\nThe connected home market is expected to grow threefold over the next few years, and consumers expect a seamless experience as part of that process. This introduction springboards that by leveraging something ubiquitous in the home today—lighting. \n\"We're excited to work with GE Lighting to bring Alexa to their LED lamp and enable new types of voice experiences,\" said Aaron Brown , Director of Alexa. \"Voice is the future of home automation and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp, provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes.\"  \nTo propel the connected home experience, GE is not only relying on inventors within its own walls, but drawing inspiration from companies like Amazon, real-world homeowners it's learning from and incubating with everyday inventors. The Alexa-enabled GE lamp drew inspiration from GE Lighting's real-world living labs, whereby the company tests lighting and connected home features and functionality with real-world consumers to learn and iterate based on their feedback.  \nThe concept also was influenced by a recent crowdsourcing challenge where GE, MAKER MEDIA and Hackster partnered to solicit makers, from college students to data scientists, to bring LEDs to life in new and unexpected ways. The winning ideas, which will be considered as part of future connected lighting designs, included lighting that notifies you when you are sitting idle for too long and encourages you to get moving; lighting-based motion detection that syncs with security services; a lit crib mobile that detects a baby's heart rate and oxygen levels to protect against SIDS; and lighting that tracks activity in the home to know who is home and where they are to customize lighting based on an individual's preferences and habits. \nThe Alexa-embedded lamp will be designed in part by Richard Clarkson , famed designer of The Cloud , a cloud-shaped ceiling fixture that produces a motion-triggered lightning and thunder performance. \nGE's C by GE table lamp with Alexa will be available for pre-orders as part of GE's C by GE connected lighting products in early 2017 on www.CbyGE.com with product availability in the second quarter of 2017.

      "text": "Event description Description The PechaKucha concept: each speaker has 6 minutes 40 sec. for a presentation in 20 images. Each image is on screen for only 20 seconds. No more, no less. \n20 images x 20 seconds each. Tempo, story, tension, show-and-tell. \nThe Brussels format includes designers, architects, artists, scientists, fashion designers, photographers, musicians, and creative entrepreneurs. It is launched and organised by Alok Nandi, Architempo, as part of {creativity*conversation}. Updates on http://pechakucha.architempo.net \n***We recommend that you arrive half an hour early*** \nPecha Kucha, which is Japanese for the sound of conversation, is a series of show-and-tell evenings for designers, architects, artists and creatives, started by Klein Dytham architecture in Tokyo in 2003. Since then, groups have sprung up in cities across the world (920 plus plus) and adopted the Pecha Kucha format: each presenter has 20 slides which are displayed for 20 seconds each. Pecha Kucha taps into a demand for a forum in which creative work can be easily and informally shown. With the 20x20 format, presentations are concise, the interest level goes up, and more people get the chance to show their ideas. ",

      "text": "GE Amazon started allowing other companies to build Alexa into their own products last year, and today GE is unveiling what might be the most compelling example yet. It's a wild LED lamp that's kind of like what would happen if you attached a large, glowing ring to the top of an Echo Dot. \nThe lamp looks all at once futuristic, kind of goofy, and like it'll fit terribly in your apartment. But having a thing that looks like a physical re-creation of the Cortana ring at home just seems kind of great. \nMore from the Verge: \niPhone grabs a bigger slice of US phone market in wake of Note 7 debacle \nMeizu's M5 Note redefines incremental improvement with 0.1mm thinner body \nCasio's new 1.9-megapixel camera is designed to be used in the dark \nGE doesn't have a fancy name for the product — right now, it's just being called the LED lamp or LED table lamp. I'm sure the name would be much more absurd if this thing had launched on Kickstarter. \nThe lamp functions more or less like any Echo device would. It includes always-on microphones listening for commands and questions, and when it hears one, it'll react or speak out a response through its built-in speakers. Don't expect those speakers to be great for music, though; a representative said they would be close in quality to the Echo Dot's speakers, which we said were just enough to \"be used in a pinch to play music.\" \nWhat the lamp does add to the picture is, of course, voice control over its built-in lamp. A big part of Alexa's appeal is its growing ability to control connected devices throughout a home; that means building Alexa into a product as practical as a lamp makes a lot of sense, even if the design is far from practical. \nGE says that the lamp design we're seeing today isn't final, but it's supposed to be very close to the final product, which should only see tweaks to the dimensions of what's being presented here. \nThe lamp is supposed to ship sometime in the second quarter of 2017.",

      "text": "You'll find Amazon's Alexa voice assistant ready to take your commands from an Echo speaker, an Amazon Fire TV remote, and now, a table lamp.\nIt's a very sleek table lamp at that, and its maker, General Electric, envisions it as more than just a way to deliver Alexa to people who don't want another gadget in their house. Indeed, it appears worthy of display in a modern art museum: a free-standing, LED-filled circular tube with a tiny gray base that suggests a portal to an alien world.\nThe lamp is designed by Richard Clarkson, whose previous work includes a cloud-shaped chandelier that doubles as a motion-triggered lightning and thunder performance. Hidden in the base are a microphone and speakers, which probably won't offer the same quality you might expect from an Echo , but nevertheless harness the full power of Alexa.",

      "text": "Innovation GE's lamp of the future is the first embedded with Amazon's Alexa Voice Service The cool factor of smart home technology goes up a notch with the debut of a new voice-controlled table lamp from GE. By Teena Maddox | December 7, 2016, 6:59 AM PST \nThe futuristic glow of GE's new LED table lamp embedded with Amazon's Alexa. Image: GE Lighting \nOn Wednesday, GE debuted the first stand-alone LED table lamp embedded with Amazon Alexa Voice Service. The futuristic-looking lamp has a modern vibe, with a glowing LED-filled circular tube on a small gray base. \nThe voice-controlled table lamp has microphones and a speaker, so that a homeowner can simply say \"lights on\" or \"lights off\" to control the lighting, as well as give it additional Alexa commands, such as asking about the latest headlines or asking about the weather. Consumers will be able to pre-order the lamp in early 2017, with delivery by the second quarter of the year. \n\"The way it works essentially is it's a table lamp. It has the Alexa Voice Service embedded inside. You could use it very much as you might use an Echo or Dot today in any room in your home to activate the Alexa service. At the same time you get a wonderful light source, a table lamp,\" said Jeff Patton, general manager of Connected Home Products for GE Lighting. \nSEE: Amazon Alexa will now talk to GE's connected appliances in smart home (TechRepublic) \nGE began developing the product earlier this year because the smart home market continues to grow, with a three-fold increase expected by 2020, said Tom Stimac, chief innovation officer for GE Lighting. \n\"What we look at in a lot of the reviews and work that we do, the consumer wants a seamless experience, they want that ultimate experience inside a house. As we started looking at a lot of different ways of accomplishing that experience, a couple of things came to us. Lighting is in every room of the house, whether it's the pantry, kitchen, bathroom, or closet. There's almost no space in your home that doesn't have some type of lighting in it,\" Stimac said. More about Innovation Read more \n\"People are wanting to get away from apps. They're really trying to understand how not to always have their phone on them. They want to understand how things can work for them. They say, 'how do I walk into a room and the lights just go on?' The first component of that overall experience that we've seen materialize is voice. Everyone has their own voice. It's something you use anyway. You can walk into a space and say, 'lights on, lights off,'\" Stimac said. \nPatton said this is just the first of what will be many smart home products that GE develops. \"Our goals are around delivering simplification of experience for people,\" Patton said. \"As we've used that as our key motivator out there, that's one reason why we chose voice as a key controlling element as we roll forward. There will be different features in months and quarters and years to come.\" \nAs for the price, Patton said they haven't finalized it yet, but they are aiming for a cost close to the Amazon Echo. The Amazon Echo retails for $179.99. \nStimac said new smart home products will begin rolling out in the first and second quarters of 2017. \nLighting is an easy entry point for those who want to have a smarter home, just as it's a common entry point for municipalities adding smart city technology. \n\"Lighting is something we use day in and day out, and when you look at how you use it and when you want to use it, there is a lot of basic automation built in already, with Christmas lights going on and off outside of a home. The big thing we can't underestimate is it's relatively easy to install or uninstall,\" Stimac said. \"It's the same thing with an overall city. If you have a pole somewhere and you're taking a light off, and putting a light on, it's one of the easier things on the operational side of a business that you can do.\" \nAnother factor that must be considered is the appeal of having the latest technology. Smart lighting adds the cool factor, Stimac said, but in an accessible manner. \n\"I think a lot of people hear a lot about   and self-driving cars that they know they can't grasp because it's outside what they do on a day-to-day basis. But this is within the overall scope of what the consumer can do, and it makes them feel like they're actually pushing themselves forward,\" Stimac said. Three takeaways  : GE Lighting has created an LED table lamp, the first-ever light source embedded with Amazon's Alexa. The market for smart home products is expected to grow three-fold by 2020. This is the first of what GE expects to be many smart home products that they will develop, with others debuting as early as the first quarter of 2017.

      "title": "General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Running Out of Gas",
      "text": "General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is Running Out of Gas Wall Street embraced GE after its oil and gas merger, but enthusiasm is waning By Chris Fraley , InvestorPlace Contributor | Dec 7, 2016, 10:56 am EST Source: Flickr \nAnd that begs the question: Has the recent runup in General Electric been merely a product of merger momentum, or could the diversified company’s larger energy footprint help rejuvenate the stock in the years to come? What Baker Hughes Means for GE \nFirst, let’s start with what exactly Baker Hughes gives GE. It specializes in products and services for hydraulic fracturing (a.k.a. “fracking”) and horizontal drilling for extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock. Before now, GE’s Oil & Gas division has specialized primarily in making oil drilling equipment. The combination of the two will allow GE to supply its own equipment to drill for oil and gas in places like the Bakken, and produce it. \nThe companies estimate that their new oil and gas partnership will add 4 cents per share to GE stock’s bottom line by 2018 (the deal won’t become final until mid-2017), and 8 cents by 2020 . For perspective, that’s 2.7% and 5.4%, respectively, of this year’s earnings-per-share estimates. \nThat’s not small potatoes, but it’s not a complete game-changer for a company that also has its hand in electricity, aviation, healthcare, transportation and life sciences. Now, if oil prices break free of their $40-to-$50 malaise now that OPEC is limiting production for the first time in two years, then the above estimates might be conservative and the Baker Hughes deal might be more of a difference maker. 10 Ways to Make Money in the Market in 2017 \nIt should be noted that Baker Hughes isn’t the first acquisition for GE’s Oil & Gas division in recent memory. Since 2007, General Electric has shelled out more than $14 billion in buyouts trying to build up its oil and gas division. During that time, GE stock has declined. The bursting of the dot-com bubble shortly after the turn of the century knocked General Electric back from $57 to $24, the 2008-09 recession sent it spiraling down to $10, and the stock hasn’t climbed much higher than $32 since. \nGE stock doesn’t carry the same weight on Wall Street that it once did. That said, it has been trending in the right direction during the last couple years (up 20% from the start of last year, nearly triple the 7% return in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ) as the company has returned to sales growth. Earnings growth has been less consistent, and the Baker Hughes deal should help in that regard.",

      "text": "This futuristic lamp can do everything an Amazon Echo does Eugene Kim More (GE) GE has built a new voice-controlled, LED \"smart\" lamp that can listen and talk to you, just like the way Amazon Echo does. In fact, GE says it comes with almost everything the Echo offers — only with the added benefit of lighting. The lamp is powered by Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled technology that's behind all Echo products. Amazon opened up the technology to third party developers in 2015 through a program called Alexa Voice Service. GE simply took advantage of it, making this the first lighting device to embed Alexa's voice technology. \"We’re really inspired by voice as an incredible new user interface. W e’re giving people an alternative by having this combination for the first time,\" Jeff Patton, GE Lighting's GM for Connected Home Products, told Business Insider. That means users can tell the lamp to play music, order pizza, or give the latest news, all through voice commands. It also comes with its own speaker, but it's not as powerful as the Echo's, which makes it closer to the smaller Echo Dot. Patton said the device isn't meant to compete with the Echo, but provide another option to customers, helping expand the broader voice-controlled device ecosystem. That's exactly what Amazon intended to do when it launched AVS. By stripping out the real brain behind the Echo, and giving others access to it, Amazon let anyone build their own hardware product powered by Alexa, paving the way for the Alexa ecosystem to become the go-to platform for voice-controlled devices. GE's new device comes from C by GE, a new connected light bulb product line launched earlier this year by GE Lighting. It will be available for pre-orders in early 2017. The price isn't finalized yet, but Patton said it will be less than the Echo's $180 price point. Here's a video of how GE's new LED lamp works:",

      "title": "GE Introduces Stylish Circular LED Lamp With Integrated Amazon Alexa Voice Support",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Wednesday, December 07, 2016 GE Introduces Stylish Circular LED Lamp With Integrated Amazon Alexa Voice Support Microsoft clearly missed an opportunity here; just look at GE Lighting’s new LED table lamp (yes, that what it’s being called now). It looks just like the Cortana ring that you would find within Windows 10 or Windows 10 Mobile (or perhaps like one of those hipster Dyson fans).\nBut instead, the GE LED table lamp has Amazon Alexa Voice Service (AVS) infused its base. As a result, the device has a built-in microphone and speaker for feedback and playing music, although expect to hear audio quality more in line with the diminutive Echo Dot . \nSo rather than having a tall, cylindrical object reminisce of the alien ship in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home sitting on your end table, you actually have a useful lamp coupled with a device that can read aloud sports scores, play music, or even open your garage door. Given the thousands of Alexa skills that are at your disposal, there’s plenty that can be accomplished with this stylish smart home device. \n“We’re excited to work with GE Lighting to bring Alexa to their LED lamp and enable new types of voice experiences,” remarked Aaron Brown, Director of Amazon Alexa. “Voice is the future of home automation and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp, provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes.” \n“It’s really about simplifying and extending an experience for consumers, allowing them to add smart capabilities throughout the home through a really simple form factor Consumers don’t need a cell phone, a special switch or a hub. They just need their voice,” added Jeff Patton, General Manager of Connected Home Products for GE Lighting. \nThis is by no means the final design for the LED table lamp, but we like what we see so far. GE Lightning plans to have a production version ship to customers during the second quarter of 2017. Hopefully by then, it will have a more inventive name.",

      "title": "Why GE Is Losing Its Appeal As A Dividend Stock",
      "text": "Why GE Is Losing Its Appeal As A Dividend Stock   Summary \nGE's changing business model means that it is less diversified and this could mean that its dividend payments are less certain. \nIt is struggling to deliver organic growth, and increasing leverage to fund acquisitions could further increase its risk while reducing headroom when making dividend payments. \nGE's earnings could be hit by a stronger dollar, while a struggling oil & gas industry could also hurt its dividend growth prospects. GE's (NYSE: GE ) business model is changing and it is causing the company to have less appeal for income investors. It also faces an uncertain future thanks to continued dollar strength, which will negatively impact on its financial performance. Further, it is struggling to grow its top line on an organic basis, with acquisitions being a major cause of earnings growth. In addition, GE lacks the diversity it once had when GE Capital was a major part of its business. This could make its dividend less robust and more volatile. Furthermore, it faces a challenging outlook for the oil and gas industry despite the OPEC deal, and the potential for a credit rating downgrade if leverage is increased. Therefore, I believe that GE is gradually losing its appeal as an income stock. A changing business GE's decision to sell off GE Capital and focus on being an industrial stock could help it to grow its top and bottom lines in the long run. The company is well placed within the industrial internet space , for example, and should be able to capitalise on its dominant position. However, this change in business model also brings higher risk in my view. It reduces GE's diversity and makes its performance less robust and resilient. In other words, less diversity means a higher risk profile. While this is not necessarily a bad thing all on its own, for income investors it could prove to be a major negative. That's because the reliability of a dividend and of dividend growth is crucial to many income investors. While GE's long term earnings profile may have improved from switching towards being an industrial company, a higher volatility of earnings makes its dividend payments less secure and less easy to accurately predict. A struggling business GE's revenue is forecast to fall by 1.6% in the 2017 financial year. This shows that the company is struggling to post higher sales on an organic basis and instead must partly rely on acquisitions in order to boost its revenue performance. On its own, this is not a major problem for the company since GE has strong cash flow and a balance sheet which can realistically absorb more debt . In fact, GE's CEO has stated that an increase in leverage of up to $20 billion could be on the cards to supplement organic growth. However, the problem is that taking on more debt increases GE's risk profile yet further. It means that before dividends can be paid, a larger amount of interest and debt repayments will be due. This makes the company's dividend outlook less certain. Further, credit agencies such as Moody's have warned in the past that GE's credit rating could decline if its debt levels increase . This shows that while GE may be becoming a more profitable company, it is gradually becoming less secure, less stable and less appealing as a dividend stock. A challenging outlook Trump is expected to push ahead with higher spending and lower tax policies when he assumes office. This is likely to lead to inflation and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. In turn, higher interest rates than the 2.25% which is currently forecast could be in existence by 2020. This means that the dollar may become even stronger versus a basket of currencies, which would be bad news for GE's financial outlook. Since over half of its revenue is derived from outside the US , it could mean negative currency adjustments increase over the medium term and squeeze the headroom it has when making dividend payments. Further, GE's oil & g as segment still faces an uncertain future. While OPEC may have agreed on a deal to cut supply , the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that demand will remain sluggish and could therefore take time to catch up with supply. This means that the oil price may remain low and lead to lackluster profitability across the industry. As such, investment and capex across the sector could remain low and hurt GE's performance in this space. Looking ahead Although I believe that GE's decision to transition towards being an industrial company will eventually pay off, I feel that it is gradually becoming a different kind of business in the process. Previously, it was viewed by many investors as a diversified, stable and highly reliable income stock. However, given its higher dependence on the industrial sector, it now has less diversity and a higher risk profile. This could mean that its dividend payments are less reliable in future. Further, GE's sales growth is lacking on an organic basis, while further leverage could lead to a credit rating downgrade. In addition, the oil & gas segment may struggle to perform as well as expected as it will take time for the imbalance between demand and supply to move into equilibrium in my view. And with a stronger US dollar likely over the medium term, GE's dividend headroom may be reduced by negative currency translation. Therefore, in my view GE is set to become less appealing as an income play in future.

      "text": "Victory! GE Mosquitoes Will Not Be Let Loose on Florida Community Citizens/environment will not be impacted by novel experiment releasing millions of GE mosquitoes \nWASHINGTON - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it will not move forward with the controversial release of millions of genetically engineered (GE) mosquitoes in the community of Key Haven in Monroe County, Florida. The release of the GE mosquitoes would have been the first-ever in the United States, but FDA failed to conduct adequate testing for potential impacts to people, threatened and endangered species, and the environment. During the November 2016 election, local citizens voted against the release of the insects.A coalition of public interest groups – including Center for Food Safety (CFS), Friends of the Earth (FOE), Foundation Earth, the International Center for Technology Assessment (ICTA), the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition, and Food & Water Watch – yesterday received a response to their 60-day notice of intent to sue FDA under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for failing to take into account impacts to federally listed species in a fast-tracked approval of the release of the GE mosquitoes.In a letter to CFS attorneys, counsel from FDA noted, “per the public referendums which took place on November 8, 2016, and the subsequent board meeting of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) on November 19, 2016, the proposed field trial is no longer moving forward in Key Haven, FL. Because residents of Key Haven voted against the trial, FKMCD commissioners agreed that the trial will not be conducted there.”Release of GE mosquitoes elsewhere in Monroe Country will require the manufacturers, Oxitec, to resubmit a new application for a trial release with environmental data for the new site. If FDA considers alternate locations proposed by Oxitec for a trial release, it will need to conduct the mandatory Environmental Assessment and indicate Findings of No Significant Impact for any new site. “FDA knew it was reckless to approve the release of a novel species without first assessing the potential impacts. The agency didn’t do its homework so the local community spoke up and they had the law on their side,” said Jaydee Hanson, Senior Policy Analyst at the Center for Food Safety. “This is a victory that protects local communities from reckless experiments,” said Dana Perls, senior food and technology campaigner with Friends of the Earth U.S. “ The FDA should never let people and ecosystems be treated as laboratories. We need long-term and sustainable solutions to prevent mosquito breeding grounds.”“We are glad the FDA finally recognized that it should not allow a company to release experimental GE mosquitoes into a community without their consent,” said Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food & Water Watch . “The FDA needs an entirely new approach to evaluating the potential risks form GE insects.”“We expect Oxitec will reapply for a permit to include all of Monroe County. FDA must push Oxitec to answer questions the company has avoided, like why have the mosquitos not been tested for pre-existing disease, especially when Zika transfers to eggs; and what is the likelihood of antibiotic-resistant bacteria promotion. Finally, FDA must require a full Environmental Impact Statement on the long term effects of the GE Mosquito DNA entering the sustainable wild populations,” said Barry Wray, Executive Director, Florida Keys Environmental Coalition . ### \nCenter for Food Safety is a national, non-profit, membership organization founded in 1997 to protect human health and the environment by curbing the use of harmful food production technologies and by promoting organic and other forms of sustainable agriculture. CFS maintains offices in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, California and Portland, Oregon, and has more than 300,000 members across the country. Organization Links",

The merger will create the world’s second-largest oil and gas services provider, which will be larger than Halliburton and second only to Schlumberger in terms of assets and revenue. GE and Baker to Create Second-Largest Oil Producer \nThe new company, which will control $34 billion in assets with projected yearly revenues of $25 billion, is going to be a 67.5/32.5 partnership between General Electric and Baker Hughes, respectively. (For more on the announcement of the merger, see: General Electric to Merge Oil and Gas Business with Baker Hughes .) \nIf revenues stay where they’re projected, the new company’s yearly revenue would be about $10 billion less than Schlumberger, and $12 billion more than Halliburton. These two companies represent the biggest competition in the oilfield services segment. \nThe deal is expected to be completed by mid-2017, pending a final SEC signoff. Bottom Line Looks Great for Investors \nEvercore analyst James West expects an initial valuation of around $69 per share, in part because of the expected growth potential of the new company. General Electric is bringing massive existing contracts to the table, so share prices will likely have a floor that is higher than some investors expect. \nLooking at comparable companies, investors in this new venture can expect dividend yields between 1.5% and 2.5%. \nIn the month since the announcement was made public, shares of Baker Hughes have risen by more than 30%, while shares of General Electric are trading up 1%.

      "title": "Alexa Finds A New Home In C By GE Lamp",
      "text": "Alexa Finds A New Home In C By GE Lamp 7 December 2016, 9:37 pm EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Internet In A Minute Now Playing GE integrates Alexa into its new C device, which the company touts as a lamp that responds, speaks and makes life easier, contributing to a new way of living. It is currently a concept but is expected to hit the market in 2Q 2017. ( GE ) Advertisement \nIn a bid to push Alexa more into our homes, Amazon has offered it free to third-party manufacturers who will be able to come up with a concept that integrates the smart assistant into their product. \nGeneral Electric is among the first to release an output in the form of a lamp called C, and the world got a glimpse of how Alexa figured into the equation. What Is Alexa? \nIt is helpful to remember that Alexa is Amazon's own virtual assistant. It is similar in function to Google 's own smart assistant and, to some extent, Apple's Siri. \nOf course, Alexa is designed to be a tool for accessing Amazon services such as shopping at its website and enjoying the content bundled in an Amazon Prime subscription, among others. \nHowever, it is also equipped with sophisticated algorithm to respond to specific commands like opening emails, streaming music, monitoring Twitter or even enabling connected devices such as lawn sprinklers and thermostats. GE Smart Lamp \nEssentially, C is a table lamp but a very stylish one. It is constituted by a circular LED tube, which resembles a halo when turned on or even a portal that could take you to another dimension. \nSome observers stated that it is sleek enough to snag a place in a modern art museum. The contraption is a brainchild of designer Richard Clarkson, notorious for creating various tech products that look like actual clouds. \nAlexa can be found at the base, still sporting the same color tone for brand identity, but — this time — it is smaller than the Echo . Though it does not have the same quality as the speaker, it is still capable of Alexa's core functions and the virtual assistant smarts, which includes what Amazon calls as skills. \nOne may be assured it can order around third party smart home devices that support Alexa. Obviously, this includes the C lamp itself. \nThe sound quality is also more inferior to the Echo speaker but some believe that it could be on par with Amazon's Echo Dot. \nIt is also worth noting that like other lamps in the C by GE smart bulbs series, the lamp will ship with GE's proprietary smart lighting app. Price And Availability \nIn the announcement, GE did not provide any pricing detail save for the claim that it will be cheaper than the Amazon Echo. There is also no word about a release date, although the company cited a 2Q 2017 launch. This should be disappointing for those in the market for a smart assistant or a smart lamp this holiday season. \nIf you really need one for yourself or as a gift, you can always get an Echo speaker or Echo Dot. Amazon also has a big list of smart lamps to choose from.  ",

      "title": "General Electric Debuts C By GE Lamp With Amazon Alexa",
      "text": "General Electric Debuts C By GE Lamp With Amazon Alexa December 7, 2016 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak \nAs devices with smart assistants are currently some of the most appealing products created by the Internet of Things (IoT) industry, Amazon, Google, and other consumer electronics manufacturers are looking to bring their virtual companions to as many devices as possible. A couple of months ago, Amazon updated its digital assistant with the ability to control General Electric appliances . Ever since the Seattle-based tech giant debuted Alexa back in 2014, it offered the said assistant to all consumer electronics manufacturers free of charge. As devices infused with AI-powered companions are usually nothing more than voice controlled recorders and speakers with Internet connectivity, Amazon can afford to offer Alexa to manufacturers for free. Namely, the company values user adoption more than minimal hosting costs incurred by such a move. Couple that with the support for General Electric appliances mentioned above, and it’s no wonder that the Haier-owned firm is now debuting a product specifically designed to host Alexa. \nMore specifically, the company just announced a smart lamp called C by GE. Simply speaking, this is a traditional desk lamp whose base is equipped with a microphone and a speaker. Add a WiFi adapter to the mix like General Electric did, and you have everything you need to use Alexa. In other words, the C by GE will work just like the Echo speaker does in terms of using Amazon’s digital companion. So, you’ll be able to ask your lamp about the weather and latest news or order it to play some music. Of course, the speaker featured in the lamp’s base isn’t large, so don’t expect premium sound quality. \nIn addition to the said lamp, General Electric also announced new C-Life and C-Sleep smart bulbs. While these lightbulbs obviously won’t be able to serve as a relay for Alexa, they will be compatible with the C by GE app. In other words, you’ll be able to control them from your smartphone. Now, it’s still unclear whether General Electric will stick to this curious name once the C by GE lamp and smart bulbs become available for preorders in early 2017, but that’s what the company is calling these products for now. Furthermore, there’s still no word on the exact price tag of these devices, though General Electric’s spokesperson recently told CNET that the C by GE lamp will be cheaper than the Amazon Echo which currently retails for $180. This IoT lamp should start shipping to customers by mid-2017, but for now, General Electric is only planning a US release. Of course, the company isn’t ruling out the possibility of bringing C by GE to other markets in the future. Post navigation",
