      "text": "Apple's refurbished store has long been a great place to buy refurbished Macs and iPads -- and now you'll also be able to get an iPhone through the store. Apple is only selling the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus through the store. More Apple is giving potential iPhone customers a cheaper way to buy a device — for the first time ever, the company is offering refurbished iPhones through its online refurbished store .\nThe store currently only offers the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but those models come in a variety of colors and different storage capacities. The price of the devices starts at much less than the new phone — you can get a 16GB version of the iPhone 6s for $449, and the 6s Plus for $529.\nMore: Color options for iPhone 7, 7 Plus may expand with addition of jet white model\nThe phones are between $100 and $120 less than buying a phone new, and all of the phones are unlocked and SIM-free — meaning that you could buy one and use it with any of the major U.S. carriers. It’s likely that over the next few years, more models will be on offer through the refurbished store — for example, after the iPhone 8 comes out, we’ll likely see refurbished iPhone 7s available too. It’s currently unknown if Apple only intends on offering the previous generation phone through its refurbished store.\nApple’s refurbished store has been around for a while, but until now it has only offered iPads and Macs. What that means is that customers who wanted cheaper iPhones had to buy one second-hand from another source, or wait for third-party sellers to refurbish phones for themselves.\nThe great thing about buying a refurbished product through Apple is that all devices are tested, cleaned, and certified. They also come with a one-year guarantee, and feature a new battery and a new case — meaning that there’s no outer damage to the devices. Buying a refurbished device from Apple is likely the next best thing compared to buying a new phone, and at a far cheaper price.\niPhone 7 and 7 Plus: Our take on Apple’s latest and greatest Which big iPhone should you buy? iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 6S Plus iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6S: Should you make the leap to the next generation?",

      "text": "iPad sales have been trending downward for quite some time but Apple has no intention of giving up on its iconic tablet just yet. Per a new Barclays Research report obtained by MacRumors , Apple is currently planning to launch three new iPad models this coming March, one of which might very well revitalize Apple's beleaguered tablet lineup. \nDON'T MISS:  Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss \nPer sources in Apple's supply chain, the new report claims that two of Apple's new iPads will be refreshed versions of the current 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. As for the third, Apple is reportedly planning to release an iPad model that may provide us with a sneak peak at what Apple has in store for us with the iPhone 8 . Specifically, Apple this March plans to roll out a 10.9-inch iPad with an edge to edge display, a similar design to what the company may showcase on its next-gen iPhone.\n\n[Barclays] said the 10.9-inch model's borderless design will allow for it to be the same physical size as the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That means the display itself will need to have an edge-to-edge design, possibly signaling the removal of the Home button.\n \nIf this rumored iPad model pans out, it could be just the thing Apple needs to inject a bit of life into an iPad lineup that has seen better days. During Apple's most recent earnings report covering the company's September quarter, iPad sales hit a new five year low. And though Tim Cook still likes to claim that the iPad is the future of computing, it's hard to look at the cold hard data and agree.\nThat notwithstanding, a rumored design refresh could help boost sales and provide existing iPad owners with more of an incentive to upgrade than ever before. Incidentally, Apple's iPad Mini 4 will likely not receive a refresh anytime soon.\nTrending right now: \nLeak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss Best Buy has a great Black Friday Galaxy S7 deal you can use right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

It’s ideal for skiing, and other adventures in harsh or wet conditions.\nBuy it now from:\nVerizon\nBody Glove ShockSuit Case ($25+) As the name suggests, this is a tough case for your iPhone that’s built to withstand the shock of any impact.

If falls are your main concern, then this is a great case to go for, and it’s not too pricey.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon\nSpeck Presidio Grip Case ($35+) The most protective case Speck currently offers for the iPhone 7 is the Presidio Grip. It can withstand drops up to 10 feet, and is capable of handling impacts thanks to the ridges lining the interior that are designed to compress and disperse shocks. A matte finish enables the case to resist scratches, while the edges have raised rubber ridges to provide additional grip, hence the name. It has a dual-layer design with polycarbonate on the outside. A raised bezel will keep the screen in perfect condition when face down, cut-outs are precise, and the button covers work well.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Speck\nPelican Voyager Case ($42+) A well-known name when it comes to protective cases for all sorts of equipment, Pelican also offers a really tough case for the iPhone.

UAG’s wares look like something a space marine would carry, but they’re actually crafted from lightweight plastics, not metal. There are rubber enhancements on the corners to absorb impact shock, and also rubber feet to prevent your iPhone from slipping off surfaces. The oversized button covers are easy to find without looking, and easy to press — even if you have wet or dirty hands. This case meets military drop test standard 810G-516.6.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon\nGriffin Survivor Summit Case ($36+) Here’s a case that can accompany you on outdoors adventures and keep your iPhone safe.

It also seals around the iPhone, so there’s no chance for rain, mud, or snow to get in and cause any damage. There are protective covers for the buttons and the ports, but also membranes to protect the speaker and microphone without muffling the sound too much. It has a built-in screen protector, and it comes with a holster that features a clip for hooking to belts or bags, which can also act as a kickstand.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Griffin\nTrident Kraken AMS Case ($21+) This case is built to withstand drops, vibration, dust, sand, and rain.

      "text": "From AT&T to Verizon, we've rounded up the best deals we could find on Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Also, take a sneak peek at a leaked Sam's Club promotion, which bundles a $250 gift card with the purchase of any new iPhone. More Since their launch, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have sold better than expected . As we approach the holidays, demand for Apple’s latest smartphone is expected to increase. Fortunately, retailers are offering various deals and trade-in offers to help offset the cost of the new iPhone.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best iPhone 7 deals you can get today. You’ll notice there are no T-Mobile deals at the moment, but fear not. There’s a reason they call themselves the “Uncarrier” network and it’s likely they’ll have something to offer as we inch closer to Black Friday. In the meantime, here are the deals you can act on now.\nVerizon Wireless Verizon’s iPhone 7 deal is pretty straightforward: Buy a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus with monthly device payments, trade in your old iPhone, and received up to a $300 credit you can apply to your new phone. The iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S will snag you a $100 credit, whereas the iPhone SE will land you a $200 credit. Meanwhile, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will get you a $300 credit. The phones must be in good working and cosmetic condition to qualify and the trade-in credit will be applied to your monthly bill over 24 months. Earlier in the year Verizon offered a slightly stronger deal with a $650 credit. Nevertheless, its current offer is still a great way to lower the cost of admission for a new iPhone.\nUp to $300 credit at Verizon Wireless\nAT&T AT&T is currently offering one of the best iPhone deals you’ll find. It requires that you purchase your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus via AT&T’s Next plan, but otherwise you’ll get a generous $650 credit when you trade-in your older iPhone. This is the same promo AT&T offered earlier in the season and essentially guarantees you a new iPhone 7 on the house.\n$650 credit at AT&T\nTarget Sprint users who want to save on Apple’s latest iPhone will want to make sure they shop at Target. The retailer is taking $100 off the cost of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus when you purchase from them and activate your phone on Sprint. (The savings also apply to Verizon and AT&T, but their trade-in promos above offer a better incentive). Just make sure to act fast because this sale ends Saturday, November 5.\n$100 off at Target\nBest Buy Best Buy is offering its customers a free $100 egift card with the purchase and activation of any Verizon smartphone, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While that’s not as strong as the Verizon offer previously mentioned, it’s a respectable alternative, especially if you don’t have an iPhone you can currently trade in.\n$100 gift card at Best Buy\nSam’s Club Leaked copies of Samsung’s Black Friday ad indicate that the retailer will offer its members a $250 Sam’s Club Gift Card and a waived activation fee with the purchase of any iPhone. Keep in mind this is a gift card and not a credit, so you’re still responsible for the full price of your iPhone. Also, Sam’s Club memberships start at $45 per year.\n$250 gift card at Sam’s Club\nHow to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch Hot potato! How to ditch your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 before it explodes The best iPhone 7 deals for every carrier",

Amazingly, the billion dollar company Apple Computing started out as Woz’s garage-based hobby so we are witnessing the ‘Birth of Apple’. I love the panelled garage walls and the various electronic bits and pieces on the shelves. Don’t miss the classic large red toolbox with sliding drawers, the Apple colours on the shelves, and the original wooden Apple I computer in the background.\n\n",

By Amit Meta , EnStars on Nov 12, 2016 10:07 PM EST Tag : iPhone 8 Rumors , iphone 8 release date , iPhone 8 News , iPhone 8 specs , apple iphone Sign Up for Newsletter The iPhone 8 might sport on OLED screen. The screen will reportedly extend edge-to-edge with virtually no bezels perhaps like Xiaomi’s Mi Mix. (Photo : instagram/ _iphone_8 ) Advertisement \nThe only thing Samsung did right in Galaxy Note 7 is making a compact design with a good screen size and at the same time, they added curved edges to make the things look attractive. \nNow according to rumors, Apple might borrow a page in Samsung's playbook. The iPhone 8 will have a larger screen with curved display, according to a Barclays Research note sent to MackRumors . \nAccording to Citing Asian Supply checks and Barclays Research analysts, Apple will switch from the current 4.7 inch iPhone 7 and 5.5 inches 7 plus to larger 5 and 5.8-inch display for the iPhone 8. \nThe iPhone 8 might sport on OLED screen. The screen will reportedly extend edge-to-edge with virtually no bezels, perhaps like Xiaomi's Mi Mix. \nApple copying to Samsung seems unlikely, but it's worth nothing the company was granted a patent for curved screens that are similar to Samsung's Galaxy Edge smartphones. \nThe iPhone 8 will have a brand-new glass and metal design reminiscent of the iPhone 4. It also has an iconic home button and embeds the Touch ID sensor underneath the display and possibly Sport wireless charging over a distance. \nAccording to rumors, the iPhone 8 will have a faster processing speed with a new iOS version. The other rumors which are far less likely include a ceramic case and Digital Crown with better cameras. \nI f the rumors are true, then the screen size will be larger than that of the iPhone 6, which was released in 2014. It could also include features like biometric additions - iris or facial scanning. \nThe iPhone 8 is still under development and Apple will probably release it next year - the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.

      "text": "11/12/16 AT 10:05 PM Close \nIt is not surprising that Apple is already working on its next iPhones that are going to be released as the special 10th anniversary handsets of the Cupertino giant. As the year 2016 is nearing its end, more consumers are excited and eagerly awaiting information about the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. This week, Barclays Research published a research note that reveals new details about the upcoming iOS-running smartphones. \nAccording to AppleInsider , Barclays analysts have stated in the report that Apple fans can expect a 5-inch iPhone and a 5.8-inch variant to arrive next year. Just like earlier reports claiming the next iPhones are going to feature a major redesign compared to this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the analysts have indicated that the new smartphones are going to come with a “bezel-less design.” Even more interesting is the claim that the larger displays of the new iPhones are going to have “curved edges.” \nBarclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Jerry Zhang and Thomas O’Malley — the people responsible for the report — reportedly got their information from the discussions they made with Apple’s component suppliers when they made a trip to Asia this week. They have indicated in their report that supply chain sources have said that there are other differences between the two iPhones aside from the sizes of their displays. Related Stories",

      "text": "The push to make the thinnest, lightest, most portable laptop is proving fruitful. Case in point: the Acer Swift 7 .\nAccording to Acer , the Swift 7 is the thinnest notebook PC in the world. When closed, it wouldn't be impossible to mistake it for a tablet with a keyboard attached, only thinner. At least, that's the case with my tried-and-true iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard Cover combo.\nSEE ALSO: Acer's new laptops are so thin they make the MacBook look fat\nWhile there's more to a laptop than its size, let's start there.\nRazor thin The Swift 7 doesn't have a tapered design, where it's thicker in the back and slowly gets thinner towards the front where the trackpad is. Some manufacturers use this design technique to claim an unrealistic number for the thinness of their laptops.\nFrom back to front, the Acer Swift 7 measures 0.39 inches thick. To put that in perspective, the recently announced MacBook Pro — which Apple hailed as a design challenge and accomplishment all in one — is 0.59 inches thick.\nThe Acer Swift 7 is thinner than the iPad Pro + Smart Keyboard Cover. Review soon on @Mashable.\nA video posted by Jason Cipriani (@mrcippy) on Nov 3, 2016 at 9:15am PDT\nThe similarly priced and spec'd 12-inch MacBook is also thicker than the Swift 7, measuring 0.52 inches at its thickest spot.\nIt's impressive to think about how portable laptops have become over the last few years. As I was testing the Swift 7, I carried it around for a couple days in my backpack. On more than one occasion, I had to stop and open my bag to make sure I didn't leave it in Starbucks or at home.\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nIt's incredibly light at 2.49 pounds. In other words, a downright portable computer.\nCourageous sacrifices On the right side of the Swift 7 there are two USB-C 3.1 ports and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. On the opposite side — nothing. Not a SD card slot, not an USB-C, not a full-sized USB-A or any other ports.\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nYou get two USB-C ports and you're going to have to learn to deal with it. Both USB-C ports can be used for charging and power. Only one of the ports offers Display-Port support over USB-C.\nWith all of the heckling Apple is getting for going all-in on USB-C, forcing users to carry around a separate bag full of dongles, it's clear the transition away from traditional USB-A ports on laptops is going to be painful for all involved.\nAnd yet, it's a necessary change.\nSo yeah, you're going to need a bunch of dongles to connect to legacy devices (unless you buy new USB-C cables). If you're not comfortable with leaping into the future of USB-C, the Swift 7 might not be for you.\nIt'll get the (basic) job done The Swift 7 has a 13.3 inch HD non-touch display, a feature that's become increasingly rare for a Windows laptop. I've stated before I'm not a fan of touchscreen PC's, so I didn't miss the ability to touch and interact with content on the screen.\nThere's only one configuration available for the $1,099 laptop. It includes an 1.2GHz Intel Core i5, 256GB SSD for storage and 8GB of RAM.\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nThose specs translate to a machine that's good for basic computing tasks, with the occasional video or photo editing. For the majority of users, it's fast enough.\nIn my use I found it powerful enough to run Chrome with a dozen tabs active, Slack, Mail, Calendar, and a few other random apps without any pause or hiccups. Truth be told, I probably could have pushed it harder than I did, but I didn't need to in my daily use.\nAcer claims battery life of just under nine hours, but I'd put it at a more realistic 7 to 8 hours depending on what you're doing and how hard you're pushing the processor. I was able to sit in a Starbucks for several hours without fear of the battery getting low.\nWhere'd my cursor go?\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nI truly enjoyed using the Swift 7, with one exception: The trackpad. More specifically, the placement of the trackpad.\nWhile resting my palms below the keyboard, using a proper typing technique taught to me years ago, while resting my thumbs on the space bar, I constantly hit the trackpad with the palm of my hand. What ends up happening as I type away, is the cursor jumps across the page or screen.\nIt's annoying, to say the least. Thankfully, there's a button to disable the trackpad in the row of function keys.\nImage: JASON CIPRIANI/MASHABLE\nAt the end of the day, the Swift 7 provides a smooth experience in a tiny package. It's very portable, but doesn't pack a ton of computing power when compared to more expensive laptops. But that's to be expected.\nIt's priced $200 lower than the MacBook with similar specs and a larger display to boot.\nIf you're on a tight budget and portability is of the utmost importance, the Swift 7 is worthy of your attention. Just keep in mind, you're also going to need some new cables and a few dongles.\nAcer Swift 7 The Good As light as a feather • Enough processing power for average users • Sharp display\nThe Bad USB-C is annoying right now • Trackpad placement is also annoying\nThe Bottom Line For someone who wants portability over maximum performance, the Acer Swift 7 will get the job done.",

      "text": "Apple Starts Sending out MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Shipping Notifications to Customers Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 13, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nApple has started sending out shipping notifications to customers who pre-ordered the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID. While the new MacBook Pro from Apple went on pre-order soon after the company’s “Hello again” event on October 27th, most customers got an estimated shipping time of anywhere between November 17-25. \nThe change in order status is only applicable for customers who pre-ordered the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar though, with 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders still being under processing for customers. \nThe change in order status has only been reported by customers in the United States, with MacBook Pro pre-order status in other regions of the world still being processed or being prepared for shipment. Most customers who have seen their order status change in the United States pre-ordered the laptop soon after Apple’s keynote ended. \nDespite being significantly costlier than older MacBook Pros and lacking many ‘pro’ features, the new MacBook Pro from Apple sold out pretty quickly after they went on pre-order. Apple’s executive Phil Schiller soon confirmed that the company’s online store received far more orders for the new MacBook Pros than any other previous MacBook model. Data from Slice Intelligence also suggested that the new MacBook Pro took only 5 days to outsell every other premium laptop in the United States.",

      "text": "Apple’s revelations Monday about the upgrades to its “intelligent personal assistant” — aka Siri — were met with generally good vibes, but there may be something even more exciting coming from the world of machine intelligence.\nConsumers and developers alike have been frustrated by Siri’s stagnation since it rolled out on iOS 5 in late 2011— particularly its inability to do much more than respond to very simple questions  (as cleverly as its too-frequent evasions or ignorance might be masked). Now that Siri has been opened up to third-party developers, users will be able to perform tasks such as summon an Uber or track a jog in the park on Under Armour’s MapMyRun app without any digital keyboarding. It also will be available on the next version of Mac OS X.\nAI’s main potential for brands and services is that it can supplement the human-to-human conversations that are so vital to maintaining relationships. And a next generation of voice-enabled AI technology out of Viv Labs is what really has the developer community buzzing.\nViv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus, who was also CEO of the team that created Siri at SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center in the first place, offered the first public demonstration of Viv in action during a 11-minute presentation of what he calls “conversational commerce” at TechCrunch ’s Disrupt NY conference last month.\nRather than the hard-coded voice-recognitions apps now in the marketplace, Viv is  “a dynamic program that in 10 milliseconds writes itself,” he said. An illustration: Ask Viv if it was raining in Seattle three Thursdays ago, and it will write a program to answer that multifaceted question lickety-split. \nBut that’s just the surface. “If Viv operates as promised — admittedly a big ‘if’ — brands will be able to reach customers in a method entirely organic and instant in nature,” says Jeff Piazza, co-founder and UX director at Behavior Design, a Manhattan-based agency that focuses on user experience, strategy and design. “This truly doesn't exist today, despite Amazon Echo's admirable attempts, and integration with existing services will be key to speed that adaption.”\nSay you’re planning a family vacation for Florida to visit your parents, Piazza offers as an example. The system should already know how many people you are traveling with, as well as such details as your preferences for airline, travel times and departure and arrival airports.\n“It's a conservation of energy and an increase in efficiency. So that the decisions that I'm making are more about detailed preferences, such as where I'm going to sit,” Piazza says. \nEliminating seven or eight of the dozen other decisions that are now required on a Web form obviously makes for a much better customer experience. “And there’s also the ability to feel like they know you. Or to suggest new things, which is really important to retain and drive the relationship between the user and that service,” Piazza points out.\nMachine-learning technology also offers promise for internal problem solving. Say, for example, you’re in an airline marketer in a meeting and someone brings up the number of complaints passengers have been making about lost luggage. Is it really that bad? Where exactly is it happening? Rather than say you’ll have IT query the database when you get back to your desk and wait for the report, you’ll be able to make an on-the-fly query on your mobile device.  \n“Immediacy is really where the value is,” Piazza says. “The fact that we're shortening the time to process information and we’re becoming better at asking the right questions to drive insight.”\nAI technology, much like virtual reality, is very much in its infancy. Piazza, in fact, likens it to the early-to-mid ’90s when everybody was just beginning to get their heads around what the newfangled World Wide Web might mean to marketers. And, as with any new technology, if Viv is going to thrive beyond early adopters, the key driver will be the quality of the content it delivers. If Viv’s responses to consumers prove to be \"empathetic\" — and they accurately represent the ideals and values that the service using it embody — it will be a success in “creating great brand affinity,” Piazza feels.\n“It's not an end to the means, but it's a way of getting there,” he says. “It gives me time. That's the value.”",

      "text": "report malware 1 screenshot Open Source programming language developed and maintained by Apple that aims to provide a cleaner syntax that is easier write and read Developed by Apple, the Swift programming language is designed to bring a modern approach to software development by providing an expressive syntax and fast integration with other tools. The language is intended to replace conventional programming languages such as C, C++, or Objective-C. Use Swift with Apple’s Xcode and start developing new projects To start developing software application using Swift, you need a Mac running on OS X El Capitan with Xcode installed, or a computer running on Linux. Note that the Swift language, package managers, libraries, and debugger are made available to anyone under an Open Source license, so you can start coding right away. To help you get started, Apple provides detailed installation guides , but also an extensive documentation that covers the Swift programming language and provides a formal reference . Additional resources include sample code, videos, and so on. Moreover, Swift comes with API design guidelines , and anyone can analyze the source code since it's made available in multiple open source repositories that are hosted on GitHub. Write cleaner code using a programming language less inclined to include errors The whole idea behind Swift is to help developers produce source code that is both easy to write and to read. Swift builds on other programming languages yet employs a more natural syntax that allows the developer to express in a cleaner manner. Worth mentioning is that Swift manages the memory automatically and implements various standards designed to increase the code safety such as checking variables or using special syntax for nil objects. Use Swift to develop cross-platform software projects The open source Swift programming language is supported by all Apple platforms ( OS X , iOS , tvOS , and watchOS ) and integrates with the Xcode system, but it can also be used to create apps and libraries on Linux. However, Swift is flexible enough to be ported to other platforms as well. To conclude, Swift aims to bring a new standard in software development by offering a cleaner, safer, and faster solution for developing code that is easier to write, read, and maintain. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Xcode New in Swift 3.0 2016-05-31-a Preview 1: SE-0081 \"Move 'where' clause to end of declaration\" is implemented, allowing you to write 'where' clauses after the signature for a declaration, but before its body. SE-0071: \"Allow (most) keywords in member references\" is implemented. This allows the use of members after a dot without backticks, e.g. \"foo.default\". SE-0057: Objective-C lightweight generic classes are now imported as generic types in Swift. SE-0055: The types UnsafePointer, UnsafeMutablePointer, AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer, OpaquePointer, Selector, and Zone (formerly NSZone) now represent non-nullable pointers, i.e. pointers that are never nil. A nullable pointer is now represented using Optional, e.g. UnsafePointer? For types imported from C, non-object pointers (such as int *) now have their nullability taken into account.",

I visit only selected, trusted news sites, as \"free\" sites are horrible offenders here. Google is much less useful while on desktops as it is likely to return obnoxious websites.\nSo far I have not had a bad autoplay on iOS. However a growing problem is obnoxious pop up ads that are difficult to escape. \nOverall more of my Internet usage is shifting to apps because the Web is just too annoying. Years ago the Web was like a friendly, boisterous marketplace in a safe town. Now it's like the street in \"Casablanca\" where I must constantly guard against someone picking my pocket. It's not worth using except for a few sites I trust. \nGoogle in particular had better watch out. With Web hostility their search is not as useful. One reaction of theirs has been to pack more information directly into their search result. moepstar 1 minute ago Facebook is IMHO the biggest offender in that category, dozens of \"in your face\" videos no one asked explicitly for...\nLuckily, there's a setting if you can be bothered - and luckily, for many marketing departments around the world many can't... \n\"Look, how many views our videos have on FB\"...",

      "title": "Review: Apple's Late-2016 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar",
      "text": "Review: Apple's Late-2016 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar By Sunday, November 13, 2016, 04:21 am PT (07:21 am ET) Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar and Touch ID is in many ways an evolutionary update, offering would-be buyers a lightweight, relatively powerful portable rig with a beautiful Retina display and solid keyboard and trackpad. But is a major redesign and minor internal upgrades worth a starting price of $1,499? The new MacBook Pro is, like all modern MacBooks, an exquisitely designed and executed productivity machine. And like every successive MacBook generation, it's better than the one that came before —with some caveats. Design For 2016, Apple amplified, refined and tuned hardware to the highest degree. Tight tolerances dictated by Apple's design are immediately evident, from the new butterfly mechanism keys to cleanly milled ports to a precise fit and finish. Design, material choice and build quality come together to form a literally solid laptop. The Late-2016 MacBook Pro is in many ways an augmentation of the industrial design introduced with last year's 12-inch MacBook, both aesthetically and functionally. Apple carries forward the squared-off clamshell motif —with rounded corners, of course —but pancakes the entire device down to a mere 0.59 inches tall. By comparison, the early-2015 13-inch MacBook Pro came in at 0.71 inches tall, while the 12-inch MacBook is 0.52 inches at its tallest point. Despite an incredibly slim chassis, flexure and torsion are near zero, on par with previous MacBook Pro models and a vast improvement over the MacBook Air line. New for 2016 is an all-metal hinge that not only delivers a more uniform aluminum aesthetic, but comes with the added bonus of enhanced structural integrity. Previous generation MacBooks, including outgoing MacBook Pro models, featured a plastic hinge enclosure that, while sturdy, tends to creak with extended use. Inside, Apple retained its patented silky-smooth clutch mechanism for easy opening and closing. Opening the new MacBook Pro reveals a litany of design tweaks that brings the line more in step with the 12-inch MacBook. The most apparent change is a revamped keyboard boasting second-generation butterfly mechanism keys (more on this later). Introduced with MacBook in 2015, Apple's butterfly keys are much larger and feature a decreased key pitch as compared to the chiclet-style keys found in previous MacBook Pros. To fit the full-size keyboard into MacBook Pro's smaller frame, which shrunk from 12.35 inches-by-8.62 inches in 2015 to 11.97 inches-by-8.36 inches this year, Apple adopts a key layout debuted with the 12-inch MacBook. Of note, all four arrow keys fit into the space of three normal QWERTY keys, with full-size left and right buttons flanking a split pair of up and down keys. Making the fit even tighter is an extra-large Force Touch trackpad, which for reference boasts an active area larger than an iPhone 7 Plus' 5.5-inch screen. The enlarged trackpad sits just millimeters away from the spacebar, command and option keys, and an equal distance away from the finger notch that assists users in opening MacBook Pro's display. Emblazoned on each backlit key are letters and glyphs accomplished in Apple's San Francisco typeface, a theme becoming increasingly common as the company moves away from Helvetica Neue. Even the \"MacBook Pro\" logo sitting just below the notebook's Retina display is in San Francisco, as is text on the computer's packaging and accompanying documents. Nonfunctional changes include the removal of the iconic backlit Apple logo which graced MacBook Pro models for years. Taking its place is a shiny aluminum insert, mimicking the look of the 12-inch MacBook. In use For this review, we tested a 13-inch MacBook Pro equipped with a 2-gigahertz Intel Core i5 CPU, Intel Iris Graphics 540 integrated graphics chip, 8 gigabytes of 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM and 256 gigabytes of PCIe-based SSD storage. The baseline configuration comes in at $1,499. At the heart of this particular MacBook Pro is Intel's sixth-generation i5-6360U, a processor that first hit the streets in the third quarter of 2015. At first blush, a one-year-old processor might seem an odd choice for a laptop marketed as a \"pro\" laptop, but the silicon is the latest offering from Intel and more than enough to handle currently available apps. Our machine rated a decent single-core score of 3,691 points and 7,148 points on the latest version of Geekbench 4 , outperforming last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro with higher-clocked fifth-generation Intel CPUs. The machine managed 28,127 points in Geekbench's compute benchmark, which measures GPU performance using OpenCL. Source: Geekbench While the CPU and integrated GPU are evolutionary updates, the latest MacBook Pro comes with next-generation NVMe storage . The SSD and controller installed on the 13-inch model is capable of reaching sequential read speeds of 3.1 gigabytes per second and write speeds of 2.1 gigabytes per second, far exceeding competing Windows machines. More importantly, the storage technology helps to alleviate perceived system slowdowns blamed on MacBook Pro's 16GB RAM ceiling . Putting the computer through its paces, we cut high-resolution video, batch processed image files in Lightroom and performed complex editing operations in Photoshop. Most operations went smoothly, though batch processing and video editing did momentarily cue the spinning beach ball of death, likely due to our system's 8GB of RAM. A laptop's keyboard is arguably its most important user-facing feature. As mentioned above, the new MacBook Pro features a keyboard first introduced with the 12-inch MacBook last year. Specifically, both laptops employ keys designed around the butterfly mechanism, a take on traditional scissor-switch keys that allow for low-profile installations. While it helps shoehorn functional keys into a super-thin chassis, the butterfly mechanism is less tactile and offers decidedly shallow displacement as compared to conventional switch types. Users have taken notice, as evidenced by complaints regarding the restrictive 0.55mm key travel on the 12-inch MacBook. The second-generation butterfly mechanism is in part a response to those critics. While key travel specifics appear to be unchanged, the new MacBook Pro integrates a tuned dome switch part that feels more \"clicky\" and responsive than the first-generation iteration. In practice, the new keys fall closer to MacBook's low-displacement units than the vaunted QWERTY keyboard of MacBook Pros of yore. That being said, the keyboard is definitely workable. Moving from the aforementioned previous-generation MacBook Pro, we adapted quickly to the new keyboard feel and layout, and were typing at speed within minutes. Sitting just below the redesigned keyboard is a gigantic Force Touch trackpad. Built to accommodate a wide variety of gestures within macOS Sierra, we found the enlarged touchpad to offer improved navigation and control of first-party apps like iMovie and Photos. The extra surface area also proved useful in image editing software like Adobe's Photoshop CC. With any large trackpad, especially one with Force Touch technology capable of detecting presses anywhere on its surface, effective palm rejection technology is key. Most users will find their palm and first metacarpal (first bone of the thumb) rest directly over the top corners of the trackpad, in some cases touching the touch sensitive surface. To thwart errant inputs, Apple appears to be using touchpad algorithms similar to those deployed with previous Force Touch units. Importantly, the trackpad intelligently ignores large swaths of skin —palms —while at the same time remaining active to input from smaller capacitive signals generated by fingers. For example, laying one's left palm on the trackpad does not register as a press. Touching and pressing down on the surface with a fingertip —even if the left palm is still in contact —will invoke an expected input event, including system gestures that require multiple fingers. All in all, MacBook Pro's jumbo-size trackpad is among the best upgrades MacBook Pro has seen in years. It's easily accessible, responsive, intuitive and plays well with both first- and third-party macOS apps. Also new to the MacBook Pro series, and Macs in general, is a Retina display with support for the DCI-P3 color space, or as Apple calls it, Wide Color . The new feature, borrowed from iPhone 7, faithfully reproduces wide color gamut images, a plus for digital imaging professionals. Depending on your workflow, or content viewing preferences, you might not be able to readily take advantage of the wider gamut. Still, with Apple pushing to support the DCI-P3 standard across its device lineup, content providers and app makers are sure to take notice. Beyond a wider color space, the 13.3-inch LED-backlit display features the same 2,560-by-1,600 pixel native resolution and IPS technology as last year's 13-inch Pro. This laptop's speakers are no joke. Apple promises \"room filling sound\" and the MacBook Pro delivers. Granted, laptop speakers will likely never serve as a replacement for studio monitors, because physics, but the Pro is more than adequate for all but the most demanding projects. Listening to lossless tracks, audio fidelity is clean across the board, from brilliant highs to full, if not booming, bass. Perhaps more impressive is sound quality from lossy, compressed files and streaming services. In our tests, even music from YouTube —a go-to source for free streaming music —was consistently clean and free of sonic anomalies that might crop up on lesser notebooks. Apple promises 10 hours of battery life and we consistently hit that number while surfing the web and performing menial background tasks. Viewing a movie on Netflix with screen brightness and audio output set to 75 percent drained power at the advertised rate, for example. Of course, more processor intensive applications like Photoshop and Premiere devoured MacBook Pro's battery in only a few hours. Still, the laptop will easily last a cross-country —or international —flight completely unplugged. Connectivity Much has been said about Apple's decision to restrict MacBook Pro to Thunderbolt 3 ports —only two of which are included on the 13-inch model without Touch Bar —but we believe most users won't feel the pinch. Whereas past MacBook Pros featured a litany of I/O ports, from Thunderbolt to HDMI to USB, as well as an SD card slot, the current models max out at four Thunderbolt 3 inputs on Touch Bar versions. Apple is looking ahead to, and in many ways driving, the future of computing. USB-C format devices will one day soon become the de facto standard in peripheral expansion and connectivity, or at least that's what Apple is banking on. It is clear that Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 are heirs to their USB 2.0 and original Thunderbolt progenitors, and will soon show up as I/O options on most consumer hardware. This assumed future is unlikely to faze power users; those adept at daisy chaining external drives with monitors and a bevy of expensive equipment. We do, however, question whether it was good idea to force the same limitations on users looking to buy what is essentially a mid-tier laptop. Though it is christened MacBook Pro, the 13-inch non-Touch Bar version lacks the computing horsepower and upgrade paths available to buyers going the Touch Bar route. In essence, Apple is marketing the Touch Bar MacBook Pros to professionals who own the latest equipment, leaving the 13-inch entry-level iteration as a MacBook step-up model, or an aspirational product for consumers. Following that mindset, Apple might have been better served to include legacy ports on the mid-tier laptop. As it stands, Joe Q. Public will have to buy a USB-C to Lightning cable adapter just to sync their iPhone or iPad. And that's just for Lightning. Apple currently sells a number of adapters suitable for USB-C equipped MacBooks, including USB-C to USB, Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2, USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (for HDMI, etc.) and the USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter. Apple provides at least one concession with MacBook Pro: a 3.5mm audio jack. Alone amid a blank slate of aluminum on the Pro's right chassis wall, the headphone jack sits. In this case, however, we agree with Apple's decision to keep the jack in play for pros who need to connect audio hardware like microphones, monitors and mixers. Conclusion Overall, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is an achievement in industrial design that fulfills Apple's commitment to usability and user experience. It is a happy middle ground between the thin-and-light 12-inch MacBook (MacBook Air is going away very soon, folks) and Apple's top-of-the-line 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar. Though not the most powerful machine, the entry level Pro is more than sufficient for most users. Road warriors, coffee shop heroes and consumers who dabble in image and video editing are well served by the system's mix of performance and battery life. Still, $1,499 is a steep price to pay for what can be considered evolutionary upgrades. Factoring in price points from past releases, new MacBook Pro costs are in some ways justified by internal additions to top-tier Touch Bar models. Potential buyers should also take into account the lack of built-in expandability. Depending on use case, users might have to spend hundreds of dollars on adapters. That being said, the 13-inch Pro without Touch Bar fills a certain niche of the consumer market. If, for example, you're looking to replace an aging MacBook used mainly for light photo and video editing, word processing and other casual tasks, and the 13-inch format suits your needs, the new non-Touch Bar model offers a nice set of features and decent future proofing. If you're looking for a small form factor professional machine capable of tackling anything from 4K video cutting to CAD apps and beyond, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is definitely a better fit. Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar fits right in the middle —in specs and price —between the $1,299 MacBook and the $1,799 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The base architecture is undoubtedly MacBook Pro, but whether or not consumer will bite at $1,499 remains to be seen.

      "text": "Acer's ultra-light Swift 7 is a formidable foe to Apple's MacBook Published by Mashable on Sun, 13 Nov 2016 The push to make the thinnest, lightest, most portable laptop is proving fruitful. Case in point: the Acer Swift 7.According to Acer, the Swift 7 is the thinnest notebook PC in the world. When closed, it wouldn't be impossible to mistake it for a tablet with a keyboard attached, only thinner. At least, that's the case with my tried-and-true iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard Cover combo.SEE ALSO: Acer's new laptops are so thin they make the MacBook look fatWhile there's more to a laptop than its size, let's start there.Razor thinThe Swift 7 doesn't have a tapered design, where it's thicker in the back and slowly gets thinner towards the front where the trackpad is. Some manufacturers use this design technique to claim an unrealistic number for the thinness of their laptops. Read more...More about Mashable Choice, Windows 10, Laptops, Reviews, and Swift 7",

Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss to coat. Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, turning once midway through cooking. (The vegetables should be fairly tender, and just starting to caramelize, when you remove them from the oven.) \n2. In a stockpot or large Dutch oven , warm the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the onion and saute over medium high heat until it begins to soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the roasted carrots, apple and celery, and stir to coat with the onions and spices. \n3. Pour in the vegetable stock, raise the heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Using a regular or immersion blender , carefully puree the soup. If desired, add the butter to the soup and stir until it is melted and evenly incorporated. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy! Related Articles",

      "text": "Advertisement Microsoft Surface Pro 5 boasts superior specs than Apple’s iPad Pro2, to be released early 2017 By Harsh Soni Nov 12, 2016 09:11 AM EST Advertisement \n(Photo : Wikimedia Commons)Latest leaks of Kaby Lake specifications suggest processors for hybrids and over hundred designs are expected to launch by last quarter of 2016 \nAdvertisement \n\nWith Black Friday coming up, various deals are now being offered for many devices. Many reports said that users should turn a blind eye on the deals for the Surface Pro 4 as the release of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is just around the corner. \nWe all know that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was noticeably left out from the recent Microsoft event, but fans still believe that the hybrid device is indeed arriving very soon. \nThough the tech giant has not confirmed the improvement of the Surface Pro 5 rumors but the speculations and leaks about the device are abounding. The upcoming hybrid seems to rock the hybrid portable enterprise device market next year. Advertisement \nThe rumors are pointing that Microsoft will be releasing a hybrid device that will be equipped with Intel's Kaby Lake processors. The Microsoft's decision to apparently release Surface Pro 5 early 2017 instead of late 2016 appears to target the release of Intel's latest processor. \nSurface Pro 5, with Kaby Lake chips, would stand far beyond than its competitor especially the upcoming Apple iPad Pro 2, which is also rumored to be released in early 2017. Another reason why Surface Pro 5 release date pushed to 2017 also includes the Windows 10 Redstone 2 OS arrival, which is also scheduled for early 2017. \nThe next-gen Microsoft tablet is expected to pack in a 16GB of RAM and powered by Intel's Kaby Lake processor as said earlier. Surface Pro 5 is also expected to feature the Nvidia Pascal GPU card as well as the enhanced battery with USB-C support, reports iDigital Times . \nAccording to Inquisitr , Surface Pro 5 is equipped with as much as 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, while Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro currently tops at 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM \nOne thing that would definitely give the Surface Pro 5 a definitive edge over the iPad Pro 2 is the operating system used in the two devices. The iPad Pro 2 would most likely still run iOS , a mobile operating system. This severely cripples the device, since even basic tasks such as working on multiple MS Word documents would prove tricky on the iPad Pro 2. \nMicrosoft's Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro of Apple Inc. were two of the most awaited tablets that were released in 2015. The Surface Pro 4 was unveiled at the beginning of October 2015, and one month later, the iPad Pro rolled out, according to Load The Game , now the rivalry to be seen between the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2. \nAccording to AutoWorldNews , Microsoft Surface Pro 5's base model will be starting at $899. The 4K UHD model will come with a steep price tag of $1,599, if rumors proved to be true. \n",

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nApple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Nordstrom ( JWN ) have been hovering near their buy zones as Walt Disney ( DIS ) and Facebook ( FB ) are moving opposite in ways at their 200-day lines. Apple \nApple has been hovering in and out of buy range from a 110.33 buy point initially cleared Sept. 14, but ultimately finished the week below that level, at 108.43. Big tech names in general have not joined the Trump rally as investors pivot to other sectors like defense, banks and basic materials. Microsoft \nFellow tech giant Microsoft rebounded from support at its 50-day line, closing the week at 59.02, back above a 58.80 buy point after falling just below the pivot on Thursday. The stock is about 4% below its high reached Oct. 25. Nordstrom \nAfter retaking its 50-day line, department store Nordstrom is now extended past its 5% buy range. The stock gapped up 7% Thursday to re-clear a 53.81 flat base entry as rival department stores were bullish on the holidays. Nordstrom extended gains Friday on its estimate-beating quarterly report, closing the week 16.5% higher. Walt Disney \nDisney retook its downward-sloping 200-day line after issuing its quarterly report late Thursday. The media powerhouse missed earnings estimates, and its ESPN subscriber woes continue. But the stock is rising as CEO Bob Iger is bullish on ESPN's future. Facebook \nFacebook, on the other hand, has been heading toward its 200-day line and dipped below that level intraday on Thursday and Friday, but ended the week above that level. The move came shortly after Facebook crumbled below its 50-day line as the social media leader projected decelerating ad revenue growth in 2017.

      "text": "European regulators’ recent finding that Apple avoided billions of dollars in taxes by stashing its profits in Ireland, a known tax haven, put the tech giant in an unwelcome spotlight. But Apple’s tax dodging is just the tip of a huge iceberg of offshore corporate tax avoidance.\nAccording to a new report, Offshore Shell Games 2016, by CTJ, ITEP & USPIRG, American firms are avoiding up to $718 billion in U.S. taxes on $2.5 trillion in profits held offshore. These jaw-dropping numbers will keep getting bigger until we fix the corporate tax system.\nThe report found that nearly three-quarters of America’s biggest companies avoid U.S. taxes by setting up subsidiaries in tax haven nations — countries where corporate tax rates are minimal or nonexistent, financial transparency murky and tax law enforcement lax. The use of tax haven subsidiaries to avoid U.S. taxes is highly concentrated among a small group of mega-corporations: just 30 firms are responsible for two-thirds of all that offshore loot.\nMuch of the corporate profit booked in offshore tax havens isn’t earned there. Corporations use accounting tricks to artificially shift earnings from the U.S. (and other large nations with big markets and effective tax systems) to small-nation tax havens. For instance, a pharmaceutical firm can assign a drug patent to a subsidiary in a tax haven, then pay steep royalties to the subsidiary to manufacture and sell the drug in this country.\nThe result? U.S. expenses are artificially inflated, depressing domestic profits and therefore taxes, while profits stack up in offshore havens where they’re taxed little if at all.\nWhen multinational corporations avoid taxes by using offshore havens, the rest of us pick up the tab through higher taxes on working people and domestic businesses, reduced public services or higher public debt.\nEnding deferral — demanding corporations pay all their taxes every year like everyone else — is the best way to end offshore tax-dodging. This simple reform should apply both to future profits and the $2.5 trillion now sitting overseas.\nUnfortunately, some politicians want to richly reward big corporations for effectively hiding their profits in offshore tax havens with a steep cut in the U.S. taxes they owe on that existing earnings pile. Donald Trump would tax these profits at just 10 percent, handing tax-dodging corporations a half-trillion-dollar tax cut. Some in Congress want to reduce the rate even more.\nWhether to give such massive and unwarranted tax discounts to some of the nation’s most profitable corporations is sure to be the centerpiece of a congressional struggle over corporate tax reform expected next year.\nMATTHEW GARDNER, WASHINGTON\nEditor’s note: Matthew Gardner is the executive director of Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",

      "title": "Apple Varieties Grown in Washington State",
      "text": "Apple Varieties Grown in Washington State Apple Varieties Grown in Washington State By Kristin Kendle Updated June 04, 2016 . \nWashington apples are known around the nation and around the world, but to those of us who live in Washington State, apples are just a staple. Go to any local grocery store and you will see easily five apple varieties, but if apple season is on, there can be 10 or more varieties lined up. Washington’s apple season starts in mid-August and goes well into the fall . \nEach year, more than 100 million apple boxes are harvested and each box weighs about 40 pounds, according to BestApples.com . Most impressive, perhaps, is the fact that there is no harvesting machine designed to pick apples. Each and every Washington apple you buy has been picked by hand. \nThere are many apple varieties grown in Washington State, but there are just nine common varieties that account for the majority of the crop—Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, Braeburn, Honeycrisp, Cripps Pink, and Cameo. \nIdeas on What to Do with All The Apples: Apple Recipes | More Apple Recipes | Other Apple Varieties Red Delicious Apples. Copyright Zajac 1. Red Delicious \nRed Delicious is Washington’s most exported apple—close to 50 percent of what goes out to other countries are Red Delicious apples! About 30 percent of the total apple crop in Washington are Red Delicious, too. This is one of the oldest apple varieties and was first grown in the 1880s and, as such, it has been modified from its original appealingly sweet and crunchy apple over time. In the past, Red Delicious made up three-quarters of Washington’s apple crop, but since the 1980s, the numbers have been in decline as Red Delicious has started to lose its appeal and signature taste. The skin on this apple is also thicker and stronger tasting than on many other apple varieties. Other apples like Fujis and Galas are climbing up the ranks! \nBest Use: Eaten fresh or used in salads. Available: All year \ncontinue reading below our video Tipping Etiquette Around the World Golden Delicious Apples. Copyright randomduck 2. Golden Delicious \nWhile this apple shares a similar moniker to Red Delicious, the two apples couldn’t be more different. Golden Delicious was born in West Virginia in 1914 and remains the state fruit there. Eastern Washington’s dry, warm climate has done well for these apples. Sweet and crisp, easy to grow, and extremely versatile whether eaten fresh or used for cooking, Golden Delicious is the ultimate all-around apple, though, the cultivar rarely gets the accolades it deserves. \nBest Use: Very versatile. Eat fresh, great baking apple, great in salads. Available: All year Gala Apples. Copyright activescience 3. Gala \nGalas are known for being crisp and sweet, yet mild. They’re a favorite of kids since the skin is thinner and the flavor is light and inviting. Gala apples were developed in 1965 in New Zealand, but are now one of the most common crops in Washington. \nBest Use: Eat fresh, salads, and a fair apple for baking. Available: September to May, but often all year due to cold storage. Fuji Apples. Copyright Veganbaking.net 4. Fuji \nFuji apples were born in Japan, a cross between Red Delicious and Ralls Janet, in the 1960s. Today, Washington produces more Fuji apples than Japan and this apple is fast becoming one of the favorite cultivars. Fujis are exceptionally crisp, very sweet, and firm—producing a satisfying crunch when you bite into one. \nBest Use: Eat fresh or use in salads, can be used in pies, sauces, and baked goods, but Fuji’s real strength is anything that serves it up raw. Available: October to August, but often all year due to cold storage. Granny Smith Apples. Copyright Veganbaking.net 5. Granny Smith \nGranny Smith apples originated in Australia when Maria Smith found a mysterious seedling in 1868, but the seedling’s parentage is still only theoretical (most likely, a combination with a French crabapple). Today, Granny Smith apples are one of Washington’s most popular cultivars and are used for just about everything. The flavor of these apples is tart and assertive and the apples are very crisp and firm. \nBest Use: Very versatile. Tart and crisp when eaten fresh or used in salads, turns sweet when baked, and freezes well, too. Available: Harvested starting in October, but often available all year. Braeburn Apples. Copyright Veganbaking.net 6. Braeburn \nBraeburns are some of the best baking apples due to their mildly tart flavor, but are also a tasty apple when eaten fresh. They are said to have a spicy sweetness and a nice crispness, but not as crisp or firm as the Fuji or Granny Smith. \nBest Use: Braeburns have a fair range of uses and are great for baking and eating fresh. Available: October to July Honeycrisp Apples. Copyright Vegan Feast Catering 7. Honeycrisp \nDeveloped by the University of Minnesota’s apple breeding program, the Honeycrisp is a hybrid known for an amazing balance of crispness, juicy sweetness, and just a hint of tartness. As a result, Honeycrisp is a superb apple for eating raw, much like the Fuji. \nBest Use: Delicious to eat fresh, but because also good for baking and salads. Available: Harvested in early to mid-autumn. Honeycrisps are not always easy to find in stores out of season. Cripps Pink Apples are also called Pink Lady Apples. Copyright Veganbaking.net 8. Cripps Pink or Pink Lady \nCripps Pink is also called the Pink Lady and is the last apple harvested in Washington State each year. This cultivar thrives in hot climates and requires a long time on the tree—about 200 days! Cripps Pinks are crisp and tart. They were cultivated in Australia by crossing Lady Williams apples with Golden Delicious. \nBest Use: Good for salads and pies, but also a fine apple to eat raw. Available: November to August. Cameo Apples. Copyright chefranden 9. Cameo \nThe Cameo cultivar was discovered right here in Washington as a chance seedling of unknown parentage, and possibly a cross between Red Delicious and Golden Delicious. Cameos are crunchy and sweet. \nBest Use: Great all around for baking, eating raw, salads, and more. Available: October to August",

      "text": "Sun, 11/13/2016 - 7:00am | Rich Warren \nA reader mailed a question that's a bit different than most of our queries: \"I read over a year ago that Apple was going to make available last December an iWatch that, among other things, would use infrared or radio waves to determine the glucose level in your blood. Months later, the rumor mill says that Apple was developing a band to do the same thing. I called the Mac store in Market Place, and they didn't know. Can you tell me the status of this product?\" \nApple steers clear of medical devices, since that's a whole layer of government regulation that complicates its marketing. \nOther companies offer products with sensors and applications (apps) that work in conjunction with the Apple Watch. \nFor example, the Dexcom website claims that the Dexcom Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share will support the Apple Watch when it ships to customers. As the industry's first mobile-connected system, Dexcom CGM and its mobile apps, Share2 and Follow, are already approved by the FDA and allow both users and followers to view glucose data directly on their iPhones. \nThe Apple Watch apps from Dexcom will now enable users to monitor glucose on the Apple Watch so that people with diabetes can discreetly view their own information, while parents and caregivers can view a child or loved one's glucose data, giving them peace of mind and reassurance when they are apart. \nDexcom CGM provides patients the opportunity to track their glucose levels and trends right on their wrist with the Apple Watch. You can find more at dexcom.com. \nUnfortunately, Dexcom fails to list any public telephone contact or where you can buy its devices. The Dexcom website states that its G5 Apple Watch compatible glucose monitoring device became available in March 2016. Thus, the Dexcom CGM is a separate device, and the Apple Watch itself does not monitor glucose. \nA reader feels we gave short shrift to the Magnavox DVR discussed in this column a few weeks ago: \"The Magnavox MDR867H is capable of HD recording from its tuners to the hard drive. Recording to the DVD drive limits resolution to 480p. Input from the RCA jack limits resolution to 480i. The 1 TB hard drive limits recording time to about 1,000 hours in HD or about 360 hours in FHD2.\" \nIf you're serious about wanting to leave cable/satellite and watch only broadcast television, then this Magnavox and its near twin, Philips DVR, or the Channel Master DVR+ are essential for time shifting. These devices probably will not remain on the market for many years, so it's best to buy one now. \nIf you buy a DVR without dual-tuners and you want to record a commercial TV show at the same time as a pubic TV show, WILL-TV (channel 12) rebroadcasts most of its primetime schedule in the middle of the night. Simply record the commercial network TV show when it airs in prime time and then set the device to record the PBS show when it reruns in early morning hours. \nNot long ago, new models of electronics gradually replaced old models. New versions arrived at the January Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas while retailers placed the previous model on sale in the spring pending the arrival to the latest and greatest. While this still occurs, it's growing less common. \nElectronics firms discontinue manufacturing models they will replace in the fall, filling the pipeline just enough for the holidays. If they guess holiday sales right, then they and the retailer won't lose profits liquidating the old model come spring. Often, the best sales occur immediately after Christmas. Some smartphone makers yank old models very quickly to sell in less developed countries so you can't always find a bargain on last year's phone. Google did this with its Nexus line when the new Pixel line debuted. \nRich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics. He can be emailed at .",

      "text": "\nHow do you download an app on your iPhone or iPad and have it also download on your Apple TV? The answer: automagically!\nYou can set up your Apple TV so that any app you download on your iPhone or iPad is also — automatically! — downloaded on your Apple TV. There are a couple of caveats: the developer has to make a version for the Apple TV, and the developer has to bundle it with the iOS apps ·(i.e. not sell and charge for it separately). Lots of apps are like that, though!\nEven better, Apple has updated its iTunes Link Maker tool to include tvOS apps. That means, even if an app is exclusive to Apple TV, you can still download it from your iPhone with the proper iTunes link.\nHow to enable automatic downloads on Apple TV In order to download Apple TV apps using your iPhone, you'll need to have automatic downloads enabled on your Apple TV.\nLaunch the Settings app on Apple TV Click on Apps . Click on Automatically Install Apps .\nIf the feature is enabled, you will see \"On\" next to it.\n\nWhenever you download an app or game that is supported on Apple TV, it will automatically appear on you Apple TV's Home screen.\nHow to disable automatic downloads on Apple TV If you decide that you don't want to clutter up your Apple TV with a bunch of apps and games you only intended to use on your iPhone or iPad, you can always disable automatic downloads. You'll still be able to purchase Apple TV exclusive content on your iPhone, iPad, or computer, but you'll have to manually download them onto your Apple TV from the Purchased tab.\nLaunch the Settings app on Apple TV Click on Apps . Click on Automatically Install Apps .\nIf the feature is disabled, you will see \"Off\" next to it.\n\nAny questions? Do you have any questions about enabling or disabling automatic downloads on Apple TV? Let me know in the comments and I'll help you out with any problem you may have.\n",

      "text": "Dave Greenbaum | November 13, 2016 in deals \nThis week’s free app is the puzzle and mind game Perchang . Normally it’s $2, but you can get it free from iTunes until Thursday, November 17th. What Is It? \nThe game is deceptively simple: get marbles into a hole by adjusting a Rube Goldberg device. By adjusting one or two of the gadgets, the marbles go in the right place. At early levels, all you do is adjust a lever or a fan. Later in the game, figuring out where the marbles go isn’t that obvious. \nThe game has fantastic 3D details which you can put into Low Power Mode to prevent it from draining the battery. The soundtrack isn’t very inspiring but gives you some motivation. \nEach level takes a maximum of 60 seconds. The level ends when you’ve filled the container with marbles or the time runs out. \nThe in-app purchase of $1.99 adds more levels. If you want more time on a puzzle, the in-app purchase lets you continue past the deadline. I didn’t try either purchase and probably wouldn’t buy the continues. Half the fun of a game like this is running against the clock. Who Is It Good For? \nI’d recommend this game for older kids and adults who can solve complex puzzles. I could see a younger child have trouble figuring out how to line up the marble path. You don’t need an A in geometry to win this game. The secret is, like any machine, you have to see how shapes and angles change the trajectory of the marble. \nI loved this game! Perchang was a short burst of fun when I had a few minutes to kill. I knew the level wouldn’t take more than 60 seconds. Playing cleared my mind a little and I got to think outside the box and into the ball. Should You Download It? \nThe app played slow on my iPhone 5s but was manageable. I had no problems on a newer phone. The app takes up about 350 MB. I’m keeping this game on all my devices. Unlike other games I keep to entertain the young ones, this game I’m keeping all to myself. With the 60 second limit on levels, it won’t occupy them long. This game is about thinking and conceptualizing rather than pure entertainment. More Reading: About Dave Greenbaum Based in Kansas, Dave Greenbaum runs his own computer repair business.

      "text": "Apple’s commitment to Privacy There is a lot of stories floating around that Apple has fallen behind in the AI race compared to Amazon (Alexa), Google Assistant and Microsoft (Cortana). What these stories are not highlighting is Apple’s commitment to user privacy. Yes, other assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant might have an edge over Siri — for example, Alexa in Amazon’s Echo will allow you to order products directly from Amazon’s website. Google Home and Google Assistant was heavily touted by Google during the release of its Pixel phone. But these companies mine user’s private data like there is no tomorrow. For example. Google Home will mine your email about your upcoming flight and remind you on the day before the flight. While these are convenient to some people, there are lot more people out there who do not want these personal information to be compromised by third parties — the main threat here is not Google and Amazon mining the info; any compromise of these services will mean the private data is in the wrong hands. Identity theft becomes much easier once this data is compromised. Apple, on the other hand, puts users privacy on the top of its priorities; the millions and millions of people who line up to buy every new iPhone realize this and value this commitment from Apple.\nQuoting Tim Cook during the recent fourth quarter earnings report:\nIn terms of the balance of privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, this is a false tradeoff. People would like you to believe you have to give up privacy to have AI do something for you, but we don’t buy that. It might take more work, it might take more thinking, but I don’t think we should throw our privacy away. It’s sort of like the age old argument between privacy and security. You should have both. You shouldn’t have to make a choice.\nApple is making a serious commitment to user privacy and its loyal customers value that a lot. The loyal apple customers do not care if Alexa or Google Assistant is able to answer a few more questions compared to Siri. They would rather than mortgage their privacy to Amazon or Google.",

      "text": "  10:29am CST | by Ahmed Humayun , in News | Apple Even after all the criticism on MacBook Pro 2016, it is selling like hot cakes \nApple has recently announced that the MacBook Pro 2016 series has broken the record for online sales for the company. You can just imagine the bar which the laptop has set for others to compete. Apple is just in being so proud and boastful. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock \nAn independent survey conducted has confirmed that Apple MacBook Pro 2016 has outsold all other laptops in the market in merely five days of availability. Now that is some record alright. The numbers are absolutely great especially when compared to Windows. \nThe results leave Apple very much positive not only about the current standing of the notebook but also for what lies in the future. Slice Intelligent’s data is pretty much evident is showing that the New MacBook Pro has outsold the Dell XPS 13 and 15 combined. \nThe Mac-OS hardware is very powerful. It has even beaten Microsoft’s Surface Book in competition. The new Pro just does great in comparison with other laptop sales. In only five days of availability the Apple MacBook Pro has almost crossed the complete MacBook sales in 2015 and 2016. \nHowever one thing should be made note of here is that Slice’s method of collecting data is not so fool proof. This is because it analyses receipts from 4.4 million shoppers in the United States. The analysis should be wide spread so that the popularity of MacBook could be understood. \nWith all this positive news there is one negative fact too. Many MacBook users are not happy that Apple has not refreshed the MacBook Pro enough. Interestingly 40% of MacBook buyers of 2014 chose to buy a competing brand rather than the MacBook. \nHowever no matter how credible the data results are one thing is for sure Tim Cook will most certainly be happy with the initial sale results of the MacBook Pro.

I remember how horrible itunes was, where it would make you re-add music to your library if you move it or change the file name. And how it would erase data from your thing if you put it on another itunes program. It really was a piece of crap software. Itunes and their proprietary ***",

The iPad Mini 4 may not get a successor but will stay part of the iPad lineup. A new 10.9 inch iPad Pro will inherit the same physical footprint of the 9.7 inch iPad Pro which will make it bezel-less and most likely the first iPad without a physical Home Button. The 9.7 inch iPad Pro will be refreshed as a low-cost model. Both, the new 10.9 inch model and a refreshed 12.9 inch iPad Pro will inherit the TrueTone display from the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro . Also all models will still feature headphone jacks and come with a quad-microphone array. The new 12,9 inch iPad Pro will get the same 12 megapixel camera with TrueTone flash, that premiered on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro .  ",

      "title": "Apple Cider Vinegar, Blackstrap Molasses and Baking Soda for Fibroids",
      "text": "Effective Natural Cures for Fibroids Apple Cider Vinegar Write a review Posted by Cathy013 (Monroe, Louisiana, USA) on 11/10/2009 \nI suffered from VERY heavy bleeding and was diagnosed with uterine polyps and possible fibroids. First was told hysterectomy; I didn't want this so I was prescribed a hormone; made the cramping, etc., WORSE; a year later I had more tests - same problem, heavy bleeding & cramping - the tests (such as saline ultrasound) were so UNCOMFORTABLE and no relief, still recommended surgery which I really didn't feel comfortable about. I searched \"natural remedies for fibroids, heavy bleeding, etc.\" and found this site. Tried ACV and black strap molasses first (1 dose of the molasses-could NOT handle that!); then tried the ACV with baking soda (2 TBSP natural ACV from health food store and 1/2 to 1 tsp baking soda dissolved in 8 oz water once daily has worked for me). I started this in August; it is now November and I feel SO MUCH BETTER! It is unbelievable - very little bleeding at regular cycle time - little to no cramping; and I was in misery before-periods lasted for weeks and would only stop for a few days and then start again. I no longer have that problem-haven't since I started the ACV & baking soda in August. It WORKS! Chapel Hill, Ncc 12/17/2009 \nI started taking ACV about a month ago for fibroid relief and I noticed a significant, positive change in my heavy flow and cramping. For the last year or so, I would have to remain inside and well medicated for the first few days of my cycle. I even had a recent, 3-day hospital stay in October for severe anemia, due to blood loss and received a blood transfusion during that time. It was a scary ordeal. In November, after trying ACV, I noticed my cramping had subsided and my flow was lighter. The first two days were still a little heavy, but I could visit my family during Thanksgiving and enjoy the holidays without any \"accidents\". I'm still taking it and can't wait to see how this month goes! Chapel Hill, Nc 01/05/2010 \nI was admitted into the hospital in Oct. for excessive bleeding after fainting in the shower. I found this website the following week. I began drinking a shot-glass of apple cidar vinegar daily immediately. I also ordered the blackstrap molasses tablets, which I've been taking daily for 2 months. So I would say I started seeing positive results during my Nov. and Dec. menstral cycles. I just received my shipment of ACV tablets. Good Luck! Irvine, Usa 07/23/2011 \nThanks everyone for great input regarding Fibroids. Since most of us are in the dark & trying to avoid surgeries with massive fibroids [10cm ].. I have a SERIOUS PLEA for every woman posting here. It's great to hear that your \"symptoms\" have eased up a bit or a lot BUT what would really be helpful to all of us here would be an organized & measured report of your progress, starting with: \n1. The size of your [biggest] Fibroid initially \n2. Remedies you followed with measurements \n3. Proof of \"size reduction\" with the latest size from your latest ultrasound > for this you may have to REVISIT the site and update us. Please take a bit of pain so the rest of us can have a calming assurance that Yes.. Indeed.. the SIZE CAN SHRINK TOO .. \nNOW SOME TIPS: \n1. After consulting numerous doctors, a few surprised me with the fact that the menstrual pain/cramps are actually due to Anemia & prolonged blood depletion instead of the Fibroids themselves. So don't just treat your Fibroids, but also take Iron Supplements such as pills and spirulina powder [mixed in carrot or apple juice]. Do not just depend on BSM if you have severe Anemia, get your #s checked. It turns out, the more anemic you are, the more you will bleed. YIIKEESS!!! Its a cycle. My fibroid is still there.. but I've seen the miracle of treating Anemia with 90% pain reduction! And reduced bleeding as well! It will take you 1 or 2 months to see dramatic results! :) Just STICK to the regimen. \n2. Many women here have complained of constipation etc due to IRON pills. Did you know that there are Iron pills in health food stores that are made of whole foods & are vegetarian and hence more absorbable and not upsetting your stomach at all! Try them before giving up. But add some spirulina or BSM to this. If you are severely anemic, take 2 to 3 pills a day for a few months. Then taper down to 1, for maintenance. Do get blood work done to see your requirements. \n3. Many women here have also complained of ACV's taste and I had the same issue. But reading its wonders, I had to come up with a way, and I did! Its the most delicious concoction/cocktail ever. Instead of taking ACV straight or mixing it up in water, I am mixing 2tbs in Lychee Juice with 1/4 tsp Baking Soda. You can use apple juice or use any sweet juice to counter it's sourness. You will be addicted to this delicious drink. \n4. Rinse your mouth right after as ACV could be bad for teeth enamel. \n5. Other women have complained of BSM's strong taste. The best way to take it is to add it to some hot water and enjoy it like tea. Others here have drizzled it on ice cream too! So don't give up. Be creative. Don't mix it up with your coffee or tea as Caffeine tends to feed fibroids! That's what I've heard. \n6. Additionally, you could take DIM supplment to balance fibroid-causing Estrogen \nAgain .. I wonder if one should just sit back & relax just because the symptoms have disappeared. Your fibroid could still be there or growing! So do go for a 2nd scan and definitely report your findings here specially the SIZE-CHANGES or Shrinkage! This is the only site where we can truly trust the testimonials. So please ladies, keep us updated with your measurements! Don't abandon us once your symptoms subside. Keep us posted.

      "text": "The new company, focused on creating the most innovative and intuitive Apple accessories in the world, released an Apple-compatible all-in-one music lamp and charging dock for pre-order this holiday season\nLos Angeles, CA, United States – November 11, 2016 /MarketersMedia/ —\nThe WySky Music Lamp , launched this month on Kickstarter, is an all-in-one solution for mobile music streaming inside the home. Designed for all new Apple products, the WySky Music Light is a one stop shop for playing music, charging your phone, and setting the mood all at the same time.\n“As music lovers, we’ve always loved speaker systems that plug directly into your phone while it charges, but we thought something was missing.” says founder Jeff Wu. “When you listen to music, so much of the pleasure and the experience depends on mood and lighting. So we wanted to combine the sound of music with the ambient lighting of the room, all in a single device. It’s a great way to unwind during dinner, at a party, or with a book or a partner after a long day.”\nMost lamps have a set color — either warm white light, cold white light, or a colored light. WySky is the first lamp that allows you to blend any color together, which means you can choose the precise shade and color that is best suited to your room or mood. The lamp is fully integrated with iOS 10 (iOS 6.1 and newer), is MFi-approved by Apple, and works with iPhone, iPad, and iPod. The team has gone through several iterations of this product to be able to provide the highest quality sound and light. It includes a 4 inch full-range speaker to fill the room with hi-definition audio and 81 LEDs that won’t burn out or get hot to the touch, and a software interface which allows for selection within a 16 million color spectrum.\nThe WySky Music Lamp is designed to complement and enhance a mindful lifestyle. It was inspired by the founders’ love of music, design, Apple products, and having a quiet and beautiful space to relax every single day.\nIn exchange for pledging to the project, backers can choose from five different styles of varying colors, starting at $99. Each lamp comes will the full range of lighting options, an alarm clock feature, and a 4” full range speaker. Backers have until Wednesday, November 23rd to pre-order and can expect to receive their Music Lamps in January 2017.\nFor more information, visit the Kickstarter page, or contact Scott Hughes at wyskytech@gmail.com .\nAbout WySky:\nWySky is an upcoming lifestyle brand and design studio based in Shanghai and Los Angeles, focused on creating the most innovative and intuitive Apple accessories in the world.\nFor additional information:\nKickstarter Campaign\nPress Kit\n http://h0cn.fnd.to/wysky\nContact Info:\nName: Scott Hughes\nEmail: wyskytech@gmail.com\nOrganization: WySky\nVideo URL: http://h0cn.fnd.to/wysky\nSource: http://marketersmedia.com/wysky-an-la-based-lifestyle-brand-and-design-studio-specializing-in-multi-function-apple-accessories-launches-on-kickstarter/145537\nRelease ID: 145537\n ",

      "text": "Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks? Yes. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon all suffered this week, but some think that’s short-sighted. Is the new U.S. president bad for Silicon Valley’s business? Carsten Koall / Getty Images There’s no question that stock of tech companies got hit this week on no real financial developments or performance issues. Except, of course, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. Yes, that . Apple shares were down in the five days from $110.03 to about $108.43. Google was down from $795 to $771.56; Facebook dropped from $123.21 to $119.04; Netflix dropped from $124.26 to $114.78; and Amazon was off from $771.60 to $739.01. Most Wall Street analysts pointed to the Trump win as the proximate cause of the drop, given his rocky history with tech and also Silicon Valley so far. That’s included: A call for a boycott of Apple due to its encryption fight with the government and also his contention that it should make its devices in the U.S.; an attack on Amazon over taxes and, really, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the tough-on-Trump Washington Post ; and opposition to net neutrality regulations by the FCC , which have favored the internet powerhouses, and the possibility of their repeal. Add to that a hard line on immigration, as well as potentially isolationist trade policies and a myriad of tangles over tech-favored social issues like gay rights. And, most of all, just a fundamental disconnect between the new administration and Silicon Valley, which largely supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Of course there’s Peter Thiel , so Facebook (where he is a director) might be safe, along with Airbnb, Palantir, SoFi and other investments he has made in a myriad of tech startups. But most in Silicon Valley have no direct lines into the Trump administration, aside from tweeting congratulatory pleasantries at it in the vain hope of detente, so it will be a rough road for a while until the expected lobbying compromises are made in D.C. over the next year. And that is precisely what will happen. For all its vaunted liberal ideals of tolerance and meritocracy, tech is big business and it will find a way to live and thrive inside a Trump regime and make all the necessary compromises. There’s some good things they can get, too — all kinds of goodies for the rich, deregulation of the kind that benefits tech around employment, perhaps, and more. And a more business-friendly and free-spending administration, which will largely benefit banking, defense and infrastructure companies initially, will most certainly trickle down to tech in ways that might not seem clear right now. But government aid, obviously, is not the way that tech has thrived for so long. While it has used all the levers, most of Silicon Valley has been successful through creating innovative products and services that consumers and businesses use enthusiastically. Those that have not innovated have gotten dinged and those that have are doing well. That’s why the current stock sell-off is a short-term panic, rather than a real worry. Is it really likely that Trump will target Amazon relentlessly until it is in ruins? It makes for a compelling media story and Trump holds a grudge, but seems unlikely that this is what he wants to spend his time doing as president. As long as the company continues to improve its business in the ways that Wall Street likes, that will be all that matters, and any vindictive attacks on it by Trump will look bad for him and not Amazon. What investors will need to pay attention to is the overall market — it’s the economy, stupid, and as usual — and how issues with other countries like China and Europe develop. While there will be pressure to make more tech goods in this country, it’d be a small price to pay. They may feel bad on social media and wring their hands at the fresh daily horrors, but I predict total normalization by those in tech, who can pretzel with the best of them. And then it’s back to business as usual and the tech stocks will rise and fall based on that. recode_divider",

      "text": "GUEST: \nApple announcements are like holidays in our office and the new iOS release in September was no exception. Since then, AI assistant news has moved at warp speed. Every Alexa update is a new opportunity for fintech integration. With their latest releases, Google also is now in the running.\nAdd to this Bank of America’s launch of their new AI chatbot Erica on at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas and the bank bot race is on. John Sculley, the former CEO at Apple, shared his insights with financial institutions at the conference that amounted to this: plan for radical change or prepare for obsolescence.\nSo let’s break down the specifics around what’s getting us excited:\n3 things about the new Apple iOS we love Texting now looks more like messaging: This update felt inevitable on our end and we’re glad finally it’s here. Texting is now going to look, and act, more like instant messaging with gifs, static images, embeddable media, and quick reply buttons (i.e., with a GUI). Plain text hasn’t been a great experience for business services in general and now opportunities live in the availability of rich media in texting. Bots (apps) are live in iMessage : This means banks can now be in iMessage. The same bots that live on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Kik, and others can now live on iMessage, expanding the reach and multi-channel opportunity to connect with consumers on their preferred device or service. We expect the ability to do this on android devices in the future, as well. Bots are live in Siri : This opens Siri up to look more like Alexa where consumers can interact with a voice-controlled personal assistant. Texting is easier than making a phone call, however, and directing bots with your voice is the easiest of all. Bots rolling out in Siri will help make the platform interactive at a personal level. 3 things about the new Google Assistant we love Conversation Actions : Many users already are familiar with the concept of “direct actions”. This could be anything from, “What is the time in [insert time zone],” to, “Play song [insert song title].” What’s more exciting is “conversation actions” where a user asks a less direct — or not completely structured — question and back-and-forth ensues to confirm the question being asked and find an appropriate answer. This is especially exciting for the prospect of machine learning kicking in to continuously improve the consumer experience for banking and elsewhere. Google Assistant SDK : Opening up to partners is what will drive innovation in conversation actions, so the launch of the Assistant SDK and the launch of conversation actions are inextricably linked. As we saw with Facebook opening the bot marketplace to developers and how that spurned incredible growth in participation, so will the opening of the Google Assistant SDK, further accelerating the creation and adoption of consumer facing bots. Competition in the marketplace: Alexa, Siri, Viv, Cortana, Facebook Messenger and others compete in the automated or voice-activated assistant space. Google joining them adds fuel to the fire to develop more competitively and garner adoption more quickly. Consumers will be interacting with bots at a far accelerated pace than originally conceived. Bots are moving incredibly fast These announcements indicate how rapidly the space is evolving and we expect to see wide consumer adoption in months, not years. Remember the days when you needed to build across iOS, Android, Blackberry and a multitude of other platforms? Those days are over as bots quickly replace the standard mobile app. A huge factor in who will “win” in the bot and AI assistant space will be hardware. All these bot powered assistants need to live on a ‘surface’ somewhere so the battle for mobile, desktop, refrigerator, automobile, smart home, and other kinds of integration will be key.\nUsers are flocking to bots. Between the 800 million people who use iMessage and the three billion people who use Android devices, the marketplace is ripe for entry. The increasing announcements and launches in the AI assistant space are only accelerating a dramatic increase in bot adoption.\nThe unknown in the space is how will banks adapt to this AI world? Their services will look increasingly conversational across services like Google Home and Amazon Echo. They will have to intelligently integrate with Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana. As in days of yore with launching mobile applications, these new AI applications inevitably will have a learning curve. Those who enter the space early will have the advantage of learning and improving on the fly while slower moving organizations try to make sense of the inevitable trend.\nFor us, this means we’re riding the crest of an incredible wave in mobile banking. We know we need to help banks activate across all these new, and potentially scary, surfaces and to take the obstacles and mystery out of launching new, consumer friendly bot integrations.\nOur ongoing challenge, and passion, is to keep up with this breakneck speed.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Rahul Srinivas \nIt would not be wrong to term the year 2016 as the year of smartphone explosions. While Samsung took much of the attention of the press thanks to the Galaxy Note7 fiasco, there have been several instances of smartphones from other manufacturers too going up in flames – including Apple’s iPhones. In a recent case from India, a low end handset from Indian phone maker LYF also went up in flames and the issue went on to become a hot topic on Twitter and other social media platforms. Anyway, in the most recent case of a smartphone going up in flames, a brand new iPhone 7 Plus is said to have exploded in China. \nAccording to a report by GizmoChina , this latest instance of an exploding iPhone happened in the Chinese province of Yunnan. The phone involved in the incident happens to be the newest large screened iPhone model – the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. The report adds that the iPhone 7 Plus went up in flames after the owner accidentally dropped the device onto a hard floor. According to the report, the battery of the phone exploded and caught fire some time after the phone hit the ground. However, before the phone went up in flames, it started vibrating severely. This was followed by a small explosion and a subsequent fire. The explosion shattered the glass and the display was entirely detached from the phone. Needless to say, the phone is in an irreparable state. \nPhotos of the damaged iPhone was posted on several websites. In the images, you can see that how bad the condition of the device is. The owner of the iPhone 7 Plus revealed that the phone was just a month old and that it was not tampered with in anyway. A photo posted on GizmoChina shows the iPhone 7 Plus that caught fire [Image Via GizmoChina] The rear side of the iPhone 7 Plus that caught fire [Image Via GizmoChina] \nThis is of course not the first time that we have heard of Apple iPhones exploding. Very recently, an iPhone user had posted on Reddit about his co-worker receiving a brand new iPhone 7 which exploded and caught fire even before the phone was delivered to him. The phone had reportedly caught fire while it was in transit! In another report from Australia, a surfer was in for a shock after the iPhone he had kept inside his car caught fire. The man had reportedly kept the phone wrapped inside his pants that he had removed and kept in the car. When he returned, he saw that smoke was coming out of his vehicle. The iPhone involved in this incident too was a brand new device that was barely one week old. This Australian surfer too claimed that he never dropped his iPhone or used any other third party charger to charge the device. \nAs for the Samsung Galaxy Note7, following the multiple instances of the new flagship going up in flames, Samsung issued a product recall after which new devices were shipped to people who had bought the supposedly defective version of the phone. However, more trouble came Samsung’s way after it emerged that some of the replaced units too were catching fire. After these reports, several aviation agencies – including the FAA banned the usage of the Note7 on flights. As the number of incidents increased, there was a total ban on the Note7 onboard flights. A few days after these incidents, Samsung finally decided to pull the plug on the Note7. Samsung no longer makes the phone and is still trying to recall all the units it had sold to users across the world. Following the incident, the future of Samsung’s flagship Note series hangs in balance. It is still unclear if the Note7 would get a successor sometime next year considering the hit the brand has taken – thanks to bad press it received in 2016. \nAs for the latest incident, it remains unclear if Apple was contacted and informed about it. There has been no official response from the company so far. \n[Featured Image Via Pixabay]",

One A9 manufacturer built more efficient chips than the other, and thus the \" chip gate \" controversy ensued.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

Heres His New Pick The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus didn't suffer from bend gate, nor did they suffer from chip gate, since the A10 Fusion chip is sole-sourced this time around. However, a new controversy has arisen: modem gate.\nThis year, Apple decided to source modems from two vendors -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- and, unsurprisingly, a third-party report demonstrated that the Qualcomm modem is superior to the Intel modem.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "November 13 at 5:31 PM Even institutions as successful as the Chicago Cubs, Apple and the U.S. Army make mistakes, so I’m not surprised that principals in one of the most effective school districts in the country, Arlington County, are making a dubious policy move and not explaining it well to parents.\nArlington’s middle school principals are exploring changes that include a switch to block scheduling. That would mean replacing the traditional daily class periods with classes that meet every other day and could be twice as long.\nMany people, including me, think block scheduling is an attractive but unproductive fad. A 2006 University of Virginia study said students in high school block schedules did somewhat worse in college sciences than those who had regular schedules. A 2010 review of British research said block schedule results were slightly positive but “are not strong enough to recommend their implementation.”\n[ An experiment in second grade: No homework. Then, see if test scores drop. ]\nWhat Arlington does could affect what has been a sweeping trend in the Washington area. The every-other-day class system was hot in the 1990s. Since then, some schools have switched back to traditional scheduling, but the issue is rarely discussed. Parents in Arlington say they are having trouble getting answers to their questions, a consistent failing of all school districts, good and bad.\nArlington Schools Superintendent Patrick Murphy proposed block schedules for all middle schools in 2012. He said regular periods were too short for the kind of creative teaching early adolescents need.\n“We are doing a disservice to students to run them through a seven-period day with a 45-minute turnaround,” he said.\nThis time, however, he is not pushing the change. Arlington schools spokeswoman Linda Erdos said principals are taking the initiative. Murphy is allowing them “to explore options with their communities,” she said.\nOnly one Arlington middle school, Kenmore, has gone to a block schedule, and just for sixth-graders. “This type of schedule carries quite a few risks,” said Williamsburg Middle School parent Lauren LeMay. “We would like to know exactly what they’re trying to accomplish at Williamsburg and why they think block scheduling is the answer.”\nParents say they worry about damage to music and language instruction and a lack of supporting research.\nThose concerns seem basic compared with the complex characterization of the schedule changes offered by Tara Nattrass, assistant superintendent for instruction. The middle schools are looking for “more personalized learning opportunities for students,” she said. They have “been exploring strategies for this approach including personalizing teacher advisory time, revisiting master schedules and providing blocks of time for small group instruction.”\nThat’s pretty vague. I see why the parents are frustrated. They have not gotten a clear answer to one of their greatest concerns: What happens to classes that need much repetition, such as band and orchestra?\n“One of the most negative and lasting impacts of full block scheduling is the elimination of cross-grade groupings,” said Swanson Middle School band parent Cathy Celestino. That means schools might not be able to assign students of similar skill level from different grades to the same band class.\nIt could also make it difficult to arrange daily practice. A group of parents and community members called Arlington Parents for Effective Scheduling concluded that the research shows that “daily instruction is a critical component of effective teaching and learning in math and foreign language,” Celestino said.\nParents say Williamsburg Principal Gordon Laurie is privately presenting the switch to block scheduling as a given and is asking teachers what kind of block schedule would be best. Williamsburg parent Patty Donmoyer said that a meeting Laurie had with parents Nov. 9 did not shed much light. “They never asked us if block scheduling should happen,” Donmoyer said. “Now we’re being given only minimal input on how it will happen.”\nArlington’s long record of success suggests it might make this work even without much research. But all districts need to give parents and teachers more chances for discussion and understanding before making such moves.",

      "text": "Andy Orin Nov 14, 2016, 9:00am \niOS: Apple recently introduced a new Portrait Mode that adds a faux depth-of-field effect when you take a photo, but it only works on the iPhone 7 Plus. With Patch , you can get a similar effect on any iPhone. \nPatch utilises neural networks to analyse your photo and determine the subject matter. It's far from perfect, so this is more of a fun photo toy than a serious tool. But the developer anticipated that it won't always accurately find the outline of your intended subject, so you can adjust the mask yourself by manually highlighting or erasing the affected areas of the blur. It will work most effectively when you take a clear picture of someone from the waist up. The above examples were taken under ideal conditions and look great. \nBut here are some random examples that I did with just random images on my phone: \nIt struggled with the toddler in the center, but did pretty well with the image of me on the left. On the right, you can see the editing tool to adjust the mask. \nPatch is free, but it will add a small watermark to every photo. It costs $US1 ($1) without the watermark. \nPatch [iTunes App Store] ",

      "text": "0 Customers gather at a store selling Apple products during the launch of the new iPhone 7 sales at the State Department Store, GUM, in central Moscow, Russia September 23, 2016. Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin \nApple is going to make the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus literally bigger than their predecessors, this according to a new report making rounds online. It looks like the tech giant will go all out celebrating its 10th year anniversary of mobile phone domination in 2017. \nApple is planning to launch its future iPhone handsets on new 5-inch and 5.8-inch variants, as told by Barclays Research analysts Jerry Zhang, Blayne Curtis, Thomas O'Malley and Christopher Hemmelgarn via MacRumors . Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are said to feature curved and bezel-free new looks. The analysts said that they got their information from Apple’s supply chain while they were on an Asian tour. \nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models currently measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches respectively. While the report says that the development is not “100 percent locked down” yet, Apple is indeed heading that direction. The iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus are slated for bigger boosts. \nA number of recent reports suggest that Apple will equip the iPhone 8 Plus with OLED display, which will mark the Cupertino-based company’s first time to use such technology on its flagship smartphone. Compared to LCD screens, OLED displays not only are brighter and sharper, they’re also power savers. Moving forward, Apple will most likely seek the help of the biggest players of the OLED game: Samsung, Sharp and LG. \nThe details of Apple’s latest Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing have been leaked just recently and they virtually confirm the tech giant’s intentions regarding its future iPhones. Investment firm J.P. Morgan looked into the documents and saw purchase orders reaching more than a year in duration and amounting to US$4 billion (AU$5.2 billion). The deals are believed to be between Apple and Samsung. \nApple will ultimately have to remove the Home button of the future iPhone 8 to add more space for its display. This will be the only way the flagship phone can achieve an edge-to-edge display. Apple is expected to launch the new iPhone 8 in September next year.",

Two of them will reportedly include 4.7-inch and 5.0-inch liquid crystal displays, while a third so-called \"premium\" option will use a curved OLED display.\nImage source: Apple.\nInterestingly, in The New York Times ' review of this year's iPhone 7, the site said the next-generation iPhone will \"have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen,\" citing sources within Apple.\nI believe that to enable this form factor in the models incorporating liquid crystal displays, Apple may use a new technology that longtime iPhone display supplier Japan Display called a \"full active\" liquid crystal display, or LCD.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "0 SHARES \nThe moment that Apple released their new line of Macbook Pro laptops at their last event, our hearts all dropped – a completely new redesign came with the new line, ultimately creating massive controversy around the price and removal of significant ports that will now require dongle usage. \nHowever, regardless of the controversy, it turns out that the number orders that have come in for the new Pro is greater than any other Macbook Pro in Apple’s history, according to Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing. The product has outsold all of its Windows-based competitors already as well. \nSlice Intelligence created a graph to demonstrate where the sales stand as of Oct. 31, though the information was pulled from sales numbers – specifically by reviewing “hundreds of millions” of e-receipts – and not exact units sold, so there is a possibility that the numbers are more skewed towards Apple. The graph demonstrates that the sales of the Pro that came in the first five days surpassed sales for key competitor notebooks, including the Microsoft Surface Book and Lenovo Yoga 900. \nJust another step towards world domination, Apple. We see you.",

      "text": "Enlarge Image Photo by Andrew Hoyle/CNET Despite not being as recognisable as Apple and Samsung , Huawei once agains proves itself to be a big player in the mobile game.\nOn Friday, the Chinese company announced the P9 , a premium phone released in April, has sold over 9 million units worldwide .\nThose sales helped Huawei retain its position in Q3 2016 as the global No. 3 phone brand, according to IDC Research , behind only Samsung and Apple. However, the gap between it and the top two spots is considerable -- Apple sold 13 million iPhone 6S units in one weekend last September, and Samsung's Galaxy S7 range hit a whopping 26 million in sales after 3 months.\nThe phone, more expensive than many of the company's midrange offerings, was sold around its Leica-branded dual cameras , a feature Apple has adopted in the iPhone 7 Plus .\nHuawei's next big release will be the Mate 9 , a 5.9-inch phablet the company announced earlier this month. It'll have dual cameras, 4GB of RAM and Huawei's new Kirin 960 processor .",
