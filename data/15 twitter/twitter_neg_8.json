      "text": "Published November 28, 2016 SkyNews Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nA skating rink with thousands of dead fish frozen underneath the ice has been forced to close its doors after causing outrage among its customers.\nAbout 25 different kinds of fish were inserted into the new attraction at the Space World theme park in Kitakyushu, Japan, with some arranged into words and shapes to create what the owners called an \"ice aquarium\".\nFollowing the opening of the 820ft rink, people took to social media to complain with some calling it \"tasteless\", \"sinful\" and \"a desecration of life\".\nWANT TO MONITOR BEARS? TRY CHECKING THEIR SALIVA \nSpace World spokesman Koji Shibata said on Monday: \"We received critical voices saying it is not good to use creatures as a toy, and that it is bad to let food go to waste.\"\nMr. Shibata said the fish were all already dead at the time of purchase and were considered unfit to be sold in markets.\n\"Internally we'd had discussions over the morality of the idea\" before the display was set up, he said.\nWHY MICE ARE NATURE’S JET ENGINES \nToshimi Takeda, general manager of Space World, said the intention was for customers to have fun while also learning about fish - but conceded that the ice would have to be replaced.\n\"We wanted customers to experience the feeling of skating on the sea, but after receiving criticism, we decided that we could not operate it any more,\" he said.\nThis article originally appeared on SkyNews.com .",

The king's sainthood played a key role in the introduction of christianity to Norway at the end of the Viking age.\n“The recent unearthing of the foundations of a church in the centre of Trondheim by archaeologists working for the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) is one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in Norway in recent times,\" NIKU Excavation Director Anna Petersen told FoxNews.com, via email.\nTINY VIKING CRUCIFIX COULD REWRITE HISTORY \nHaraldsson died fighting rival nobles in the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 and his body was buried in Trondheim, or Nidaros as it was then known. Local people soon reported tales of miracles attributed to the dead king, according to NIKU, and in 1031 his coffin was dug up and opened in in the presence of a bishop, revealing his well-preserved body.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract The excavation site in Trondheim, Norway (NIKU). \nThe dead king was declared a saint and his remains were enshrined above the high altar of St. Clement’s Church, which became his first mausoleum. Olaf’s coffin rested in the church for a number of years before it was moved to a larger church. The remains were eventually enshrined in Trondheim’s Nidaros Cathedral.\nSt. Clement’s Church was demolished in the 13th century and its location remained a mystery until NIKU archaeologists unearthed the site in Trondheim, which was dated to the time of Olaf’s rule.\n“During its excavation, the archaeologists uncovered a small rectangular stone-built platform at the building’s east end,” said NIKU, in a press release. “This is probably the foundation for an altar – probably the very same altar on which St. Olaf’s coffin was placed in 1031!”\nTHE REAL REASON FOR VIKING RAIDS: SHORTAGE OF ELIGIBLE WOMEN? \nA small well was also discovered at the site, which may have been a “holy well” associated with the saint’s remains. Olaf himself built St. Clement's Church, probably shortly after 1015. \n\"Excavations will continue here into 2017,\" said Petersen. \"There are already indications that Olaf's church may not have been the first building constructed on the site.\"\nThe archaeologist explained that large post-holes found beneath the church may belong to an even earlier wooden church that may have been built by King Olaf I Tryggvason, another Viking king associated with the introduction of Christianity to Norway at the end of the 10th century. And below that that lie even earlier archaeological remains that may belong to a Viking-age kaupang , or trading settlement, from which the medieval city of Trondheim grew.\n\"This site has still not revealed all its secrets, and will continue to provide archaeologists and historians with much new information about events in Scandinavia during the transition from the Viking age to the medieval age,\" she said.  \nNEW VIKING SITE IN NORTH AMERICA? EXPERTS EYE SATELLITE DATA FOR POTENTIAL DISCOVERY \nOther stunning Viking era discoveries have been made in Scandinavia this year. In March, for example, a 10th century Viking crucifix was unearthed in Denmark, prompting experts to reconsider the dates when Christianity arrived in the country.\nEarlier this year archaeologists also used satellite imagery to identify a site in Newfoundland that could be the first new Viking site discovered in North America in over 50 years.",

      "text": "By Kris Millgate \nPublished November 28, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Necessity is the mother of invention, the saying goes. And in Cuba, this has proved true among a group of fishermen who have taken to inflating condoms to catch fish. It’s called balloon fishing, and the floating condoms carry the anglers’ bait up to 900 feet from shore to hook trophies.\nAs NBC Miami reports, Cubans have adopted the method as a result of limited resources and the high cost of purchasing a private boat. The fishermen simply can’t get their lines out far enough to catch big fish. “No one can cast line that far by hand,” said local fisherman Ivan Muno. “This is the most effective way to fish. I can be out here all night with the balloons out.”\nMany of the anglers who use the condoms are looking to feed their families. But many also opt to sell their catches , which can fetch a dollar a pound on an island with an average monthly income of about $25. Selling fish is illegal without a license, but the big money drives many to disregard the law.\nBalloon fishing is less risky compared with riding the high seas on an inner tube or on foam blocks, two other popular makeshift ways to catch fish off the Cuban coast. The latter is known as cork fishing, which the Coast Guard cracks down on, but balloon fishing is kosher.\n“It’s efficient and everyone uses it,” Alex Romero, Old Havana Federation of Fishermen, told NBC Miami. “It’s the ingenuity that Cubans always show in resolving problems without spending a lot of money.”",

Avoid area of College.” \nThere was no official word on whether a shooting had taken place, but a Columbus Fire official told Fox News that eight people were transported to the hospital, with one in critical condition. \nColumbus Police told The Columbus Dispatch newspaper and WTTE/WSYX-TV that at least one suspect was killed. Fox News was not able to yet independently confirm the report. \nThe school's newspaper, The Lantern, indicated in a tweet that someone was down. \n\"There's at least one body bag present in front of Koffolt Labs,\" read the tweet. \"OSU police still advising to take shelter. Situation not under control.\" \nA police officer on scene later told The Lantern thata possible shooter is believe to be inside the Lane Avenue Parking garage on campus. \nThe school paper also tweeted that there may be a second assailant.",

Protesters expressed their displeasure and hoped to reach out to students during their demonstration. \n“They took down my flag, they have a right to that, I’m here to defend their right to do that but I want them to understand how bad that hurts me,” veteran Jerry Maguire told WWLP-TV. \nThe station reported that hundreds all over the New England region joined the protest, including Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno.

(Reuters) \n\"Star Wars\" actor Mark Hamill weighed in on President-elect Donald Trump saying he's in \"total denial\" over the election results.\n\"I’m glad I have [my new show 'Pop Culture Quest'] to take my mind off what’s going on,” Hamill told the Daily Beast . \"Because if you look at what's being assembled for our government it’s like, yikes. It's a who’s-who of really despicable people.\"\n\nHamill did not mention any of Trump's appointments by name. Several Cabinet positions have been filled since he won the election earlier this month.\nHamill added that while it's \"tempting to say\" he'll leave the country under a President Trump, it's more challenging to \"stay and defend our country and do what you think is right.\"\nHe continued, \"And not to retreat and hide under the covers. It's not going to be easy, that's for sure.\"\nThe actor will reprise his role as Luke Skywalker in 2017's \"Star Wars Episode VIII.\"",

      "text": "Dominic Oduro takes Twitter shot at Toronto FC's MLS Cup advance sales November 28, 2016 11:39AM EST Follow@ SteveBrisendine \nDominic Oduro 's Twitter handle is @Freakyfast8 — for his pace on the pitch, of course. But the speedy Montreal winger also wasted little time in tweaking 401 Derby rivals Toronto FC ahead of Wednesday's second leg of the Eastern Conference Championship , after a report surfaced that tickets were already being sold for an MLS Cup final at BMO Field. \nOduro's tweet, sent out Sunday evening, came in response to a report by Fox Sports' Julie Stewart-Binks: You guys have a refund policy??? https://t.co/pF6aNc2MNp — Dominic Oduro (@Freakyfast8) November 28, 2016 \nMontreal can't host MLS Cup, if they qualify for the first time. The Seattle Sounders, who completed a 3-1 two-leg aggregate victory over Colorado on Sunday and also are first-time finalists, would host the title game on Dec.10 on the strength of a better regular-season record. \nStill, with the impact holding a 3-2 edge after the first leg in Montreal , Oduro's confidence is not without foundation. Montreal advances with a victory or a draw on Wednesday, and would advance on any one-goal loss but 1-0 or 2-1. A 3-2 defeat would square the round on aggregate and away goals, requiring extra time (and perhaps penalties) to settle the conference winner. Topics:",

      "text": "Trump Back To Business As Recount Distractions Loom Large   Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nFOX NEWS \nPresident-elect Donald Trump will be back in the saddle Monday in New York as he looks to decide who will fill the integral appointments in his Cabinet as concerns about a possible secretary of state choice rise and the distraction of a recount vote in Wisconsin, and possibly other key battleground states, set to press on. \nTrump has a series of meetings scheduled to try and narrow down the foundation of his Cabinet after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his Palm Beach, Fla., estate. As the talks are reportedly expected to intensify over the course of the week, concerns about the possible appointment of Mitt Romney as secretary of state were made known on Sunday. \nTop adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that she will support Trump's pick, but continues to argue that the grass-roots supporters who backed his improbable victory feel let down about Romney, considering he called Trump a “con man” and a “phony.” \n\"People feel betrayed to think that … Romney, who went out of his way to question the character and the intellect and the integrity of Donald Trump … would be given the most significant Cabinet post of all,” Conway said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.”",

      "text": "TOP 5347713 \nCritics are excoriating Twitter’s recent decision to validate the violent, anti-Semitic tweets of the Muslim Brotherhood on its website. The social media giant has granted verification to Ikhwan Web , the official online feed of the Israel-hating, terrorist-abetting Muslim Brotherhood. A man reads tweets on his phone in front of a displayed Twitter logo in Bordeaux, southwestern France, March 10, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Illustration/File Photo \nThe “blue badge” of verification essentially places the Twitter stamp of approval on an organization’s online feed. (RELATED: Twitter Suspends Its CEO At Same Time As Alt-Right Purge) \nThe Muslim Brotherhood is officially recognized by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization and has been banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia. It exists in cyberspace through an online presence that includes its English-language affiliate Ikhwan. \nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which documents anti-Semitism around the world, has condemned the Muslim Brotherhood for its virulent anti-Jewish language that has characterized the organization form the beginning. \nWith Twitter’s official sanction of the radical Muslim mouthpiece, some prominent U.S. legislators are accusing the company of indirect complicity in the Muslim Brotherhood’s active involvement in terrorist acts and global Jihad. \n‎”Verifying the Muslim Brotherhood’s Twitter feed helps further their narrative of civilization-Jihad,” Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, told the Washington Free Beacon . \nCruz has been a consistent and vocal critic of the Brotherhood and was instrumental in promulgating legislation that designated the group as a terrorist organization. (RELATED: Twitter Initiates Mass Purge Of Prominent Alt-Right Accounts Following Trump Victory) \nCritics of Twitter are wondering just how the highly-influential internet site decides what is acceptable and what is not. It has been accused of repressing conservative opinions, ejecting conservative users and quietly “shadow blocking” conservative critics. \nThe Muslim Brotherhood verification comes almost two weeks after Twitter banned users associated with the white nationalist alt-right movement. \n“This is corporate Stalinism,” Richard Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation . “Twitter is trying to airbrush the Alt Right out of existence. They’re clearly afraid. They will fail!”",

Kellyanne Conway reportedly sides with Rudy Giuliani as secretary of state and says choosing Mitt Romney instead may make people feel betrayed.

      "text": "Published November 28, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy DAMIAN PALETTA, The Wall Street Journal\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla.— President-elect Donald Trump, coming off a steady two-week flow of personnel announcements for his nascent administration, is confronting a series of more vexing decisions about how to shape the remainder of his cabinet.\nChief among them is whether to name as secretary of state Mitt Romney , who emerged as Mr. Trump’s early favorite for the post despite his criticism of the GOP nominee during the Republican presidential primaries. The campaign against the party’s 2012 presidential nominee escalated Sunday when Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, said on CNN that a “breathtaking” number of people would feel “betrayed” if Mr. Romney got the prominent cabinet post after he had opposed Mr. Trump so publicly.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, who has met and spoken privately with Mr. Trump about the State Department job at least twice, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\n \nThe internal tug of war over who will be named to the nation’s top diplomatic job has slowed what had been a relatively brisk pace of appointments since Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over the transition effort a week after Election Day. It also is obscuring the many key positions that remain unfilled.\nRELATED: \nReport: Trump is ‘furious’ with Conway over Romney 'betrayal' comments Mr. Trump has interviewed for—but not filled—the defense secretary post, saying he is seriously considering retired Gen. James Mattis . The Trump team has also signaled, but not closed the deal, on the appointment of Adm. Michael Rogers as the director of national intelligence, the nation’s top spy.\nRead the full story at the Wall Street Journal→",

Just days before, Pennsylvania had been written off by experts who assumed the state’s streak of voting Democratic would continue. But in addition to proving them wrong, Pennsylvanians also elected 13 Republicans to the House of Representatives (out of a state delegation of 18), reelected noted fiscal conservative Pat Toomey in the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history, and expanded Republican majorities in both chambers of the state legislature to the highest level either party has enjoyed in over 60 years.\nRead more at Weeklystandard.com→",

      "text": "Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott took to Twitter late Sunday night to announce his plan to ban sanctuary cities in his state while other governors and mayors across the country vow to continue protecting illegal immigrants from deportation.\nYes. I'm going to sign a law that bans sanctuary cities. Also I've already issued an order cutting funding to sanctuary cities. #txlege https://t.co/uYXa2QFrvE \n— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 28, 2016 \n\nThe governor’s push to outlaw sanctuary cities in the Lone Star State, as well as his executive order to cut funding to such municipalities, follows a comment from a Twitter user wondering what Abbott planned to do about Travis County’s newly elected Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, who has vowed not to cooperate with federal officials on immigration issues . Such a move would make Austin, which is located in Travis County, the state’s first true sanctuary city.\nOn the campaign trail, President-  pledge to crack down on illegal immigration was one of his foundational promises. In an interview earlier this month on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” the billionaire businessman said he plans to deport illegal immigrants with criminal records :\nWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million — it could be even 3 million — we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.\nAfter the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about, who are terrific people — they’re terrific people — but we are going to make a determination at that. But before we make that determination … it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.\nFollowing those comments, several Democratic mayors and governors have said they will ignore federal laws on immigration. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti both vowed to oppose Trump on deporting criminal illegal immigrants .\nAnd in a statement following the Nov. 8 election, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel promised to defy President-elect Trump, saying, “Chicago will always be a sanctuary city.”\nTrump, for his part, has stated that he intends to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print File photo. (REUTERS/SeongJoon Cho/Pool) \nYou may or may not have heard of a StingRay— it’s a controversial surveillance device that, by acting like a cell tower, can find your cell phone’s location and other info. Now photos of what's reportedly a related device called a Harpoon have surfaced and show it ostensibly in the posession of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \nPublished by Vice Motherboard, a photo shows a stack of devices with what looks like the word “Harpoon” on them; a second photo reveals a label from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) on the back of equipment. \nWhat’s a Harpoon? A document posted by Ars Technica describes it as a “high-power filtered amplifier” that boosts the performance of the StingRay devices as well as another system called the KingFish. \nA lawyer from The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who was shown the photos by Vice said that it was “consistent with what we know about how these devices are typically used,” according to Vice Motherboard, which acquired the photos and other documents via a leak. “They’re put inside a police vehicle and to anyone on the outside there would be no indication that the police are driving around with a powerful surveillance device.” \nDISTRICT JUDGE SAYS EVIDENCE IN 'STINGRAY' CASE CAN BE SUPPRESSED \nState or local police use StringRay-type tracking devices in 23 states across the country, from Washington and California to Pennsylvania and New York, according to a map published by the ACLU. \n\"FDLE does not discuss investigative tactics,\" Molly Best, a public information officer for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told FoxNews.com by email in response to an inquiry on the topic. \nThe company connected with the Harpoon device is called Harris . \"We are unable to comment for your story,\" Jim Burke, the director of global public relations at Harris Corporation, told FoxNews.com in an email. \nThis July, a United States district judge ruled to suppress evidence that authorities gathered after using a StringRay device— in that case, the Drug Enforcement Agency used a StingRay-type “cell-site simulator” to find a suspect’s New York City apartment. \nLater, the DEA entered the apartment and found drug paraphernalia, but the judge deemed that that was an “unreasonable search” because of the use of the StingRay. \nFollow Rob Verger on Twitter: @robverger Advertisement",

The college freshmen who were 18 years old in 1987 are now 47 years old — meaning that relatively few people under the age of 60 received a solid grounding in the humanities of the type Professor Bloom thought were essential.\nRead the full story at LifeZette→",

      "text": "Knicks beat reporter Al Iannazzone took questions from Twitter followers this week as the team prepares for a few inter-conference matchups. Here are 10 answers:\n@RyanMNorman: What has been your assessment of this team so far? Underachieving or overachieving? Latest Knicks stories Knicks get set to host scorching Westbrook Noah hopes to begin making an impact Knicks lose to Hornets after bad 1st quarter Iannazzone: Knicks’ personality transition game Noah back in starting lineup after illness\nIannazzone: I would say they are right about where I expected them from a record standpoint. It takes a while for three new starters and six or seven new rotation guys overall to mesh, even more so with Derrick Rose missing 2 ½ weeks of preseason and practices for his civil trial. But a couple of things that are concerning is their defense most nights and their lack of effort and energy on the road. You can’t fall behind by 20 regularly and expect to win.\n@TheRealDominicC: Since the Knicks continue to leave Noah on the bench during the end of games, would they explore trading him?\nIannazzone: Noah makes $72 million over four years and he hasn’t played well even when healthy. I can’t see any team wanting that contract. That said, it’s a long season and Noah is a proud and proven player, “a winner,” according to Derrick Rose. The Knicks signed Noah for his intensity, leadership, defense, selflessness and passing. It’s a long season. I think he will be able to help the Knicks at some point.\n@russell_javier: Do the #Knicks plan on having Noah come off the bench since they always have “slow start” in games? #Frustrated\nIannazzone: There were a number of Noah-related questions, many about him coming off the bench. I don’t see it at this point, but never say never. He came off the bench for the Bulls last year, but they had more veterans up front. The Knicks aren’t ready to make the move to start Willy Hernangomez. Noah doesn’t move as well as he used to, but he still is a strong rebounder and can play physically and be an enforcer when he’s on the floor with Kristaps Porzingis. Few teams play conventional lineups for the bulk of games anymore, so Noah probably isn’t a 30-minute player now. Unless he starts making an impact he may continue to be a spectator at the end of games. But it’s a long season. His time may come.\n@sblez: When do we trade melo and allow this to be Porzingis’ team? Why aren’t we tanking?\nIannazzone: Tanking makes no sense for this team. Phil Jackson wants to preside over a playoff team. He brought in mostly playoff-tested veterans to help Anthony and Porzingis get there this season. The Knicks believe they can be dangerous at full strength. It’s also good for Porzingis to be playing meaningful games late in the season and possibly postseason games. As for your first question, it will be Porzingis’ team soon enough. Anthony has a no-trade clause so he’s not going anywhere unless if maybe a title contender wants him. But he wants to stay here, and he’s become a more complete player as he’s gotten older. Also it’s overlooked too often that Anthony is helping Porzingis. All the attention Anthony draws opens things up for Porzingis.\n@SuasoProd: Can Porzingis statistically reach Patrick Ewing numbers?\nIannazzone: Porzingis is off to a good start to his career, better than anyone expected (besides himself). He wants to be an All-Star and has a chance this season. But it’s hard to say whether he will reach Ewing’s numbers. He was a Hall of Famer, an all-time great who played his heart out every single night and put the Knicks on his back. Porzingis is much more versatile but not the defender or rebounder Ewing was – yet. Porzingis also has to show he can carry a team consistently. But Porzingis looks like this generation’s Ewing for Knicks fans: a franchise player, a centerpiece to build around and count on for years.\n@DiamondNealauto: I know that KP is growing day by day, but wouldn’t a sky hook that no center utilizes cement his young game? Knicks videos\nIannazzone: He wants a signature move and shot, and may try to pick one up from Dirk Nowitzki if they work out together in the summer as planned. I’m not sure the sky hook is the answer. Only one person mastered it. Porzingis is still learning how to play in the post and use his size against guards or even some big forwards. He has the advantage on most occasions. But he still has work to do, and Porzingis is willing to put in the work. He wants to be great.\n@ToddNeikirk: What % chance is there that Jennings ends up playing more than Rose at some point\nIannazzone: I don’t see it unless Rose gets hurt. Rose will continue to start and finish games. He’s constantly applying pressure on the defense, is tremendous in pick-and-rolls and few attack the basket the way Rose does. He’s a former MVP and one of the most competitive players in the league. Jennings is a much better passer than I thought. He has tremendous vision and sets up his teammates well. He also ignites the second unit with his energy. That’s a good role for him. Sometimes he gets a little too excited and can make questionable decisions. You can see Jeff Hornacek get a little frustrated with some of them from time to time. But Rose and Jennings are effective, apart or together. When was the last time you could say that about two Knicks point guards?\n@Dattfranco: Can you see Lance Thomas and O’Quinn as trade bait?\nIannazzone: The Knicks tried to move O’Quinn over the summer. Although he’s given them some good minutes they could explore it again, especially as Willy Hernangomez continues to improve. It says a lot that Hornacek trusts Hernangomez at the end of games. But O’Quinn has been serviceable this season. The Knicks were counting on Thomas to be one of their “glue guys” off the bench. He’s a selfless player and good defender, but he has been banged up since the second game of the season. I believe they’re still banking on him being a reliable player off the bench when he comes back from injury.\n@SDeecken: Thoughts on Kuz play so far? I think he can be a consistent scorer off the bench for us once he gets more mins\nIannazzone: Mindaugas Kuzminskas has looked pretty good. He hit a huge shot in the win over Portland last week. With him, the belief was he’d be able to contribute once he got used to the league. Kuzminskas is 27 and has played a lot of basketball in Europe. He plays with a lot of energy, is fearless and has a nice shot. He looks like a good pick up.\n@4to700: We see many stars around NBA rest. Knicks play 8 games next two weeks, expect Melo/Rose to rest?\nIannazzone: They both say they want to play every game so that remains to be seen. But the Knicks’ schedule isn’t that bad. They have only two sets of back-to-backs for the remainder of this calendar year. Most of their games are every other day or following a couple days of off. They have time to rest.

      "text": "Published November 29, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich slammed efforts by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Green Party candidate Jill Stein to force a recount of votes in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, with another request expected to be filed in Michigan this week. \n\"The recount mania is one more example of the collapse of the Democratic Party as a realistic institution,\" Gingrich told Fox News' Sean Hannity on \"Hannity\" Monday. \"You’re seeing the sort of nutty wing of the Democratic Party begin to take over.\"\n\"If there was a realistic chance that they could turn three states, and therefore turn the election, you could say 'All right, I get it,'\" Gingrich added. \"But there’s not. I mean, nobody believes they’re going to turn Pennsylvania, period. If you don’t turn Pennsylvania, nothing matters ... The odds against them ... are probably a trillion to one.\"\nGingrich also told \"Hannity\" that President-elect Donald Trump could alienate many of his supporters by nominating longtime nemesis Mitt Romney.\n\"[Trump] simply needs to understand ... that there is an enormous base that wanted to drain the swamp and they see Romney as the swamp,\" Gingrich said. \"He has to decide if he’s willing to accept a very large part of his base being totally upset and feeling betrayed ... I can’t quite imagine the introductory speech where president-elect Trump explains why Mitt Romney makes any sense as secretary of state.\"\nFor his part, the former Speaker endorsed former New York City Mayor and longtime Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani to be secretary of state, telling Hannity that \"anybody who’s watched him knowsyou wouldn’t get anybody tougher, both in reforming the State Department and in speaking to the world on behalf of America ... I think he would do a terrific job.\"",

      "text": "  Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Sep 15, 2016; Kansas City, MO, USA; Kansas City Royals pitcher Edinson Volquez (36) delivers a pitch against the Oakland Athletics during the second inning at Kauffman Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY Sports \nMIAMI -- The Marlins have begun the painful task of revamping their rotation following the death of ace Jose Fernandez, reaching a deal with free agent Edinson Volquez.\nThe veteran right-hander agreed to a two-year, $22 million contract, a person familiar with the situation said Monday. The person confirmed the deal to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it won't be final until Volquez successfully completes a physical.\nAn All-Star in 2008 when he won 17 games with Cincinnati, Volquez helped pitch Kansas City to the World Series title in 2015 as he went 13-9 with a 3.55 ERA. He slipped to 10-11 with a 5.37 ERA with the Royals in 2016.\nMore from FoxSports Hot Air: Why they call the newest D-backs pitcher 'Skywalker' Royals spine-tingling moment No. 5: KC refuses to give in to Tigers What will Braves rotation look like, and will it be better in 2017? Vin Scully receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom Fernandez died in a boating accident a week before the end of the regular season in September. He went 16-8 with a 2.86 ERA this year.\nMiami's rotation is also expected to include Tom Koehler, Adam Conley and Wei-Yin Chen, who combined to go 22-24 in 2016.\nVolquez has an 89-79 record in 12 major league seasons. He's 33 but has pitched at least 170 innings every year since 2012, and still had a 93-mph fastball this year.\nVolquez became a free agent this month when he declined his mutual option with the Royals.",

Wood plays one of the artificial beings.\n\"Evan Rachel Wood: How wild past, personal demons prepped her for 'Westworld,' \" the headline read.\nUSA TODAY\nHBO's 'Westworld' blurs line between humans, A.I. beings\nShe told the magazine reporter that she had suffered “physical, psychological (and) sexual” abuse in the past but didn't elaborate. On Nov. 9, she wrote the reporter a letter expanding on that revelation, which was partially Quote: d in the interview.\nOn Monday, she posted the entire letter on Twitter.\nToward the end, she gets to the point: \"Yes. I have been raped,\" she wrote. \"By a significant other while we were together. And on a separate occasion, by the owner of a bar.”\nShe said she didn't want to talk about these episodes before because she didn't want to make it a \"sob story\" about herself. She questioned whether one encounter was actually rape. She didn't want to be blamed. And who would believe her anyway, she thought.\nEvan Rachel Wood and Ed Harris star in HBO's 'Westworld.' (Photo: John P. Johnson, HBO)\nNow she's over all that. \"I will not be ashamed ... I don't believe we live in a time where people can stay silent any longer,\" she wrote. \"I certainly can't. Not given the world we live in with its blatant bigotry and sexism.\"\nIt was all years ago, she wrote, and now she knows neither encounter was her fault, neither was OK. She tried to commit suicide years later and she's sure the encounters were factors.\n\"There you have it,\" she concluded.\nUSA TODAY\nEvan Rachel Wood tweets about depression over her bisexuality and 'bi-shame'\nWood has been open about her sexuality: She came out publicly as bisexual in 2011 and has called herself \"gender-fluid.\" She was married to actor Jamie Bell and has a son with him, born in 2013.\nIn her interview, she attributes her vulnerability to her sexuality.\n\"You know, bisexuality is worthy of eye rolls,\" she said. \"And I didn't realize how damaging that was until I tried to have healthy relationships as an adult and realized that there was still all this shame and conditioning and stigma around my sexuality that was really affecting the way I related to people. I think I was taken advantage of because someone knew there was something about me that they could exploit.\"\n8358 CONNECT TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 23 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gcNwVt",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nWhen President-Elect Trump tweeted out on Twitter about the possibility of illegal immigrants tilting the popular vote, the mainstream media outlets went into overdrive. Others claimed he had no facts to back up his assertions. The Washington Post even stated that his assertions were just a result huge ego and no substance.\nCertainly, most would say that President-Elect Trump has a huge ego. Most in his position do have big egos. However, the threat of illegal immigrants and other ineligible people voting in our elections has nothing to do with the ego of our President-Elect. I would guess, it is the bruised egos of the mainstream media that should actually be in question here.\nTo call President-Elect Trump a liar is especially laughable when this allegation comes from the same media, which has been caught in so many lies and distortions of the truth through this election cycle. In addition, the idea that President-Elect Trump has to give out facts to support his claim of illegal votes is a representation of the biased media double standard. The media is completely ignoring the fact that there is no evidence of hacking, but Jill Stein continues to demand recounts. Voter fraud is a serious matter. The Tea Party has been fighting against voter fraud. The Tea Party is against any idea of illegal immigrants participating in our election process. The idea illegal activity being used to sway the election is much easier than hacking an entire system and not as far-fetched as people might think, especially in the State of California.\nCalifornia has different laws and programs in place that could lead to widespread voter fraud. The most concerning set of laws deals with California’s AB-60. The AB-60 allows illegal immigrants to obtain a driver’s license. This driver’s license requires little documentation to obtain. If the person is unable to provide the documentation, they can appeal with an application of a waiver. Under California law, no one may question the legal status of the immigrant who presents this license. While a license alone is not enough to register to vote online in California, their paper voter’s registration card is quite different.\nAccording to the eight page instruction booklet, put out by the City and County of San Francisco, in order to register to vote using the voter’ s registration card, a voter needs only a driver’s license number (or identification number) or a Social Security number, not both. In fact, there are provisions for people who have neither a driver’s license (state identification) nor a Social Security number. The Registrar of Voters will just issue you a number, as evidenced in the image on the right.\nAnother law that deserves some scrutiny is their “Voter Registration Confidentiality” law. The primary intent of this law is to protect the identity of victims of violent crime. However, this law is inundated with potential problems. A person who claims to be a victim can contact a Safe-at-Home program provider. The provider aids the alleged victim in registering to vote. They will also give resources for name changes and Social Security number changes. What are the requirements for such a program? An alleged victim only has to prove that they live somewhere in California. The alleged victim also has to sign an affidavit he or she is a victim. They do not even require a police report! I smell voter fraud here.\nAs we can see, giving illegal immigrants a driver’s license, having no true identification requirement for voter’s registration, and having a voter’s registration confidentiality law, is an open invitation to voter fraud. It is also concrete evidence that President-Elect Trump is not just speaking out of ego. California’s laws need some thorough examination, as they allow for penetration and abuse by illegal immigrants.\nrnss Thumbs up 0 Love 0 Joy 0 Surprised 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Whatsapp The post President-Elect Trump Exposes Another Liberal Lie: The Truth Has Nothing To Do With Ego appeared first on Tea Party Tribune .",

      "title": "4 Tips on How to Use Twitter Polls in Your Marketing (from Twitter)",
      "text": "Just over a year ago, Twitter introduced polls , a new way to generate engagement and response from your Twitter audience.\nComing soon! We're rolling out the ability for everyone to create polls on Twitter: https://t.co/pH5a8q9Ujz pic.twitter.com/ijAKEMUdf1\n— Twitter (@twitter) October 21, 2015 And while polls have never really been a massive hit, they are used regularly, and can be a great feedback tool.\nHave you ever considered Twitter polls within your social media marketing strategy?\nWhether you have or haven’t, Twitter recently outlined four ways in which brands can use polls - and they might just get you thinking about the potential benefits of querying your Twitter audience.\n1. “Tap into trending topics” As per Twitter :\n“Everything happens on Twitter, from breaking global news to local events. Use a poll to be part of the conversation in an engaging way. Include event hashtags to widen your reach and connect with people chatting about a specific moment.”\nWhich hairstyle do you think we'll see the most of at tonight's #Emmys ? #Emmys2016\n— Drybar (@theDrybar) September 18, 2016 In this example, Drybar is looking to tap into the trending Emmys conversation with a themed poll – which is pretty much the same as newsjacking a hashtag, but adds a more creative, unique element to it.\nOther brands have used the same process to tap into trending hashtags and conversations.\nIt Mondays were shoes, they would be Crocs.\nWhat helps you get through Monday? #mondaymotivation\n— frank body (@frank_bod) October 3, 2016 Using the #MondayMotivation tag, frank body seeks input from their audience, which can help boost engagement and interest, and make their tweets stand out from the rest.\n2. “Ask for feedback that helps your business strategy” Twitter polls can also be a quick and easy way to get insight from your audience about strategic direction or potential changes - but interestingly, the examples provided by Twitter in this instance also underline one of the reasons brands avoid polls.\nWelcome new followers! What type of content are you most interested in? #TwitterPolls #TwitterPoll\n— Bixal (@bixal) February 11, 2016 In this example, Bixal has called on their followers to let them know what content they want to see. The problem here is that only 10 people, in total, have responded, which is likely not an indicative enough audience to draw and conclusions – while it also underlines, potentially, how unengaged your current audience is (for reference, Bixal has more than 4,400 followers )\nAs noted, this is likely one of the main reasons brands avoid polls, for fear of the results showing that no one’s listening to them – it’s hard to position your business as an influential voice in the industry if only a small percentage of your audience takes the time to respond when asked.\nBut then again, it is what it is – you can’t get any feedback at all if you don’t ask, and if you want to actually become a more influential presence in your inducts, you need to start incorporating feedback and response. Polls can help you do that.\nMaybe you won’t get a heap of response initially, but the more engaged your audience becomes, the more valuable a tool polls will be.\n3. “Discover product preferences” Another way polls can be used is to seek feedback on specific products. This gives your audience a chance to voice their preference, while also providing you with data on what Twitter users are most interested in.\nI'll take my Alfred cold brew:\n— Alfred Coffee (@alfredcoffee) October 3, 2016 4. “Ask lifestyle questions that tie back to your business” And Twitter’s last key tip on utilizing polls in your social media marketing efforts is to ask day-to-day questions which can be tied back to what your brand does.\nWhat is the one item you are always misplacing around the house?\n— The TrackR (@TheTrackR) October 13, 2016 This is essentially about knowing your audience and understanding the value that your product/service provides. If you can pose an interesting question that gets people thinking, that can help highlight the value your business provides, which can be a great way to get people thinking and considering your brand.\nOverall, it’s hard to say how much or how little value Twitter polls can or will provide. Engaging with your audience is a great way to establish better connection - which is particularly important in the age of algorithms - but at the same time, you might post and get few responses, which can feel somewhat embarrassing. But you need to start somewhere - getting a few responses and starting a conversation is just that, a start, and those initial notes can lead to building a more engaged community over time.\nJust like Twitter itself, polls won’t be for everyone, but they can be a good way to add something new and different into your social media marketing mix.",

      "text": "Donald Trump lashed out Monday night over a CNN report refuting his assertions about mass voter fraud on Election Day, firing off a series of tweets and retweets aimed at the network and one of its reporters.\nA report by CNN’s Jeff Zeleny dismissed Trump’s assertion that he won the popular vote if people who voted illegally are deducted as “blatant and baseless” and called Trump a “sore winner.” Politico has more on the CNN report and Trump’s tweets and retweets. Here are a few, and Zeleny’s reply.\n\" @HighonHillcrest : @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN \"\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016 \" @JoeBowman12 : @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !\" @CNN still doesn't get it. They will never learn!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016 . @CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016 @realDonaldTrump Good evening! Have been looking for examples of voter fraud. Please send our way. Full-time journalist here still working.\n— Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) November 29, 2016 Democrats brace for secret ballot: House Democrats return to Washington Tuesday, a day before party leadership elections. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California is facing a challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio for the minority leader position, and Pelosi is expected to keep her post. But as the Hill writes, few envisioned the battle just weeks ago, when Democrats headed into the elections with hopes that Trump would be a curse on vulnerable Republicans. Democrats will decide their new leader in a secret ballot vote .\nPrice picked to head HHS: Trump has picked Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, to be his Health and Human Services secretary, The Wall Street Journal reports. Price is a leading critic of President Barack Obama’s health-care law , and told the Journal last summer: “We think it’s important that Washington not be in charge of health care.” He said the problem he has with the law is “its premise is that Washington knows best.”\nAlso read: Entrepreneurs and small business on why they hate — and love — Obamacare .\nPrice’s blueprint: Vox writes Price is the secretary “you’d pick if you were dead serious about dismantling” Obamacare. The congressman will arrive at the department with a clear blueprint for what comes next, Vox reports . He is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, a thorough and detailed proposal to repeal and replace the law.\nCorker, Romney meetings set for Tuesday: Trump is continuing to interview candidates to be his top diplomat, and USA Today reports Sen. Bob Corker has a meeting scheduled Tuesday with the president-elect . The Tennessee Republican, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are all in the mix to head the State Department. Trump and Romney will meet Tuesday as well.\nMore from MarketWatch What the world’s top investors read every morning OPEC oil meeting: 7 things you need to know Google’s Pixel business will be bigger than Fitbit and GoPro combined Related Topics U.S. Economy U.S. Politics Washington, D.C.",

      "text": "Aaron Rodgers disappeared into a mystery tent and Twitter went crazy with it Published 24/7 \nAaron Rodgers got the Green Bay Packers back to winning ways last night in a decisive Monday Night Football victory over the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field.The Packers quarterback put on a show, including one inch-perfect touchdown pass to Davante Adams, as the Packers ran out 27-13 winners to move to 3rd place in the NFC North with a 5-6 record. \nHowever, the big story of the night wasn't Green Bay's solid play on offense or their ability to shut down Carson Wentz for most of the night. Instead, everyone was talking about just what Rodgers was doing in a mysterious tent. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nThis kind of volatility in a name like Twitter presented a great opportunity to get into the name via options. \nIf we take a look at the one-year chart we see the stock topped out at $25 twice and has been trading near the lows the entire time. \nThe upside now is perhaps limited because there are no significant events taking place in that timeframe and the likelihood of having a bidder come in is off the table. \nWhen all the hoopla surrounding a buyout of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) was taking place in late September/early October I figured it would be a great opportunity to scoop up shares if the takeover talks were just talk and there was a significant price declined that followed. My hopes came to fruition in early October and investors saw a decline from a high of $24.87 to a low of $16.88 as seen from the chart below. \nClick to enlarge \nInvestors know there were lots of potential suitors for Twitter. Names like Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and even Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) were thrown around, but eventually none of the big companies wanted a piece of the social media company that has been languishing of late. Obviously these large companies are always looking at strategic opportunities to create shareholder value but once Twitter was removed as a viable option for any of these companies a drop in the stock price ensued. \nThis kind of volatility in a name like Twitter presented a great opportunity to get into the name via options as opposed to buying the stock outright. So what I wanted to do when the stock was trading around $17.50 was write a put where I really wanted to own the stock if it ever got there and then use the proceeds from the put to buy a call. So what I ended up doing was writing the $16 December put, collecting $1.09 in the process while purchasing the December $20 call for $0.91. If the stock expires between $16 and $20 I stand to make $0.18. If the stock goes below $16 I would be forced to purchase the shares at $16 and have potentially significant losses, and finally if the stock appreciates above $20 I could have potentially significant gains. I felt I could put on this trade with very minimal risk that it would see $16 again. \nIf we take a look at the one-year chart we see the stock topped out at $25 twice and has been trading near the lows for almost the entire time. There is a strong level of support around the $14 range as it traded near those levels the entire summer of 2016. I could have written the put at the $14 strike but I felt that the stop out at $16 was the lowest it could go in the short term. \nSince that time the company did not receive a buyout offer, but reported a great quarter , and that is why we have a current stock price of $18.30. I think it is safe to say that the stock is more likely to move toward the $20 level than it is the $16 level at this point. Think about it, without any significant events on the calendar for the next three or so weeks, the stock has to drop another 12.5% for it to be put to anyone that wrote the $16 put. \nThe upside now is perhaps limited because there are no significant events taking place in that timeframe and the likelihood of having a bidder come in is off the table. At best the stock will meander where it currently is or move slightly higher with the rest of the market.

      "text": "Published November 29, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nPublished November 29, 2016  | FoxNews.com \nThe man who plowed a car into a crowd at Ohio State University before stabbing several pedestrians with a butcher knife on Monday is said to have referred to American-born Al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki as a “hero” on his social media accounts.\nLaw enforcement sources told Fox News on Tuesday that the reference of al-Awlaki on Abdul Razak Ali Artan’s social media accounts is “deeply concerning” because it could suggest he was self-radicalized before launching the attack.\nWhile a motive has not been confirmed, authorities are looking into whether the car-and-knife attack by the Somali-born student was an anti-U.S. terrorist attack.\nThe FBI is now in possession of Artan’s electronic devices and will focus their investigation on whether he was reading the two recent ISIS propaganda journals that called for attacks using vehicles and knives, a law enforcement source added.\nIn recent months, federal law enforcement officials have raised concerns about online extremist propaganda that encourages knife and car attacks, which are easier to pull off than bombings.\nThe Islamic State group has urged sympathizers online to carry out lone-wolf attacks in their home countries with whatever weapons are available to them.\nThis follows reports that Artan, who was shot and killed during the attack, shared a Facebook post that appeared to condemn U.S. military action in Muslim countries.\nAl-Awlaki, who was a senior Al Qaeda leader, was killed more than five years ago during a CIA-led U.S. drone strike. Before his death, al-Awlaki was involved in several terror plots in the United States, using his fluent English skills to draw recruits to carry out attacks.\nFIVE YEARS AFTER THIS DEATH, ANWAR AL-AWLAKI'S TOXIC MESSAGE IS ALIVE AND WELL According to law enforcement sources, Artan was born in Somalia and was a legal U.S. permanent resident.\nSources told Fox News that Artan attended Columbus State Community College and graduated with an associate’s degree earlier this year. Allen Kraus, the school’s vice president of marketing and communications, said the former student had no record of behavioral or disciplinary issues during his time at CSCC.\nOhio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, ran an interview in August with a student named Abdul Razak Artan, who identified himself as a Muslim and a third-year logistics management student who had just transferred from Columbus State in the fall.\nHe said he was looking for a place to pray openly and worried about how he would be received.\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "Twitter 1 0 \nManaging passbook files or pkpass files on your Windows 10 device is sometimes a hard thing to do, and managing them across Windows 10 devices is often harder. Now, a developer has made is much easier with a Windows 10 app called Wallet Pass. \nWallet Pass is a Windows 10 app available for $0.99 on the Windows Store, and its main goal is to help manage passbook files or pkpass files. You can store and sort these files, and help manage your mobile life as well. Wallet Pass Features \nWith Wallet Pass you can import .pkpass files from the browser or within your emails. You can then in turn show the passbooks to use them, and the locations are shown in the included passbooks with the Nokia Here Maps app. \nThis app lets you save the passbooks to your wallet automatically, and you can manage every passbook inside the app. This helps with those who actively use passbooks for a variety of uses, and should help those who use Windows 10 desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Wallet Pass Made For Windows 10 \nTo show how the Wallet Pass is made for Windows 10, it lets you pin live tiles to the smart screen for evrey passbook. You can then save those calendar events from passbooks data, and get notifications in the action center. What a deal. \nYou also get automatic updates of the new app once you buy it, and you can backup your passbooks too. If you run it across multiple devices, the app lets you synchronize between devices, and includes a barcode scan and PIN-lock for mobile devices. \nIf you use Passbook files, Wallet Pass is a life changer. It’s less than $1 to try out, and could save you endless minutes over the long run. \nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/wallet-pass/9wzdncrdnncq?tduid=(bb48e60e6044dfe264ef3c458110b4c0)(213688)(2795219)()()",

      "title": "4 Tips on How to Use Twitter Polls in Your Marketing (from Twitter)",
      "text": "November 29, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nJust over a year ago, Twitter introduced polls , a new way to generate engagement and response from your Twitter audience. Coming soon! We're rolling out the ability for everyone to create polls on Twitter: https://t.co/pH5a8q9Ujz pic.twitter.com/ijAKEMUdf1 \nAnd while polls have never really been a massive hit, they are used regularly, and can be a great feedback tool. \nHave you ever considered Twitter polls within your social media marketing strategy? \nWhether you have or haven’t, Twitter recently outlined four ways in which brands can use polls - and they might just get you thinking about the potential benefits of querying your Twitter audience. 1. “Tap into trending topics” \nAs per Twitter : \n“Everything happens on Twitter, from breaking global news to local events. Use a poll to be part of the conversation in an engaging way. Include event hashtags to widen your reach and connect with people chatting about a specific moment.” Which hairstyle do you think we'll see the most of at tonight's #Emmys ? #Emmys2016 \nIn this example, Drybar is looking to tap into the trending Emmys conversation with a themed poll – which is pretty much the same as newsjacking a hashtag, but adds a more creative, unique element to it. \nOther brands have used the same process to tap into trending hashtags and conversations. It Mondays were shoes, they would be Crocs. What helps you get through Monday? #mondaymotivation — frank body (@frank_bod) October 3, 2016 \nUsing the #MondayMotivation tag, frank body seeks input from their audience, which can help boost engagement and interest, and make their tweets stand out from the rest. 2. “Ask for feedback that helps your business strategy” \nTwitter polls can also be a quick and easy way to get insight from your audience about strategic direction or potential changes - but interestingly, the examples provided by Twitter in this instance also underline one of the reasons brands avoid polls. Welcome new followers! What type of content are you most interested in? #TwitterPolls #TwitterPoll — Bixal (@bixal) February 11, 2016 \nIn this example, Bixal has called on their followers to let them know what content they want to see. The problem here is that only 10 people, in total, have responded, which is likely not an indicative enough audience to draw and conclusions – while it also underlines, potentially, how unengaged your current audience is (for reference, Bixal has more than 4,400 followers ) \nAs noted, this is likely one of the main reasons brands avoid polls, for fear of the results showing that no one’s listening to them – it’s hard to position your business as an influential voice in the industry if only a small percentage of your audience takes the time to respond when asked. \nBut then again, it is what it is – you can’t get any feedback at all if you don’t ask, and if you want to actually become a more influential presence in your inducts, you need to start incorporating feedback and response. Polls can help you do that. \nMaybe you won’t get a heap of response initially, but the more engaged your audience becomes, the more valuable a tool polls will be. 3. “Discover product preferences” \nAnother way polls can be used is to seek feedback on specific products. This gives your audience a chance to voice their preference, while also providing you with data on what Twitter users are most interested in. I'll take my Alfred cold brew: — Alfred Coffee (@alfredcoffee) October 3, 2016 4. “Ask lifestyle questions that tie back to your business” \nAnd Twitter’s last key tip on utilizing polls in your social media marketing efforts is to ask day-to-day questions which can be tied back to what your brand does. What is the one item you are always misplacing around the house? — The TrackR (@TheTrackR) October 13, 2016 \nThis is essentially about knowing your audience and understanding the value that your product/service provides. If you can pose an interesting question that gets people thinking, that can help highlight the value your business provides, which can be a great way to get people thinking and considering your brand. \nOverall, it’s hard to say how much or how little value Twitter polls can or will provide. Engaging with your audience is a great way to establish better connection - which is particularly important in the age of algorithms - but at the same time, you might post and get few responses, which can feel somewhat embarrassing. But you need to start somewhere - getting a few responses and starting a conversation is just that, a start, and those initial notes can lead to building a more engaged community over time. \nJust like Twitter itself, polls won’t be for everyone, but they can be a good way to add something new and different into your social media marketing mix.

      "text": "Lee Thomas-Mason for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 29 Nov 2016 7:58 am Eric Bristow, five-time world darts champion, now works for Sky Sports. (Picture: Getty) \nEric Bristow, the former world No.1 darts player, has come under fire for controversial comments sent from his official Twitter account in which he suggests that the victims in the recent football sex abuse scandal are ‘not proper men’. \nPolice forces are investigating claims made by over 20 former footballers who came forward to report allegations of sexual abuse in the sport. \nIn a series of bizarre tweets, 59-year-old Bristow claims that the victims should have gone back to ‘sort out’ the alleged abusers when they were older, said that footballers are ‘wimps’ and described the alleged abuser as a ‘poof’ before attempting to change his stance. \n‘Might be a looney but if some football coach was touching me when I was a kid as I got older I would have went back and sorted that poof out,’ Bristow began his rant. \nAfter claiming that footballers are ‘wimps’, Bristow, who was made MBE in 1989, carried on his tirade of tweets by suggesting the victims aren’t ‘proper men’ for not seeking revenge in their adulthood. \nThe 59-year-old for darts champions, who works for Sky Sports as a commentator, also believes victims shouldn’t be able to ‘look at themselves in the mirror’ for not ‘sorting out’ their abusers when they grew ‘older and fitter’. \nSky Sports have confirmed they have sacked Bristow as a pundit and commentator for their darts coverage, a spokesperson said: ‘He was a contributor to our darts coverage in the past but we will not be using him in the future.’ \nOf the 20 victims to contact the police, former England international Paul Stewart followed the lead of ex-Crewe footballers Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, as well as ex-Manchester City forward David White, by telling their stories of the harrowing sexual abuse they suffered as children, attempting to become professional sportsmen. \n‘I’ve suffered for a long time,’ he told This Morning’s Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes. ‘I was inspired by Andy Woodward – he was the first to come out [with the allegations]. I was worried that his story may fade into insignificance if he didn’t get any support from anyone,’ the former Liverpool and Spurs man added. \n‘After soul-searching and speaking to my family, I decided to tell my story.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \n\nStewart went on to pay homage to Woodward, the first man to publicly tell the story of how he was abused and tormented by former Crewe coach and youth football scout Barry Bennell. \nThe news comes as Bennell, the convicted Paedophile football coach, was taken to hospital after police responded to a ‘fear for welfare incident’. \nMORE: FA launches review after more than 20 footballers make sex abuse claims \nA statement from Thames Valley Police said: ‘Police officers attended an address in Knebworth Park, Stevenage just before 11pm on Friday, November 25 in connection with a fear for welfare incident. \n‘A 62-year-old man was located and was taken to hospital in order to receive medical treatment, where he remains. \n‘At this stage of enquiries, it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ ",

I started off in radio dressed in a Batman costume. YES it's true I started my radio career not as 'Joe Joe' but as the dude in the Batman costume to win a contest the night guy was hosting. I started spending a lot of time at the radio station and eventually they had to give me a job. Years later I now host the night show on KRQ! Contact ",

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT) - RTR4AMWV \nDerek Hough is leaving \"Dancing With the Stars,\" because when Jennifer Lopez requests your presence, you don't say no.\nThe longtime \"Dancing\" instructor will be joining JLo's upcoming NBC dance competition \" World of Dance \" as a judge, along with R&B singer and dancer Ne-Yo .\nHough, in his blog for TVGuide.com earlier this month, hinted that he had some other projects in the pipeline and didn't know if he would be back for \"Dancing's\" 24th season. Now it's official -- he'll be with J.Lo and Ne-Yo at the judges' table when \"World of Dance\" premieres next year.\n\"Jennifer, Derek and Ne-Yo are three of the most accomplished dancers of their generation, and their incredible insight from the judges' table will be both inspiring and wholly constructive to the world-class level of dancers who are competing on the show,\" Universal Television Alternative Studio President Meredith Ahr said in a statement. \"We feel so very honored that the three of them are giving back to the dance community in this way.\"\nHough will next be seen in NBC's musical \" Hairspray Live! \" on Dec. 7.\nWhile Ne-Yo has been making hit songs for over a decade, he got to really show off his dance chops as the Tin Man in last year's \" The Wiz Live! \"\n\"World of Dance\" is a dance competition show where three age divisions of dancers duke it out until only one act, solo or group, is left in each division. Then the top three will compete against each other for a million-dollar prize and the title of \"Best In the World.\"\nLopez started her career as a backup dancer on the sketch comedy show \" In Living Color .\" Before \"World of Dance,\" she was a judge on \" American Idol .\"",

      "title": "Ski Resorts In The West DEEP in Snow – Up To 6 Feet!",
      "text": "Twitter 0 \nWhile shoppers were scrambling for Black Friday and Cyber Monday bargains, skiers and snowboarders in the western United States and Canada cashed in on big snowfalls across several regions. Given that ski season traditionally gets started in earnest around Thanksgiving weekend, the 2016-17 season is off to a good start in the West. \nBack in 2012, The Weather Channel began naming serious winter storms in alphabetical order just like hurricanes. This latest storm was named Blanche—fitting considering Blanche means “white.” British Columbia – 6 feet+ PHOTO CREDIT: Sun Peaks Resort \nWhistler Blackcomb opened for the season the day before the Thanksgiving with a bountiful powder day. The day’s snow added up to more than two feet. By the end of the weekend, more than six feet of snow had fallen at the Canadian resort. Pacific Northwest – 70 inches+ PHOTO CREDIT: Mt. Hood Meadows \nBlanche left a white cover across the ski areas of Washington and Oregon. Known for its record-setting snowfalls, Washington’s Mt. Baker led the way in typical fashion with 27 inches in a 48-hour span. More than 70 inches in the past week gave Mt. Baker bragging rights for the deepest snowpack in the United States. \nIn Oregon, Mt. Hood Meadows notched a total of 18 inches in a little more than 24 hours . Farther south, Mt. Bachelor reported about a foot of new snow from the storm. California – 34 inches PHOTO CREDIT: Mammoth Mountain \nTwo feet of fresh snow in the Lake Tahoe area allowed Squaw Valley to open the upper mountain on Tuesday, November 29, with top-to-bottom skiing on Mountain Run. Mammoth Mountain also racked up big snow totals with 34 inches from the storm at the resort’s summit. \nFind Southern California lift tickets . Utah – 3 feet \nBy the evening of Monday, November 28, Snowbird was approaching three feet with more in the forecast. Snowbird’s Little Cottonwood Canyon neighbor, Alta Ski Area , had not opened for the season, but plenty of snow should be waiting when the area opens on Friday, December 2. Colorado – 20+ inches PHOTO CREDIT: Purgatory Resort \nThe San Juan Mountains in southwest Colorado got the first helping of snow with Purgatory leading the way before Thanksgiving thanks to a 17-inch day. The rest of the state eventually got their share. For example, Winter Park picked up 20 inches for the week . \nFind Colorado lift tickets . New Mexico – 9 inches \nTaos Ski Valley , the state’s biggest resort, is not scheduled to open until December 15, but New Mexico skiers and boarders got to hit Red River Ski Area for 9 inches of fresh snow over the weekend . Red River is scheduled to close during the week but reopen on Friday, December 2.",

A black man stands accused of killing white San Antonio Detective Benjamin Marconi.\n“Did anybody say, ‘Man, I feel bad for their family?’” Barkley reportedly asked the audience.

      "text": "Published November 29, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nBy F.H. Buckley | NYPost \nDonald Trump has pledged to “drain the swamp,” but I wonder if he knows just how deep down the muck goes.\nYes, he plans to close the revolving door between his administration and the lobbying firms of K Street, and that’s a good start. If you don’t do that, a top federal official is going to be paying way too much attention to the lobbying firm he expects will hire him after he leaves government, and that’s a legalized form of bribery.\nPresident Obama made a similar pledge, and as quickly backed away from it. He said that no administration official could leave government to take up a job as a lobbyist, but exemptions were given and end runs permitted until there was little left of the pledge. Trump proposes to up the ante, by extending the ban from Obama’s two years to five years. He’d also close some of the loopholes that permitted Obama officials to work in lobbying firms without registering as lobbyists.\nRead the full story at the New York Post→",

      "text": "Twitter's mobile apps get organized conversations, will highlight replies closer to your circle Twitter's mobile apps get organized conversations, will highlight replies closer to your circle Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Android - Android + Apps - Apps + Twitter announced today that its mobile apps - available for free on iOS and Android - now use the same ranked conversation system as the web version of the microblogging platform. Back in 2015, Twitter's web app got a useful new feature called conversation ranking, a system that takes into account multiple signals to highlight tweet replies and arrange them in sub-conversations. For a better understanding of the mechanism, here's an excerpt from the Twitter support page that details the conversation ranking feature: For example, when ranking a reply higher, we consider factors such as if the original Tweet author has replied, or if a reply is from someone you follow. Ranked conversations allow Twitter to present a summary of the replies in a way that's more meaningful for each user's social circle. Best of all, the old chronological display of tweet replies is still available if you need it. Twitter is currently undergoing a vital period of intense transformation. As rumors of potential buyouts intensify, the main microblogging platform has been updated with a number of new and useful features such as QR code reading, free NFL game streaming, stickers, a new and more efficient block option, as well as a rather useful night mode. It remains to be seen, however, if Twitter's efforts to fight back against declining active user counts will prove to be effective. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

(Source: Reuters) \nTo make the most relevant replies appear on the top of a tweet thread, Twitter has added a “reply counter” and a “conversation ranking” to its mobile app . The two features will not change the way users use Twitter but they will not be able to read the replies in a chronological order, ENGADGET reported on Wednesday. \nWith the “Conversation ranking” feature, those threads which the original poster replies to will appear on the top. Also, the replies from those you follow will appear on the top. \nSo that a user may understand the context of a conversation, this feature of Twitter will group the replies into sub-conversations based on their context. \n“The new direct ‘reply counter’ is exactly what it sounds like: the reply button under any given tweet will now show how many users have directly replied to that tweet,” the report noted.

      "text": "Westworld ‘s Evan Rachel Wood has announced she’s taking a break from Twitter just a day after she used the platform to describe how she was raped twice, and how the assaults have left their mark on her life.\nBefore Westworld premiered , critics decried the inclusion of scene very early in the pilot in which the show’s female lead, Dolores (Wood), is dragged by the hair into a barn and raped. Wood has defended the show’s depiction of sexual violence, pointing out that there are no actual rape scenes.\nEarlier this month, in a Rolling Stone profile , Wood revealed she had been raped twice, once by a significant other and once by a bar owner. The profile’s author, Alex Morris, notes that she was initially vague about the abusive behavior that contributed to her suicide attempt at age 22, but was “less circumspect” the day after the presidential election, when she emailed him and stated explicitly that she was raped. “I don’t believe we live in a time where people can stay silent any longer,” she wrote in the email. “Not given the state our world is in with its blatant bigotry and sexism.”\nOn Monday, Wood posted a lengthy note on Twitter — the whole “confession” that she had previously shared with Morris. “I started questioning my reasons for staying vague about my experience as a girl growing up in America,” the note begins. “I think, like a lot of women, I had the urge to not make it a sob story, to not make it about me.” The tweet has been shared over two thousand times as of this posting.\nOn Tuesday morning, Wood tweeted that she will be “taking a break from social media for the time being. Thank you for all your support and courageous stories. xo.” (Confusingly, she’s since retweeted an inspirational tweet from author Neale Donald Walsch and an article on C.S. Lewis by Maria Popova.) In the Rolling Stone profile, Wood told Morris that Westworld has helped her cope with some of her own “demons.” “I mean, your demons never fully leave,” she said. “But when you’re using them to create something else, it almost gives them a purpose and feels like none of it was in vain. I think that’s how I make peace with it. Westworld ? Good God. I left so much in that first season and never looked back.”\n",

New York won 27-13. (Photo by: Nick Cammett/Diamond Images/Getty Imges) \nSterling Shepard has been one of the top rookie receivers this season for the New York Giants. He's second among rookies with five touchdowns and 476 yards, while also ranking third in receptions with 44. He's put up those numbers despite not recording a single catch on Sunday against the Browns.\nIn fact, he wasn't even targeted once, the first time that's happened in his career. his previous low was four in his NFL debut.\nEli Manning is obviously responsible for getting Shepard the ball, and he was sorry for not making that happen on Sunday.\nMore from FoxSports Delanie Walker is ready for the Titans' bye week | PROCast Peter King: 'Full speed ahead' for Cardinals Fantasy Football: Week 13 waiver wire targets Whitlock 1-on-1: Chris Spielman says Kap can say whatever he wants if he wins | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF \"I apologized for not getting him a catch,\" Manning said, via the New York Daily News . \"We need to get him involved. We need to get him catches. It's kind of the way the day went on some things. He's done a good job all year. We've got to make sure we're getting him involved in the offense.\" \nManning clearly felt bad about putting a big, fat zero on Shepard's stat sheet, but the rookie didn't need an apology to make it right. He understands that the game dictates where the ball goes oftentimes.\n\"I didn't want him to apologize to me,\" Shepard said. \"That's just the way it goes sometimes.\" \nSo long as the Giants are winning, all is well. No receiver is going to complain about being blanked in the reception column if New York gets a victory. Or at least no receiver should make a fuss about it.",

Follow @rawstory \nIn recent weeks, viral videos of angry, ranting supporters of Donald Trump have made the rounds, prompting fears in many that under the rule of a Pres. Trump, racist white people will feel even more entitled to inflict their hateful views on people who are different from them. \nAn essay in the New Republic published Wednesday , however, put forth the idea that these videos — and the collective disgust they inspire in us — are actually a sign that the majority of Americans don’t subscribe to the angry, racist ideology that helped propel the former reality TV star to a victory in the U.S. Electoral College. \nVideos of the white woman who went on a 45-minute racist harangue in a Chicago Michael’s crafts store, the man who stood up during a Delta flight and demanded to know if there were any “Hillary b*tches” on board the plane and the angry Florida Starbucks customer who said he was the victim of anti-white discrimination all went viral not because everyone supports these people, but because we as a country are appalled by them. \nAt first blush, wrote New Republic’s Graham Vyse, these videos appear to be confirmation of — as former Republican presidential candidate Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA) said — evidence of Trump’s “trickle-down racism.” Trump’s open disdain for nonwhites has emboldened a number of his followers and made them more comfortable inflicting their backward, racist views on the people around them. \n“The closer you look, the more you listen, the clearer it is that these bigoted ranters aren’t so much empowered as they are fragile and pathetic,” wrote Vyse. “And what’s gone largely unnoticed is the reactions that the other people in the videos have to their bigoted ravings—reactions that hint at something to be kinda, sorta hopeful about — that non-racist whites have also been woken up by the Trumpian surge of white nationalism.” \nIn the Michael’s video, the Starbucks video and during the incident of the Delta flight, none of these outspoken Trump supporters are met with support by the people around them. The Starbucks customer was told not to “talk to people that way” by another customer. A witness to the Chicago incident started a GoFundMe account for the employees impacted by the angry shopper’s racist harangue. And the man on the Delta flight who called for cheers for Trump was met only with stony silence from other passengers. \nVyse said, “So, yes, these people were acting entitled. In two of the cases, they were engaged in racial harassment. And sure, they’re all displaying petulant and pathetic assertions of white privilege. But they’re also full of what the scholar and author Robin DiAngelo calls ‘white fragility’—‘a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves.’” \nHe pointed to the videos and the nation’s reaction to them as a sign that the majority of white Americans are not going to stand by and be “silent partners” to a revival of old school racism and a reassertion of American white supremacy. \nAnti-racism scholar and activist Tim Wise, Vyse said, reports that in addition to an uptick of racist mobilization in the U.S., there has been a corresponding rise in anti-racist activity in the country. \n“Wise said he’s seen more white anti-racist activists in recent years than he has for many decades — and Trumpism has undoubtedly helped them find their voices, too,” wrote Vyse. “In a strange way, these disturbing viral videos can be a gift, showing Americans who we really are—both bad and good. They’re also an challenge to be our best selves, to act in such situations the way we’d hope to be seen on camera.” About the Author David Ferguson is an editor at Raw Story.

      "text": "How and why to Twitter verify for a social marketing VIP boost November 30, 2016 Social Media \nTwitter verification used to be more exclusive than a Hollywood afterparty – only about 0.06 percent of Twitter’s accounts were verified (roughly 187,000 out of 310 million monthly users). But over the summer the social media giant sent out an open invitation for qualified users to apply for the blue badge. And verification continues to be a valuable element of a strong social marketing strategy . \nFor content marketers, having the icon next to the username of your business brings with it a heap of benefits. Considering Global Web Index’s quarterly social media marketing report found that social media is a key resource for more than 33 percent of internet users seeking product or service information, that little blue checkmark can help push your audience through the sales funnel. Verification makes a subtle, but impactful difference \nObtaining this status is not going to quadruple your followers overnight. Your content is not ranked higher than that from unverified accounts in Twitter search results. You are not magically going to convert all your followers into leads. So why bother? \nA verified Twitter account, much like a meta description, will not have a direct impact but will still make a positive difference. Verification brings with it a sense of security. Twitter only verifies accounts that are of “public interest,” which include celebrities (of course), political figureheads, news outlets and businesses. Your followers know you’re the real deal and that your content can be trusted, increasing the likelihood you’ll be viewed as an authority in your space. 4 unique verification benefits \nOnce your account is verified, you will get a few perks for your efforts: You will have the ability to customize your feed directly within Twitter. You’ll no longer need to manage a third-party app to track the users you want to interact with. You can set up your account so you only see mentions or other notifications from a custom group of users, or filter out all unverified accounts. You get another way to filter out unwanted content too. If you’ve ever gotten a spammy mass Direct Message on Twitter, you’ll be glad to know verification can fend those off. Verified accounts get the VIP treatment when it comes to filtering out unwanted correspondence – now you know why your favorite celeb never tweets back. If you’re using Vine or Periscope as part of your social media marketing strategy, you’ll be happy to know verification is a three-way street. Once you’re verified on Twitter, visit the other profiles, log out and log back in with your Twitter account. Voila! You’ll automatically be verified on these networks too. While it may be fairly minor, once you’re verified, you will no longer have to deal with popups bugging you to upgrade your Twitter Analytics. You can focus on your data interruption- and distraction-free. \nThe process of getting verified itself is fairly quick and easy (and free), making the ROI all the more impressive. Information you’ll need \nTo become a verified business, you must request the badge from Twitter . Before you even submit a request, make sure your profile has the following: A verified phone number. An email address associated with the brand. An accurate, up-to-date bio. A link to your website. Public Tweets. \nWhen you request verification, you may need to show your ID. Twitter says this requirement is for individual accounts only, but when we verified the Brafton Twitter account , they did request a confirmation of identity. Scan a copy of the primary account owner’s license or passport in advance so if they do ask for it, you can fire the info off right away and reduce delays. For security’s sake, delete the file right away – they do the same once they’ve confirmed the individual is a real person. Details you could get hung up on \nIt’s not a complex process to get verified, so long as you have all your ducks in a row. However, there are a few issues that could arise, mainly when it comes to your phone number. If you do not link your account to a phone number, you cannot get verified. Don’t let a small detail hold you back from getting verified. \nThis may seem like a simple problem. Just have whoever is in charge of Twitter use their cellphone, right? Well, yes, this will technically work. However, if the account changes hands, or more one person accesses it regularly, it becomes problematic. \nTwitter will send verification codes to the linked number every time someone tries to log in from a new computer. If you have more than one person who needs to access the account, coordinating the verification codes will become a hassle quickly. The same issue arises if the primary account owner changes, especially if the individual leaves the company before you get a chance to adjust the business’s profile settings. If you do not link your account to a phone number, you cannot get verified. \nYou may be able to get around this roadblock by using a third-party phone number provider and creating a number specifically for the Twitter account. Many, such as Burner App, do charge for the service, but they make it easy to transfer ownership. Samantha Gordon is the Managing Editor of Brafton.com.

      "text": "Published November 30, 2016 Associated Press Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  (AP) \nALBANY, N.Y. –   Anti-hunger advocates and agriculture groups are criticizing Gov. Andrew Cuomo's opposition to legislation that would give farmers a tax break for donating surplus fruits, vegetables and other locally grown products to food banks to address New York state's growing hunger problem.\nThe Democratic governor vetoed the bill this week. It's the second year the bill has passed the Legislature only to be blocked by Cuomo. He says that while he supports the idea, the measure would reduce state revenue and should be handled in the state budget process.\nSusan Zimet, director of the Hunger Action Network of New York State, says Cuomo's opposition is \"misguided.\" She says lawmakers should return to Albany to override the veto.\nSeveral states including California and Colorado already offer similar tax incentives to farmers.",

Last night after the Cleveland Cavaliers lost 118-101 to the Milwaukee Bucks, J.R. Smith did his postgame interview wearing a ski mask. What resulted was hilarious memes, and Smith is the perfect player for the jokes. \nNBA writer and J.R. Smith enthusiast @ World_Wide_Wob encouraged his followers to come up with the memes. \nPhotos in the gallery above. \nSmith explained the ski mask, noting that it’s his alter ego. \n“It’s my alter ego,” Smith said. “It’s a gift from Ohio State, so I figure why not?” \nSmith got the hood during the Cavs’ trip to the Michigan-Ohio State football game over the weekend. He was then asked if his alter ego had a name. \n“Yeah,” he said. \nWhat is it? \n“I can’t tell you,” Smith said, as LeBron James chuckled while dressing at the locker next to him, causing Smith to laugh, as well.",

      "text": "By Sam Gardner \nPublished November 30, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print OCTOBER, 1973: Defensive back Mel Renfro #20 of the Dallas Cowboys warms up prior to a game in October, 1973. (Photo by: Tony Tomsic/Getty Images) \nTHEN: A former All-American halfback at the University of Oregon, Mel Renfro spent his entire 14-year NFL career as a defensive back with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom he played in four Super Bowls and won two championships, in 1971 and 1977. During his career, Renfro was selected to 10 Pro Bowls, and he's still the Cowboys' all-time interceptions leader, with 52. In 1981, Renfro was inducted to the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and in 1996 he was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nNOW: Now 74, Renfro still lives in the Dallas area, where he keeps busy with autograph signings, motivational speaking and personal appearances. However, his primary focus is on spending time with his 10 grandchildren between the ages of 3 and 22.\nON DALLAS' 10-1 START: \"Looking back, two years ago, we were kind of one play from maybe, possibly, going to the Super Bowl, so the nucleus was there. It was just a matter of last year, with unfortunate injuries to some key players, they just weren't able to get it together. But this year, by the grace of God, those two rookies (Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott) have really been the key. And I think the defensive coordinator (Rod Marinelli) has done a tremendous job of getting the defense to where they're playing extremely well. They haven't got the greatest talent in there, but they've got guys that work hard and want to win and never give up.\"\nMore from FoxSports Snopp Dogg on 'Undisputed': Los Angeles Rams coach Jeff Fisher needs to go Snoop Dogg disagrees with Ben Roethlisberger - let Antonio Brown celebrate | UNDISPUTED Snopp Dogg: Los Angeles Rams' coach Jeff Fisher needs to go | UNDISPUTED Snoop Dogg says Colin Kaepernick needs to choose - football or revolutionary? | UNDISPUTED ON THE PLAY OF ELLIOTT AND PRESCOTT: \"Right out of the gate, there was no question in my mind (about them) from Day 1. The way they performed in training camp, and in the preseason games, these guys played against first-teamers and they showed some ability, some talent, and they were very confident and worked well together. The offensive coordinator (Scott Linehan) and Coach (Jason) Garrett have really done a great job of making the right calls and the right decisions at the right times, so the formula is there for them to be a solid team for many years to come.\"\nON THURSDAY'S COWBOYS-VIKINGS GAME: \"They were our nemesis several times, and the Hail Mary pass up in Minnesota with Roger (Staubach) to Drew Pearson was an exciting finish (in the 1975 divisional round). And then I know one time in Texas Stadium (in the 1973 NFC Championship game), the Vikings knocked us out of the playoffs and they went on to the Super Bowl that year. But it's going to be a good matchup. You've got to play the game. You can't call them before it starts, and anything can happen, but I've got confidence in Zeke and Dak that they'll play hard, the team will rally around them, and hopefully they'll have a victory.\"\nON THE JOY OF WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP: \"We had eight opportunities to go to the Super Bowl, and it took us four hard years where we lost in the playoffs before we got to the Super Bowl. Then we got to Super Bowl V (in 1970) and lost, and the next year we finally won. So we were called 'next year's champions' for four years and it was very painful, but to finally get there and win those Super Bowl rings -- I'll tell you, it's like getting to the mountaintop.\"\nON OREGON'S DECISION TO FIRE MARK HELFRICH: \"I don't agree with it, and it's sad to hear that he was fired. He's been such a mainstay and such a winner and such a gracious and good guy for so long. You're going to have down years in any sport, and he had a great run. And I think if he had just been fed the right players over the last couple of years that he'd still be in there. So it's unfortunate, but I wish the best for him, and I know that Oregon will rise again.\"\nYou can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or email him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 30, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print CLEVELAND, OH - SEPTEMBER 18, 2016: Safety Eric Weddle #32 of the Baltimore Ravens pumps his fist as he walks off the field after a game against the Cleveland Browns on September 18, 2016 at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. Baltimore won 25-20. (Photo by Nick Cammett/Diamond Images/Getty Images) \nVeteran safety Eric Weddle made the jump from the Chargers to the Ravens this offseason after a messy exit from San Diego. In doing so, Weddle has already won more games this season than he did in all of 2015 with the Chargers.\nThat makes for a whole lot of ice cream in the Weddle household.\nAfter every win, Weddle indulges in a big bowl of ice cream. He's shared photos of his post-game meal several times on social media, proving that his unhealthy tradition is indeed real.\nMore from FoxSports Snopp Dogg on 'Undisputed': Los Angeles Rams coach Jeff Fisher needs to go Snoop Dogg disagrees with Ben Roethlisberger - let Antonio Brown celebrate | UNDISPUTED Snopp Dogg: Los Angeles Rams' coach Jeff Fisher needs to go | UNDISPUTED Snoop Dogg says Colin Kaepernick needs to choose - football or revolutionary? | UNDISPUTED However, it was unclear just how much ice cream Weddle actually ate. Hint: It's a lot.\n\"I would think that I consume a full gallon,\" Weddle said on PFT Live . \"I usually take the first batch of some ice cream, eat it and then about an hour later, at halftime of the Sunday night game, I go after a second serving. So I pretty much get a whole gallon of ice cream Sunday night. It's pretty bad.\" \nYeah, pretty safe to say eating a gallon of ice cream before bed -- or at any time, for that matter -- is a bad idea, and not great for one's health. That won't stop Weddle, though. It's working.\nHe's having an outstanding season and is a big part of the Ravens' elite defense. The wins are certainly fun to celebrate, but the losses don't warrant the same reward.\n\"I definitely don't get ice cream,\" he said.",

He's also written columns suggesting women \"suck\" at job interviews and that fear of Islam is rational. \nThe Breitbart website is considered by many to be the platform of the so-called \"alt-right\" movement, an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. \nYiannopoulos, who is gay, has released dates through Jan. 20 for his tour, the title of which contains a slur against LGBT individuals. \nAccording to Yiannopoulos's website, he will speak in the Math 100 lecture hall on the CU campus from 7 to 10 p.m. Jan. 25. \nA representative from Turning Point USA at CU Boulder confirmed via email that the group is hosting Yiannopoulos's appearance in Boulder. Advertisement \nTurning Point USA bills itself as a student group that aims to \"educate students about the importance of fiscal responsibility, limited government and free markets,\" according to its Facebook page. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

It’s a popular issue and politician glom on to popular issues.\nThat is why we have a Supreme Court: to prevent elected politicians from compromising unpopular basic liberties, such as freedom of expression for those whose views and actions we despise.\nThe late Justice William J. Brennan once said that if he saw someone burning his beloved American flag, he would punch him in the mouth, but he wouldn’t try to convict him of a crime.  I would do neither.

Kennedy. One day before the inauguration, Eisenhower’s mind was on the looming threats to American security, and Cuba was high on that list.\nWriting about this critical moment in U.S.-Cuban relations in my new book, “Three Days in January: Dwight Eisenhower’s Final Mission” (out from William Morrow on January 10, 2017), I was struck by the parallels between then and now, especially as we grapple with the implications of the death of Fidel Castro.\nThen, at the height of the Cold War, the threat posed by a Soviet-backed dictator off our southern coast was grave, and the need to formulate the right response in a nuclear age was a grave concern for Eisenhower. \nOn the campaign trail during the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy had been bullish about dealing with and confronting Castro. Now Ike wanted to give him a more measured perspective.\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports \nGREEN BAY, Wis. -- Clay Matthews didn't mince words about the play that got him injured against the Eagles.\n\"It was a cheap shot,\" Matthews said.\nMatthews sustained an injured left shoulder on a crunching first-quarter block from Philadelphia lineman Allen Barbre on Monday night\nMore from FoxSports Derek Carr thinks it's awesome that his finger has a Twitter account Joe Theismann is wrong about Tony Romo being damaged goods | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Whitlock 1-on-1: Ray Lewis explains comments on Joe Flacco | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Should the NFL consider adding a bonus point for kickoffs that split the uprights? Matthews missed three plays and returned, then missed the next series while receiving a pain-killing injection. He returned for the Eagles' third series and played most of the rest of the game. Matthews recorded a fourth-quarter sack, his first since the fourth game of the season.\nThe injury is the latest to limit Matthews. He missed the Week 3 game against Detroit with a hamstring injury, played in the next three games, then missed the Atlanta, Indianapolis and Tennessee games - all losses - after injuring the hamstring again. He returned for last week's loss at Washington but didn't record a tackle.\n\"I was feeling good on that first series\" against the Eagles, Matthews said Wednesday. \"I was playing a little faster with the position change and everything, feeling good about what I was able to do on those first couple of plays. I realize it was only a handful of plays. Yeah, it was frustrating. Part of the game, though. We'll battle through it and just deal with it, I guess.\"\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers injured his left hamstring during the third quarter, but both he and Matthews are expected to play Sunday against Houston. The team didn't practice Wednesday, given them an extra day of rest following Monday night's win.\nCoach Mike McCarthy instead emphasized mental preparation as the Packers (5-6) try to stay in the NFC playoff race.\n\"Stress, it adds up,\" McCarthy said. \"Frankly, this plan was in place in the spring when the schedule came out. We knew this was going to be a difficult stretch for our football team. We moved everything back, gave those guys a chance to sleep in today.\"\nEven without three-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt, who's on injured reserve because of his back, the Texans (6-5) rank fifth in total defense and 12th in points allowed. A hobbled Rodgers would certainly help their cause as they cling to a half-game lead over Tennessee (6-6) and a one-game lead over Indianapolis (5-6) in the AFC South.\n\"There's no question it will definitely help out if he can sit in the pocket and doesn't really feel like running, because there's nothing more defeating than on third down covering everybody and then the quarterback runs right by everyone for the first down,\" Texans linebacker Brian Cushing said. \"If it limits him, obviously that'll be a big plus for us.\"\nNote: Including Rodgers and Matthews, 12 players were on the Packers injury report. Linebackers Jake Ryan (ankle) and Blake Martinez (knee) would have been limited participation and right guard T.J. Lang (ankle) would have not participated.",

They’re Fascism. http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-...re-fascism “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” Most discussion of Trump’s recent tweet has focused on the fact that it is a brazen lie, based on no evidence. People have also pointed out that Trump is directly undermining election legitimacy, and potentially laying the groundwork to refuse to vacate the White House if he should be defeated for reelection in 2020.\" LoP Guest https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/611 18 U.S. Code § 611 - Voting by aliens (a) It shall be unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate for the office of President, Vice President, Presidential elector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, or Resident Commissioner, unless— (1) the election is held partly for some other purpose; (2) aliens are authorized to vote for such other purpose under a State constitution or statute or a local ordinance; and (3) voting for such other purpose is conducted independently of voting for a candidate for such Federal offices, in such a manner that an alien has the opportunity to vote for such other purpose, but not an opportunity to vote for a candidate for any one or more of such Federal offices. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDTcxIqqM0 HIDDEN CAM: NYC Democratic Election Commissioner, \"They Bus People Around to Vote\" In the video, NYC Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin is caught on hidden camera at a United Federation of Teachers holiday party admitting that there is widespread voter fraud in New York City. “Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,” said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York. “You know, I don’t think it’s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID…Like I say, people don’t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,” said Schulkin. Found by livingwaters: Poll: 13% of Illegal Aliens ADMIT They Vote A quick wiki search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_im...ted_States The DHS estimate \"is in the same ballpark as several independent organizations that study illegal immigration, including Pew Research Center (11.3 million); By using that number and the statistic from that poll listed by livingwaters and realizing that most of these illegals will vote for the people promising them amnesty (D) we come to a number of 1,469,000 illegal aliens that voted. Now those are just acknowledged numbers. The population of illegal immigrants may be much higher and the number of them voting may be much higher. Then taking into account the video posted where an election commissioner admits that they bus people around from precinct to precinct to vote and you have fraud on a massive scale. How many Democrats went from poll to poll and voted with assistance from the fine folks who are supposed to be preventing such a thing but didn't because of instructions from Creamer and others in the DNC dirty tricks department as desired by those who hired such fine folks? As for the machines. http://www.blackboxvoting.org . Bev Harris has done some incredible work on this subject. Head on over and take a look at her 'Fraction Magic' videos. Here is the short version video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hjmKBfrycQ Illegal Aliens, Non-Citizens Caught Voting In Florida In Vast Numbers \"We don't know how widespread this problem is because elections offices don't keep track of where non-citizens live,\" Pierrotti reports, \"So we decided to do something that they'd never tried to do before: We found them on our own.\" The investigation began by examining state forms on which residents had declined jury duty by checking a box indicating that they weren't US citizens, and were therefore ineligible to serve. Pierrotti then cross-referenced those results with local voter rolls, identifying at least 94 people who were registered to vote in the state of Florida. Next, he visited some of these people at their homes, where they admitted that they weren't citizens and professed ignorance as to how they were registered to vote in the first place. But voting records confirmed that they'd exercised their \"right\" to vote that, as non-citizens, they do not actually possess. http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/doj-w...ered-vote/ DOJ Whistleblower Reveals How Many Dead People Are Registered to Vote It seems the possibility of the dead rising up from their graves could occur well after Halloween this year. More specifically, eight days later – on Election Day. J. Christian Adams, an election lawyer who served in the Voting Rights Section at the U.S. Department of Justice, revealed earlier today that there are over 4 million ineligible and dead voters registered to vote in the United States. Vid included No, voter fraud isn’t a myth:10 cases where it’s all too real ANALYSIS/OPINION: As Donald Trump takes on the Republican establishment, Democrats and the mainstream media, he’s telling supporters they’re fighting against a “rigged” system, rife with voter fraud and those eager to protect the status quo. The left, predictably, says this type of talk is “dangerous” to the integrity of our electoral system, and then glibly asks for Mr. Trump to prove his voter fraud allegations. This is where the left is wrong: The argument isn’t whether voter fraud is real, but how widespread it is. Here’s 10 examples documenting that voter fraud isn’t a myth and how Mr. Trump’s claims aren’t just speculation. 1. Dead people voting in Colorado. 2. Illegals found voting in Virginia; only discovered after they self-reported. 3. Some Pennsylvania citizens voting twice. 4. Illegal voters uncovered in Philadelphia; half had previously voted. 5. Voter rigging triggers probe in Texas. 6. Indiana voter fraud investigation grows to 56 counties. 7. Three under investigation in Oklahoma for voting twice in the presidential primary. 8. Election fraud in Kentucky. 9. Underage voters found voting in Wisconsin’s presidential primary. 10. Voter registration cards sent to illegals in Pennsylvania. How Widespread is Voter Fraud? | 2012 Facts & Figures Here are the facts: To date, 46 states have prosecuted or convicted cases of voter fraud. More than 24 million voter registrations are invalid, yet remain on the rolls nation-wide. There are over still eligible on the rolls across the country. More than 2.75 million Americans are registered to vote in more than one state. True The Vote recently found 99 cases of potential felony interstate voter fraud. Maryland affiliates of True The Vote uncovered cases of people registering and voting after their respective deaths. This year, True The Vote uncovered more than 348,000 dead people on the rolls in 27 states. California: 49,000 http://www.globalresearch.ca/stanford-un...on/5555392 A bombshell study released by Stanford University confirms evidence of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. According to a paper released this week entitled, “Are we witnessing a dishonest election?,” a state comparison based on the voting procedures used during the election reveals endemic election fraud within the system. Given the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance. Are the results we are witnessing in the 2016 primary elections trustworthy? While Donald Trump enjoyed a clear and early edge over his Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernard Sanders has been far more competitive. LoP Guest RE: Twitter says it will ban Trump if he breaks hate-speech rules Shall we go on to HRC committing treason? I've put together a couple of things. One on her email and the other on her and ISIS sitting in a tree. FYI, on the email thing, if it's ever proven that anyone ever hacked her private server it's actually enough to charge her with espionage. Your call. I've posted it numerous times already but all of you just seem to glide right on over it. Like committing treason is no big deal as long as the proper trade mark is after the person's name. But it's your call. I have the doc open and can post it fairly quick.

      "text": "In what is a targeted attack on the Indian National Congress, the Twitter account of the party has been hacked. The hackers who go by the name ‘Legions’ seem to have taken control over the party’s Twitter account and are posting expletives and abuses. The hack has taken place after the Twitter handle of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was similarly compromised last night. At the time of filing this story, the Congress Twitter handle is still compromised and the hackers continue to push tweets filled with expletives and abuses. Some of them read, “Corrupt political party trying to f*ck around with innocent hackers, you think you’re cool bro?!” and “Coming up is a full dump of inc.in congress emails, stay tuned",

      "text": "Bethany Clarke | Getty Images The Twitter logo and hashtag '#Ring!' is displayed on a mobile device. Chris Sacca, one of the earliest investors in Twitter , told CNBC on Wednesday that he would \"love\" to see the social media company acquired as that could boost innovation at the company. \nTwitter has been struggling with user growth in recent months and it was also in the middle of intense takeover speculation with Salesforce and Google both reportedly taking an interest. But those takeover talks ended in mid-October. \nStill, there is a chorus of voices that feel Twitter should be acquired. Sacca, who is also an investor on \"Shark Tank\", still feels the company could benefit from being acquired.\n\"I would love to see them in a partnership or an acquisition position with a company, just so they would get a little more product vision, maybe freedom to experiment and take some risk, because we just haven't seen that out of this team,\" Sacca told CNBC in a TV interview at the Slush technology conference in Helsinki.\nTwitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has put a big emphasis on live video to boost growth. Earlier this year, Twitter signed a deal to live stream Thursday night NFL games and has experimented with broadcasting other sporting events. Dorsey sees live video as a way of attracting new users and advertisers to the platform. \nSacca said live video is \"compelling\" but Twitter is not leveraging its strengths to boost the experience.\n\"The problem is Twitter hasn't yet built a great Twitter-specific complimentary experience to live video. So you see the live video of the (NFL) game, but you really need the great high-quality tweets to go along with that to make it uniquely valuable for Twitter and they still haven't gotten there,\" Sacca said.",

(Reuters) \nAfter Rahul Gandhi ’s official Twitter handle was hacked on Wednesday evening, INC’s verified account was hacked today. The hackers filled the accounts with obscene and abusive tweets. Meanwhile, it took some time but the accounts were restored and the distasteful tweets were removed. The group of hackers who call themselves ‘Legion’ directed several abusive tweets at Rahul Gandhi and also the Congress party from their verified account themselves. Many of the tweets were full of profane words, even as some of them threatened Gandhi and the Congress party. \nThe party condemned the hacking of Gandhi’s account while Congress’ media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the hacking was a ‘sinister concept to abuse and intimidate’. Meanwhile, Rahul Pandhi a part of the party’ digital team wrote on Twitter, “When you don’t have ans to Rahul Gandhi’s Qns, you hack his account to put the trash that your mind is. It’s rather a win for @OfficeOfRG!” He added that the INC’s Twitter handle was restored and that the email server was compromised by hackers with political agenda of top levels. Pandhi wrote, “A malicious cyber attack at the highest possible levels. The passwords etc were replaced, but our e-mail servers have been compromised.” He added, “Oh baby! We at @INCIndia are getting into the nerves our political opponents..full cyber attack by the chimps. You still can’t deter us!” \nAlso read | After Rahul Gandhi, Congress’ Twitter account gets hacked \nWhen someone on Twitter suggested that the crime could have been done by a ‘disgruntled sacked employee’, Gaurav responded, “Hacking is a crime – whoever does it. You & your sources must assist the investigators to nab the hackers if your info is correct.” Earlier, after the hack of Rahul Gandhi’s account, Pandhi asked, “If eminent digital props can be hacked & not restored, what’s the assurance about financial transactions? Cyber attack is real. #RahulGandhi”. \nAlso read | Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account hacked, Congress says BJP behind act \nPandhi blamed ‘helpless’ Twitter for inaction against such cyber abuse, saying that if a senior politician like Rahul Gandhi’s account can be hacked why can’t the social media giant take responsibility to get it back as soon as possible. Pandhi said, “Tomorrow anyone’s account gets hacked and folks from @twitter are inaccessible and then your team is unable to get back account.” He further said, “Is this the shit that Twitter is where you are not able to control the services when it is being misused by bigots.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

      "title": "The lung cancer symptoms even non-smokers should know",
      "text": "The lung cancer symptoms even non-smokers should know By Anthea Levi Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nAshley Rivas was 26 when she noticed she was getting tired earlier than usual on her runs. Over the next few years, the X-ray technician from Albuquerque, New Mexico, developed a persistent cough and wheezing, which her doctors attributed to exercise-induced asthma. She had other symptoms, too: weight loss, fever, and several bouts of pneumonia. Still, when Rivas finally decided to perform a chest X-ray on herself, cancer was the last thing on her mind. \nThe image revealed a mass on her right lung that turned out to be a malignant tumor. Rivas was 32 and had never smoked a cigarette in her life. \"I want people to know lung cancer can happen to anyone,\" she says. \nRivas has joined the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign, to spread the word that her disease isn't just a smoker's affliction. \"It's true that the majority of people with lung cancer have some history of tobacco use,\" says Lung Association spokesperson Andrea McKee, MD, the chair of radiation oncology at Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts. \"Having said that, 15% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer have no history of tobacco use—and they may be quite young.\" \nOther known risk factors aside from smoking include a family history of the disease, as well as exposure to certain air pollutants, such as asbestos, arsenic, radon, even diesel fumes, says Dr. McKee. Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide; and each year, it kills more women than breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer combined. \nRELATED: 25 Breast Cancer Myths Busted \nIf it's diagnosed early, the disease is actually highly curable, Dr. McKee says. Luckily this was the case for Rivas. She had her tumor removed in 2013, and is now thriving. (She ran a half-marathon last year!) \nBut only about 16% of cases are caught at stage 1. \"Usually it’s like a 7- to 8-millimeter nodule sitting in the middle of a lung that doesn’t have any symptoms associated with it,\" says Dr. McKee. Most patients are diagnosed later, once the tumor has grown large enough that it's \"pushing on an airway, resulting in some breathing problems,\" she explains. \nThat's what Marlo Palacio experienced just before the holidays in 2013, when she developed a cough unlike any cough she'd ever had before. \"I would feel like I was out of breath or gagging,\" she says. At first, the social worker from Pasadena, California, assumed she'd picked up a bug from her toddler son. But six weeks later, the cough hadn't gone away. Doctors diagnosed Palacio—an otherwise healthy, 39-year-old non-smoker—with stage 4 lung cancer. \nAt stage 4, lung symptoms like Palacio had (and others such as pneumonia and coughing up blood) may be accompanied by problems elsewhere in the body, such as back pain, bone pain, headaches, weight loss, and confusion, says Dr. McKee. That's because \"once the disease has spread, [it's] usually having an effect on a system outside of the lungs,\" she explains. \nAfter several different treatments, Palacio developed a new, isolated tumor in September. But she says she is doing well, physically and emotionally. \"I'm feeling pretty positive that this will be something that we can just eliminate and maintain,\" she says. \"I just accept that this is a lifelong fight for maintenance, and keeping my cancer down.\" \nRELATED: 6 Cancer-Fighting Superfoods \nDr. McKee is hopeful that rising awareness of lung cancer, and advances in screening will mean fewer late-stage diagnoses in the future—because catching the disease early can make all the difference. \nFrida Orozco knows that fact first-hand. She was diagnosed with stage 2 in her late twenties, a few months after she developed a dry cough. \"I started to feel a pain every time I coughed on the lower side of my ribs, and also on the left side of my chest, near the clavicle,\" she says. When Orozco came down with a fever, headaches, and dizziness, she went to an urgent care facility; a chest X-ray revealed the mass in her lung. \nBut today, the 30-year-old student at Borough of Manhattan Community College happily reports she has been in remission for a year and a half. \"You can't even tell I've been through all of this,\" she says, \"except for the scars.\" \nRELATED: 15 Thyroid Cancer Facts Everyone Should Know \nSo when should you get a lingering cough checked out? \"To be safe, I would say that any cough that you're concerned about that's persisting beyond a few weeks, you should talk with your doctor,\" says Dr. McKee. \"A cough shouldn't linger beyond two or three weeks.\" \nIf you suspect something is not right with your health, follow up, urges Rivas. \"You know your body better than anybody,\" she says. \"Push, because you're probably right. My pulmonologist told me that if I hadn’t caught [my cancer] when I did, I would’ve died. And it was because of my persistence. I knew something was wrong, I kept pushing.\" \nTo learn more lung cancer, check out the American Lung Association's Lung Force campaign.",

      "text": "Twitter says it will ban Donald Trump if he violates the site's rules #trumpban on Dec 1, 2016, 9:30 AM TechSpot \nAfter Twitter had brought down the banhammer on a number of high-profile accounts associated with “alt-right” movements earlier this week, the question was raised whether it would ever remove its most famous \"controversial\" Tweeter: Donald Trump. When asked if it really would ban the President-elect, the microblogging site said that if he broke the rules then his account would be removed. \nA company spokesperson told Slate : “The Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.” \nWhen pressed on whether this specifically means Trump would be banned if he was judged to have broken the rules, the spokesperson confirmed: “The Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts.” \nNot long after Twitter introduced its recent anti-troll measures , the site banned the head of the National Policy Institute, Richard Spencer. “This is corporate Stalinism,” said Spencer. “Twitter is trying to airbrush the Alt Right out of existence. They’re clearly afraid. They will fail!” \nBack in July, the site permanently banned one of Trump’s biggest supporters, Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos, for allegedly inciting his followers to send abusive tweets to Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. \nTwitter has long tried to walk a fine line between keeping its reputation as a home for free speech and taking action against abusive users. One could only imagine the uproar that banning Trump would cause. \nIt seems Twitter’s stance is in contrast to that of Facebook. Some of the social network's employees called for Trump’s Facebook page to be suspended because his posts about banning Muslims from entering the US violate the site’s rules on hate speech. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it would be inappropriate for the company to interfere with a major-party candidate’s political posts. Related Reads",

      "text": "By Sean Hannity \nPublished December 01, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s dramatic deal with air conditioner manufacturer Carrier to keep jobs in America is not the only major campaign promise that he's working to keep.\nTrump also is planning a massive, Reagan-like tax cut, according to his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin. And like the Carrier deal, which keeps 1,000 jobs in Indiana, Trump is not wasting any time.\n“We're already sitting down and discussing this with Congress,” Mnuchin said. “And this is going to be something that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency. We're going to have a major tax reform, biggest tax reform since Reagan. And it's not just going to be a cut in corporate taxes, but it's also going to be a very large middle income tax cut that's going to help this country.”\nGINGRICH SAYS SCHUMER 'HAS NO IDEAS' \nMnuchin is also revealing that the Trump team is moving ahead with the president-elect's plan to allow multi-national corporations to repatriate trillions of dollars in profits that are held overseas at a 10 percent rate. That means companies can bring all of that money back to America to build factories, manufacturing centers and create jobs.\nAnd then there's ObamaCare. Trump has vowed to repeal or replace the disastrous health care law, last night, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told my television audience that doing so is at the top of Mr. Trump's ambitious agenda.\n“The president-elect's made it very clear he wants the Congress when they convene in early January to take up the task of repealing and replacing ObamaCare first,” Pence said.\nPresident-elect Trump is not even in office yet, and he's already off to a pretty good start. During the campaign, he made very specific promises to the American people. In order for him to be a successful president, all he has to do is go down the list of things he promised and make them happen.\nHe won’t be sworn in for another 50 days, and he is already checking boxes.\nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on \"Hannity,\" Nov. 30, 2016 \n\nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 10-11PM/ET) . He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York. Click here for more information on Sean Hannity .",

      "text": "  \nLala Kent took to Twitter after this week's episode of Vanderpump Rules and claimed her co-star, Scheana Shay, had been bullied. \nAfter watching as the other ladies became upset after learning Shay had spoken to Kent, Kent shared a tweet with fans, accusing Katie Maloney, Stassi Schroeder and the other women of bullying Shay into bullying her. I'm appalled by the way these little mean girls R treating Scheana on #pumprules . Bullying her into bullying me? It's disgusting. \n— Lala Kent (@lala_kent) November 30, 2016 \nKent also spoke of her co-stars during an interview with Jenny McCarthy days ago. \n“I don’t know why these girls don’t like me,” Kent explained, via Reality Tea . “Now I’ve definitely given everyone a reason not to like me because I’ve spoken my truth and my mind, but they haven’t been kind to me since I walked into the restaurant and onto the show.” \n“I think they’re just jealous of my lifestyle period. I lived at home for a really long time and saved up a lot of money, so – I kind of live a little bit differently than they live and date different types of people than they date, and I just see more in my future than, like, shaking martinis. I think they get offended, like I’m judging them…” she continued. \nTo see more of Lala Kent and the cast of Vanderpump Rules , check out new episodes of the series airing   and watch a sneak peek at next week's episode  ",

      "text": "Published December 01, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print A Massachusetts family wants answers after their child was given Ritalin.  (Fox 25.) \nA Massachusetts family is seeking answers after a school nurse gave their daughter Ritalin instead of Motrin in an alleged case of mistaken identity. Madison Young, 7, said she went to the nurse for Motrin after falling in the lunchroom and the nurse began calling her by the wrong name, Fox 25 reported. \n“She said, ‘Hi Ava.’ I said, ‘I’m not Ava,’ but then she still proceeded to give me the medicine,” Young told Fox 25. \nThe medicine was identified as Ritalin, a drug used to address attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and was intended for another student, which the nurse reportedly realized after giving it to Young. Kerry Russell, Young’s mother, said she received a panicked phone call from the nurse and instructed her to call poison control after she admitted to the mistake, Fox 25 reported. \nThe school’s superintendent told Fox 25 that all parties were contacted to discuss protocols and procedures to prevent the same mistake from happening to another child, but Russell said she was never contacted, the news station reported. The family wants to know why the nurse never confirmed Young’s identity before administering the Ritalin.\nMore on this... Generic drug makers challenge FDA plan to withdraw their ADHD pills",

President Obama’s contentious actions and rhetoric only served to drive a wedge between three quarter million law officers and the communities they serve.\nIt hasn’t been impossible to see instances where a police officer acted in a manner that brought doubt and suspicion on their department. But the misguided narrative that linked the actions of a very few to an entire profession has generated a wave of mistrust against law officers and gave a voice to hateful, anti-cop groups like Black Lives Matter.\nIn fact, were it to be fully and fairly reported, we would know of exponentially more acts of police bravery, sacrifice and heroism than the comparatively few questionable shootings of citizens.\nRead more at Foxnews.com→",

      "text": "Flip \nChris Sacca, one of Twitter’s earliest investors, said he would love to see the micro-blogging site acquired, as that could push innovation at the social media platform. Twitter, which has been struggling to increase its user base , was in the middle of intense takeover speculation with both Google and Salesforce, but nothing came out of it. Photo by edisona (Pixabay) Twitter could benefit from acquisition \nBoth Google and Salesforce were once reportedly taking an interest in acquiring the social media company, but in mid-October, those takeover speculations came to an end. However, there are still voices that feel the social network should be bought, and Sacca, who feels the social media platform could benefit from being acquired, is one of them \nOn Wednesday in a TV interview with CNBC, Sacca said he would love to see the micro-blogging site in an acquisition position or a partnership with a company, “just so they would get a little more product vision, maybe freedom to experiment and take some risk, because we just haven’t seen that out of this team.” \nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has put a huge emphasis on live video to push growth. The micro-blogging site signed a deal earlier this year to live-stream Thursday night NFL games. In addition, the social network has experimented with broadcasting other sporting events. The CEO sees live video as a way of attracting advertisers and new users to the platform. \nLive video is compelling, but the company is not leveraging its strengths to boost the experience, said Sacca. The problem is that the social network has not yet created a “great Twitter-specific complimentary experience to live video,” the investor said. He believes the company needs to make it uniquely valuable by creating great high-quality tweets to go along with the game but that it hasn’t gotten there yet. What’s blocking the acquisition? \nWhen Dorsey took control in 2015, the tech giant was struggling with several issues which still have not been solved. Stalled growth, online harassment, abusive users and hate speech are a big issue for the tech giant. \nTwitter’s price tag is probably what is blocking its acquisition. The company’s current market capitalization is about $13 billion, and any acquisition would likely involve a meaningful premium. According to a report from Fool.com, for a social network that has a stagnating user base, net losses measured in large amounts, and annual revenue of just $2.5 billion, this is a high price to pay.",

      "text": "\nBack in October, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn took to Twitter to tease the beloved Marvel film's upcoming sequel by way of a poster and the first trailer for the flick. Before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters on May 5, 2017, however, the director has another project up his sleeve: The Belko Experiment . Produced and written by Gunn with Australian Greg McLean in the director's chair, the satirical The Belko Experiment -- which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year -- is a kill-or-be-killed thriller that sees the employees of the Belko Corporation trapped in their office building and ordered to kill one another lest their hostage-takers murder them all.\nThe Belko Experiment will hit theaters March 17, 2017.\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n",

The LP is set to release digitally Dec. 16 while the physical album drops on Dec. 23.\nThe follow-up to 2015's Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven was originally set for a September release before Cudi cited \"minor sample clearances\" as the cause of the delay. Cudi released two songs from the album, \"Surfin'\" and \"The Frequency,\" just days before he checked himself into rehab for depression.\nThe rapper also dropped a new track from the album, \"Baptized In Fire\" featuring Travis Scott which can be streamed here.

      "text": "Congress slams govt over Twitter hack attacks, fears of server breach loom india Updated: Dec 01, 2016 17:54 IST Saubhadra Chatterji and Anirban Ghoshal, Hindustan Times Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account was hacked and offensive tweets were posted. (Arun Sharma/HT Photo) \nThe Congress is livid. The party’s official Twitter account allegedly fell prey to hackers who posted offensive messages on Thursday morning, just 12 hours after vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s account faced a similar ordeal. \nBut the bad news doesn’t end there. The hackers indicated the breach was much bigger and a cache of confidential internal party emails and correspondence might land up on a public platform such as Wikileaks soon. \nSources said the server that hosted the Congress website and e-mail accounts was hacked, indicating confidential data had been compromised. \n“Coming up is a full dump of inc.in congress emails, stay tuned for Christmas special,” one of the tweets allegedly posted by the hackers via @INCIndia read. The offensive tweets were erased in a matter of minutes. \nJust 12 hours ago, hackers had done something similar to @officeofRG, removing Gandhi’s profile picture and changing the account name and bio. A screen shot of the Congress’s official Twitter page after it was allegedly hacked into. \nAgencies reported that the information technology ministry has ordered a probe but Twitter refused comment on the matter. \nA Twitter account can be hacked in one or more ways. A hacker can either choose to download a tool from thousands of websites available online to hack a person’s profile or use the sheer brute force of programming to get a password, change it and hijack the account. \nReports say the hackers gained access to the Congress’ social media accounts through a targeted attack on the party server, which gave hackers access to all mails and accounts. \nThe Congress has lashed out at the government for poor cyber security at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi is exhorting Indians to go cashless. \n“Those forcing country to adopt online payment overnight,have they taken steps to ensure a/c of ordinary ppl will be immune from hacking?” tweeted Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel. \n“Hacking of@OfficeofRG proves lack of Digital safety around each one of us. Every digital info can be accessed, altered, morphed & modified,” tweeted Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. \nBut is the opposition party barking up the wrong tree? \nRead: Twitter account hacking: BJP hits out at Congress’‘regressive thinking’ \nExperts feel it is futile for the Opposition party to try and corner the government over the hacking of Twitter handles, even in countries with most advanced cyber protection laws, hackers still make a living. \n“A hack on Twitter cannot be blamed on the government’s cybersecurity laws as Twitter has its own set of encryption and protection measures which is uniform for all countries,” Saket Modi, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Lucideus, said. \n“The Opposition’s allegation that India needs better cyber security laws in lieu of the economy going cashless doesn’t hold in the case of the hack attack on the Congress Twitter handle and Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter handle,” he added. \nHe also added that the draft amendment of the national encryption policy that would increase the encryption to 128-bits has also been discarded by the government.The party has lodged a formal complaint to the cyber security cell of the Delhi Police. The complaint was filed by Surjewala, demanding strict action against those behind the hacking. \n“The way @OfficeOfRG a/c got hacked,as cybercrime & Twitter watched helpless raises serious Q’s on digital safety, Digital India future,”Ahmed Patel said, taking digs at PM Modi’s pet project of Digital India. tags ",
