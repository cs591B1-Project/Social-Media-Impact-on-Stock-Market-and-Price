As one of its AI experiments , the search giant has launched a new site, Quick, Draw! , which is not only entertaining for us humans, but an educational experience for Google’s neural network. \nQuick, Draw! works like this: The site tasks you with drawing six relatively common, doodle-able items, and you’ve got up to 20 seconds to draw each. As you’re drawing, Google’s neural network is continually guessing what you’re trying to illustrate. Once it correctly guesses your doodle—or time is up—you move on to the next drawing. After you’ve finished your illustrations, Quick, Draw! also shows you how it came to its successful guesses by showing you the doodles other people have submitted thus far. \nWhen we gave it a stab, the network correctly guessed five out of our six drawings. As you can see below, this AI must already be skilled, because our doodling abilities certainly aren't. Google's Quick, Draw! results Screengrab via Google \nAs a doodler, you can play with two angles. You can try to give Google a challenge to analyze your images, or you can try to help it guess your doodles as quickly as possible. \nAnd luckily, if you’re dissatisfied with your first round, you can always play again.",

      "title": "Google Pixel XL XDA Review: A Foundational Release for Google & Post-Nexus Android",
      "text": "Google’s newest incursion into the smartphone market is upon us, and the Pixel and Pixel XL aim to offer top-notch hardware and the perfect realization of Google’s new vision for Android. Most importantly, perhaps, it is key part of a bigger push for a redefined Google ecosystem.\nWith so many great Android phones around, how clearly can the Pixels stand out?\nIn this review, we’ll take an in-depth dive into the Pixel XL. Rather than listing specs and talking about how the experience felt, this feature attempts to provide a thorough look with contents relevant to our reader base. At XDA, our reviews are not meant to tell a user whether a phone is worth buying or not — instead, we try to lend you the phone through our words and help you come to the decision by yourself. Before getting started, let’s get the specification sheet out of the way:\nDevice Name: Pixel XL Release Date/Price Available Now, Starts at U$D 769 Android Version 7.1 Nougat Display 5.5 inch AMOLED – 1440 x 2560 – 534 PPI Chipset Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 “Pro-AB” | Quad-core CPU (2×2.15 GHz Kryo & 2×1.6 GHz Kryo) | Adreno 530 GPU Battery 3,450 mAh RAM 4GB LPDDR4 Sensors Fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer Storage 32GB | 128GB Connectivity USB 3.0 Type C, 3.5mm audio jack Dimensions 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm (~71.2% screen-to-body) Rear Camera f/2.0, EIS, laser autofocus, video: 4K Video, 240FPS Maximum Weight 168g Front Camera 8MP, f/2.4 Index Design Software – UI Software – UX Performance Real World UX Camera Display Battery Life Audio Development & Future Proofing Final Thoughts \nHardware Design & Build Quality The design of the Pixel XL is one of the factors that will likely get disputed the most among enthusiasts, owners and potential-buyers: in many ways, it is a deviation from the design language of the Nexus line as seen on the Nexus 6P and 5X , but the new shell gives credence to the idea of a discrete Google product. The HTC-manufactured body follows a mix between tradition and oddity, ultimately achieving a look that’s unique even if unconventional. While Google likely tried to make something different with its first new phone, given some of the recent revelations it’s unclear whether they really had much time at all to nail the body of the Pixel and Pixel XL, and some think that it might not even be a truly Google-designed device . None of that changes the merits and downfalls of the actual device that is already produced, though, so we’ll leave those arguments for the editorials where they belong. Let’s take a detailed look at each part of the Pixel XL. \n\nThe front of the Pixel XL is what I referred to as “conventional” when describing the makeup of the phone’s design. The “quite black” color option actually tones down the “black slab” motif of previous Nexus given its more of a deep grey, something worth pointing out due to the AMOLED screen the device packs. Nexus 6P owners will candidly recall the way in which the bezels merged with the screen on black background and images — not perfectly so, but well-enough to give the illusion in most lighting conditions. Unless you are in a dark environment, you will find a clear distinction between screen and bezel in the Pixel XL no matter which variant you pick. Something that I believe has been largely ignored, though, is that the Pixel XL has one of the absolute-thinnest black border around its actual display , which makes the white and blue variants of the device look more pleasing than they otherwise would, and than other white phones \n\nThe fact that you will notice the bezel is relevant given the phone’s below-average screen-to-body ratio , with average side bezels and sizeable top and bottom bezels as well. While the device is quite tall, its surface dimensions are largely the same in proportion to the Nexus 6P’s, as the screen-to-body ratio is 71.4% versus 71.2%. Due to the Pixel Xl’s slightly-smaller screen, it ultimately makes it a more-compact device with slightly-bigger bezels than an average 5.5-inch phone. An issue many will take with the frontal design, however, is the asymmetrical distribution of top and bottom bezel. We found the larger bottom bezel to be slightly more noticeable on the white front Pixel variants, too, as the pitch-black navigation bar makes a clear contrast with the bezel. It is a little disappointed to see that space unused given that last year’s Nexus phones had bottom-firing speakers, and that HTC (who ultimately manufactured this phone) has been renowned for its speakers too. However, I have found the ergonomics and nav-bar-reachability to be excellent on the Pixel XL precisely because of the bottom-heavy bezel, which ends up pushing the navigation bar higher and making it easier for the thumb to reach it. At the top you’ll find the usual camera, sensor and speaker. \n\nA similarly-neat positioning is found on the sides of the phone: the 8.5mm-thick frame hosts both the volume rocker and the power-button on the right side, in such a way that they are easy to reach with either hand . Right-handed usage results in the thumb perfectly landing on the power button and only slightly above the volume rocker, while left-handed usage has the index finger reach the power button, and the middle finger land on the volume keys. I adapted to the new setup instantly, and the textured power button feels great and aids in giving tactile contrast between the two control pieces. It also shines differently at various angles when hit by light due to its geometry, and it ultimately feels extremely sturdy and clicky. The volume rocker, on the other hand, has been wobblier on all the units we’ve tested, and we’ve also seen numerous reports of other users finding their volume keys wobblier than the power button ( and they can sound differently, too ). That being said, they remain extremely clicky as well , and we’ve had no issues with asymmetric feedback when pressing either key either. \nOther than that, the sides are pretty barren except for the SIM card slot on the other side of the device, which sits flush with the rest of the frame. The bottom of the phone contains the USB Type-C port as well as two grills, only one of which is a speaker as the right grill is a microphone instead. At the top of the phone, you’ll find the 3.5mm headphone jack. Around the edges you’ll find both the glass front and the back of phone fused with different curvatures: the 2.5D glass transition of the screen is extremely subtle , whereas the curvature merging the frame with the back is very pronounced and sudden, and the antennae bands follow around it. \n\nGetting to the back of the phone is where we find some of the more interesting-aspects of the device’s design. The Pixel XL has a two-tone back with the aluminum chassis featuring a glass overlay at the top, which reportedly helps with signal as well (I haven’t found signal to be particularly better than on other devices, though, and I know friends abroad have had signal issues). It gives the design an unconventional look that makes it stand out from the crowd and it’s ultimately a more-prominent “Google phone” marker than the Google logo at the mid-bottom. The two-tone back is certainly a curious addition that brings unconventional side-effects, such as uneven heat distribution, different scratch and shatter properties for uneven durability, and an interesting difference in light reflection . The glass panel is glossy and due to the background under it, it ends up looking not-quite-transparent, meaning it can look like slick black glass or like a more matte grey texture depending on the lighting and the angle. I personally think it’s an interesting choice and I’ve grown to like it, but there are some nitpicks worth mentioning as well: \n\nFirst of all, the glass is slightly raised above the metal, making the glass window prone to scratches when laid on certain surfaces. Our units have all been scratched as a result, with the edges in particular showing many microscratches. Second, we found a positioning mistake in multiple units where the window’s microphone hole is actually not aligned with the microphone under the glass . We’ve also heard reports of slightly uneven fusing of the glass and the metal across its four edges, but our units have been fine. Ultimately, cases and skins can help mitigate some of the potential durability side-effects. \nThe new redesign certainly borrows some structural similarities from other manufacturers, but the execution is very solid in itself. The phone feels very sturdy (in part due to the thickness), the materials feel premium and the ergonomics are very good for a large and thick device, with good button placement and reachability. A final nitpick would be that the device doesn’t feel properly balanced in terms of weight, although the center of gravity lays only slightly past the middle. I personally think the design is unassuming and unspectacular, but I also feel like it’s the kind of design one won’t get sick of after a year, or rather, the kind of functional smartphone design one can enjoy for more than a single year. \nSoftware Design & User Interface With the Pixel phones being Google-branded, we are actually seeing Google customize the system UI of their devices with an “exclusive” theme, but given that the Pixel is also running Android 7.1 we also see some UI changes that will eventually arrive to all Android devices. Google’s changes to the system UI are ultimately tame and lighter than the changes in OEM skins , but they are worth documenting because they either represent the foundation for what we can expect out of future Pixel phones, or the future of Android as the changes trickle down to all devices. And, perhaps most importantly, these modifications give the Pixel some extra character and uniqueness, not unlike what other OEMs intend with their modifications to stock Android. \nStarting with the one change you’ll see on nearly every screen, we find that the navigation bar has now filled its icons and deviated from the standard imposed by Android 5.0 Lollipop now two years ago. The new buttons behave identically to the standard AOSP navigation bar for the most part, with the exception of the home button which has a short animation upon pressing it and long-pressing it. The Google colors make for a nice visual cue that signals the presence of Google Assistant as well, and the way in which they react to touch serve as visual aid to make long-pressing for the shortcut more intuitive. \n\nMoving on to the Pixel Launcher, which you can download for your device, we see two important changes to the Pixel’s UI design language. First, we find the circular icons that are now a system-wide standard and not relegated to the launcher only , and that are enabled by Google but also can be enabled by any OEM who wishes to adopt the standard for their future Nougat releases. It’s an odd deviation for sure, but we’ll leave the subjective interpretation to you. The second big change is the use of transparencies across the launcher , perhaps most notably in the homescreen dock found at the bottom which presents a white, transparent rectangle that also merges with the navigation bar. There is a purpose to this rectangle, as swiping up transforms it into the application drawer. Another transparency is found in the message one finds when clearing all recent apps, as illustrated. \nThat transparency seemingly mimics the transitions by other OEMs into an UI with more transparencies and “glass-like” behavior , something which is also apparent in Google’s choice of default wallpaper, as the dynamic “Aurora Time lapse” background has the kind of blurred aesthetic we’d expect from other OEMs. The launcher also presents a weather widget that expands into an app with playful colors and transitions, and the “Google” pill which expands into a Google search bar when pressed. Swiping to the left expectedly reveals the Google Now feed, and that about rounds up the Pixel’s launcher. One of the nicest aspects of the Pixel homescreen experience is behind the launcher, though, as the built-in wallpaper picker offers beautiful photography and much of it is dynamic , reacting not just to your swipes and actions but also the time and weather. \n\nWhat about the rest of the UI? There are no radical changes to the recents menu, but the notification panel sees an extra slot in the quick toggles after the first swipe. Here you will also find a hint of blue in the brightness slider, now replacing the stock Android green, and this color is the new accent color Google chose for the Pixel. Indeed, this accent color is found in various places across the UI including the camera, downloads and settings icons, the settings menus themselves (toggles and trims) and the new dialer also includes a vibrant and attractive blue theme. \nMoving onto the settings, the blue theme is present on the material iconography; however, there is a prominent new tab to accompany the traditional settings, which takes the user into customer support . Under this tab, one can initiate phone or chat customer support as well as quickly access help resources, tips & tricks, and an option to send feedback. I don’t personally believe that such a feature deserves an entire tab in the settings menu instead of a submenu or an app you can hide, and I don’t see people using the feature frequently enough to warrant such an important shortcut. But at the very least it’s impossible to miss, which isn’t a bad thing for this kind of feature. \nThere aren’t other changes worth noting as far as aesthetics go, and I haven’t found any issues with the stock experience. The features under the System UI tuner, however, haven’t been properly updated: the “Do Not Disturb” toggle for the volume menu doesn’t scale with DPI which makes it look oddly big and unaligned, and the slide gesture for multi-window doesn’t work. These are small nitpicks in what’s otherwise a stellar Android user experience that offers a close to Stock UI with just enough character to differentiate it from the Nexus experience . The move towards rounded features, transparencies and blur might not develop prominently like what we see on other OEMs’ modifications, and I believe they are done rather tastefully. The new launcher and wallpapers steal the show, with the latter being excellently accessible to the mainstream consumer given they are part of the default homescreen experience. Overall, the UI of the Pixel phones has been delightful, though I wish that there were more ways to customize it — early reports suggested accent theming, and a dark theme has not made it here either, but hopefully future releases will keep making the experience better as currently, theme engines and available themes don’t see very good compatibility with the system UI. \nSoftware Features & User Experience The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to come with Android 7.1 out of the box, which means that they bring the latest in terms of Android features. At the same time, however, the changes that Google made to the Pixel’s software (the aesthetic ones being documented above) also mean exclusive features and changes beyond mere cosmetic accents. Some of these “exclusive” features didn’t remain Pixel-only for very long thanks to the talents of the developer community. But nevertheless, it’s clear that Google tried to bring extra oomph to the Pixel’s software past what a regular Stock Android device running Nougat would offer. And it’s important to look at the Pixel’s resulting software UX because it signals the underlying intentions and direction that Google has planned for Android. So what’s new in Android 7.1 Nougat, and in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL? \nGoogle has leveraged its services to entice Pixel owners into using cloud storage, as Pixel owners get unlimited photo and video backup to Google Photos , and unlike the regular “unlimited” service, this one keeps the quality of the content pristine as Google otherwise compresses your pictures if they are above a specific threshold. This feature is complemented by Smart Storage which automatically removes already-backed pictures and videos from your device if they are old enough and if you are running out of space. Considering there is no storage option in between the Pixel and Pixel XL, this option might prove useful for those that opt for the 32GB variant. \nAnother quick feature related to photos and video transfer is the quick switch adapter which lets you restore your files from another Android or iPhone device. \nThe Pixels also bring “Moves”, which has its own menu within the settings. Under that menu you will find a few shortcuts that you can toggle, including “Jump to Camera” by double tapping the power button from any screen (like the Nexus 6P and 5X) and then “Flip Camera”, which allows you to switch in and out of selfie mode with a quick double-twist of the phone, similar to the Moto X’s lines’ camera jump shortcut. The fingerprint sensor of the Pixel XL also supports gestures, which the phone implements as a “Swipe for Notifications” shortcut , very much like what we’ve found on Honor devices like the 5X at the start of this year. This is a very welcome feature, and it works very well, but we would have hoped some extra functionality and/or customization; other devices with this feature include more options already, and Google could have pushed the envelope even further by allowing list scrolling or other nifty features. \nThere is no Dark Mode/Theme, and System UI tuner is almost as limited as always. There are power notification controls for setting an app’s notification importance (managing peek, sound, vibration, interruptions, etc), the Do Not Disturb shortcut for the settings menu, and then Status Bar controls. There is also a Multi-Window slide-up-recents gesture toggle, but it currently doesn’t work. Night mode is present and it’s as pleasant as ever, although not very smart and it can cause blinding flashes after it changes on you with no gradual adjustments (especially if it’s done automatically without you expecting it). \nMulti-window itself, however, is a great addition to Android and something I’ve personally waited for a long time. Given that the feature is debuting on Nougat, and that the Pixel is one of the few devices running official Nougat out of the box, I’ll give a brief description and thoughts. You can enter multi-window by long-pressing the recents menu, or by dragging a recents menu card to the top of the screen. The top of the screen will be reserved for that app and there is no way to quickly switch it to the bottom panel like on Samsung devices, but the screen persists while browsing through recents and, while it disappears when on a Launcher, it pops backup atop whatever app you then launch. If you launch an app through an app shortcut (such as Settings from the notification panel), it will go to the bottom irrespective of which screen you are focused on. The dividing bar has a hinge separating the two windows, but it can only be dragged to select heights, and the 3 levels conveniently allow you to display a full video on top while browsing an app on the bottom. Dragging the hinge all the way up or down will exit multi-window and focus on the app thatremains \nThe fact that the Pixel has a status bar and navigation keys that are not hidden means that a chunk of the usable screen space is unavailable to the user on multi-window — while this is something we are all used to most of the time, that extra space becomes more valuable when multi-tasking this way. Samsung’s implementation (which will dramatically change under Android Nougat, according to the Android compatibility document ) hid the status bar, and capacitive keys helped maximize usable space. The combination of a thick divider bar, status bar and navigation bar means the space is not maximized on the Pixel, and in reality all that used space is taken from one app’s interface. Luckily, the built-in DPI tuner of Android Nougat makes this less of an issue by shrinking the ratio of status/navigation bar to usable content, as well as increasing the content density within each application. The stock implementation is ultimately very fluid and useful and while features such as quick-swap between the top and bottom aren’t there, there is a lot I appreciate such as the ability to open two instances of certain apps like Chrome or the Settings menu. \nSo, what about Google’s flagship Pixel feature, Assistant? I’ve used Assistant throughout my review period, in great part because I actually use Search (and even Google Now) a lot for my day-to-day usage. Google Assistant is, quite clearly, in its early stages and we’ve noted as much in an editorial where we documented many of the oddities and inconsistencies we found when testing the service. There is clear feature disparity with not just Google’s current Search service, but also other Assistant versions such as what’s found on Google Home. That being said, Assistant comes to specifically tackle a problem that likely caused Google many headaches, and that’s the difficulty in marketing its services when they are disparately distributed in various parts of the UI. \nAssistant ultimately tries to marry three core services – Google Now, Google Search and Now on Tap – which are currently (outside the Pixel) found on three different areas of the user interface (the leftmost homescreen, the search bars across the phone, and the home button long press). By making Assistant accessible through the home button, and capable of all of what Google services can do, the simplification of Google’s useful services would come about in theory. \n\nThe reality is that, in its current form, Assistant’s lack of feature parity make it a less-suitable alternative to actual search bars – or even Google Now, which you can get back with a simple build.prop edit – and other Google services. For example, the Pixel can’t currently recognize Songs, and its information display is separate than that of Search. An example that I found in my usage is that asking Assistant for or about math-related formulas or concepts doesn’t return the relevant formula or description to rekindle my memory, but instead initiates a search. We also found inconsistencies when making shopping lists across Assistant, home, and Allo’s neutered Assistant. Above you can find an example, and it seems that the same happens with Google Home. Then there are the issues with inconsistent command recognition and other problems we’ve been used to for a while. \nDue to the feature disparity between Assistant and Search, the experience was ultimately not polished to the point where I could use Assistant exclusively\nThat being said, when it works, it works very well . Google Assistant is only a glimpse of what’s to come, I believe, and just like Google Now on Tap got better over time, so will this ambitious feature. The better aspects manage to shine through and suggest a really interesting future for voice assistants. For example, the ability to have Assistant recognize the subject of the next query tacitly rather than explicitly helps in making the service feel more conversational. Further expansions to context-awareness could push this even further, and currently it remains useful for fetching information, searching for images of more-specific objects (and of specific colors), or even launching music even if you don’t remember the specific song title. There is definitely a lot of impressive technology in Assistant, but I also know many of my colleagues have disabled the feature entirely given they didn’t see the additional benefit (also, you can go back to Google Now on Tap as well by removing the Pixel identifier from your build.prop). I have personally used it a great deal given I have been used to these types of services anyway, but Assistant was not solid enough to the point where I could use it exclusively. Part of that is due to the feature disparity, but the inability to input text for example hurts the more-technical search queries. Pro-tip: Assistant is great for finding items in game wikis, though. \nThere is also a live-support feature, which put us on the phone with a real-flesh assistant on the other side of the screen, but we only used this feature once. One last feature that you will only require about 12 times a year is the background updates system . Android 7.1 Nougat on the Pixel mirrors every partition of the device to form an A/B system similar to what’s found on Chromebooks. What this means is that updates can be downloaded and installed in the background, allowing you to then simply reboot into your updated state. This makes updates faster and safer (less prone to issues when updating), and you can actually see the activity that’s installing the update while you are using your phone (note that it will get slightly toasty). I’ve only experienced the system once through the November patch, but it was a quite short and satisfactory experience. \nPerformance The Google Pixel XL has Google flexing its performance muscle once more: while the Nexus 6P packed the still-flawed Snapdragon 810, it’s worth remembering the Nexus 5 ’s excellent Snapdragon 800 experience, and the subsequent Nexus 6 with the unsung masterpiece that was the Snapdragon 805. Qualcomm’s misstep with the 810 stood in contrast with the jewels of its past, but with the 820 the company has managed to put out a really compelling chipset that some manufacturers have implemented extremely well, such as OnePlus with the OnePlus 3 . \nOthers, however, have had less success with the processor as we’ve seen in our tests and reviews , but given this is Google’s chance at better control over both hardware and software, we’d expect this Snapdragon 821 to be very well-implemented. \nBefore we dig into the details, we must remind our readers that Google’s Snapdragon 821 is a variant clocked at 2.15GHz on the performance cluster, and 1.6GHz on the efficiency cluster — in essence, that means the Pixel XL can be expected to perform like a device running a regular Snapdragon 820 in most benchmarks. The same goes for the GPU, and we can confirm that our results show the Pixel XL very similarly to other devices in 2016 as far as theoretical performance goes. However, there are some difference when it comes to thermals and throttling which we’ll detail, although not as extensively as we did in our separate Pixel XL throttling and thermals analysis (so head there if you want the specifics). We’ll also compare the Snapdragon 821 with the recently-released Kirin 960 in the Huawei Mate 9, so that people get an idea of the processor’s relative standing at the very end of 2016. As a final note, the Snapdragon 821 in the Pixel XL might perform at the same level as the 820 in other devices released earlier this year, but Qualcomm told us there is a smaller advantage in battery savings at the same clockspeeds of around 5%, so ultimately the inclusion of this processor is not unjustified. \nCPU & System \nIn most aspects, the Pixel XL behaves just like the Snapdragon 820 devices we are used to. Luckily, this isn’t a bad thing, as the Snapdragon 820 is the most powerful chipset that is also widely-available , and those SoCs that are more powerful in specific aspects are also exclusive to Samsung and Huawei which offer user experiences particularly antithetic to stock Android. Perhaps most importantly, though, the Pixel XL not only scores higher than your average Snapdragon 820 device (if only slightly), but it also shows low score variance and very good thermal consistency when stressing the CPU. \nWhile we’ve seen some Snapdragon 820 devices like the HTC 10 begin throttling within 10 Geekbench 3 consecutive tests, the Pixel XL joins the ranks of the OnePlus 3 and other thermally-consistent devices by not having a visible downward trend in its scores over those first 10 tests. With the A73 cores being implemented in newer chipsets and with Qualcomm’s 10nm future , we’ll likely be either extending the runtime of our CPU stress test or redesigning it altogether; it was good enough at revealing throttling in the 810 era and in early 2016, but the commendable performance of recent chipsets means we need to find more stressful CPU endurance tests more akin to our GPU endurance suite.\nAs you can see, one year makes a tremendous difference for sustained performance.\nThe Pixel XL ultimately does a great job in both the synthetic benchmarks with more-abstract tests as well as those that try to mimic real-world performance using system resources. PCMark and Basemark OS II scores are very respectable, and the phone manages to hold its own in various sub-tests even against the latest A73-based Kirin 960 found in the Huawei Mate 9. It’s worth noting that the Pixel XL suffers the most in the memory tests, which bring down the overall score, but are not a CPU-centric burden. \nWhile Qualcomm’s CPU does perform worse on these tests than A72 and A73-based processors like the Kirin 950 to Kirin 960 as well as Samsung’s Exynos 8890 with M1 cores, the Kryo has ultimately shown it can achieve respectable performance while keeping a good thermal profile and minimize throttling. Sadly, the OEM’s application does seem to have a big impact on the results, but Google did a good job with the Pixel XL. \nGPU & Gaming \nThe Snapdragon 821 brings the famous Adreno 530 GPU, which offers excellent performance in the one realm Qualcomm still has not been beaten in. The Pixel XL is also a shining example of what the Adreno 530 can do, and with very good reason too — this is a phone that Google needs to both powerful and efficient for their Daydream VR platform, which will stress the GPU the most, but it’ll also make good use of the Snapdragon 820’s peripherals like the Hexagon DSP. This makes the Snapdragon 821 the best choice for graphics performance, and consequently gaming and VR as well. Our usual set of graphics-intensive benchmarks emphasize this like we’d expect. \nThe Pixel XL manages to slightly edge out Snapdragon 820 devices on GFXBench off-screen tests and 3DMark’s Slingshot ES3.1, which renders at 1440p and then scales the image to the device’s resolution (effectively making it resolution-independent). When factoring in resolution, 1080p Snapdragon 820 devices like the OnePlus 3 do perform better in terms of peak scores and also performance-over-time in on-screen tests other than 3DMark, but off-screen results are very similar and in-line with what we’d expect out of an efficient 821 device.\nThe Pixel XL is also very good at sustained performance when testing both 3DMark and GFXBench (30 iterations), showing lower differentials and less throttling than other Snapdragon 820 devices as we’ve analyzed in previous features, as well as less throttling than what we’ve found on the Exynos Note 7 . While the Pixel XL throttled significantly less than Galaxy devices on 3DMark, its final temperature was around the same, ranging from 43.1°C | 109.6°F to 43.6°C | 110.5°F. This isn’t unconventionally hot for these kinds of tests, but we must stress the fact that this is the temperature on the fingerprint scanner, and the rest of the body feels cooler to the touch. The sustained score is not as big of an improvement over last year’s Nexus 6P’s 3DMark performance over time, which actually did surprisingly well despite the Snapdragon 810 inside it. That being said, not all Snapdragon 810 devices were created equal, and the OnePlus 2 saw a drop in score of ~21%. \nWhen running GFXBench at 1440p, I did not find a consistent throttling pattern however; those who read our Snapdragon 820 vs Exynos 8890 Note 7 comparison might recall that the throttling pattern for those devices was extremely replicable throughout various tests, but even when controlling the starting conditions, the Pixel XL shows wildly-different results — I made sure to run this 30-minute test many, many times. Even if I couldn’t get a clear and satisfying pattern down, all of my results were above the average. Indeed, the Pixel XL actually beats the Snapdragon 820 Note 7 and the HTC 10, the former shedding up to half its score and the latter losing close to a third . The Pixel XL, by comparison, saw drops between 5% and 20%, with most results sitting around a 10% drop in performance at most. Temperatures never rose past 44°C | 111.2°F very much like in 3DMark. While some subtests in gaming-mimicking benchmarks weigh down the score compared to other chipsets with faster CPUs, graphics and rendering-related scores ultimately put the Pixel ahead. \n\n\nMoving on to gaming, this phone is simply one of the best options currently available. Framerates in games like Asphalt Extreme can come close to sustaining the 30FPS mark with slight variations in certain scenes (and the obligatory drop when reloading a level, which should be ignored). Dead Trigger 2 and GTA San Andreas also show excellent performance that can be sustained for 15 to 20 minutes with no significant throttling, and thermals remain tame at a maximum of 43°C | 109.4°F located in the fingerprint scanner. (Special thanks to Gamebench for providing us with a solution to Gamebench not being able to run on the Pixel XL, thus enabling us to test!) \nOverall, the Pixel XL offers excellent gaming performance, and even if the device does go over 40°C | 104°F (the point at which I consider the heat noticeable), having the hottest point on the fingerprint scanner means you are unlikely to touch the hottest point. However, the phone does suffer from uneven heat distribution that is top-heavy, so very long gaming sessions could turn uncomfortable. \nReal-World Performance The Nexus devices held a tradition of being some if not the fastest devices implementing their respective chipsets, and even the Nexus 6P was able to deliver outstanding performance despite its Snapdragon 810 processor ( and all the issues that implied ). With the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, you’d think that the company that created Android being in control of the hardware would be able to deliver an outstanding experience, one worthy of “vertical integration” levels of praise that Apple has been showered with for years. I’m happy to report that, for the most part, that is the case indeed: the Pixel XL is a fast and smooth device in its operation, but surprisingly enough, it falls a bit short in a few areas that ultimately prevent it from claiming the performance crown in my eyes. \nBeginning with app opening speeds, the Pixel XL is an extremely snappy phone . While changes to Android Nougat and 7.1 squashed our chances of looking at objective measurements through Discomark , we methodically tested app opening speeds in comparison to other high-end flagships and found the Pixel XL was as good as other 820 devices. We’ve confirmed it to be slightly faster than our LG V20 and as fast as the OnePlus 3 running Oxygen 3.2.6, and the overall app-opening speed is fast enough that its boost is noticeable to the naked eye, although devices like the Exynos Note 7 are likely still faster (but take this with a grain of salt as we are inferring it from our Discomark data and experience ) at opening apps. Another great part about the Pixel XL’s performance is hot app opening speeds, as the phone is able to swiftly fetch apps from memory with great responsiveness. Operating the navigation keys of back and home, too, show no delays and it can make for some impressively-fluid juggling of apps and home screens. Keep in mind the clips above bear the burden of the screen recorder software as well. \nNow, while the resulting experience described above is very good, there are two caveats that influence what we’ve observed. First, the RAM management of the Pixel XL is below what we’d consider to be the average for a 4GB RAM device. The device can hold over 14 small applications, like we’d expect, but throwing games into the mix quickly kicks old apps out of memory (for example, in the clip above, it could hold 3 out of the 5 games at once). One of the most frustrating consequences that stems from it is the occasional launcher redraw , which we wouldn’t expect out of such hardware in hands of Google. As for the app opening speeds, it’s worth noting that the effective responsiveness is magnified by Android 7.1 due to its improvements to input latency. The way Google achieved this (as described to us by Chet Haase at the BABBQ 2016) is by changing the order and priority of registering and rendering inputs and frames, which results in up to 40% reduced latency (although, this varies depending on the rendering cycle and the time it takes to render a particular frame before being queued for display). This improvement is tangible, and it affects everything from opening apps to starting in-app activities and scrolling through lists. We were not able to measure the precise input latency nor the roundabout lag as our WALT would not get consistent results, but needless to say the improvements are there, and they are tangible. \nWhen it comes to fluidity and framerate, the Pixel XL is stunningly smooth barring some discrete exceptions. While we noticed dropped frames in the Pixel Launcher that we managed to install onto non-Pixel devices ahead of release, we really didn’t expect those dropped frames to show up in the final product. Alas, they did, and swiping to the left-most screen visibly stutters rather frequently — not as bad TouchWiz’s flipboard integration, but it is not as smooth as we’d expect and even not as smooth as the Google Now launcher. Other than that, scrolling through the interface and lists is very smooth, and jumps in activities rarely feature choppy transitions, even in resource-heavy applications. This isn’t to say that in-app performance is entirely consistent: we did notice some odd slowdowns on YouTube, Hangouts, and Chrome, but those faults could be attributed to these particular Google app themselves. \nThroughout one of our three review weeks, we saw particularly unstable performance on YouTube, and we’d often meet app force closes. This is hardly what we’d expect out of a Google phone, but in the Pixel’s defense, the fault lies in with the apps — Google apps, nonetheless. \nUltimately, though, the Pixel XL is an excellent phone when it comes to performance and I’d say that in terms of responsiveness , it is not only Android’s best performer, but also as close a competitor to the iPhone as we’ll get this year. While responsiveness is a combination of touch latency (which was thoroughly improved with the Pixel’s software) and actual speed, the latter is also excellent on the Pixel XL, with better app opening times than most Snapdragon 820 devices. That said, the aspects that bring down the experience a couple of notches are bad enough to be both noticeable in real-world use, and replicable without much trouble: the occasional framedrops in select areas of the UI are bad enough, but having a consistent stutter on the leftmost panel is particularly puzzling. Likewise, having occasional launcher redraws on a 4GB device with software and hardware in Google’s control is a tad disconcerting. I strongly believe that the benefits outshine the negatives here, though, and it’s also worth noting that the Pixel XL is pushing a 1440p display, meaning that regular Pixel owners will see a small performance improvement in actions related to graphics rendering. Overall, this device is a joy to operate. \nCamera Written by Daniel Marchena \nPrior Google phones have been lackluster in the camera department, in particular up until the Nexus 6P, and usually behind the curve that other flagships set. However, when factoring the lower cost of a Google Nexus phone in comparison to the competition, many of those issues could be written off. With Google targeting a considerably higher price bracket than last year and going toe-to-toe with some of the best hardware in the industry they needed to step their game up considerably. \nSo when Google announced the new Pixel phones as being the highest-rated smartphone cameras ever from DXOMark it was both a point of excitement and a cause for caution. So did Google finally put out a phone that has a class leading camera, or is it relegated to the “it’s a great phone, but if the camera is important then look elsewhere” stereotype of old? In short, it is almost everything Google said it was plus some, but it is not without drawbacks. Do consider that the Pixel packs an impressive Sony IMX378 sensor which we’ve detailed in a previous in-depth article , and although it does not have OIS, its EIS for video is a work of wonder which we’ll look at below. The first step for any camera, however, is the experience. \nCarrying the “double tap power” feature from Nexus phones and AOSP, the Pixel camera is one of the easiest to access, although the delay is a little short and you may find yourself turning on and off the screen instead of accessing the camera. Moving on to the actual application experience, Google has adjusted the camera app a few times in recent years but some core elements remain the same. It is a sparse interface that serves as an advantage and disadvantage. On top of the screen lays a series of toggles for various camera options. The traditional timer and flash options are present but there are a few more toggles power users will love. One of my personal favorites is the adjustable 3 way grid system that includes 3×3, 4×4 and the Golden ratio, ensuring you can frame your shot however you want. \nAlso present is a white balance selector that sadly leaves out the ability to set it manually. There is also the HDR toggle which we will discuss later. The Pixel ships with its camera in a 4:3 ratio for the maximum of 12.3MP which leaves blank space on the right for your shutter control, camera switcher and the ability to view prior photos. A swipe off the left screen brings in the options for Slow Motion, Panorama, Photo Sphere, Lens Blur and your settings menu. Finally, swiping to side puts you into video mode. While it would be nice to have the record button on the main screen, it is difficult to do with a native 4:3 sensor since hitting record crops the image to 16×9 and may cause you to lose your original framing. I have found that swiping the screen with little to no indication that is an option can leave users confused, including my wife. \nInside the settings menu are the basics such as adjusting the front and rear camera resolutions for both video and photos, burst settings panorama controls and video stabilization. Here is where I have a bone to pick with Google. Things like FPS controls that should be in this menu as well as the OSD but are not, as should be further controls for things like high frame rate options and so on. It is understood that Google was going for a more simple approach, but most stand alone camera have settings found through options menu and those options available for quick toggling through the OSD. It is a small thing to pick on, but it can affect day to day usage. Generally you will find yourself toggling through menus more often than you should trying to find where a specific option might be located at. \nA second issue that the Google Camera has is the lacking of full manual controls for things like ISO, shutter speed and focus and RAW image capture. It has been a few years since the Camera API2, which allowed many of these things natively, hit the scene so to see Google still fail to implement them is annoying. It is clear that Google set out to target the the iPhone instead of a more powerful application like the one that Samsung provides which clearly is ahead of both in terms of form and function. \nThe lack of settings and adjustments is clear indication that Google wants you to go full auto with your photography and leave the settings to the phone. The shocking part is how well this actually works . The simple fact is that the Pixel consistently out performed my expectations. It does not get any easier than pointing and shooting with the Pixel. Due to the HDR+ Auto enhancements you can even point the camera directly into the sun and still capture the colors and details in grass and foliage, and what you see in the viewfinder is ultimately misleading due to how well it handles capturing detail from differently-lighted scenes. \nThe exposure difference between the viewfinder and an HDR+ photo.\nIn bright lighting, low lighting and anywhere in between the Pixel delivers above average photo quality despite its disadvantages on paper such as the lack of OIS and its F2.0 aperture, but Google has made tremendous leaps forward; they have made good use of the Snapdragon 821 and the Hexagon DSP in particular and unlike with the Nexus 6P, you can queue many pictures for processing with no delay in the actual UX. This is, in part, because the Pixel is constantly recording the data and the pressing the capture button pulls the last few frames the phone had already recorded for the sampling — do keep in mind that when processing an image, it cannot be shared or otherwise manipulated, and the image processing itself takes a fair few seconds so taking pictures and sharing them right away is slower than on other phones. \nVideo is also surprisingly excellent, although it does not appear to benefit from the sort of HDR video support like we have seen on this years Galaxy phones, and this is despite the sensor’s enhanced capabilities for 4k 60 Hz HDR video (but there are bottlenecks to be considered outside the ideal world). This can cause some of the highlights to be washed out during video and keeps it more or less in line with the competition. Personally a sticking point for me this year has been the forgoing of optical image stabilization for electronic image stabilization. While Google’s accomplishments in this area are impressive to say the least , even the best electronic stabilization is no match for optically stabilized video. Google’s algorithm delivers a floating “reactive” approach to stabilized video instead of the “active” stabilization that OIS brings. At its extremes you can get a “jerking” motion while panning the camera that can be unpleasant.. Google does provide the option to turn this setting off, but then you are left with no sort of stabilization which is simply unacceptable on a phone that carries this sort of price tag. \nThe benefit though is that the Pixel is one of the only phones out this year without a camera bump , if the omission of OIS is the cause of this we don’t know, but it is a case of “pick your poison”. Personally, I will deal with the bump in every case if that meant my photos and videos would benefit from it. All of that being said though, the electronic stabilization is very impressive and most users will not notice any of the side effects it bringsand generally very happy with its performance. It’s impressive enough to fool most people into believing there is some strong hardware influence at play, and the gyro-based solution is ultimately very serviceable even if a bit unnatural. \nAs I mentioned earlier, if you are looking for a camera experience where you can literally point and shoot and get the shot, the Pixel is likely the best phone on the market today. But that does not mean that the camera itself is above the competition, or even toe-to-toe with camera leaders in specific areas. The camera sensor that the Pixel uses is a very close relative to the 6P sensor boasting only PDAF over its older sibling (on paper). While Phase Detect Autofocus is far better than laser or contrast, it is not the dual pixel technology Samsung was using this year, or like that of the Sony IMX398 sensor the OPPO R9 uses which also has that advantage. Further, the Pixel is one of the only flagships this year to ship without optical image stabilization. Between the enhanced EIS and improved HDR+ Auto, Google argues that OIS is not needed… and I’d argue that for the money it should be there to further improve an already-stellar experience. In short and leaving price aside, Google’s camera is now one of the best for people who just want to capture a great moment in time and without fidgeting , and their improvements over the past two years in this department are more than commendable. \nDisplay The Pixel XL brings a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 1440p, currently the perfect pixel density for both VR and a large phone screen. Given that Google has had full control over the Pixel XL’s design, we see their choice of display technology as a bit of an endorsement, and it makes sense given the tremendous strides AMOLED has made in the past few years as well as its screen properties (like low persistence, excellent contrast) which also make VR more enjoyable. The screen is flanked by an extremely subtle curvature along the edges, as well as thick bezels. One last physical characteristic worth mentioning is the absolutely minimal black border around the actual display , which makes the white and blue variants more attractive to the eye. Now that we’ve gone over the superficial aspects, how does it actually perform? \n\nStarting with brightness, the Pixel XL caps at around 400 Nits, and ultimately performs very similarly to the OnePlus 3 and other AMOLED devices in regular usage. The Pixel XL is not above average in this regard, and I’ve found that its brightness output is actually very underwhelming under direct sunlight . This problem is further amplified by the fact that the Pixel XL does not come with a sunlight-boosting mode or feature built into its adaptive brightness, like other AMOLED devices do. Not having that extra boost to maximum brightness (which came at the cost of some color distortion) makes it difficult to look at media or images on sunny days, and I especially missed the brightness boost while taking pictures out and about; that being said, AMOLED’s excellent contrast makes it so that reading isn’t too much of a problem should the text clearly stand out anyway. \n\nIt’s worth mentioning that not all AMOLED devices share the same features, but the similarly-bright OnePlus 3 has a dual-polarizing layer that ultimately makes sunlight legibility slightly better. Luckily, if you are into rooting your device, custom Kernels, Xposed modules and even root apps will most certainly let you get some extra lumens out of your Pixel XL. As for adaptive brightness, I found it to be very serviceable, and the display can actually reach further minimums when the setting is toggled — this allows the Pixel XL to actually get dimmer than the OnePlus 3, for example, but otherwise it doesn’t. \n\nThe whitepoint of the Pixel XL is on the colder side on the regular display mode, and slightly greenish when toggling sRGB. When it comes to greyscale, the Pixel XL actually doesn’t look to be as accurate as other AMOLED devices like Google’s own Nexus 6P, and this is only made worse when switching to the sRGB color profile. I haven’t found those issues to negatively affect my media consumption experience, though, and I only noticed the difference when comparing special templates side by side against more accurate devices. There is also no odd banding or other unexpected issues, either. The AMOLED display’s perfect blacks also make for a much more enjoyable media experience in my opinion, and even with an inaccurate greyscale AMOLED has come a long way from the days of impossible horror-movie watching and purple ghosting (an issue still noticeable on some AMOLED displays, like the OnePlus 3’s). Also (and as expected), the Pixel XL also displays excellent viewing angles with no color distortion . \nMoving on to color, the Pixel XL targets the NTSC color space which is a poor choice for an Android device. As we’ve explained in an in-depth article, Android has no system-level color management, which means that the information is sentto the display without accounting for the color space of the source and the color space chosen by the OEM. Most of the content you’ll consume is sRGB, and NTSC is a larger color gamut, so the system sends relatively untagged color data to the display, ultimately conforming them to its standard and displaying them inaccurately. Luckily and not unlike the Nexus 6P before it, the Pixel XL offers an sRGB mode to more-accurately represent your content and media like it was intended. Finally, keep in mind that Google targeted NTSC by design and they did not aim for color accuracy with the Pixel XL in its default state anyway; while Google knows how to offer a color-accurate device like the Nexus 5, it most certainly knows that people don’t necessarily like the admittedly-tamer sRGB mode and accurate calibration. \n\nWith that in mind, we can look at color: reds are bright and punchy, green is extremely vibrant (and the most inaccurate color), and blues are deep. The screen ultimately stands out quite a lot, but it is also very color-inaccurate (again, by design). I did enjoy the multimedia experience on the default screen mode, though, and I presume most users will find it to be very good as well. For those that want accurate color rendering, the sRGB mode does a pretty good job at that. That being said, whites become oddly greener and the greyscale accuracy becomes slightly less accurate. \nThat covers most of my findings, but I want to reiterate a few points as well: the color accuracy debacle does not mean you will be unable to enjoy this display ; quite the opposite, I am sure Google’s research indicates that this was a more pleasant configuration for the mainstream public, and we regularly see popular smartphones with leading screen technology ship with inaccurate calibrations and odd color space targets as the default (like LG and DCI-P3). The fact that this screen does not skimp on pixel density is good for Google’s Daydream VR push but also for media consumption, as the chroma resolution of a Pentile AMOLED display is lower due to its uneven number of subpixels, and can be effectively halved under certain conditions. As a final note, I’d like to say that the experience has been quite nice and the only shortcoming I was made conscious off multiple times throughout my usage is sunlight legibility, as I wish Google would have either implemented an brightness-boost feature or made the screen less reflective some other way. \nBattery Life & Charging The Pixel XL made no sacrifices to endurance in exchange for thinness, as the 8.5mm-thick device packs a substantial 3,450mAh battery. Given the phone has a 1440p screen, it makes sense that such capacity (15% more than the “standard” of 3,000mAh) was their choice — the same target they hit with the Nexus 6P, which had a more power-hungry processor as well. So with a respectable battery size, a Snapdragon 821 and a revamped Doze courtesy of Nougat, one would expect the device to fare quite well in both synthetic tests and in the real-world. Luckily, reality meets expectation with the Pixel XL, but it doesn’t shatter them. The Pixel XL makes good use of its battery capacity and leverages its circumventing hardware to ultimately output rather efficient longevity. Our first sign of this can be observed with PCMark: \n\nPixe XL PCMark 2.0 Work Battery Life Min. Brightness 9 h 54 m Med. Brightness 7 h 12 m Max Brightness 5 h 37 m PCMark on the Pixel XL shows an above-average level of efficiency, with over 7 hour runs at medium brightness, putting it relatively close to the Mate 9 in terms of minutes per mAh considering the latter packs a bleeding-edge CPU and a larger battery. Performance is consistent throughout, which is expected out of a relatively light benchmark meant to emulate real-world usage, and internal temperature doesn’t peak past 30°C | 86°F. The rate of drain also looks healthy and linear, and the deltas between brightness are are near identical at around 2 hours and 30 minutes, with the test at maximum brightness being a bit short of halving the runtime of the minimum brightness run. While PCMark is a nice representation of real-world performance, do keep in mind that it doesn’t drain battery like real-world usage actually would given the digitizer and radios are not doing their share of drain the same way. As such, real-world results are typically lower than what we observe on these cyclical benchmarks, and the same is true for the Pixel XL. \nReal-world usage across our team has brought us results ranging from slightly above-average to excellent. I personally see an average of 4.5 to 5 hours of screen-on time with my mixed usage of a lot of Hangouts and Gmail, plenty of Chrome for work and play, Google Docs and Sheets, an hour or two of YouTube (some with screen off), a few minutes of GPS and calls and about an hour of screen-off podcasts. This is above the average for the phones I personally test, but at the same time it is a bit disappointing considering the battery capacity on it opposed to that of devices on which I’ve gotten close results (OnePlus 3) or substantially better (Exynos Note 7) . Other team members have gotten much better battery life than I have, though, with Daniel Marchena getting above-average endurance and Eric Hulse getting what he calls “the best battery life he has ever gotten [on Android phones]”. Above you can find some examples of my experience. \nWhen it comes to idle drain, the Pixel XL has been very good to all of us with below 1 percent drain per hour while idling during the day on WiFi, and even less than that – below half a percent per hour – while dozing overnight. LTE drain doubles up to 2% idle drain and even more when moving out and about and receiving notifications. Finally, dozing on WiFi with no SIM provided an neat lack of drain over more than 6 hours of idling despite notifications coming in. It must be noted that we all use Hangouts and the full suite of Google Services on our devices, so seeing this kind of idle drain is not very surprising. Knowing that you can forego charging your device overnight with a respectable amount of battery left, and wake up a couple of percentages under, is a satisfying feeling that few phones have nailed like the Pixel and Pixel XL did for us. \nCharging on the Pixel and Pixel XL does not use a proprietary solution nor Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0, despite the device having the necessary components. Google opted for the USB Type C spec-compliant USB Power Delivery, with the Pixel XL charger itself listing 5V/3A and 9V/2A (for 18W, although the regular Pixel only supports 16W while both pack the same charger). We tested the actual charge times as well as the dynamic current and battery temperature, and actually found the USB-PD solution in the Pixel XL to fall flat in every way (we’ll have an extensive comparison on this very shortly) — the device got warmer and it ultimately charged slower than Quick Charge 3.0, Huawei’s SuperCharge and OnePlus’ Dash Charge. Charging the device while running a loop of PCMark, a light benchmark we used to mimic real-world usage to some extent, made the differentials even more catastrophic, with the average current being only 2.1A as opposed to Dash Charge’s 2.9A, and the Pixel also displayed some slight thermal throttled and heated up to 40°C | 104°F on average throughout the charge, compared to 35°C | 95°F for the OnePlus 3. \nLuckily, the Pixel XL’s battery life was good enough to make the slow charging not be much of a problem, but we do wish that Google offered better power-saving options or power profiles, something which has gotten very popular and even effective on OEM skins nowadays. Stock Android’s battery saver feature is serviceable, though we still don’t understand why Google insists on turning the navigation and status bar orange when toggled — if anything, it should force them to stay black due to AMOLED battery savings. That’s a miniscule nitpick, though. In the end, the Pixel XL offers strong battery life with clear capacity for greatness, both due to its battery size but also its high-end hardware. It’s not a remarkably power-efficient phone even if Doze has been very good to us, but I am sure that with updates and customization through the power of root access, most dedicated customers will be getting a decent day and half of usage (or more) of strong usage out of the Pixel XL. \nAudio Audio is admittedly a weak point for the Pixel XL: there is a single speaker left of the USB Type C, a clear step back from the stereo speaker setup of the Nexus 6P. The Pixel XL’s monospeaker is also positioned in a spot that makes it extremely easy to cover when holding the device in landscape mode, unlike some devices that are harder to muffle even when accidentally covering them in part. The speaker sound itself is actually pretty loud for a monospeaker, and the clarity is sustained even at higher levels. While it a speaker that you can easily drive for the occasional YouTube video, it’s very hard to get excited about it especially when recalling that the Nexus 6P offered one of the best speaker setups, and when considering the price of this device. If anything, I’d say it’s one of the worst speakers of any device in the $700+ range. \nHeadphone audio on the Pixel XL is not quite as mediocre as it supports Qualcomm’s Aqstic audio codec. For 32-bit quality, headphone output sounds fine on regular earbuds and cheaper headphones. If you are an audio enthusiast and own high-quality headphones, though, the Pixel XL will likely disappoint you — it doesn’t seem to be in the league of the HTC 10 or the LG V20 , the former also making use of the Aqstic audio codec and the latter featuring a quad-DAC for those ultra-premium headphones. The Pixel XL also doesn’t have any sound profiles that you can choose from or customize, making it harder to adjust or compensate headphone biases for better control over your listening experience (but to be fair, neither does the audiophile-targeting LG V20). While it’s not a device suitable for those looking for rich headphone audio, those consumers that care more about a decent experience with their humble earbuds will find no issues with the Pixel XL. \nAs for the device’s microphones, I’ve had no issues with calls over the phone, VOIP or while videochatting. Interlocutors had no trouble hearing me nor did I have trouble hearing them through the top earpiece, which can get plenty loud (though not loud or clear enough for the inevitable stereo sound mod, if you ask me). I’ve had experiences with slight feedback on Nexus devices (namely the 6, and to a much lesser extent, the 6P), but there is no such issue on the Pixel XL — it’s a very clear and satisfying phone for audio and video (Duo?) calls. \nFuture Proofing and Development For the longest time, we believed the Pixel phones were actually going to be Nexus devices — from the fish codenames to the early rumors of HTC’s involvement, all the information we had pointed towards an HTC Nexus device. When the Pixel was revealed to be a phone “Made by Google” and designed to showcase Google’s ecosystem and services, some people still held to the idea of the Pixel as a developer-friendly phone. We reported soon before release that the Pixel would have difficulties with root due to changes to Android 7.1 that Google would opt to enable, and we were correct. Chainfire managed to claim victory anyway , but root on the Pixel phones comes with new constraints, and it’s worth noting it wasn’t until this very week that we received both TWRP to kickstart development and the proliferation of custom ROMs, as well as a TWRP-compatible root method for the Pixel and Pixel XL. \nOne thing we can assess at this moment in time is that the Pixel and Pixel XL are not picking up the mantle of the Nexus line, as they don’t look to be as developer-friendly as the Nexus phones were. With SafetyNet increasingly cracking down on modifications by now locking open-bootloader devices out of many key services, we can infer Google is not to keen on their services coexisting on our customized platforms. And with the Pixel phones being Google’s maximum exponent of what their services can offer, we’d expect that philosophy to carry over to this device. \nWhile the development of these devices is uncertain, there already many clever mods to enhance the user experience by enabling old features, disabling unwanted annoyances, or simply improving day-to-day operation and longevity through custom kernels. We see a modest amount of activity on the Pixel and Pixel XL forums, but it might be wise not to expect the level of openness and customization, nor the level of mod and ROM variety, that the Nexus devices did. We also reached out to a few prominent figures in our community to hear their thoughts on the Pixel and Pixel XL, which we’ll quote below: \nPulser G2 : It’s worth keeping in mind what Google is trying to do with the Pixel range. This is Google’s attempt at being the “iPhone” of Android phones. That means the good points of a tightly engineered product, including custom hardware and software design and integration, as well as the bad – which for many will be Google’s attempts at a more controlled experience. It is worth keeping in mind that Google wants to make a phone that will tempt the average smartphone user to switch – the goal of the Pixel isn’t necessarily to be developer friendly, or even at a price-point that will interest developers. That was the goal of the Nexus range. The Pixel is first and foremost about showcasing the full Google experience. If that’s not for you, then the Pixel is probably not the phone for you. If you live and breath everything Google, then the Pixel will probably be worth considering. Remember that until recently, many people have said iOS was the best platform for using Google Services. If Google wants to change that, this is the first step on a long road towards bringing their platform and Android apps up to speed` \nBumblebee: If the price were lower, they would sell more to developers. Depending on the type of developer asked you will likely see 2 main assessments: \n1) APP Devs : Google in the passed used the “Nexus” line of phones to get the latest version of android to the app devs on some standard HW , this was the main test bed when app devs would move forward in API versions. The pixel (being priced where it is) puts it out of reach of some the indie devs (unlike the N5X where most devs own them), that coupled with 7.1 being time exclusive to the pixel (you cant assume the dev previews on the 5X / 6P are good development targets) will be alienating some the indie devs \n2) Hacker / ROM Devs : Instead of releasing an “PURE GOOGLE” Nexus phone the pixel has been made with some pixel exclusive features, this is another step in the long line of google removing features from AOSP (started with abandoning apps like music / browser and moving these to google apps). From a rom developer point of view pixel is just another (expensive) OEM phone and 7.1 can be built for other devices (see Sony Xperia AOSP) . One other sticking point for the pixel devices is the new updater process that remove the separate boot / recovery image (instead having 1 image to chainload from /system) this will cause some teething pains for the rom building / rooting community ranging from systemless root and recovery projects. \nNicolas Chum: Development happens based on the rate of accessibility. How do you cater to “developers” attracts real developers much differently. For example, “developers”, or self-claimed “developers” without much proven work would like the Pixel because it looks good, but real developers who truly develop would question HOW it would benefit their development – would what they develop ON the Pixel differ from developing FROM another device running it’s exclusive software? \nTo add on to that, the price is not accessible to the common user, so why would we develop Pixel exclusive features on a device that not many people have? \nAs for future-proofing, the device itself packs extremely-capable hardware and will be getting the same – or even better – treatment when it comes to software updates straight from Google. If anything, the Pixel phones have priority over the Nexus line as indicated by the fact that they shipped with 7.1 while Nexus devices merely received a preview at the time of writing. You can expect at least two years of Android updates for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, and also an extra year of security patches. The hardware itself nicely compliments the future-proofing of this device given many of the transitions we’ve seen in the past two years (64-bit, USB Type C) have already been established, and the Pixel and Pixel XL already ship with the ability to make use of Google Assistant and Daydream VR, both of which we’ll likely be seeing a lot more of in the next few years. \nConclusion Google’s Pixel XL represents the brink of a new era for Android smartphones — we are less than a year away from Google’s ambitious “Andromeda” project , and we are also over a year past the last Nexus release. I couldn’t help but compare the Pixel XL with the Nexus 6P throughout this review, in part because of the indirect inheritance, and in part because the Nexus 6P was one of my favorite phones of all time . Finally, while this phone is proudly advertised as “made by Google”, there are good reasons to believe this might be undue hyperbole on Google’s part . This doesn’t really make much of a difference to the end consumer, but it also ties in with the possibility that the Pixel XL was made in about nine months. I believe that last bit should be taken into account when analyzing the Pixel as a product, and the Pixel brand as a flagship smartphone series. Lastly, there’s one last thing that I have attempted to reduce mentions of throughout the review, and that’s the price. \nStarting at $770 for the 32GB Pixel XL, this device sits at the very high-end of the premium market. Choosing a storage upgrade further adds to the price, for a total of $870… after taxes, you are looking at over $900 dollars, and I personally ended up paying more than what I paid for the Galaxy Note 7 , a device that was thoroughly-criticized and picked apart by the media due to its price. While the Pixel brand does start at $650 for the regular size Pixel with 32GB of storage, Google is not offering an “in-between” storage option for the Pixels; I happen to believe, for example, that 32GB is too little storage, but I’ve also never used close to 128GB. Not having the increasingly-common 64GB configuration means users are stuck choosing between two extremes, and I am doubtful either gives the average consumer the most effectiveness for their buck. \nThe Pixel phones are not fighting against cheaper phones, however. I don’t believe that affordable flagships compete for customers with the Pixel outside enthusiast circles, and Google’s commitment to advertising and forging partnerships (beginning with Verizon) will likely make the Pixel brand more successful than a large portion of Android smartphones. The question is whether that success and recognition is actually deserved, and whether the Pixel phones can offer enough not only to satisfy consumers, but also lay the foundations for future Google phones. This and Google’s push for Assistant – essentially a unification and simplification of disparate Google services, all handled through one intuitive interface – across an ecosystem of Google products will define the first generation Pixel’s future and the trajectory of Google’s upcoming hardware. How does the Pixel XL fare in this regard, and what has it managed to achieve? \n\nAfter over three weeks with the Pixel XL, and after using a variety of tools to measure and quantify many results of Google’s efforts, I can safely say the Pixel XL is an excellent smartphone that I’d have no qualms recommending to any friend or relative in need of a new phone. The experience is ultimately polished bar a few minor inconsistencies, and while I expected more minute attention to detail from Google’s personal incursion into the smartphone market, I think that as a whole the Pixel XL is an excellent product able to capture the mainstream. But as much as I see the Pixel XL as a great smartphone with no real compromises, I also don’t see it as a phone that’s more than the sum of its parts. In my opinion, the design is uninspiring, the exclusive feature set is not particularly strong at the moment, and the hardware ultimately feels extremely safe. If anything, it feels like the Pixel it’s too expensive for its own good. Despite its few unique traits, I never felt like I was using “ a Pixel” phone, but rather just a more-polished Android smartphone, which I’d welcome any day. \nThe Pixel XL is excellent at core smartphone functions, and for that I commend it: it’s one of the most responsive devices I’ve tested, and it feels snappy in almost every situation. Fluidity is consistent enough in most scenarios, although the occasional stutter stands out due to the device’s otherwise-stellar fluidity. The camera of this phone is also one of the most satisfying ones I’ve ever used, even if and when it doesn’t offer the best results. That video stabilization, for example, completely redefined my expectations of what EIS is capable of, and I must also commend Google for their thoughtful and ultimately pleasant modifications to Stock Android on the device. None of this shatters smartphone paradigms, but the Pixel XL is a smartphone for the day-to-day, and it is perfect for the person that cares more about Android apps than they do about Android itself — the people who want to use the phone without thinking about customization or worrying about troubleshooting. It’s a no-bullsh*t smartphone, for people that want a no-frills experience. \nAnd this leads us to the Pixel’s future on XDA and our community; from the start we knew that the Pixel would have issues with root and possibly custom recoveries; we now have those tools. As of yet, the future for the Pixel’s future looks to be rather uncertain, and that alone is a worrying matter for those expecting a continuation of the Nexus line. The truth is that the Pixel is no Nexus, and I believe that people will have that very clear by the next release cycle. Developers we’ve reached out to cite the price and, in part, Google’s new approach to Android as reasons why the Pixel is not as appealing as preceding fish-codename devices. I will be keeping an eye on the Pixel’s development future and whatever mods and ROMs become available, and I’ll be reporting back every now and then to let our readers know our thoughts. \nTo summarize, the Pixel XL is an excellent phone that I’ve enjoyed using throughout my review period; it’s also a phone that I’ll enjoy keeping tabs on in order to see where development takes its potential user experience. I don’t believe it’s more than the sum of its parts, but it doesn’t need to be — with a great camera, a nice screen, smooth performance and above-average battery life, it’s a phone I can recommend to anyone looking for a new phone that won’t make them want to pull their hair out. In that regard, I think Google’s Pixels are some of the most mainstream-friendly smartphones out there as well. But there are many decisions that make me question Google’s efforts on this first, foundational release… The glass accent is a smudge and scratch magnet, the construction of our devices hasn’t been as precise as we’d expect, and the exclusive offerings are neither truly exclusive nor have they hit their true potential. \nI see the Pixel XL as a perfect investment into a new Google ecosystem, though, and thus also a device that’s exciting for tech enthusiasts. It might not be the best phone for customization and optimization, but knowing that Google will have its back for a few years in terms of updates is comforting. I hope that Google does things differently for the second release, and they’ve reportedly already started work on the upcoming Pixels — this is great, because it’d mean they’d have the experience of the first device and more production time this Pixel had, if reports are to be believed. The Pixel XL is a great consumer smartphone, but not the Google flagship I expected. Nevertheless, it sets the foundations for something bigger, and as Google ecosystem matures, the Pixel and its Assistant will get wiser with it. \nIf you’ve made it this far, we thank you!

      "title": "As Trump rises, so do some hands waving Confederate battle flags",
      "text": " Google+\nBy Richard Fausset New York Times November 19, 2016\nFor a brief moment, after a white supremacist carried out a massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., it seemed as though the Confederate battle flag, that most divisive of symbols, might soon be on its way out of the US political arena.\nBut now that explosive and complicated vestige of the Old South is back, in a new — and, to some Americans, newly disturbing — context. During President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, followers drawn to his rallies occasionally displayed the flag and other Confederate iconography. Since the election, his supporters and others have displayed the flag as a kind of rejoinder to anti-Trump protesters in places such as Durango, Colo.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Hampton, Va.; Fort Worth, Texas; and Traverse City, Mich.\nAdvertisement\nOn Election Day in Silverton, Ore., the flag appeared at a high school Trump rally, where students reportedly told Hispanic classmates, “Pack your bags, you’re leaving tomorrow.” The day after, at Kenyon College in Ohio, the college’s president, Sean M. Decatur, spoke to a worried campus, describing his discomfort at seeing Confederate flags on display in the nearby city of Mount Vernon.\nDorothy Robinson, 37, said that seeing the battle flag flying at a traditional postelection unity parade in her hometown, Georgetown, Del., felt “like someone had punched me in the gut.”\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Those who have publicly embraced the flag are a small minority of the more than 60 million Americans who voted for Trump in the Nov. 8 election.\nBut these incidents, and hundreds of reports of insults and threats directed at minorities and others, are forcing Americans to confront vexing questions about the future of race relations under Trump and the extent to which his campaign has animated white resentment and even a budding white nationalism.\nThe emergence of the flag in a postelection context also comes as liberals and others have harshly criticized Trump for appointing as his chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, a website they accuse of trafficking in anti-Semitic, misogynist, and anti-Muslim ideas.\nAdvertisement\nShortly after the June 17, 2015, Charleston massacre, an article posted on Breitbart argued that the Confederacy was “a patriotic and idealistic cause,” and that its flag “proclaims a glorious heritage.”\n“Every tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag,” the author, Gerald Warner, wrote. “Hoist it high and fly it with pride.”\nHow much the flag’s resurgence reflects anything more than the sentiments of those who fly it remains unclear.\nTrump, a native New Yorker, declared shortly after announcing his candidacy that he supported a call by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to remove the flag from the grounds of the Statehouse there after the mass shooting in Charleston. The state legislature, after passionate debate, eventually agreed to remove the flag.\n“I think they should put it in the museum, let it go, respect whatever it is that you have to respect, because it was a point in time, and put it in a museum,” Trump told reporters at the time.\nHistorians say the battle flag has had shifting meanings over time: a symbol of white resistance to integration during the Civil Rights era, a more complicated but still racially charged symbol now.\nGrace Elizabeth Hale, a professor of American studies and history at the University of Virginia who has written extensively about the South, segregation and white Americans, said the flag has long been a symbol for outsiders and a rebuke to the forces of decorum and political correctness.\nShe said its use now both in the South and outside it, could be seen as an expression of concern that white culture “has been displaced as the norm.”\n“Maybe for the first time ever, definitely in my lifetime, people outside the South are, in a very public way, claiming a white racial identity,” she said.\nStephen Moss, a Republican state representative from the small town of Blacksburg, South Carolina, was one of a number of lawmakers who voted against removing the flag from the Statehouse grounds in July 2015. To Moss, a supporter of Trump, the flag represents the heritage of those who fought for the Confederacy. But he acknowledged that the flag had also been “hijacked by hate groups.” Trump declared his candidacy on June 16, 2015, the day before the Charleston massacre. He would go on to see his political stock rise at the same time as the pro-flag backlash was emerging, particularly among people who felt their heritage as white Southerners was under attack. Across the country, flag supporters staged more than 350 rallies after the Charleston shooting. Since Election Day, anecdotal accounts of discrimination targeting racial and religious minorities and lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender people have overrun news reports and social media. National anti-hate organizations have begun tracking the reports, seeking to verify their veracity and identify trends. The Southern Poverty Law Center has received more than 430 reports, the majority for anti-immigrant behavior, followed by anti-black episodes. Many of the events have occurred on elementary, middle and high school campuses.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reports that many of the episodes, which range from offensive vandalism to physical violence, have invoked Trump and his campaign slogans. The center has also collected some reports of Trump supporters being harassed by opponents.\nIn an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Trump turned directly to the camera and addressed those who would commit hateful acts.\n“I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,” he said.\nThough Trump called for the removal of the flag from the South Carolina Statehouse, the flag has ardent supporters among prominent members of the alt-right, the group of conservatives that the Anti-Defamation League has called “a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists.” Some extol the flag as a symbol of white resistance. Others describe something broader.\n“Love the confederate flag! Has become the universal symbol of defiance,” Paul Ray Ramsey, a Trump supporter and popular alt-right internet personality who goes by Ramzpaul, wrote in January when he shared on Twitter a photograph of Hungarian nationalists with the flag.\nStill, the flag’s new context can seem almost baffling to those Southerners who, for decades, have been making the case that it is strictly a symbol of Southern sacrifice from a war settled long ago.\n“Well, we are naturally suspicious of all politicians and political parties because they have completely politicized our symbols and history,” Kevin Stone, the commander of the North Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, wrote in an email this week.\nThe group’s “constant battles,” he continued, “to keep monuments, flags and other symbols of Confederate heritage intact are usually hard fought, against long odds and without any political allies.”",

Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign “We have received more than 300 calls, showing that this is a real issue that is happening right here in Massachusetts,” Healey said.\nHer office said its civil rights division is working with police and district attorneys to address the complaints.\n“Our office will do all that we can to be a resource for people who have been subjected to bias-motivated threats, harassment, and violence,” Healey said.\nAdvertisement\nResidents can call the hot line at 800-994-3228, or fill out a complaint online, officials said. People can also report through the attorney general’s social media platforms.\nHealey’s office said Monday when the hot line was announced that immigrants can also come forward with concerns without “fear of reprisal based on immigration status.”\nNon-English speakers can call the hot line. A staff member handling the line speaks Portuguese and Spanish. Other staffers are available who speak other languages. Callers can also use tools such as Language Line, Healey’s office said.\nOlivia Quintana can be reached at olivia.quintana@globe.com .",

The result, employees say, is a workplace that fosters a sense of genuine closeness and caring.\nThoughts from the top: “If we’re going to be a partner to working people in other companies, we want to be the best we can ourselves,” says CEO David Lissy.\nAdvertisement\nA magic moment: Gregg Millien is used to being forgotten; the lead toddler teacher knows most of his charges just move on. Recently, though, a boy Millien hadn’t seen in two years spotted him across a room. “He runs and gives me the best hug,” Millien says. “I was like, man, this is awesome.”\nOffice space: Hundreds of employees work at the company’s Watertown headquarters. But the majority of Bright Horizons’ staff works at its child-care centers, where walls are decorated with student artwork, toys and play equipment line tables and shelves, and the babble of children is a constant, creating a workplace far removed from conventional cubicles.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Balancing act: For Bright Horizons, the flexibility to attend to family matters is essential to keeping employees happy. Shortly after Jessica Fein, vice president of marketing and creative services, joined the company, her daughter ended up hospitalized for three months.

      "text": " Google+\nAndres Kudacki/Associated Press\nPeople walked in between security fences as steam rose from under the street near Trump Tower in New York on Friday.\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist November 18, 2016\nGoodbye, old friends. I’d like to say I’ll miss you. But I think we both know that this is for the best.\nSo farewell, Rachel and Chris and Lawrence, my old MSNBC pals. You assured me everything was going be OK. I don’t blame you. I was foolishly blinded, too.\nAdvertisement\nAnd good riddance to my old adversaries. Yes, I occasionally peeked in at the Fox crew. Bill-O. The conflicted Megyn Kelly. The obnoxious Mr. Hannity.\nClinton lost. I haven’t been so surprised since that October night in 1986 when Mookie Wilson hit a little dribbler down Shea Stadium’s first-base line where Bill Buckner awaited.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Stunned sadness. Disbelief. Whatever that is in the pit of my stomach, it’s real. And it’s durable.\nI’m done with all that. At least I’m trying to be.\nEven as our incoming president begins to surround himself with questionable characters, I’m sifting rubble for treasure.\nAdvertisement\nThere are too many good books on my shelf that I’ve left unread. There are too many old friends I’ve meant to reconnect with and haven’t – inexcusable neglect. There are hikes in the Blue Hills in my near future. And long and lazy lunches with neighbors, too.\nThese are dreadful days if you believe the things that I do about how national discourse should unfold.\nNever before have I been involved in such somber conversations — in our newsroom, on neighborhood streets, in the boardrooms of some of our city’s movers and shakers — where this question is asked with deeply sincere and quavery voices: Are we going to be OK?\nYes, we are.\nIf you do the kind of work I do, you meet people at the polar ends of the human experience. That’s the nature of news.\nI’ve chased down con men and exposed charlatans. I’ve written about serial killers and crooked officials who’ve betrayed their oaths. I’ve witnessed virulent racists up close. That’s a sad minority, an ugly slice.\nI’ve also chronicled the work of inspirational doctors trying to crack genetic codes to wipe out killer diseases. I’ve covered accomplished, dedicated, smart politicians who embody all that is good about public service. I’ve spent months with veterans who went to war to defend us and then came home to bravely fight the demons they’ve brought back from the battlefield. I’ve seen bombs explode and heroes rush in.\nI have a stock question for the people I’m writing about: Do you believe people are essentially good? The answer -- with only a single exception I can remember – has been yes.\nI believe that, too. Why? Because even as the aftershocks of our tectonic election still reverberate, good is all around us.\nWhere? The woman who delivers daily meals to shut-ins. The neighborhood kid who cuts the grass and shovels the snow for the elderly woman down the street. The volunteers who offer comfort to hospital patients, staff our soup kitchens, referee our kids’ weekend games, teach Sunday school, visit our prisons, and work to ensure poor kids have what most of us take for granted.\nFor the most part, that’s who we are. I choose to focus on that.\nOn Thanksgiving morning, I’ll stand near a chilly end-zone as the Galloping Gaels and the Chieftains renew a high school rivalry that stretches back to my childhood. My friends and I will sip coffee and cheer for the kids whose names we don’t know but who carry on a tradition that still warms our hearts and instinctively tells us that we’re home again.\nMy oldest friend — one of the kindest people I know — will be on the sidelines, where he’s been a fixture for 29 years. He’s a beloved head coach who across the decades has taught his players that integrity, character, hard work, and good sportsmanship matter more than the final score. It’s a lesson some kids — and many coaches — never learn.\nAfter the game, we’ll adjourn to the tiny house where my parents raised nine kids and crowd around the big table where we’ve marked the milestones of our lives.\nWhen the dishes are cleared and the adult beverages come out, I’ll be ready with rhetorical diversions in case someone invokes He Whose Name Shall Not Be Spoken.\n“Pass me that leftover drumstick.”\n“Can we unmute the Cowboys game?”\n“Wait till you see what I’ve got for the Yankee Swap.’’\nEven if they’re too drowsy to acknowledge it, my family will give silent thanks for that microscopic attempt at civility.\nAfter all we’ve been through, don’t we owe that much to one another?\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Cindy Atoji Keene November 17, 2016\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nLaura Lu\nEMPLOYER: CarGurus\nJOB: VP international engineering\nI had no interest in cars when I first started at CarGurus. I’m still not an expert in cars themselves but am very interested in the way people shop for cars, whether it’s in Germany, the UK, or Canada. I lead the international team as we develop new markets — each country is a whole new set of challenges. It’s not a matter of just changing the code a little bit, but customizing the user experience and interface with a different data infrastructure for each culture. It’s great when we get feedback, like a user in the UK Quote: : “I found a great car through your site. Thanks. Will use you guys again.” The growth is intoxicating to me, and I work with some really smart and capable people. We get projects done quickly and efficiently, yet there’s still a nice work/life balance. I’m expecting a baby in a few months, and I’ll enjoy the generous primary caregiver leave as well. And we need a new car soon, so of course I’m using CarGurus for that. I’m sure I’ll find a great deal.\nFUN FACT: When traveling, my husband and I seem to end up in cities that are protesting: Cairo, Athens, Reykjavik, and Paris. But I guess they’re always protesting in Paris.\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nOwen Coyne\nEMPLOYER: Rapid7\nJOB: Sales manager\nThey call me “Owdogg” at the office. That’s my nickname as a dancer from the UK, so it’s kind of stuck. I’m not a hip-hop performer anymore, but my unusual skill set — locking, popping, b-boying — is embraced here at Rapid7. There’s always music playing in the sales department, and you can see me break-dancing in recruitment videos and at office parties. All this feels normal when working aside my fellow Moose (our symbol of unity and individualism). I started here as an inexperienced sales rep, shaking at the knees. I had fears that going from a dancer to software-security industry sales would be just too extreme. But on the contrary — self-expression is embraced, and we’re always moving forward to a different rhythm: the beat of hard work, persistence, some good old grit, and always a lot of fun. I have to pinch myself sometimes, because it feels like I’m living some sort of classic American dream.\nFUN FACT: I’m a huge Arsenal Football Club fan and was born and raised right near their stadium in London. You can hear the roar of the crowd in my house.\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nLynette Silva\nEMPLOYER: Globoforce\nJOB: Senior recognition strategist\nI often get teased by co-workers that I bleed Globoforce blue, a reference to our iconic logo colors. I once even dressed up for a company costume contest as GloboGirl, a caped crusader who fights the injustice of ingratitude everywhere. But I just can’t help myself — I’m such a big believer in our mission, a more human workplace through the power of thanks. Of course we use our employee recognition platform at our own workplace, and I was in tears myself when I received an e-mail for my seven-year work anniversary. It was a compilation of wonderful, silly, and memorable stories of my past years at the company. Globoforce is all about reaffirming employees: I value you, and you’re important. The real proof of that is when my beloved husband was ill and passed away. My Globofamily — from Dublin to California — rallied to support me. Talk about a global force.\nFUN FACT: I joined an improv group this summer, and we work on improvisational exercises. The goal is to make the other person better with every line.  \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nMatthew “Marty” Panos\nEMPLOYER: Intercontinental Real Estate Corp.\nJOB: Former human resources manager (now part-time accounting clerk)\nI retired almost five years ago at age 81 after being comptroller and, later, human resources manager. I had a most wonderful retirement party. But after nine months or so, they begged me to come back; the lady hired to replace me didn’t work out. Now I come in one day a week, doing miscellaneous tasks, like going through old paperwork and shredding unwanted documents. I do enjoy coming into the office, but I keep saying, “If you need this desk, please, just let me know.” I helped start the company over five decades ago, and seeing the growth of this place pleases me so much. I’ve watched entry-level employees, who used to make $8.50 an hour, rise now through the ranks and become big executives. This company is like a family; many employees stay for years. They still ask me to speak at the annual holiday party, and I give a little speech about the company’s history, and everyone always cheers.\nFUN FACT: I’ve been to Iran a few times and got to meet the shah of Iran’s sister. \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nJean-Yves Hyppolite\nEMPLOYER: TransAction Corporate Shuttles\nJOB: Driver\nEven when I was in my country  —  I’m from Haiti  —  I loved to drive. I love the freedom and responsibility it gives me. But when I came here, I started working in a fast-food restaurant. I had the idea that someday, as I told my wife, I would like to drive a bus instead. At the time, she was taking a shuttle bus back and forth to work. She spoke with the people and recommended me as a driver. Some jobs would not hire you without the proper license, but this company gave me a chance. They gave me the training so that I could take the test to drive a 33-passenger bus. I studied and passed the exam. That allowed me to start driving a shuttle for a major Boston company, picking up and dropping off employees. I have a long day. Life is not easy, but it’s better. This company help me to realize my dream. I feel like I was born to drive.\nFUN FACT: I read books to try to improve my English. The last book I read was The Dropout: How a Lost Kid Found His Dream (Joseph Mathews).  \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nHelio Martinez\nEMPLOYER: Comcast\nJOB: Technical operations supervisor\nI love technology — I have all our Comcast products at home: home security, Internet, entertainment operating systems. As the company continues to enhance their products and services, I’m happy to be a part of that. Any tricks I learn, I pass on to our customers, which is great. I oversee 15 technicians who service about 40,000 customers in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. We go out to the field and trouble-shoot any issues, whether it’s connectivity or device malfunction. I still go out to homes myself and use my expertise on installation and trouble-shooting. We have all the tools we need, whether it’s vehicle, uniform, test equipment, and laptops. I started right out of high school and now have been here for over 15 years. I’ve risen to supervisor after starting in an entry-level position. There’s so much opportunity to grow within the company, and I try to excel in everything I do. I like being a Comcast ambassador.\nFUN FACT: I love deep-sea fishing and once won a prize for catching a 30-inch striper.\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nMara Rodriguez\nEMPLOYER: Curriculum Associates\nJOB: Director of educator success\nMy official title is director of educator success; it’s an amorphous role. I gather insights from educators who use our products, then curate and synthesize them to inform our decisions and create support materials that help educators get the most from the products. I spent the last nine years in an inner-city school before I “jumped the fence’’ to an education company. I absolutely miss being in a school — once an educator, always an educator — but it’s really great to be in an organization that “gets it.’’ Being a former user of the product, I know the nuances of what’s going to really connect with teachers. We roll up our sleeves and make decisions here based on what’s going to help students and faculty. This leads us to be super-collaborative and set aside our egos. Good curriculum and good tools make a teacher’s job so much easier. I still have old school textbooks in my office here, and they’re a good reminder of classroom life.\nFUN FACT: My go-to dish, passed down from my grandmother, is paella. My version can include clam, calamari, mussels, and scallops, all in one dish. \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nDeVron Warner\nEMPLOYER: Harmonix Music Systems\nJOB: Executive producer\nI often get asked, “Do you get to play video games all day?’’ My answer is “I get to play broken video games all day.’’ It’s a lot of fun but also a lot of work; whatever we make has to operate — and also be entertaining and exciting. Right now I’m working on the virtual-reality version of Rock Band, which allows players to experience being on stage with a crowd. I’m a developer who is also a bass player, which helps me understand what we’re trying to re-create: the feeling of being a musician. In fact, so many of us here are passionate about both music and video games. There’s even a practice space with amps and instruments where bands can rehearse. And, of course, a game room with a library full of different video games. I often realize how lucky I am — it’s a lot of responsibility and sometimes a grind, but in the end, I’m helping to make a video game, and that’s just plain cool.\nFUN FACT: I’m a longtime car guy and travel around the country to car shows. I have a souped-up Volkswagen R32.  \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nVictor Rodriguez Sr.\nEMPLOYER: PeoplesBank\nJOB: Mortgage consultant\nI’m a first-generation homeowner, the first in my family to own a house. So I really understand when folks in Chicopee, Springfield, or Holyoke struggle to buy a home. My father was from Costa Rica and my mom was Puerto Rican, so being able to speak English and Spanish is of huge benefit when dealing with the large Latino population in this area. I think everyone has a right to own their own home, whether it’s a one- or two-family, although there are some foundations that have to be laid — credit, income, work history. I break it down and describe the steps that need to be taken. It’s always satisfying assisting customers, but even more special for first-time home buyers because that’s a life-changing experience. I visit different branch offices at least once a week and really enjoy the camaraderie among the tellers and others. I arrive in the morning and have my second cup of coffee and then I’m ready to face the day.\nFUN FACT: I have a baseball card collection that started when I was 9 or 10 years old and now have over 7,000 cards in it, including a few Reggie Jackson cards. \nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff\nJeff Krebs\nEMPLOYER: NEI General Contracting\nJOB: Assistant project manager\nAs a technical engineer in the Army, I’d go to obscure areas in Afghanistan and help survey, design, and build combat outposts, guard towers, and perimeters. We were in the middle of nowhere, planning where the next base would be. This construction experience is serving me well in my current role, where I’m managing ground-up construction for multimillion-dollar projects. It all whittles down to the details, the nuts and bolts of everything that’s going to happen while at the same time getting the documentation in order. The main thing I learned in the service is leadership and handling teams; some days it feels like herding cats, moving subcontractors around almost like pieces on a chessboard. I’m still in the reserves as a warrant officer, and NEI has been very supportive, even allowing me to take five weeks off to attend candidate school. Juggling my civilian and Army roles is sometimes like a tug of war, but I do the best I can. That’s what I learned overseas: Get it done.\nFUN FACT: I’m addicted to board games and have a huge collection nearing the triple digits.\nRelated The Top Places to Work for 2016, and how we picked them Bright Horizons Family Solutions tops the list of largest companies Big Night Entertainment named No. 1 large company Nitsch Engineering chosen as No. 1 medium-size company Addgene tops list of small employers For businesses that still have pensions, they’re a golden lure\nSend comments to magazine@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nFormer US senator Scott Brown spoke with Donald Trump after he endorsed Trump during a N.H. campaign rally in February 2016.\nBy Jim O’Sullivan and Travis Andersen Globe Staff November 19, 2016\nScott Brown is in the running to be the US secretary of veterans affairs, the former US senator said President-elect Donald Trump told him Friday.\n“He said he’s making his highest recommendation to his committee that they consider me,” said Brown, who endorsed Trump shortly before the presidential primary in New Hampshire, where Brown ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2014. Trump won a runaway victory in the state.\nAdvertisement\nBrown, a military veteran who won a stunning 2010 Senate victory in Massachusetts, said Trump called him on his cellphone during a flight back from Dallas, where Brown had attended a housing forum.\n“He said, ‘How do you think you can help me?’ ” Brown said.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign The former Republican state legislator pointed to two areas where he felt he has expertise: housing and veterans’ issues.\n“He said, ‘What’s your passion?’ ” Brown recalled, saying that he replied, “Military service.”\n“Quite honestly, it’s the toughest Cabinet position,” Brown said he told Trump, adding, “It transcends party.”\nAdvertisement\nThe president-elect’s transition team could not be reached for comment on Friday night.\nDuring his campaign, Trump focused repeatedly on the plight of military veterans — and on the shortcomings of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThe VA has been under scrutiny in recent years for a litany of scandals involving shoddy health care for returning veterans, delays in providing treatment, and other issues.\nTrump vowed during his victory speech that his administration would “finally take care of our great veterans, who have been so loyal.”\nIn June, he pledged to fire or discipline VA officials who fail to adequately care for veterans and also called for an expansion of programs that allow veterans to choose their doctor and clinics, regardless of whether they are VA facilities or private medical centers, and still receive government-paid medical care.\nBrown’s revelation Friday came as Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Trump has been staging his transition meetings, has been awash in speculation about top hires, opening policy initiatives, and the contours of a presidency many never saw coming.\nSeveral of Trump’s initial hires have ignited criticism over their history of racially and ethnically divisive comments and positions.\nBrown, who famously campaigned for Senate in a barn jacket and a truck, is unlikely to face such controversies.\nHe last ran in Massachusetts in 2012, when he lost the Senate seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren.\nBrown said he had heard from a number of former Senate colleagues, who vote on Cabinet nominees.\n“I’m hopeful that if it happens,” he said, “that I’ll get unanimous approval.”\nBrown said Trump told him he’d be in touch next week.\nHe chuckled when reminded that Trump had said, at a Boston fund-raiser in June, that he would campaign in Massachusetts, which last voted for a GOP presidential candidate in 1984, if Brown advised him to.\n“We never really followed up on that,” Brown said.\nAttempts to reach aides to elected officials on both sides of the aisle for comment, including Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, and Senators Kelly Ayotte and Warren, were unsuccessful Friday evening.\nIf nominated and confirmed, Brown would bring to the job an extensive military background.\nHe served more than 30 years in the National Guard, and requested in 2010 to serve his summer duty in Afghanistan during the August congressional recess. Brown was gone for two weeks, but he spent part of that time in predeployment training and traveling to and from Afghanistan.\nHe told reporters at Logan Airport when he returned that the soldiers he visited were worried about the pace of President Obama’s troop drawdown in Afghanistan. He spoke of the 116-degree heat as he ate with troops while dressed in full body armor.\nBrown also wrote in his memoir of enduring a mortar attack while at Bagram Airfield near Kabul.\n“Another blast came, this one maybe 700 or 800 meters away, close enough to glimpse the bright flash of light,” he wrote. “A bunch of us took off at a dead run toward a nearby bunker. Three hours later, my flight was in the sky.”\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report. Travis Andersen of the Globe Staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nJay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File\nSharon Jones.\nBy Steve Kenny New York Times November 19, 2016\nSharon Jones, the soul singer and powerful voice of the band the Dap-Kings, died Friday of pancreatic cancer that had been in remission but returned last year. She was 60.\nJones’ death was confirmed by Judy Miller Silverman, her publicist. She said Jones was surrounded by members of the Dap-Kings and other loved ones when she died.\nAdvertisement\nShe continued performing throughout the summer, even while undergoing chemotherapy that she said caused neuropathy in her feet and legs and restricted her movements onstage. But Jones remained undeterred.\n“Getting out on that stage, that’s my therapy,” Jones said in a New York Times interview published in July. “You have to look at life the way it is. No one knows how long I have. But I have the strength now, and I want to continue.”\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign The summer tour promoted “I’m Still Here,” a single with the Dap-Kings that detailed Jones’ birth in a brutally segregated South, a childhood in the burned-out Bronx, and a career hampered by record executives who considered her “too short, too fat, too black and too old.”\nJones was that rare music star who found fame in middle age, when she was in her 40s.\nWith that late start, she recorded and performed at an unrelenting pace, and in the last year and a half of her life Jones recorded two albums, opened two national tours for Hall & Oates, was featured in a television commercial for Lincoln (performing the Allman Brothers’ “Midnight Rider”) and starred in “Miss Sharon Jones!,” a documentary about her life.\nAdvertisement\nThe film traced her life from the diagnosis of Stage 2 pancreatic cancer in 2013 through her triumphant return to the stage in 2015.\n“Sharon is always up,” the film’s director, Barbara Kopple, said at the time of its release. “Even when she’s in the room where people are getting chemo, she’s the sunshine.”\nJones publicly announced the return of her cancer in September 2015 at the film’s first showing at the Toronto International Film Festival. Doctors, she said, had found a spot on her liver. “I didn’t want people to come up and congratulate me on beating cancer when it’s back,” she said.\nThat recurrence was treated with radiation. But in May, while she was on tour, cancer cells were found in her stomach, lymph nodes and lungs. Chemotherapy was required, although Jones changed the regimen to give her greater freedom of movement.\n“I need to dance onstage,” she said. “I don’t want something that makes me bedridden. I want to live my life to the fullest.”",

      "text": " Google+\nJosh Reynolds for The Boston Globe\nLexington-based bereavement counselor Sairey Luterman is helping people cope.\nBy Cindy Atoji Keene Globe Correspondent November 19, 2016\nBereavement counselor Sairey Luterman is dealing with a new kind of grief these days. It’s not the mourning that comes after death, divorce, or the loss of a longtime pet or job. This is post-election trauma. Luterman says she’s hearing from clients who say, “I can’t stop crying” or “I feel hopeless.” These are most definitely not Donald Trump supporters. All the hallmarks of grieving are there — bargaining, anger, disbelief. And Luterman, 47, a certified thanatologist (study of death) who has a private practice in Lexington, is helping people cope. They are most definitely not Donald Trump supporters. “I have had numerous people call to say they are in mourning for our country,” Luterman said. But her work extends far beyond helping people deal with the outcome of an election.\n“I don’t usually say to people after a loss, ‘Turn off the TV and back away from the news.’ But this is different from ‘regular’ grief, if there is such a thing. I recommend self-care, a supportive community, and, of course, avoiding social media. I don’t want to encourage partisan camps, but if you’re feeling vulnerable and unglued, don’t be spending time with your cousin, uncle, or father-in-law who is celebrating the current state of affairs.\n“Think about how you can mourn and organize, as the two are not incompatible. Grief is a response to a specific catalyst, and it may last for some time, whereas depression may not have a single starting point.\nAdvertisement\n“The role of a grief counselor such as myself is actually very old-fashioned: compassionate, nonjudgmental listening, and helping to empower mourners to a ‘new normal.’ I started on this path when my daughter was very sick. She recovered, but I felt I had a debt to pay.\n“I began volunteering for a nonprofit bereavement center that served families dealing with catastrophic loss. I was terrified when I first started; sadness is the most gritty and horrible thing, while being rich and meaningful. Sometimes I can see a physical transformation from a trauma mask almost — pallor, nervousness, anxiety — to relief and peace.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign “Do I have a magic button or lever? Hardly — my clients do the work themselves; the process is a very internal one.\n“Grief or loss as a counseling specialty is growing because faith communities are crumbling and death is externalized — it happens in the hospital and not the home. Death and dying are disenfranchised in America because we don’t talk about it. But now we have death cafes, where taboo topics are discussed over tea and cupcakes, which normalizes it.\n“Still, if you want to see someone turn gray and hurry away, tell them you are a grief counselor. People look at me wide-eyed as if they are thinking, ‘I can’t get away from this woman fast enough.’ ”\nCindy Atoji Keene can be reached at cindy@cindyatoji.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images\nUS Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama talked to the media at the Trump Tower in New York on Thursday.\nBy Astead W. Herndon Globe Staff November 19, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump made his first Cabinet selection Friday, tapping Senator Jeff Sessions, the conservative hard-liner and Trump loyalist from Alabama who has previously confronted accusations of racism, to be his nominee for attorney general.\n“Jeff has been a highly respected member of the US Senate for 20 years,” Trump said in a statement from Trump Tower in Manhattan, which has been a hive of transition activity. “He is a world-class legal mind . . . and is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.”\nAdvertisement\nThe prospect of Sessions at the helm of the Justice Department triggered an immediate firestorm among liberal lawmakers and civil rights organizations, who spent Friday denouncing Trump’s choice and relitigating Sessions’ controversial history on civil and voting rights.\nIn addition to Sessions, Trump also named retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. Flynn is a darling of the far-right who once said in a tweet that the fear of all Muslims is “rational.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Representative Michael Pompeo, a Republican House member from Kansas, was selected as the nominee to lead the CIA. To serve, Sessions and Pompeo must be confirmed by the Senate. Democrats, when they had the majority in 2013, changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for high-level nominations, so both men stand a strong chance of winning confirmation.\nView Story Warren asks Trump to withdraw AG nominee “Can the Republicans step up and say, ‘No. No to Jeff Sessions’?” Warren asked.\nFor some, the combination of Sessions, Flynn, and an earlier pick, former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon as chief White House strategist, established a troubling trend for the president-elect. Rather than sending conciliatory signals with his picks, or reaching out to skeptical Democrats, Trump is naming loyal figures who are inflaming racial and partisan divides.\nSessions’ confirmation hearings promise to reignite debates about Trump’s racially divisive campaign and the incoming administration’s approach to immigrations and minorities.\nSAUL LOEBSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\nRepublican US Representative from Kansas Mike Pompeo.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1986, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship after accusations that the former federal prosecutor had made racist comments, including that he called a black assistant US attorney “boy,” and said the Ku Klux Klan was “OK.”\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sessions apologized after former colleagues said he called the NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union, and other civil rights organizations “un-American” and “communist-inspired.”\nSessions has repeatedly denied allegations of racism and has defended his comments to colleagues as friendly banter.\nCornell William Brooks, president of the NAACP, implored the Senate to reject Sessions’ nomination.\n“This is not the time for the US Senate to develop a case of post-election amnesia,” Brooks said in an interview Friday. “Donald Trump does not have a mandate to take this country backwards. That mandate does not exist.”\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, and other Massachusetts political leaders joined in calling for the rejection of Sessions’ nomination.\n“Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship,” Warren said. “In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism, no negotiation with hate. Today, a new Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right.”\nThe incoming minority leader in the Senate, Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, struck a slightly more neutral tone about Sessions, although he expressed concerns about Sessions’ commitment to civil rights enforcement at the Justice Department. Democrats “want to hear what he has to say,” Schumer said in a statement.\nBorn Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III and sharing names with two Confederate heroes, the 69-year-old has been an uncompromising conservative firebrand in the Senate.\nA former US attorney and state attorney general in Alabama, Sessions was elected in 1996.\nIn February, Sessions was the first senator to publicly endorse Trump’s unlikely presidential campaign, becoming a trusted surrogate and close adviser to the New York real estate mogul, who needed a link to Washington. Since Trump’s upset victory, Sessions has been considered a virtual lock to receive a key Cabinet nomination.\nUPI/Ron Bennett\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee nomination hearing of Jeff Sessions in 1986.\n“Jeff Sessions great pick for AG,” tweeted another Trump supporter, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. “He was a bold voice . . . when other GOP figures were ready to give away the country.”\nIn a statement released by the Trump transition team, Sessions thanked the president-elect for the nomination, and alluded to his upcoming nomination fight. Sessions promised to “give all my strength to advance the department’s highest ideals.”\n“I enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump’s vision for ‘one America,’ and his commitment to equal justice under law,” Sessions said in the statement. “I look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.”\nIn response to critics, Sessions supporters cite an investigation led by Sessions when he was US attorney in Alabama, of the 1981 murder of a black man who was kidnapped, beaten, and killed by two Klansmen who hanged his body in a tree. The two men were later arrested and convicted.\n‘‘He couldn’t have been more supportive of making sure we got convicted the murderers of the last black man who was lynched by the Klan,’’ former Justice Department attorney Barry Kowalski, who worked with Sessions, told the Associated Press.\nBut the Congressional Black Caucus released a statement saying Sessions was unfit to serve as the country’s chief law enforcement officer. Black Caucus chairman G.K. Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina, called Sessions’ record on civil rights “appalling” and said it should disqualify him from Senate confirmation.\n“The Congressional Black Caucus stands ready to oppose Senator Sessions’ confirmation as we adamantly believe his appointment will set us back in the advancement of civil rights and race relations across the country,” Butterfield said.\nHealey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said Sessions has “made a career standing against many of our most important values as a state.” Many have wondered whether state initiatives will be challenged legally under a Sessions-led Justice Department. Massachusetts recently approved recreational marijuana and implemented early voting.\nThe late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who staunchly opposed Sessions’ appointment to the US District Court in 1986, called Sessions a “throwback to a shameful era.’’\n“It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a US attorney, let alone a US federal judge,” Kennedy said at the time.\nRelated Warren asks Trump to withdraw AG nominee or face fight in Senate\nAstead W.

      "title": "Walsh opens painful, but needed, dialogue on race",
      "text": " Google+\nCredit: Macamdu - Fotolia.\n November 18, 2016\nT he arraignment of three Boston teenagers on hate-crime charges provides a sobering backdrop for Mayor Marty Walsh’s new dialogue on racism in the city. Prosecutors say the 15-year-old girls — two from Dorchester, and one from Mattapan — repeatedly punched a 49-year-old woman on a Red Line train while telling her to “go back to [her] own country.”\nOne incident doesn’t define the character of the city. But it’s as good a reminder as any of why Walsh’s discussions, which kick off Saturday with an event at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, are so important. Their purpose, according to the mayor’s office, is to explore “how we acknowledge our past as we look to our future in order to become a more socially cohesive and resilient city.”\nAdvertisement\nRacism is such a broad, multifaceted problem that discussions about it can quickly float away into a cloud of generalities. One way to make this discussion focused and productive would be for the mayor to rally the city to meet its most immediate racial challenge — protecting Boston’s immigrants, especially Latinos, from violence and discrimination in the era of Donald Trump.\nThere’s not much doubt that Trump’s rhetoric has unleashed some ugly forces, including in Boston. Last year, in another Red Line incident, two men were arrested for assaulting a man they believed was Mexican, at the JFK/UMass station. One cited Trump after the assault. Nationally, a spike of racial harassment has been reported since Election Day.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign In the series of discussions planned after Saturday’s meeting — and in classrooms and public spaces across the city — the city should step up efforts to honor its immigrant heritage. Many people want to know how they personally can help; one step would be to provide guidance on how bystanders should respond if they witness racial harassment.\nThat’s not to dismiss the city’s many other racial challenges, including income inequality, residential segregation, and the still-raw legacy of the busing crisis. Those issues are bound to come up on Saturday, and they should. But it’s not necessary to settle every historical question first in order to respond to fresh injustices. Maybe, on the contrary, what the city needs in order to confront its oldest scars is the momentum it would gain from a successful citywide effort to combat hate in the present day.",

      "text": "Google has launched a range of two Live case lines for its Google Pixel phones. Each comes with its own live wallpapers and, depending on your preference, either can be aesthetically pleasing or purely functional. The Google Earth Live cases feature some of Google’s best imagery taken from the tech giant’s satellite imagery. Each case matches a Google Earth photo, however, the live wallpapers change every day using a number of curated images.\nThe other case, Google Trends Live, has wallpapers that are certainly interesting. Instead of beautifully curated images, the wallpaper displays the top trending Google searches. It’s a handy way of staying on top of current events, but don’t be surprised if the odd peculiar search trend appears on your home screen.\nBoth lines of Live cases are now available currently in the U.S. You can purchase at Best Buy, Verizon or from Google’s online store .\nStaying with mobile tech, check out our iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel camera comparison to see which comes out on top.\n",

      "text": "Today on Google.com is a special Google logo, Doodle, for writer James Welch. Today would be his 76th birthday and Google wanted to highlight his writing contributions.\nThis Doodle highlights his work on Fools Crow, the story of the Blackfeet people during the period of post-civil war encroachment by Europeans. The Doodle was designed by artist, Sophie Diao. Here is what Google said about it:\nThirty years ago, Welch published his best known work, Fools Crow, the story of the Blackfeet people during the period of post-civil war encroachment by Europeans. In this award-winning novel, the Blackfeet seek to continue traditional ways, and to avoid both contact and conflict. As a whole, Welch’s works emphasized the humanity of native peoples and their deep attachment to their homelands. He was considered an early part of what was later dubbed the Native American Renaissance, during which native writers celebrated tribal culture and revealed its complex problems in works readily accessible to the larger American public.\nWelch, who as a young man described himself as an \"Indian who writes,\" gained an international audience. His works were appreciated universally for both their artistic appeal and ability to bring the experiences of the Native American people to life.\nHe was born on November 18, 1940 in Browning, Montana and passed at the age of 62 on August 4, 2003 in Missoula, Montana. You can learn more about his life and achievements on Wikipedia .\nForum discussion at Google+ .",

      "text": "(Before It's News) BIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those well aware of the issues, it’s high time you switch to Seen.life . It is a website similar to Facebook but without the censorship\nEarlier today, when I first heard that Donald Trump had tapped Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General, I have to admit I was less than thrilled, but not for the reasons the mainstream media or Hollywood elites are whining and moaning about. Personally, I thought Trey Gowdy was born for the job, and when I heard Ted Cruz might be in the running I got a bit excited, however at the end of the day, I realize that President-Elect Donald Trump has to pick who he feels he can work best with.\nMoving on, I’m not sure how many of you have seen Tucker Carlson’s new show, since it’s only been on the air about a week, but after watching the segment below live, I can’t say I’m surprised that before the show is even half over, the interview is already up on YouTube.\nWe’ve all known for some time that the mainstream media has been carrying water for the Democrat Party, and that sad reality was further instilled in us during the presidential election when Julian Assange and Wikileaks revealed just how deep the corruption and collusion has been between the mainstream media and the Democrats.\nWith that said, in the interview below, Tucker Carlson interviews Jonathan Allen regarding a hit piece Allen wrote about Jeff Sessions being a racist, but it was actually written a few days before Trump announced Sessions as his pick for Attorney General.\nGet ready to see Tucker Carlson like you’ve never seen him before. Allen is likely to need years of therapy after Tucker ruthlessly tore him apart limb by limb on live television for being the pathetic, integrity lacking, journalistic hack that Allen is. For about 8:00 minutes, Jonathan Allen had nowhere to hide, and it must have seemed longer than 8 years while he was sitting there.\nWow! Tucker, take it easy man. You might scare little kids watching… I’m just joking, but all kidding aside, Jonathan Allen had nowhere to hide, and Tucker had every reason to do what he did. As I warned in a previous post, Notice to the Mainstream Media: Don’t Get Comfortable, You’re Next ! Also, don’t forget the protest planned to bring CNN to its knees beginning November 20th. It’s time We the People take out the trash in the mainstream media. Great job tonight Tucker! Get your popcorn out for this one…\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those well aware of the issues, it’s high time you switch to Seen.life .

      "text": "For three years, Google's Chromecast platform has stood out in the streaming-box category for one simple reason: your phone is your remote. Smartphones and tablets can do a lot of the heavy lifting in the TV-watching experience (browsing content, picking through apps, typing keywords). Chromecast takes advantage of that: no remote, no separate set-top box app ecosystem, lower cost.\nLast year's second-gen Chromecast offered decent upgrades over the original , but not much else. The device changed designs, shrank in size, and drove 1080p video to your TV screen a little faster and more efficiently. That device still exists for the same low price of $35. Is there a reason we need a third-gen Chromecast?\nOn paper, there might be. Streaming boxes with support for the rising 4K and HDR standards are still few and far between, and this month's $69 Chromecast Ultra advertises support for both while still being $30 cheaper than the cheapest 4K HDR Roku box. The Ultra is also the first Chromecast model to support wired Ethernet.\nBut Chromecast, like most streaming boxes rushing to the 4K market, has an uphill battle to climb. Chances are, your shiny new 4K set already has \"smart\" functions built in to support the scant few streaming services that currently support 4K and HDR video. Unlike smart TVs of old, new sets are more likely to support new app downloads, which potentially undermines one of Chromecast's better selling points—easy app upgradeability.\nIf you still favor the Chromecast line's ties to smartphones, I have tested exactly what you can expect from this new $69 Ultra variant. But if you're only reading this article because you hate your current 4K set's internal apps, I don't have much good news to report.\nSetting up the puck The Chromecast Ultra tucked into its plastic safety net. This is how we do it. I never noticed any remarkable speed boost with the Ultra compared to the standard Chromecast. HDMI flap fully extended. Say hello to the new \"G\" branding. Size comparison with the Chromecast Audio (which is the same size as the 2015 Chromecast). This is where you plug the Ethernet cable. Tighter zoom of Ethernet port. Extended on its tummy. Extended on its back. Chromecast Ultra sticks with the \"hockey puck\" design that debuted with last year's refresh of the hardware, only now the puck is a little bit closer to NHL regulation size. The diameter has grown a quarter of an inch, from 2 inches to 2.25 inches, while the hardware has fattened up an eighth of an inch to a full half-inch of depth.\nChances are, the size increase won't disrupt your entertainment center. The puck design remains easier to stick into a TV's crowded port party than the original stick model, as it again comes with an HDMI \"ribbon\" of about 3 inches. In an interesting move, Google expanded the Chromecast's functionality by adding one more port, but you won't find it in the puck. Instead, the device's new Ethernet port has been built into the AC adapter.\nThis means the AC adapter's general design has changed and grown, which might require some power-cord shuffling if your power strip is already swamped. The primary hardware accepts power from a micro-USB cable, but if you choose a different USB power adapter, the Chromecast Ultra will warn you that you'll be limited to 1080p output.\nSetting the device up requires installing the Google Home app (which used to be called Google Cast, and before that, Chromecast) onto a smartphone or tablet. Open Google Home on an Android device, and the app should automatically tell you that you have a new Chromecast Ultra in need of setting up (I did not test this on an iOS device, but setting up past Chromecasts in iOS has been only slightly more complicated).\nThe setup process at this point is simple: your phone will automatically switch to the Chromecast Ultra's short-range Wi-Fi signal and quickly exchange information to enable control. If you opt for a wired connection, that's it; if you prefer wireless, the app will ask you to automatically transfer your preferred Wi-Fi network and password from your phone. This Wi-Fi auto-transfer has only recently been added to the Google Home app, and it's a welcome setup shortcut.\nYou can now start casting content from your handheld device (or a laptop with the Chrome browser) to your Chromecast Ultra's TV set. This works by loading a compatible audio- or video-streaming app and tapping the \"cast\" icon, then selecting content in that app.\nPage: 1 2 Next →",

      "text": "\nI’m sure you’re aware of Google’s dominance in the internet search space and you likely know that Google Search tends to be more popular on mobile than it is on desktop. This is largely because Google Search appears on pretty much every mobile device. But with recent changes in internet usage, Google’s lead is only going to grow even further.\nSee also: What’s the fastest Android browser? September 18, 2016 When it comes to desktop search dominance, Google comfortably takes the number one spot in the U.S. with 81.42 percent of browser traffic. But on mobile, that lead jumps to a near ubiquitous 92.91 percent on mobile, helped in large part by making Google the default search engine on iPhones as well as Android.\nGoogle represents over 90 percent of mobile search traffic\nIn fact, Google has represented over 90 percent of mobile search traffic all year.\nConsidering the attempt at a Google shut-out in countries like China and Russia, that’s very impressive.\nIn the desktop space however, Google isn’t quite as dominant (and it should be noted that the U.S. isn’t even in the top ten most Google-dependent countries where desktop usage is concerned).\nWith mobile internet access surpassing desktop for the first time ever, Google's dominance is only going to grow\nBut with a recent report noting that mobile internet access surpassed desktop usage for the first time ever and mobile predicted to represent 75 percent of global search traffic next year , Google’s cornering of the mobile market means its lead is only going to grow even larger.\nThe difference between 80 percent and 90 percent may not seem like much, but that’s the entire space in which Google’s search rivals exist.\nStatista \nAs Google’s market share inevitably grows in the wake of the transition to mobile internet usage, it will put increasing pressure on competitors like Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and AskJeeves.\nEventually of course, there simply won’t be enough residual search traffic to share around and one or more of these alternative search providers will collapse. Google may be great at what it does, but competition is always good.\nEventually there won't be enough residual search traffic to share around and one or more alternative search providers will collapse\nThis monopolistic outcome is exactly why the EU Commission is always going after Google for anti-competitive behavior. While I can’t see Google dropping the ball on delivering the best search engine possible, regardless of how many competitors it has, an internet dominated by Google alone is a little worrying.\nDo you use other search engines than Google? Are you OK with Google squeezing out competition?",

      "text": "print \nGoogle has done a much better job combating fake news than Facebook, but there is still a big problem it needs to fix: “newsy” Google search results that seem like they have been editorially approved, but actually haven’t been. \nEarlier this week, Google faced criticism when one of its top results for “final election count” was fake news. The top result in Google Search's “In the news” section was a Wordpress blog named “70 News,” which claimed Trump won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700,000. He didn’t. \nHere is what the Google results looked like at one point: \nBusiness Insider \nTo the average person, the above page might look as if Google News, the company's editorially-vetted news section, which has human oversight, had been duped by a fake news story. \nBut it hadn't. Google says that “70 News” was not part of the Google News roster of approved publications. \nHow is that possible? \nThe reason is because the “newsy” modules that sit at the top of many Google searches — the “In the news” section on desktop, and the “Top stories” section on mobile — don’t pull content straight from Google News. They pull from all sorts of content available across the web, and can include sites not approved by Google News. \nThis is particularly confusing for users on the desktop version of Google's site, where the \"In the news\" section lives. \nNot only does the “In the news” section literally have the word \"news\" in its name, but the link at the bottom of the module, which says “More news for…,” takes you to the separate Google News page, which is comprised only of articles that Google's editorial system has approved. \nBusiness Insider \nGiven these two factors, it's not a stretch that you might assume the results in that little box are from Google News. Often the are. But they aren't always, as evidenced by \"70 News.\" And that's perfectly OK by Google. \nThe newsy boxes appear to be a loophole in Google's system that provides another way for false information to seep into the public consciousness under the guise of trusted facts. \nWhile the viral nature of Facebook's social media platform has been blamed for much of the recent spread of false news, Google's efforts to position itself as the world's fist stop on the web has created another breeding ground for fake news that is still not completely understood. Ads versus ad-free \nSo why isn’t the “In the news” section just the top three Google News results? \nThe short answer is because Google sees Google Search and Google News as separate products. \nThe longer answer might have to do with advertising dollars. Google News does not include any advertising, which helps Google avoid recriminations from news publishers, already angry about losing traffic to Google, that Google is profiting from their work. \nGoogle's main search page, by contrast, does have advertising. \nBy features a box of news stories on its main search page, Google can generate ad revenue alongside popular news articles that are not technically \"Google News,\" while providing a link to its ad-free Google News section. (Google declined to comment on this aspect). \nWhatever the reason for the separation, the branding and placement of the “In the news” section seems likely to mislead users into thinking it’s a Google News product. The 80% Google News consensus \nNone of this would be a problem if Google News and Google Search had the same amount of editorial oversight. But Google has a stricter system of quality control on Google News, so users might inherently trust “In the news” in a way they wouldn't trust a simple search result. \nThe goal of Google News is to showcase the work of bona fide news sites, with authoritative voices. Publications have to apply to be part of Google News, and can be turned down. \nTo get into Google News, a site first goes through a low-level algorithmic check, which looks at things like site structure (is there an “About Me” page?). If it passes, the site then goes through a proactive review by a committee, which is encouraged to do extra research. In this committee, if the site gets an 80% or more consensus, it passes. If it gets rejected, the publisher is told why, and can reapply in 60 days. Google has let over 75,000 publications onto this platform, and there is a form anyone can use to report any bad behavior, which can get publishers kicked off. Google Search for truth \nGoogle’s search results, in contrast, are not editorially vetted, or assessed for “truth.” Google’s algorithms still do a good job at sniffing out fake sites because Google is set up to catch “spam.” But Google’s algorithms will likely never be 100% perfect at telling what information on a website is inaccurate. \nGoogle does, however, seem to want to wipe fake news from its platform. \n“From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said recently. After the issue of fake news entered the spotlight after the election, Google announced it would ban fake-news sites from its ad network, choking off their revenue. \nBut even if Google's goal is to kick fake-news sites out of its search engine, most Google users probably understand that Google search results don’t have carry the editorial stamp of approval from Google. \nBut this expectation gets more complicated when it comes to Search sections like “Top Stories” or “In the news.” The 'Top Stories' on your phone \nWhen you search for something that relates to news on your smartphone, Google will often present you with a carousel of stories at the top labeled “Top stories.” \nHere is what it looks like: \nBusiness Insider \nThat carousel is not part of Google News. It is full of “ newsy” pages from both Google News and from Google Search. So it is a mixture of sites vetted and not vetted by humans. \nWhat ties all those “Top stories” together is that they are AMP sites, Google’s open-source project to promote faster-loading webpages. Basically, any website that conforms to a set of technical standards gets labeled an AMP site by Google, and gets an “AMP” tag (with a little lightning bolt). \nOne of the perks of being an AMP site is that you have the chance to appear in the “Top stories” carousel. \nBut though the “Top stories” carousel might strike you as similar to Google News when you hear the name, Google views AMP as a technical description, not as an editorial product. Anyone can publish an AMP site, and the pages don’t even have to be news-related — Ebay is one, for instance. \nBecause of this stance, Google has no plans to have humans make any editorial decisions about AMP pages. \nThe “In the news” section rests in a similar situation. It is a “Search” product not a “News” product, and so is not editorially vetted. And while Google’s algorithms are good, the “70 News” situation shows they can be gamed. \nThis whole situation seems like an easy fix for Google: Have the sections that appear to be news only pull from Google News, which has stricter oversight. As previously stated, Google declined to comment on the reason why Google News and Google Search are kept separate.",

Lastly, Google can prompt you on your phone to approve a sign-in attempt (as long as your phone has Google Play Services). \nFor some users, the latter method now works on Android Wear as well. Some of our readers are reporting that the above notification now appears on Android Wear devices connected to their 2FA-approved phone, allowing them to approve or deny login attempts without reaching for their phone.

In this case, \"70 News\" hadn't been vetted by Google News. \nGoogle’s search results, in contrast to Google News, are not assessed for “truth.” Google’s algorithms still do a good job at sniffing out fake news sites because Google is set up to catch “spam.” But Google’s algorithms will likely never be perfect at telling what information on a website is inaccurate. \nGoogle does want to try to get fake news completely off search as well, however. \n“From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said recently. \nAfter the issue of fake news entered the spotlight after the election, Google also announced it would ban fake-news sites from its ad network, choking off their revenue.

      "text": "How to avoid getting conned by fake news sites \nZuckerberg's post comes as Facebook, Google and others face a barrage of criticism for letting sham articles circulate by way of their sites. \nDuring the recent US presidential election, a number of bogus articles did the rounds , including made-up stories like President Barack Obama banning the playing of the national anthem at US sporting events, and an FBI agent tied to the Hillary Clinton email scandal being found dead. \nSome critics say the spread of stories like that on Facebook tipped the election , a charge Zuckerberg last week said was \" pretty crazy ,\" adding later that the social network had made progress in addressing fake news and would continue working at it. \nEven Obama has weighed in on the issue. \n\"Particularly in the social media era, when so many get information from sound bites and snippets off their phone, if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda , then we have problems,\" the president warned during a press conference Thursday. \nZuckerberg's Friday post suggests he's aware the issue can't easily be dismissed. \n\"I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously,\" he wrote, \"we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.\" \nZuckerberg urged patience, however, saying the search for a fix would involve trial and error and that some of the solutions being explored by Facebook might not pan out. \n\"Some of these ideas will work well,\" he wrote, \"and some will not.\" \nHere's the full text of the post : \nA lot of you have asked what we're doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an update. \nThe bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously. Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done. \nHistorically, we have relied on our community to help us understand what is fake and what is not. Anyone on Facebook can report any link as false, and we use signals from those reports along with a number of others -- like people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes -- to understand which stories we can confidently classify as misinformation. Similar to clickbait, spam and scams, we penalize this content in News Feed so it's much less likely to spread. \nThe problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically. We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties. \nWhile the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap. Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway: \n- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \n- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \nSome of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right. Share your voice",

      "text": "\nThere's a lot of beauty in Google's shiny new Pixel, and that extends to the Pixel Launcher.\nThe clean lines of the redesigned Google widget atop the screen, the whimsical portholes for folder icons, the faint white bar behind the dock … Google did a lot of interesting things with its new launcher layout, and while I'm all for the Pixel look, let's face it: not all of us have 800 bucks for a Pixel. And even those with a Pixel can get fed up with the launcher's limitations when it comes to desktop grid size and icon packs. Don't worry! You don't have to give up your sweet Pixely theme just because you're giving up the Pixel Launcher.\nLuckily for us, two of the most popular replacement launchers on the market have already done most of the work for us; all we have to do is turn the proper settings on. We'll show you how to bring out the Pixel in Nova Launcher and Action Launcher , and how to put it all together.\nGoogle Wallpapers \nI've said before in themes like these that stock wallpapers are boring as hell, make me sad and shouldn't be used. Thankfully, I don't have to say that this time because the Wallpapers app that ships on the Pixel and is available on Google Play has dozens and dozens of beautiful and diverse wallpapers ranging from Google Earth and Landscapes to Life and Textures. They even have daily wallpaper settings so that your wallpaper can't get stale and sad, because you can wake up every morning to a new one! Yay!\nSee our review of Google Wallpapers \nIcons The Pixel uses round icons. Woo. Hoo. There are a lot (by which I mean a metric crapton) of round icon packs out there, but we've come to the two we prefer over all others, and indeed over the mismatched stock icons on the Pixel.\nPixel UI Icon Pack, left, and Dives - Icon Pack, right\nPixel Icon Pack (Free) is a free icon pack with the Pixel icons we've come to love (or not), along with a decent amount of themed third-party icons and a masking tool for icons that don't have an icon in the pack yet. There aren't a lot of alternate icons, but it looks decent in the app drawer and on the home screen, is easy to apply and easy to navigate if you're looking for a specific icon or alternate. Dives - Icon Pack ($0.99) is by Vertumus, a developers with some very robust and beautiful packs, and while you can find the standard Pixel icons here for stock apps along with round icons for thousands of apps, what we also have here are alternate icons for apps like Google Play Music that look SO MUCH BETTER than the one Google is using. In fact use the alt_3 icon for all the Google Play apps. Oh, and the icon pack is on sale for a dollar right now, half off its usual $2 price tag. Pixel via Action Launcher (aka the easy way) \nAction Launcher recognizes that changing settings across an entire launcher takes a while, which is why they were gracious enough to provide a shortcut. Here's how to find it again if you didn't use it the first time it popped up:\nOpen Action 3 Settings . Swipe up to scroll down to the bottom of the settings menu. Tap Help .\n\nTap Looking for Pixel Launcher features . Action Launcher will then list and explain all of the Pixel features and styles it has. It'll tell you where you can activate each individual one. Tap Apply All .\n\nAction Launcher will tell you what all it is about to change and ask you if that's what you wanted. Tap OK . Tap the back button to get back into the main menu of Action 3 Settings. Scroll up and tap Display .\n\nTap Icon pack . Select Dives or Pixel Icon Pack . Action Launcher has some of the default Pixel icon built in, but you'll want a real icon pack to put some consistency on your launcher. \nThis will get you everything for the Pixel theme except the Google search bar, which isn't available in Quickbar but instead as a standalone widget at the top of the widget drawer. While this does mean that you can put that little pill wherever you want on the screen and that you don't look the entire top bar of your screen like you do on other launchers, you can't customize the color like Action Launcher's signature Quickbars, nor can you get the date or weather. Shame.\nPixel via Nova Launcher (aka the hard way) \nNova Launcher is the Old Faithful of third-party launchers: it is beautiful, it is dependable, and it's the best quarter I ever spent in Google Play back in the day. While you can get most of the way to Pixel with the free version of Nova Launcher, you need Nova Launcher Prime for the gesture actions we're going to be using for the app drawer.\nIf you didn't already use Nova Launcher , you can import your current layout to Nova upon installing it by going into Nova Settings. In the Backup & import settings, tap Import and select your launcher. You'll have to click through a few warnings about deleting your current Nova layout, but if you just installed the launcher, you're just losing the default layout\nOpen Nova Settings . Tap Desktop . Tap Desktop grid .\n\nSet the desktop grid to 4 rows by 5 columns . Tap Done to return to Desktop settings. Tap Width Padding and select Medium . Tap Height padding and select Medium .\n\nTap Persistent search bar to turn it on. Tap Search bar style . Tap the pill-shaped Pixel Bar style .\n\nTap Bar color Set it to white . Scroll down to Logo style and select the colorful G .\n\nScroll down and tap Weather to turn on weather content in the search bar. Tap the back button twice to return to the main menu in Nova Settings. Tap App & widget drawers .\n\nTap Drawer App Grid . Set to 6 rows by 5 columns . Tap Done to return to App & widget drawer settings.\n\nTap Frequently used apps to turn it on. Tap App drawer style . Tap to select Vertical .\n\nMake sure Card background is turned off. Tap Swipe to open to turn it on. Tap Background .\n\nSelect White and set Transparency to 0% . Tap Enable fast scrollbar to turn it on. Tap Scroll accent color \n\nSelect Teal (fourth row, first column). Tap Search bar to turn it on. Tap the back button to return to the main menu in Nova Settings.\n\nTap Dock . Tap Dock Background Select Rectangle .\n\nTap Color . Select White . Drag Transparency to 70% \n\nTap Draw behind navigation bar to turn it on if you have on-screen navigation buttons. Tap the back button to return to Dock settings. Tap Dock icons .\n\nSet to 5 . Tap Done to return to Dock settings. Tap Width padding and select Medium . Tap Height padding and select Large .\n\nTap the back button to return to the main menu in Nova Settings. Tap Folders . Tap Folder Preview .\n\nSelect Grid . Tap Folder Background . Select N Preview .\n\nTap Background . Select White and set Transparency to 0% . Tap the back button to return to the main menu in Nova Settings.\n\nTap Look & feel . Tap Icon theme . Select Dives or *Pixel Icon Pack**.\n\nIf you want an extra way to swipe open your app drawer, tap Gestures & inputs . Tap Swipe up . Tap app drawer . \nGoing beyond the Pixel \nThe stock Pixel theme we've described up above brings a nice, clean, bright look to our launchers, but there's no saying we have to follow the Pixel theme to the letter. Here are a few ways to make your Pixel theme a little more flexible, fun, and fitting:\nFolder Fun: By changing the color of your folder Background in Nova or Folder icon background away from white, you can make your folders pop with a colored ring on that porthole preview. It can be a challenge to pick a hue that looks good on your theme as both a preview and folder background color, but when pulled off properly it can be quite stunning. Pretty Pill: While you can't customize the color of your Pixel search widget in Action Launcher, Nova will let you customize the color of the search bar to better match your wallpaper or theme colors. I don't know about you, but white widgets hurt my soul. Shapely Icons: If circular icons aren't your cup of tea, you can fall back on some of our favorite icon packs: the Material icon pack Glim or the monochromatic Whicons and Zwart packs go with almost any theme, Pixel included. So, how Pixely do you like your launcher? Have any circular icon packs that we may have overlooked?

Some users have been seeing a new “Cards” UI when performing searches, but this latest change can make finding new apps easier. Image courtesy of Android Police \nCurrently, when you navigate to the Top Charts within the Play Store, you are just presented with the list of applications. According to a few readers of Android Police , there is now a toggle within the Top Charts section of the Play Store which allows you to hide applications that have already been installed. \nThis update is not available for everyone just yet, but it seems these changes are not limited to a specific region. We should be seeing the update rolling out to more users over the next month or so, but let us know if you’ve already received the update.",

      "text": "Andrew Myrick Nov 19th, 2016 \nMini-shops within brick-and-mortar locations isn’t a new thing. Apple notoriously provides one of its mini-shops within various Best Buy locations, and Google has tinkered with this concept before. Now, it seems that the big “G” is going all-in on this approach. Image courtesy of TechCrunch \nStarting in Canada, Google is creating a unique way to experience all of its new products. These shops are aptly named “Google Shops” and allow customers to test out the latest and greatest products including the new Daydream View VR headset, the Pixel and Pixel XL , Google Home, and more. \nSpeaking to TechCrunch , Janell Fisher, Google’s Director of Retail Marketing has explained the reasoning behind this new approach: \nWe love it when people can come in, discover, play and have fun and it just happens to be with technology, so we’ve really tried to layer on lots of different immersive sorts of experiences, some that are direct demonstrations of the product and product features, but some that are more exploratory and fun. \nIn addition to providing a new way to experience Google’s products, the company will also be hosting various workshops and sessions. These workshops will be held within the appropriate Best Buy location and may be run by Google employees or others such as YouTubers. Image courtesy of TechCrunch \nIn addition to launching the Google Shops within Canada, Google has already launched three of these shops in the UK. The experiences will remain mostly the same, save for some subtle changes depending on the location and size of the shop. \nThe bad news is that Fischer confirmed that Google does not have anything in the works to bring this experience to those of us in the United States. This is fairly upsetting considering Google’s failed attempt to provide a different experience within Best Buy locations here in the States.",

      "text": " Google+\nJoshua Roberts/REUTERS\nHillary Clinton speaks to the Children’s Defense Fund in Washington on Nov. 16.\nBy Nancy Gertner November 18, 2016\nI take the election of Donald Trump personally not just because my candidate, Hillary Clinton, lost. I take this election personally not because Clinton was a dear friend, a classmate at Yale Law School. I take this election personally not just because it feels like the last best chance for someone of my generation — who fought the wars of Second Wave feminism — to break that final glass ceiling in national politics.\nI take this election personally because of how Trump won and what it legitimized. He won despite comments demeaning women in general, and Clinton in particular. He won after demonizing Muslims, immigrants, and black people. This is “just talk,’ some may say — not what he really felt. Or better yet, others will dismiss this as being “politically correct,” code for “don’t take it seriously.”\nAdvertisement\nI was a civil rights and criminal defense lawyer before I became a judge. The tools of exclusion against women and minorities were words — words that discouraged workplace participation, words that mocked their intelligence and their commitment. In my career, there were the words from male lawyers whose reaction to my asking advice in a high-profile murder case was for me to get out of the case. Or others who assured me that women were not tough enough to be trial lawyers. Or those who warned me that I shouldn’t be too aggressive in court, or chided me for being insufficiently aggressive. For people who have been excluded from the power structure, these words map onto their own sense of outsider status. I didn’t listen; I had supporters and mentors. Hillary didn’t either, but many were not as fortunate as we.\nWords matter. Over time the coded language of discrimination became more nuanced, but the impact was the same. To one woman applying to be a named tenured chair it was, “You don’t look like a named chair.” Which was code for: No woman has ever done this before. Another woman was rejected from a job because the standards became more rigorous than they had ever been before. The language of sexual harassment persisted, like the words of the judge who told me after court had ended how much he liked my “build.” Women — minorities, and outsiders — were fair game for words of discouragement and not just of exclusion.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign This campaign had it all: Hillary didn’t look like a president. Her voice was too shrill. Other women were mocked with unflattering pictures, labelled too fat, too aggressive, measured by their attractiveness, not their competence.\nWe should take words seriously. Even if Trump does not believe what he says, which I doubt, his words have had an impact. They have normalized a discourse about women — and minorities — we have not seen in decades. Labelling it “pc” trivializes it.\nWords matter. Words matter to the cab driver who thought that he won’t be allowed back into the United States — he is American — because his birth certificate lists his religion as “Muslim.” To the gay couple who feared the Supreme Court would withdraw protection for gay marriage. To the students who see racial slurs and ethnic slurs in line postings and signs around the campus.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s would be one thing to criticize “political correctness” in a world where the equality struggle has been won, when discrimination is the product of the aberrant individual who didn’t get the message. But that’s not the world in which we live. African-Americans are 11.4 percent of the workforce but only hold 6.7 percent of management positions. Hispanics are 16.1 percent of the total workforce but hold only 9.1 percent of management positions. Relative to their white male counterparts, African-American males earned 75.8 percent as much, Hispanic males earned 68.6 percent, African American females earned 68.1 percent, and Hispanic females earned 61.0 percent. Females earned 82.5 percent of what their male counterparts earned; and in management professions, females earned only 77.5 percent of what male managers earned. Words matter, contributing to what civil rights lawyers described as “headwinds” to equality.\nIf there is a silver lining in this election, it is only this: Trump’s campaign has made the implicit explicit, at least for those in the majority who never experienced discrimination. We are not remotely in a post-racial, post-feminist environment. Not by a long shot.\nI take this election personally.\nNancy Gertner, a retired federal judge, is a professor at Harvard Law School.",

And I appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and I look forward to the coming administration and the things that it’s going to be doing.”\nAdvertisement\nTrump cupped his hands and said “it went great” before Romney spoke.\nRomney’s meeting with Trump is a surprising development, given the animosity the two displayed toward each other only months ago.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign But Romney has been mentioned in recent days as a possible candidate for secretary of state.\nView Story Warren advises Romney to bring his ‘binders full of women’ to Trump meeting The Mass. senator remains critical as Trump transitions to the White House.\nRomney arrived at a golf club owned by Donald Trump in Bedminster, N.J., at 12:58 p.m., according to press reports. The meeting lasted about an hour and 20 minutes.\nBREAKING NEWS: @MittRomney arrives and meets with President-elect @realDonaldTrump and VP-elect @mike_pence in Bedminster, N.J. pic.twitter.com/mMvwZBreMV\n— Fox News (@FoxNews) November 19, 2016 Trump and Mike Pence, the vice-president elect, were waiting at the door to the golf club. Trump clapped his hands.\nAdvertisement\n“Mr. President-elect, how are you, sir?” Romney said.\nTrump responded with, “How are you, sir?”\nRomney then shook hands with Pence and the three walked into the clubhouse.\nRomney was the Republican nominee for president in 2012 but he was no fan of Trump during this year’s campaign. Romney said that Trump was “a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.”\nTrump responded with vitriol, calling Romney a “failed candidate” and a “choke artist.”\nThe meeting between the two could be a way to establish a rapport. But Senator Jeff Sessions cautioned about reading too much into the development. Sessions, a GOP senator from Alabama, is Trump’s nominee for attorney general.\n“I think it’s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,” Sessions said, according to Reuters. He added, “There are a lot of talented people that he (Trump) needs good relationships with. And I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things. But he will be one of those, I am sure, that’s reviewed.”\nTrump also met with Michelle Rhee and Kevin Johnson on Saturday. Rhee is the former leader of the District of Columbia’s public schools and has been mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of education. Kevin Johnson is mayor of Sacramento and a former NBA player.\nLater Trump met with Betsy DeVos, the former head of the Michigan GOP and another possible candidate for education secretary.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Yvonne Abraham Globe Staff November 19, 2016\nAron Greenfield in Austria in 1946, a year after his liberation from a labor camp by allied forces.\nNORWOOD — Aron Greenfield worries about what will become of his past.\nWill anyone remember when he’s gone?\nAdvertisement\nHe is 90 now, one of a dwindling group of men and women who saw the Holocaust with their own eyes. With every passing year, their dark chapter of history grows more distant, more abstract, more vulnerable to those who seek to deny reality.\n“Twenty years from now, when most of us survivors are gone, who are you gonna believe?” he said, sitting at his dining table on a recent morning. “The witnesses are dying out. It will be, ‘Oh yeah, another story, sure, whatever.’”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign In 1937, he lived with his parents and eight brothers and sisters in Szczakowa, Poland. People there, as everywhere, were suffering, struggling with unemployment and declining industry. Adolf Hitler gave the Greenfields’ neighbors someone to blame for their misery. No facts could dissuade them. Truth was whatever the charismatic leader said it was.\n“They had nothing to lose,” Greenfeld recalled, and Hitler had something to give. “ ‘Here is a piece of bread; keep busy. Kill the Jews; they are the problem.’ ”\nEven all these years later, it is hard for him to contemplate. He can barely sleep the night before he meets with a reporter, or appears at a middle school to give a presentation. But as long as this small, scrappy man has breath, he has to keep talking about it.\nAdvertisement\n“It is my duty,” he said. “I want the world to know what happened. They should know all the little details. They should feel what it is to watch your own father or mother being beaten in front of you, and there’s nothing you can do.”\nThe Germans marched in a couple of months after his bar mitzvah. He remembers being forced out of bed in the middle of the night to shovel snow for them. His father and three of his brothers were taken away to camps, the rest of his family pushed into a ghetto. He remembers public executions. He remembers the night of the selection, the cries of his mother when his 4-year-old sister was wrenched from her. His remaining family was loaded onto trucks, “like garbage,” driven to their deaths. He lied about his age and was sent to labor camps. He was enterprising, and lucky, defying brutality and near-starvation.\nAron Greenfield’s mother, Rosa (seated), and his sister Sarah.\nThousands fell all around him, executed by Nazis, killed by disease or cold. He awoke one frigid morning to find that the man on whose stomach he had rested his head was dead.\n“People say, ‘What did you do?’” Greenfield said. “What do you think I did, said Kaddish? I stole his shoes. By that time you didn’t believe there is a God. ‘He’s on vacation’ is what we used to say.”\nHow quickly hell descended, picking off every member of his family, save his sister Sarah. How easily it took hold. All it took was a showman, expert at turning ordinary people’s grievances to his own ends.\n“People take advantage of situations, and you find that people will do almost anything to better themselves,” he said. “When you have a politician running for office, you have no idea who he is going to be. If he gets power, he will do whatever is necessary.” You’d be amazed, he said, at how willing people are to submit to a monster who makes the right appeal.\nAllied troops liberated the last labor camp he was in, Gorlitz, in 1945. He and his sister resettled here a few years later. Aron and his wife, Martha, have run Brenner’s Children Shop in Norwood for 42 years, dispensing First Communion dresses and Boy Scout uniforms to families who have no idea what he went through to stand behind that counter.\n‘It is my duty. I want the world to know what happened. They should know all the little details.’\nUnless they ask. Deb Stone Popiel asked.\nThe mother of four, who had been shopping at Brenner’s for years, wondered about Greenfield’s accent one day, and he told her some of his story, leaving her shaken. Her son Caden, a sensitive kid about to have his own bar mitzvah, wanted to know more. He sat down with Greenfield for talks about what he had seen and learned. Maybe Caden could find a way to share that story, starting with his bar mitzvah.\nOn Saturday morning, the 13-year-old stood before his friends and family at Temple Beth Elohim in Wellesley and promised to bear witness to his friend’s past. He asked Greenfield to stand, so the congregation could honor him. He shared his mentor’s advice.\n“ ‘Always question what you read and what you are told,’ Mr. Greenfield told me. He reminded me that in the case of Hitler, all it took was one charismatic leader to lead the masses down the wrong path, because nobody questioned him.\n“Stand up for the good,” Caden continued. “Fight for the minority, and be an upstander, not a bystander.”\nThat’s the only way to make sure God doesn’t take another vacation.\nGlobe columnist Yvonne Abraham can be reached at yvonne.abraham@globe.com Follow her on Twitter @GlobeAbraham",

      "title": "Google’s Click-to-Message introduces mobile messaging to businesses",
      "text": "GUEST: \nAbout a month ago, Google announced a new addition to its AdWords platform: the click-to-message ad extension. After some regional testing, Google recently rolled this functionality out across the globe. Advertisers can now place a small button below their ad that, once clicked, will trigger an SMS straight to a mobile telephone number. This new feature aligns itself with the ever-more-mobile trend Google has been following over the last few years.\nWhat made Google introduce messaging ads? In Google’s initial statement , they mention 65% of consumers said they would consider using messaging to connect with a business to find information about a service or product.\nRecently, the 2016 Mobile Messaging Report showed 63.9% of consumers want business to be contactable and available on messaging apps. Facebook’s IQ research also shows 67% of consumers expect to message businesses more over the next two years.\nAs the data shows, consumers are becoming more and more present on mobile. Leveraging this channel with an advertisement-to-SMS feature just makes sense.\nWhat do messaging ads mean for businesses? It is particularly interesting for those businesses who target millennials. It is this demographic that are the most mobile-friendly (source: Business Insider ). With its 97% open rate and messages read within 3 minutes, SMS is an effective way to communicate with customers at scale. The issue businesses may run into is not having the time to manage all the enquiries they receive via SMS.\nIntegrating SMS into current marketing efforts will either require a hands-on approach with someone in charge of monitoring and replying to incoming SMS, or the use of automation.\nAutomating the SMS channel – chatbots and auto-responders Chatbots and messaging automation have been a central focus in the tech industry for some years. Google’s new SMS offering means some businesses will use automation behind the messaging they deliver through this channel. Consumers who use this new ad extension will do so because they want an immediate answer to their question. Any delay in a response from the company will lower the value this new channel adds. In fact, Google mentions this in the press release by saying “a timely response to the user will help engagement”.\nEverything points toward the direction of instantaneity driven by automation.\nWhat is next? This ad extension is exciting and will bring a new acquisition opportunity to businesses of all sizes across all industries. Not only that, but it will pave the way for companies to explore mobile messaging in areas aside from advertising (delivering an automation-led SMS support or enquiry line, for instance).\nThere are, however, limitations.The greatest barrier advertisers may encounter is the fact that SMS is aging technology. Back in 2014, The Guardian reported the first-ever decline in the number of SMS messages sent .\nWe all know what has been outpacing SMS growth: messaging apps. In 2015, messages delivered through WhatsApp alone overtook the number of SMS sent . So, what’s next? Apparently, messaging apps. We should expect Google to introduce a similar option to the Click-to-message extension, but integrated with their brand new messaging application, Allo.\nWhatever the future may hold for this ad extension or Google’s Allo, the birth of a new acquisition channel is an exciting opportunity for business and consumer alike.\n",

Freyer Globe Staff November 19, 2016\nFourth in a series of occasional articles on people contending with chronic pain.\nCONCORD — Sydney Durlach’s pain started with a mishap during soccer practice. She iced and elevated her injured foot, and for a time encased it in a boot. But nothing stopped the throbbing, burning, and tingling. Soon, her leg bloomed in shades of red and blue.\nMore than a year later, Sydney’s foot is still sore, the nerves signaling trouble even though the injury has healed. A wisp of a child with a radiant smile, she can’t run for more than half a minute and can’t sleep through the night.\nAdvertisement\nSydney is 13 years old, and pain is her daily companion.\nIt’s common to think of pain as an adult burden, the product of time-beaten joints and aged tissues, but pain also hobbles children. When that happens, youngsters’ suffering is often overlooked or dismissed. Or it gets chalked up to psychological issues — an approach especially troubling to some parents.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Some of these children are left alone with their pain.”\nView Story Sickle cell: an unpredictable adversary Among childhood pain syndromes, sickle cell disease stands out as an especially bedeviling condition.\nThe other side of the war on opioids Survey: Struggles for US pain patients Living in a box: stories of chronic pain\nGottschalk experienced the price of such neglect when his teenage son developed chronic pain after a knee injury. Even though he is a well-connected pediatrician, Gottschalk couldn’t find help in the Houston area. His hospital’s pain center focused on short-term problems, and the local chronic pain specialists would see only adults.\nGottschalk and his son ended up traveling to Boston for treatment.\nAdvertisement\nBut even for those who live in Boston, there’s no guarantee of good care. Johann Marin spent much of his childhood hunched over his desk at school, feeling like barbed wire was wrapped around his muscles. A doctor accused him of faking it to get out of schoolwork. His teachers ignored him. Not until he was 20 did Marin get referred to the outpatient pain clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital, where he learned coping techniques and received medication to ease his problem, diagnosed as fibromyalgia. Now 23, he just graduated from high school, will start college in January, and plans to become a doctor.\nAs recently as the 1980s, doctors sometimes operated on infants without anesthesia, believing they didn’t feel pain, or would forget it in any case. Research has since shown that the nerves don’t forget, and early pain leads to sensitivity years later.\nStill, recent federal guidelines on opioid prescribing address only adults, and the Institute of Medicine’s 2011 report on pain devoted exactly two of 364 pages to children.\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff\nSydney Durlach squeezed putty as a distraction from her pain during an appointment at Emerson Hospital.\nChronic pain in children can affect the abdomen, back, muscles, or joints — and often strikes more than one part of the body. Headaches are common. Sometimes, the pain springs from a condition such as arthritis. Other times, the pain itself is the illness, the result of a nervous system gone rogue. Girls are affected much more often than boys.\nDr. Neil Schechter, director of the Chronic Pain Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital, said physicians today do a good job managing children’s pain from surgery and injury. But chronic pain poses complex challenges, he said. It requires a lot of doctors’ time and intense collaboration among specialists — both tall orders for today’s frenzied, fragmented health care system.\nChildren’s pain is also complicated by family dynamics and psychological factors. Its intensity can rise or fall based on how children think about the pain, and how their parents react. Fear makes pain worse, and so does stress; relaxation and distraction can ease it.\nParents’ reasonable efforts to protect their children can make matters worse. Kids stay home from school, stop playing sports, let friendships lapse. Inactivity and isolation worsen symptoms — as does the constant fretting that a dangerous physical abnormality is at fault.\n“Many of the kids we see have been to a number of doctors,” Schechter said. “They’ve had endoscopies and blood work and imaging studies, and no one has found the hardware explanation to their problems.”\nSydney Durlach, the Concord girl injured at soccer practice, also had her share of imaging studies, all showing nothing wrong with her foot’s anatomy.\nInstead, as she learned a month after her accident, she has complex regional pain syndrome, a condition in which the nerves continue to send pain signals to the brain after an injury has healed. Pain, originally the body’s warning to protect a damaged limb, had now become an illness of its own.\n“I had never heard of such a thing,” said Sydney’s mother, Amy . “There’s no visible sign that there’s anything wrong with her foot. Yet there’s excruciating pain.”\nSydney could not bear to put her foot on the ground. In the shower, she sat on a stool and draped her leg outside, protecting her sensitive skin from the water’s battering. Her mother drove her to school every day, helping her out of the car and into the building, where she hobbled around on crutches. Her right calf shrank to a stick, the muscle atrophied from disuse.\nSydney was referred to the Mayo Family Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center, a treatment program in Waltham run by Boston Children’s Hospital. After months on the waiting list, she was admitted in June.\nThere she joined five other children, mostly girls, who came every weekday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., joined by their parents for the last hour of each day. Eleven staff members, including physical and occupational therapists, worked with the children to improve their functioning — making no promises about ending the pain.\nSydney needed to learn that her foot had the mechanical ability to bear weight, that pain no longer signaled a damaged joint needing protection. She took it step by step — first practicing letting her foot touch the floor, then putting weight on it, then walking with one crutch. By the end of the third week, she was able to put aside the crutches altogether.\n“It hurt like a ton,” Sydney said. “But it felt good to be able to walk with two feet.”\nFor some children, the center prescribes drugs that affect the nervous system, typically anticonvulsants or antidepressants, said Dr. Navil Sethna, clinical director. These drugs are best used short term, he said, because they tend to slow the nervous system, leading to drowsiness and difficulty with thinking and memory. Sydney, however, did not take medications, because her parents were concerned about side effects.\nInstead, she relied on the coping skills taught by the rehab center’s psychologist, Caitlin Conroy. Sydney squeezed and stretched a ball of putty, as a distraction. She learned breathing techniques to calm herself and keep moving despite the pain. And the staff urged her to think about what she would gain from persevering — being able to enjoy the activities that other kids do.\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff\nSydney’s mother, Amy, drove her to a physical therapy appointment.\nSuch coping strategies ultimately “change the physiologic response to pain and decrease nervous system sensitivity,” said Rachael Coakley, a psychologist who heads another outpatient pain program at Boston Children’s. But parents, she said, sometimes wrongly assume that a psychologist’s involvement implies the pain is a psychological problem. Instead, pain involves a complex interplay of mind and body.\n“The way you think about it has an impact on the pain,” Coakley said. “Pain is not just a biologic experience.”\nDr. F. Wickham Kraemer, medical director of the Acute and Chronic Pain Management Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the “psychological connectedness of mind and body” is especially salient in young people amid the mental and physical stresses of adolescence.\nKraemer, whose hospital has a rehab program similar to the one in Waltham, said he often tells parents, “I will not be able to give you a clear-cut diagnosis of what’s going on. I’m very rarely able to tell you, ‘This is it.’ ”\nStill, he said, doctors keep their eyes open for underlying medical problems, and worry about missing them. In rehab programs, “you push the kid to get through it. That can backfire.” He described such situations as rare.\nBut it’s those situations that worry some parents, who complain that the emphasis on psychology, while important, can risk overshadowing legitimate medical needs.\nThe Coalition Against Pediatric Pain, based in Marshfield, was founded five years ago by parents of children with complex disorders, in the hope of educating doctors and patients. Two of the five founders were parents unhappy with their children’s experiences at Boston Children’s.\nOne of them, Dr. Aurora Richards-Stipnieks, a veterinarian who lives in Medfield, said her daughter, Karen Richards, attended the Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center when she was 8, because pain persisted after a leg injury. The program taught Karen to tolerate high levels of pain but, her mother said, “No one ever stopped to ask, ‘Why the pain?’ ”\nIn the ensuing years, Richards-Stipnieks learned that her daughter, now 16, had an unusually complex set of medical conditions, related to a genetic connective-tissue disorder, Ehlers Danlos syndrome. After leaving the program, Karen had 20 surgeries. Today, she manages her pain and happily takes the train each day to private high school in Boston.\nMichaela Sullivan also attended the Children’s rehab program at age 13, after she suffered lasting pain from spinal fusion surgery to correct scoliosis. Now 18, she described her experience there as helpful but traumatic.\n“They took my [wheelchair], after I’d been in it for 10 weeks,” Sullivan said. “They made me walk without any assistance. My pain was through the roof. I just remember collapsing to the floor crying.”\nHer pain did not abate, but she did learn to walk again, and was grateful for that.\nOver the years, Sullivan’s difficulties persisted. By December of last year, she was back in a wheelchair and incontinent. A surgeon finally identified the problem — a rare condition known as tethered spinal cord, in which the spinal cord is attached to tissue around the spine and can’t move freely. The surgery to correct it in January immediately changed her life; within two weeks, she was back on her feet with the pain nearly gone. Now, she feels she needlessly lost six years of her life, and recalls bitterly “the frustration of feeling like no one really believes you.”\nDr. Pradeep Chopra, who specializes in treating rare and complex pain conditions, said he has seen children in his Pawtucket, R.I., practice who have had similar experiences.\n“These children, they had been to all the top-notch hospitals, and eventually they were told this was all psychological,” he said. And yet Chopra, who trained at Harvard and serves as a clinical faculty member at Brown University’s medical school, said that in most cases he found objective evidence of a physical disorder.\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff\nHaylee Obando (left) and her sister Helen, 13, stretched during cheerleader practice.\nSchechter, the chief of Children’s chronic pain clinic, said doctors always strive to identify the physical source of pain. But at some point, searching for an elusive answer becomes counterproductive, distracting from efforts to improve a child’s life now.\nSethna, the rehab center’s clinical director, did not have permission to discuss individual patients. He said all patients entering the program “have been seen by specialists who have ruled out all correctable causes” of their pain.\n“We are left with patients who have tried everything,” Sethna said. “Do we either help them, in the rehab approach, or have them stay where they are?” Remaining in a wheelchair can cause muscle weakness and joint contraction, and limit a child’s life experiences.\nData from Children’s Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center, as yet unpublished, show that 85 percent of participants improve significantly and continue to function well months to years after discharge. The 15 percent who don’t improve tend to have chronic medical conditions, Sethna said.\nSydney Durlach left the rehab center in late July, after six weeks of treatment. Today, she walks without crutches, attends school, and goes to physical therapy twice a week. For her, the rehab center worked as intended: “It made me feel that it wasn’t my fault and that I wasn’t alone,” she said. “They understood what I was going through and they knew how to treat it.”\nStill, since leaving the program, the 13-year-old has had six or seven “pain flare-ups,” a few days when the pain got so bad she would begin limping again.\nDuring a recent session at Emerson Hospital’s Center for Rehabilitative and Sports Therapies in Concord, physical therapist Lisa Coppola had Sydney do leg lifts, kick a soccer ball, and balance one-legged on a foam square. During the workout, Sydney often broke into her irresistible smile. Smiling, she said, is one way she copes with pain.\nHer foot hurts as badly now as it had before going to the Children’s program. But before, she had feared the pain so much she couldn’t use her leg. Now, at Coppola’s request, she balanced her full weight on her right foot, wavering slightly as she chewed gum and furiously mashed the putty.\nWill Sydney’s pain ever go away?\nSethna predicted it will someday, because children recover more fully and more quickly than adults. “Eventually,” he said, “the nervous system will reset to normal functioning.”\nAmy Durlach, Sydney’s mother, said she doesn’t think about whether the pain will end.\nAnd Sydney — she smiles. “I am happy still,” she said. “My pain isn’t going to make me not happy.”\nFelice J.

      "text": " Google+\nRichard Drew/Associated Press\nA passerby stopped to photograph Trump Tower in New York on Friday.\nBy Eric Lipton and Ellen Barry New York Times November 20, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump met in the last week in his office at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai, raising new questions about how he will separate his business dealings from the work of the government once he is in the White House.\nA spokeswoman for Trump described the meeting as a courtesy call by the three Indian real estate executives, who flew from India to congratulate Trump on his election victory. In a picture posted on Twitter, all four men are smiling and giving a thumbs-up.\nAdvertisement\n“It was not a formal meeting of any kind,” Breanna Butler, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said when asked about the meeting on Saturday.\nThe meeting was also attended by some of Trump’s children, who are running his businesses as they play a part in the presidential transition.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Butler and Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, declined to comment when asked Saturday if the meeting with the Trump family members included any discussion of Trump businesses in Indiaor expanding that business.\nThe three Indian executives — Atul Chordia, Sagar Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta — have been Quote: d in Indian newspapers, including The Economic Times, as saying they have discussed expanding their partnership with the Trump Organization now that Trump is president-elect. They could not be reached for comment Saturday night.\nWashington ethics lawyers said that a meeting with Indian real estate partners, regardless of what was discussed, raised conflict of interest questions for Trump, who could be perceived as using the presidency to advance his business interests.\nAdvertisement\n“There may be people for whom this looks OK,” said Robert L. Walker, the former chief counsel of the Senate Ethics Committee, who advises corporations and members of Congress on government ethics issues. “But for a large part of the American public, it is not going to be OK. His role as president-elect should dictate that someone else handles business matters.”\nIn an account of the meeting that appeared in The Economic Times, Trump was Quote: d as praising the United States’ relationship with India and its prime minister, Narendra Modi.\nThe Economic Times reported that the meeting occurred Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization would not confirm the day of the meeting.\nInternationally, many of Trump’s properties that bear his name are the result of marketing deals — like the one in India — in which he is paid by someone for the use of his name but does not actually own the underlying property. He has such marketing agreements in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, the Philippines and Turkey, according to a list published by his company.\nAtul Chordia and Sagar Chordia are well-known figures in real estate in Pune, a city of about 3 million people in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Their father, Ishwardas Chordia, was born into a family of sugar traders, but as a young man forged a close friendship with Sharad Pawar, who became an important politician in Maharashtra and now sits in the upper house of India’s parliament.\nBeginning in the 1990s, Chordia businesses built luxury hotels, corporate parks and residential projects in upscale neighborhoods in Pune.\nThe third executive at the meeting, Kalpesh Mehta, is the managing partner of a real estate firm named TriBeCa, which is also a part of the Trump projects in India, which go by names including Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai.\nDave Besseling, a former deputy editor at GQ India, hosted an event at Sagar Chordia’s hotel during the 2016 presidential campaign and said Chordia expressed “elation” about Trump’s candidacy and the opportunities it would bring.\nThe same week, Trump’s daughter Ivanka — an executive at the Trump Organization hotel chain — attended a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The move drew criticism from former State Department officials, given that Ivanka Trump does not have security clearance and is helping run the family business enterprises.\nSeparately, The Washington Post reported Saturday that the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington invited representatives from local embassies to the hotel after the election to encourage them to use it when leaders from their countries visited Washington.\nNoah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a liberal government watchdog group in Washington, said the meeting at Trump Tower was inappropriate even if there had not been conversation about business. “Donald Trump’s children and son-in-law have been deeply involved in the transition and selecting who will be part of his administration,” Bookbinder said. “At the same time they are deeply involved in the business. There does not seem to be any sign of a meaningful separation of Trump government operations and his business operations.”\nButler, the spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the family was moving to try to formally separate Trump from his family’s business ventures.\n“Mr. Trump is not going to have dealings in the day-to-day business of that organization,” she said.\nAnother spokeswoman for the Trump Organization added in a written statement that “the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.”\nAsked if such a separation had already taken place in the aftermath of the election, she said she did not know.\n“The transition is still being mapped,” she said.",

But people close to the 70-year-old president-elect say that he has such long-held habits formed by fame, wealth, and the freedom to have done whatever he wanted that they remain skeptical, at least for now, that he will transform to fit the constraints of the White House.\nAdvertisement\n“The presidency may change him eventually, but it’s not going to change him initially,” said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser to the Trump campaign and a Republican strategist. “He’s a man who likes a lot of input from a lot of people, and he’s someone who has an incredible instinct for the American people.”\nPeople close to Trump nonetheless say he is more focused now than he was in the first few days after his surprise victory. He was nervous and jolted, they said, by the 90-minute Oval Office meeting with Obama, and for the first time appeared to take in the enormousness of the job.\nHe is proud, they say, that he has so rapidly named people for his Cabinet and senior staff, including a group of hawks and hard-line loyalists: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general, Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as director of the CIA, and Stephen Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News, as chief strategist.\n“Ahead of schedule, under budget, high energy, trust and loyalty — there’s just a pattern to the whole thing,” said Richard F. Hohlt, a longtime Republican lobbyist. “That’s his mark of success.”\nLoyalty, however, goes only so far.\nThere were initial reports from senior officials within Trump’s orbit that Giuliani, Trump’s most fervent supporter in the campaign’s final weeks, was the leading candidate for secretary of state. But the headlines about Giuliani’s business interests bothered Trump, who was urged by several business leaders and some media hosts to reconsider the option. Suddenly, he arranged a Saturday meeting with one of his fiercest critics, Mitt Romney, at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.\nTransition officials say the meeting with Romney, a moderate Republican who was the party’s nominee for president in 2012, may not have been simply for show. They say that Trump believes that Romney looks the part of a top diplomat right out of “central casting” — the same phrase Trump used to describe Mike Pence before choosing him as his running mate. Yet Trump is worried, his aides say, that he will not be able to keep his Android phone once he gets to the White House and wonders aloud how isolated he will become — and whether he will be able to keep in touch with his friends — without it as president. He continues to discuss with the Secret Service how much he can return on weekends to Trump Tower.\nThe Trump International Hotel in Washington, five blocks from the White House, could also take on an outsize role in the Trump administration. His children may stay there when they come to the nation’s capital, and there is chatter that it may supplant Blair House, which traditionally hosts foreign dignitaries visiting the president.\nBut for now, Trump seems most comfortable running the show from Trump Tower.\n“I’ve witnessed him as a businessman sitting at the desk; I’ve witnessed him as a potential candidate sitting at the desk; I’ve witnessed him as a candidate sitting at the desk; and I’ve now witnessed him as the president-elect sitting at the desk,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser.\n“It’s a comfortable environment,” she added, “but now the stakes are higher.”",

      "text": " Google+\nJustin Saglio for the Boston Globe\nNatick High School students Titi Scorzailo (left) and Bela Ghosh (right) spoke at a rally for peace and solidarity.\nBy Nicole Fleming Globe Correspondent November 20, 2016\nMore than 100 people crowded around the gazebo on the Natick Common Saturday afternoon to show solidarity against discrimination and comments made by President-elect Donald J. Trump, displaying handmade signs and shouting “Black lives matter!”\nBéla Ghosh, an 18-year-old senior at Natick High School, addressed the crowd and offered instructions “for our white allies, for our Christian allies, for our male allies, and for our straight allies” in an impromptu speech to the audience.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s time to get uncomfortable,” said Ghosh, founder and president of the InterFem student group at her high school. “To pretend like Trump caused racism is so ignorant. There has been racism in Natick for all 18 years of my existence. I’ve been uncomfortable for all 18 years of my existence.”\nA week earlier, a town resident posted on Facebook photos of racist, slur-filled letters he received , referencing Trump’s victory and telling the Elm Street resident that “Natick has no tolerance for black people.” Danelle Wylder and her partner Judy Heithmar organized Saturday’s rally with a Facebook event , to show support for the resident and other members of the community experiencing discrimination. Police said they were investigating the letter incident as a possible hate crime.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

I worry about the safety of my family every day. And I worry about my own safety every day,” Scorzailo said. “I want to represent this school because I know so many students who don’t understand what’s going on, and I want to show them that the kid who sits next to them in science is struggling every day.”\nMany young children were in the crowd, which some parents said was to show the next generation the importance of standing up against ignorance and hatred.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m not used to putting my face out there and screaming ‘Black lives matter!’ but I think that it’s important that people who care about these issues not be afraid to stand up and open their mouths and open their doors,” said Meredith Cutler, a Natick resident who displayed a rainbow sign painted by her 6-year-old daughter. “Because clearly the racism is really embedded.”\nEleonora Tulaba, a friend of Cutler’s and also a Natick resident, brought her 4-month-old daughter and 5-year-old son to the rally, along with her husband. Even though it might seem like bigots were not “messing with me personally — they are, because they’re messing with my neighbors,” she said.\nMembers of the audience squinted against the sun as they listened to the speakers and held up signs: “HONK FOR PEACE,” “NO RACISM, FULL STOP,” “BLACK LIVES MATTER.”\n“If you look around, there are not a whole lot of people who look like me in this crowd,” said Alison Smith, 29, a black Natick resident who took the microphone at the gazebo with her 4-year-old daughter McKayla.\n“I walk around with that, every single day,” said Smith. “Every single day. And the bigots in our community — I want them to feel that. I want them to feel ‘othered.’ I want them to know that they are the outliers, and not us.”\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and began a chant of “Black lives matter.”\n“It’s time for white people specifically to educate themselves on the embedded racism in all of our structures,” said Tina Opie, a black Natick resident.\nSomeone called police on her son once when he was in Wellesley — “falsely, thank God, there were video cameras and evidence.” Her son was described as a “full-grown man,” she said.\nOpie said her son was 11 years old at the time.\nOpie and other speakers said rallies aren’t enough.\nCommunities must be vigilant in combating prejudice in their day-to-day actions, they said.\n“We have got to move beyond balloons and signs and rallies, to getting to understand each other . . . and confronting the racism that is within many, many people,” Opie said.\nJustin Saglio for the Boston Globe\nAttendees gathered on Natick Common at a rally for peace and solidarity on Saturday.\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nAdam Glanzman/Getty Images\nHarvard quarterback Joe Viviano was under heavy pressure as he looked to throw in the second quarter.\nBy Julian Benbow Globe Staff November 19, 2016\nAs he was wrapping up preparations for Yale, knowing all that was riding on the 133rd edition of The Game — at least a share of the Ivy League title, a chance to beat an archrival for the 10th straight year — something told Harvard coach Tim Murphy to make sure he had covered all the bases.\nHe warned his players that Yale’s 2-7 record didn’t matter. They could throw records out the window and expect the kitchen sink to be thrown at them.\nAdvertisement\nThe last thing Murphy went over with his team Friday night was the possibility that Yale would break out a fake field goal. The Crimson had seen the Bulldogs do it on film, and Murphy wanted to make sure his players kept it in the back of their minds on game day.\n“But in the heat of the moment,” he said, “it’s easier said than done.”\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here When the Crimson lined up on defense on fourth and 4 from the Harvard 19 late in the second quarter, the thought of Yale pulling a trick out of its bag never crossed their minds.\nBox score: Yale 21, Harvard 14\nYale holder Andrew Johnson then hopped up and floated a pass over the line of scrimmage that barely reached tight end Leo Haenni for a 16-yard gain. It moved the Bulldogs to the 3-yard line. Three plays later, running back Alan Lamar punched in a touchdown from the 1 to tie the game at 7.\nAll Murphy could do was shake his head.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s just ironic,” he said afterward. “I said to myself, ‘Wow, that’s the last thing we covered in special teams on Friday.’ ”\nThe play gave Yale momentum going into halftime, and the Bulldogs never let go of it. They pulled out all the stops to snap a nine-game losing streak against Harvard and pull out a 21-14 win that spoiled the Crimson’s season.\n“When we think we have an opportunity to gain an advantage, we do it — no matter if we’re playing Harvard or if we’re playing anybody else,” said Yale coach Tony Reno.\nIn his five years as coach, Reno had never been able to pull out a win over the Crimson. He said his team came in with the mentality to take any edge it could find. After snatching momentum at the end of the first half, the Bulldogs jumped at the chance to run with it in the second.\nYale (3-7, 3-4) had picked up on some tendencies in Harvard’s kickoff return team in the first half, and the Bulldogs decided to test out an onside kick to start the second half.\nKicker Alex Galland softly booted the ball, and he followed it for 10 yards before smothering it and giving the Bulldogs possession.\n“When you get into nine games of film on opponents, there’s a lot of tendencies that build up,” Reno said. “It was a tendency there. We felt that would be a really good opportunity for us. We saw it, we confirmed it in the first half, and we took a shot at it.”\nFour plays later, Yale freshman quarterback Kurt Rawlings hit sophomore wideout Reed Klubnik for a 28-yard touchdown that put the Bulldogs ahead, 14-7.\n“Really the only turnover the entire game was the onside kick, which proved to be the pivotal play for a lot of different reasons,” Murphy said.\nHarvard (7-3, 5-2) managed to even things up later in the quarter, putting together a 10-play, 84-yard drive capped by a 1-yard touchdown pass from Joe Viviano to Ryan Halvorson, but the Crimson let crucial opportunities slip through their fingers.\nWith a chance to take the lead in the fourth quarter, kicker Jake McIntyre missed a 35-yard field goal attempt.\nYale could sense a win was within reach. While Crimson players urged the crowd to make noise, looking to draw some energy, there was the surreal sight of a number of Bulldogs fans stripped down to their underwear (and in some cases less) howling from the stands.\nWhen Rawlings found Klubnik for a 3-yard touchdown pass with 4:14 left, Harvard’s fate was all but sealed.\nThe Crimson’s hopes of becoming the first team since Penn to win four straight Ivy League championships were shattered. Penn and Princeton split the Ivy crown with wins in their season finales.\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Murphy said. “It’s heartbreaking for our seniors because they had a chance to win an Ivy League championship. It’s heartbreaking for our seniors because at the end of the day, this game’s about pride — pride in our team, pride in our program, and certainly pride in our school.\n“So yeah, it’s heartbreaking. You realize you worked all 320 days a year, you only get 10 opportunities, and obviously it culminates in the Harvard-Yale game. I just feel terrible for our kids.”\nBut for Yale, the win was a gratifying finish to a trying season.\n“You grow as a season goes on, and this team grew,” said Reno. “Sometimes it wasn’t easy to see in the score, sometimes it wasn’t easy to see in yardage, but what we saw today was all the hard work these kids have put in all season long.”\nJulian Benbow can be reached at jbenbow@globe.com .

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nAn interview with Katy Whelan by Dave Hodges, former CSS Health Reporter, Prepared for The Common Sense Show This is the best researched article on the topic of medical marijuana. Government has known of marijuana’s healing properties for 30 years and covering up the facts http://www.naturalnews.com/049651_medicinal_marijuana_federal_government_street_meth.html\n(NaturalNews) There’s a massive deception taking place at both the state and federal levels of American government as it pertains to the possession and use of all-natural cannabis, or as it is more commonly known, marijuana. As it turns out, the federal government, which still claims that there’s absolutely no medicinal use for cannabis, quietly holds two patents on cannabis as medicine , a specious hypocrisy and tyrannical affront to health and medical freedom in this so-called republic.\nFor more than 30 years, in fact, the Feds have known full well that cannabis contains unique cannabinoid compounds and antioxidants that act as natural neuroprotectants, protecting the human brain and body against disease.\nCannabis oil cures man’s cancer after he was given 18 months to live: why real cancer cures are always outlawed http://www.naturalnews.com/051009_marijuana_cancer_cure_cannabis.html\n(NaturalNews) A 33-year-old father from the U.K. is completely cancer-free, but not because of chemotherapy or radiation. David Hibbitt’s doctors diagnosed him with a “terminal” case of bowel cancer that they said would kill him within 18 months, but he successfully eliminated this cancer on his own by taking therapeutic doses of cannabis oil at a cost of about $75 per month. Father arrested in Australia for successfully treating his dying cancer-ridden toddler with cannabis oil\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/048297_cannabis_oil_natural_medicine_Australia.html\nThe doctors at Lady Cliento Children’s Hospital claimed that there was a 50 percent chance of her recovery with conventional therapy, which started with surgery and is continuing with an 8- to 12-month series of chemotherapy treatments.\nAdam had decided to find and use medical-grade cannabis to help Rumer Rose recover. Adam claims he was just using high-CBD and low- or no-THC cannabis oil as an adjunct to “increase her chances of survival beyond 50 percent.” [2]\nBut Adam was surprised beyond what he had expected with Rumer Rose’s improvement from the medical-grade marijuana. He reported on his Facebook page “Fearless Father” that “Her cancer-ridden little body was ALIVE AGAIN – Rumer had almost instant quality of life.”\nCan cannabis prevent or reverse Alzheimer’s? http://www.naturalnews.com/049789_medical_cannabis_Alzheimers_dementia_remedies.html\n(NaturalNews) You’ve probably read about the positive effects of coconut oil’s medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to produce ketones that energize brain cells with dysfunctional brain metabolism and even reverse Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\nAlzheimer’s rate of occurrence has increased exponentially over the past few decades and has positioned itself near the elite disease killers of heart disease and cancer.\nThere are also herbs from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda that are helpful, while Big Pharma flounders with toxic failures to create a profitable Alzheimer’s pharmaceutical that might help more than harm. And now there may be another effective non-pharmaceutical solution to add: Cannabis\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/049789_medical_cannabis_Alzheimers_dementia_remedies.html\nPharmaceutical painkiller deaths drop 25% in states with medical marijuana according to study http://www.naturalnews.com/049671_medical_marijuana_prescription_painkillers_opioids.htm l\n(NaturalNews) Groundbreaking research published in the respected journal JAMA Internal Medicine has revealed new benefits to the denouement of marijuana prohibition throughout the U.S. It turns out that states where medical cannabis use is no longer a criminal offense are reporting substantially fewer deaths associated with pharmaceutical painkiller use, suggesting that more people in legalized states are turning to the safe cannabis herb for pain relief rather than Big Pharma’s death pills.\nMan who treated stage III COPD with cannabis off all meds and back to work full time http://www.naturalnews.com/048001_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease_cannabis_oil_medical_marijuana.html\n(NaturalNews) Back in April of 2014, this author presented an article about how cannabis is very helpful for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The story of Jeff Waters, diagnosed with stage III COPD at the age of 36, was featured in that article. Some may wonder how he’s doing now\nJeff was on 15 pharmaceuticals including COPD drugs, high blood pressure meds and drugs for depression, anxiety, aggression, high cholesterol, insomnia and pain. Acute upper respiratory disease is a black box warning on some of them\nThough residing in a non-medical marijuana state, Jeff managed to get his hands on FECO (full-extract cannabis oil) made with full-spectrum cannabis that includes THC and uses grain alcohol as the solvent. He managed to get up to a half gram twice dailyJeff proudly states, “Now my inhalers and nebulizers collect dust in storage and I sold my oxygen concentrator and I walk every day and occasionally jog. I no longer set limits on what exercise or anything else I can do!”\nAs with most COPD cases, Jeff couldn’t work and was on disability. He wanted to go back to work but had to be selective. Many work places do drug checks and don’t understand marijuana’s medicinal properties, especially in a non-medical marijuana state. He’s proud to report that he’s working full time now, in a local grocery store\nTerminal stage IV lung cancer patient miraculously cured by cannabis oil http://www.naturalnews.com/047924_lung_cancer_cannabis_oil_medical_marijuana.html\n(NaturalNews) An Australian woman in her mid-50s recently posted a YouTube video explaining how she has eliminated her stage IV lung cancer with cannabis after being given a death sentence of six months with no treatment. Her oncologist suggested chemo as an option, but it wouldn’t cure her cancer. It would only prolong her life a few months with chemo side effects.\nTo protect her anonymity, she refers to everyone by title (husband, oncologist, etc), but she displays before and after PET scans in the video to prove that cannabis did indeed remove all traces of lung cancer within three months\nCannabis dissolves cancerous tumor in young infant, deemed a ‘miracle baby’ by physician http://www.naturalnews.com/046994_cannabis_cancerous_tumors_miracle_baby.html\n(NaturalNews) Instead of opting for chemotherapy and radiation in an attempt to shrink an inoperable brain tumor, the father of an eight-month-old baby pushed for alternative treatment with cannabis oil. The baby’s physician, Dr. William Courtney, was initially skeptical early in his career about cannabis as medicine but has since seen such impressive results that he’s now a staunch advocate for its use.\n“They were putting cannabinoid oil on the baby’s pacifier twice a day, increasing the dose… And within two months there was a dramatic reduction, enough that the pediatric oncologist allowed them to go ahead with not pursuing traditional therapy,” said Dr. Courtney in an interview with The Huffington Post .\nAt four months, the tumor was completely gone. And after eight months of treatment, the brain tissue was considered completely normal\n Cannabis kicks Lyme disease to the curb http://www.naturalnews.com/043834_cannabis_Lyme_disease_medical_marijuana.html\nWith Lyme disease, there are so many symptoms, so many debilitating, agonizing manifestations, that it’s often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, lupus or a mental issue.\nLyme disease is caused by a spirochetal bacteria of the Borrelia genus. Spirochetes are composed of about 40% DNA and have double-membrane envelopes that make them difficult to trace and kill. They’re apparently able to hide in deep tissue and change shapes to disguise their identities.\nGoing through the medical system with Lyme disease is like being a ball in an old fashioned pinball game machine. Being on antibiotics forever is risking serious adverse events or at least reducing one’s immunity to invite all sorts of other complications.\nAll this without a complete cure. But now there is considerable hope with cannabis.\nShelly White’s Lyme disease was so debilitating that she had endured at least 10 seizures daily for a year and a half. She began smoking marijuana from a pipe and then switched to inhaling it through a vaporizer. Just from that, her seizures had stopped. Then she decided to go to the next level of using cannabis oil.\nAfter a month of the oil, she was able to return to work and school. At the time of writing her story, she was happy to announce that she could now move out and live on her own and enjoy a normal social life. [2]\nCannabis oil cures terminal cancer in 3-year-old after pharmaceutical drugs fail miserably http://www.naturalnews.com/051881_cannabis_oil_cancer_treatment_Big_Pharma.html\n(NaturalNews) A 3 year-old Utah boy, diagnosed with leukemia and told by doctors that he had mere days to live, is now alive and well not because he continued his chemotherapy, but because he obtained cannabis oil treatment instead. (1)\nThe family, fed up with the fact that the only treatment doctors could recommend was chemotherapy–even after little Landon Riddle kept vomiting dozens of times daily and refused to eat after two months of chemo–looked into cannabis oil treatment. After reading up about it online and researching the details, they traveled to Colorado where such a treatment is legal, to help Landon. (1)\nRead this story entire story. The video, which can be viewed in this article here , explains that the family was initially given an ultimatum: continue years of chemo and steroid treatments or refuse it, and potentially have Landon removed from their care. A lawyer willing to take on the case stepped in, expressing his thoughts that there is nothing detrimental about the family’s intentions.\nBut rather than give in to a death sentence and play into Big Pharma’s only recommendation, Landon began cannabis oil treatments. The results have been incredible. (1)\nWithin just days of the treatment, Landon showed signs of improvement. Instead of withering away, his appetite surged and his vomiting lessened. He rebounded, and as explained on a CNN video, is still cancer -free even months later. (1)\nRick Simpson and Race From The Cure video. PLEASE WATCH AND PASS THIS ON!\nhttp://phoenixtears.ca/\nPlease watch the video I have posted on my blog . Race from the cure. How a man named Rick Simpson procured a method of distillation of Cannabis oil and it’s been curing cancer in countless people. He went through hell helping people in his community and having amazing success and the Canadian government shut him down and for all intents and purposes chased him out of Canada. You may have trouble finding the video as the powers that be are doing everything they can do rid the internet of this video.. I found a version so please watch this and pass it on.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaSwtEbioNk\n20 Studies That Prove Cannabis Can Cure Cancer http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/20-studies-that-prove-cannabis-can-cure.html\nBrain Cancer 1. A study published in the British Journal of Cancer , conducted by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Complutense University in Madrid, this study determined that Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids inhibit tumour growth. They were responsible for the first clinical study aimed at assessing cannabinoid antitumoral action. Cannabinoid delivery was safe and was achieved with zero psychoactive effects. THC was found to decrease tumor cells in two out of the nine patients.\n2. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience examined the biochemical events in both acute neuronal damage and in slowly progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. They conducted a magnetic resonance imaging study that looked at THC (the main active compound in marijuana) and found that it reduced neuronal injury in rats. The results of this study provide evidence that the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.\n3. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics already acknowledged the fact that cannabinoids have been shown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of cannabidiol (CBD, non psychoactive cannabinoid compound) on human glioma cell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the viability of glioma cells. Glioma is the word used to describe brain tumor. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a significant antitumor activity.\n4. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics outlines how brain tumors are highly resistant to current anticancer treatments, which makes it crucial to find new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the poor prognosis of patients suffering from this disease. This study also demonstrated the reversal of tumor activity in Glioblastoma multiforme.\nBreast Cancer 5. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine , conducted by the California Pacific Medical Centre determined that cannabidiol (CBD) inhibits human breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. They also demonstrated that CBD significantly reduces tumor mass.\n6. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics determined that THC as well as cannabidiol dramatically reduced breast cancer cell growth. They confirmed the potency and effectiveness of these compounds.\n7. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer showed that THC reduced tumor growth and tumor numbers. They determined that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell proliferation, induce cancer cell apoptosis and impair tumor angiogenesis (all good things). This study provides strong evidence for the use of cannabinoid based therapies for the management of breast cancer.\n8. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) determined that cannabinoids inhibit human breast cancer cell proliferation. Lung Cancer 9. A study published in the journal Oncogene , by Harvard Medical School’s Experimental Medicine Department determined that THC inhibits epithelial growth factor induced lung cancer cell migration and more. They go on to state that THC should be explored as novel therapeutic molecules in controlling the growth and metastasis of certain lung cancers.\n10. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine by the Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology, from the Department of General Surgery in Germany determined that cannabinoids inhibit cancer cell invasion. Effects were confirmed in primary tumor cells from a lung cancer patient. Overall, data indicated that cannabinoids decrease cancer cell invasiveness.\n11. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine , conducted by Harvard Medical School investigated the role of cannabinoid receptors in lung cancer cells. They determined its effectiveness and suggested that it should be used for treatment against lung cancer cells. Prostate Cancer\n12. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine illustrates a decrease in prostatic cancer cells by acting through cannabinoid receptors. 13. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine outlined multiple studies proving the effectiveness of cannabis on prostate cancer.\n14. Another study published by the US National Library of Medicine determined that clinical testing of CBD against prostate carcinoma is a must. That cannabinoid receptor activation induces prostate carcinoma cell apoptosis. They determined that cannabidiol significantly inhibited cell viability.\nBlood Cancer\n15. A study published in the journal Molecular Pharmacology recently showed that cannabinoids induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in mantle cell lymphoma. The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Society, The Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm.\n16. A study published in the International Journal of Cancer also determined and illustrated that cannabinoids exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various types of cancer and in mantle cell lymphoma.\n17. A study published in the US National Library of Medicine conducted by the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology by Virginia Commonwealth University determined that cannabinoids induce apoptosis in leukemia cells.\nOral Cancer 18. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine results show cannabinoids are potent inhibitors of cellular respiration and are toxic to highly malignant oral tumors. Liver Cancer 19. A study published by the US National Library of Medicine determined that that THC reduces the viability of human HCC cell lines (Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line) and reduced the growth. Pancreatic Cancer 20. A study published in The American Journal of Cancer determined that cannabinoid receptors are expressed in human pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumor biopsies at much higher levels than in normal pancreatic tissue. Results showed that cannabinoid administration induced apoptosis. They also reduced the growth of tumor cells, and inhibited the spreading of pancreatic tumor cells.\nPODCAST FOR THE SHOW BIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

      "text": "Derbyshire Youth Court heard details of the case (Picture: Google Street View) A 15-year-old immigrant who raped a five-year-old boy in a bathroom and said he would ‘break him into pieces’ has been handed a rehabilitation order.\nThe teenager, who cannot be named, told the victim to perform a sex act on him just months after arriving in the UK from Europe to be with his father.\nDad accidentally glues his eye closed with superglue He threatened the five-year-old not to tell anyone and then started crying in a bedroom immediately after committing the rape.\nThe victim told his mum what had happened the day after the attack in Derby on October 30 last year and the 15-year-old was arrested.\nThe teenager admitted rape but was spared jail when he was handed a three-year youth rehabilitation order at Derbyshire Youth Court.\nSentencing, Judge Jonathan Bennett said: ‘This was a very unpleasant offence against a young boy and experts will want to work with you to ensure this will never be repeated again.\n‘There are a number of troubling issues I have read about you in your background and if I was sentencing an adult for an offence as serious as this they would receive a very substantial period in prison.\n‘However, this does not apply to you as a youth and there are different guidelines for someone your age.\nCannabis blamed after man strangled his gran then drowned his aunt in a bath ‘You came to the UK not long before this offence took place.\n‘It is clear that one of the reasons you came to this country was because your mother was struggling to bring you up and you were reunited with your father who you have not had much contact with in the past.’\nProsecutor Gordon Aspen said the teen and his victim were at the property when the 15-year-old ordered the boy to carry out a sex act on him.\nHe added: ‘The following day the victim told his mother what had happened when they were walking together in Normanton.\n‘He said immediately afterward the teenager said to him ‘if you tell anyone I will break you into pieces’.\nPlumber who won £14,000,000 on lottery turned up for work next day ‘He then said he saw the defendant in a bedroom crying. She sent a text message to the teenager’s father telling him she was going to the police.’\nSpeaking through an interpreter in a police interview, the rapist admitted carrying out the sex attack and told officers: ‘I have been bad’.\nThe teenager was handed a six-month curfew confining him to his home address in Normanton, Derby, between 7pm and 6am each day for the first two months.\nHe was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order forbidding him to have unsupervised contact with anyone aged under 13 without their parent or guardian’s consent.\nThe youth was further handed a restraining order forbidding him from contacting his victim for five years.\nHis father was also given a 12-month parenting order to assist him as he brings the boy up.\nAlwyn Jones, defending, said: ‘I hope this will address the underlying issues this young man has.’",

      "text": "Google’s hidden list of Glass features paints a bright future \nSometimes it’s easy to forget that we really are living in the future. Star Trek communicators are basically dumbed down smartphones; we now have laser beams that sanitize skin for surgery, and… of course, we’ve got self-driving cars (not as cool as the flying kind, but way safer for sure). But even with all that, now and then, something comes along that just floors me. \nTake this megaphone, for example. It’s basically a universal translator. You speak into the normal speaking end, tap some buttons, and it automagically translates what you said into English, Chinese, or Korean. And it does this in a matter of seconds. Not perfect, by any means, but it’s a huge step towards the future. \nPanasonic developed the device dubbed “The Megahonyaku,” a portmanteau that plays on the Japanese words for “megaphone” and translation. It comes with 300 or so phrases that it can understand, and, if you’d prefer not to speak, you can select which command you’d like using a touchscreen. Some of the phrases include “Please form a single line,” and “the train has been delayed,” but users can add more themselves or download new ones. \nForeigners have been trekking to Japan either for vacation or business in record numbers recently. That’s made it more difficult for the relatively monolingual island nation to communicate effectively with visitors. The hope is that this will help Japanese workers speak to and advise tourists and professionals about important information. It’s also being considered for use during emergencies and can translate reasonably well regardless of background noise. \nThe Megahonyaku will cost about $200 a month via a subscription service with Panasonic — so not exactly affordable for most of us. But the company is targeting the device at businesses that staff high-traffic areas like airports and tourist areas. The device should go on sale later this year. Share",

      "text": "print \nNEW YORK — Google just opened its first retail store, just a few short blocks from one of New York City's many Apple stores. \nBut it's not the usual retail experience: It's a pop-up store, intended to showcase the range of new \"Made by Google\" products. That's everything from the just-released Google Pixel phone to its Amazon Echo competitor, Google Home (to say nothing of all the other stuff). \nThe store officially opened on Thursday, October 20. Ahead of that, Google offered Business Insider an early peek at what customers can expect. Here's what we saw! View As: One Page Slides The Google pop-up store is at 96 Spring St. in beautiful downtown Manhattan. Planning a visit? It's between Broadway and Mercer, and it opens at 10 a.m. every day. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is this massive wooden fountain of light. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider And this gigantic wall of colored blocks. (Its design changes every now and again.) Ben Gilbert / Business Insider But you're here for Google products, right? That's what the whole store is about! Ben Gilbert / Business Insider The focus of the 'Made by Google' pop-up is Google's new phone, the Pixel. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Customers can try out the phone, which is otherwise sold only at Verizon stores and online through Google. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider You can also check out the new custom cases for the Pixel, which are quite fetching. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Not bad, right? Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Did you know there's a little button on the new cases that can do stuff on the Pixel? It's that tiny symbol in the middle, below the fingerprint sensor. You can program it to do various things, like automatically turn on your flashlight. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Anyway, beyond phones, there's lots of other stuff in Google's pop-up store. A whole area is dedicated to showing off Google Home, the Amazon Echo competitor. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider You can check out the various looks for Google Home — the bottom portion can be swapped with a variety of other colored bases. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider Better yet, there are two rooms, a kitchen and a living room, meant to exemplify the experience with Google Home. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider There were even some cute little hidden items in the kitchen, like this Saint Pablo candle. (Praise be to 'Ye.) Ben Gilbert / Business Insider And this Google-branded box of cornflakes. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider The largest section of the store, without a doubt, is dedicated to Google's new virtual reality headset: Daydream View. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider You can check out the headset up close before trying it on. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider The headset is covered in a comfortable microfiber, similar to fabric on sweatpants and other sportswear. And, as you see here, it comes with a relatively basic controller. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider The Daydream View headset is actually powered by the Google Pixel phone, so each of these headsets has a phone strapped to the front. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider You can see it here pretty clearly from the side. That's definitely a phone in there! Ben Gilbert / Business Insider In the store, after strapping on the headset, you're seated in a swivel chair — which is good, because it makes looking around in VR easier than ever: Ben Gilbert / Business Insider When you're not busy trying out VR, there's this bizarre spheroid object made of tablets to, uh, look at? I guess? Ben Gilbert / Business Insider And you could always take a load off on these steps. Ben Gilbert / Business Insider If you like anything you see here, you can't actually buy it on the spot. This is an 'experience' store — you'll need to go online to order it. Google The Google pop-up store opened to the public on Thursday, October 20, and it'll be open through the end of 2016. It's at 96 Spring St. in downtown Manhattan — right here: Google",

      "text": "Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp \nSaturday Night Live opened this week with Alec Baldwin returning as a flustered Trump confronting the reality of having to come through on his many campaign promises. Baldwin was again across from Kate McKinnon , except instead of doing her Hillary she transformed into a regretful Kellyanne Conway (Trump's final campaign manager.) \nHosted by former cast member and break out star Kristen Wiig , SNL kept up its cameo streak, with both Steve Martin and Will Forte joining Wiig onstage for the opening monologue, which was just a little educational ditty about Thanksgiving. \nThe upcoming holiday, along with post-election blues was a major theme for the show, and they really nailed the spirit of the season with perhaps the most brutally honest Target commercial ever. \nThe return of Wiig (it was her second time hosting) was uniquely comforting and cozy, with the cast clearly enjoying playing against her and visibly beaming at her during skits as she inhabited some of the characters she originated, including the excitable Sue. \nIt was truly delightful to watch her and McKinnon side by side as two flirty and elderly cat enthusiasts on \"Whiskers R We\", both seemingly on the verge of breaking the entire time. \nHowever there was at least one viewer who wasn't feeling the love for Wiig's cozy homecoming. Taking to his late night Twitter, President-elect Trump blasted it as a \"totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" \nWhile SNL has been unapologetically pro-Clinton throughout the election, it did take a moment this week to poke a little gentle fun at its own with a high-concept commercial for \"The Bubble\"- a sophisticated urban community determined to go on as though the election never happened and half the country doesn't exist, literally cut off from the world in a bubble. \nSNL returns 11/22 with host Joseph Gordon-Levitt and musical guest Dave Matthews Band.",

      "text": "Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp \nIf you're fearing a heated debate around the Thanksgiving table this year, PBS has your back with a special the whole family can enjoy no matter how they voted: Anne of Green Gables , starring Martin Sheen as Matthew Cuthbert and Ella Ballantine as the titular Anne Shirley. \nReleased originally in Canada this past February, Sheen's TV movie re-telling of L.M. Montgomery's beloved novel is far removed from currents events and issues; and that's just the way we like it this holiday season. Who needs to loudly proclaim, \"I'm moving to Canada!\" when you can just visit our neighbors to the north on TV? \nAnd Anne as a character is experiencing a bit of a renaissance this year: Netflix and the CBC have teamed up to produce a Green Gables reboot titled simply Anne , which they are touting as a grittier, more hardcore version of the beloved L.M. Montgomery novel. \n5 Things to Know About Netflix's Anne of Green Gables Reboot \nWhy the sudden renewed interest in the world's most famous Canadian redhead? \n\"Anne's a clear reflection of how we used to entertain ourselves and educate ourselves before cell phones, before television, before the internet. I think it's very important, particularly for young people today, to have a chance to visit the past in order to suggest a better possibility for the future,\" Sheen told Parade . \nYes, there's nothing like watching TV to help you entertain yourself without TV. Wait what? \n\"This is one of those great, classic stories out of Canada.\" Sheen continued. \nSay no more, we're sold! There's no way Aunt Phyllis can work in a political rant about this one. You too can enjoy watching it in a blissful, cozy truce with the whole family on November 24 at 8/7c on PBS.",

      "text": "0 \nKanye West put on a spectacle for his fans in Sacramento, California Saturday night (November 19), reportedly performing three songs, bringing out Kid Cudi, going on another extended rant that took shots at people and organizations across a broad spectrum and then cutting the show short after about 30 minutes. \nThe erratic performance came only days after Kanye’s last politically fueled tirade, where he proclaimed his support for president-elect Donald Trump . \nBringing Kid Cudi out for an emotional moment of reconciliation, the two hugged it out on the floating stage as throngs of people watched from below. Cudi and Kanye’s relationship went through some turmoil in September , ahead of Cudi checking into rehab for depression . Kanye West and Kid Cudi hugging it out on stage! BEEF SQUASHED! pic.twitter.com/Xhb3riEG4L \n— DJ Akademiks (@IamAkademiks) November 20, 2016 \nKanye then went on a lengthy rant, veering from topic to topic and occasionally pausing to address the crowd’s increasing boos. \nHere are some key points, divided by topic. Watch the full rant below. On Obama \n“Obama couldn’t make America great. Because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this [yells] and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bruh. On Beyonce \n“Beyoncé, I was hurt, because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won video of the year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling.’ Now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé, she is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bro. I’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth.” On Jay Z \n“Jay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t call me. Jay Z, call me. Hey, bro, Jay Z, I know you’ve got killers. Please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man.” On Equality \n“I’m not trying to be the man, I’m just a man. The same as everybody here. I ain’t above or below none of y’all. We all equal. This is the vibes, bruh. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again.” On Feelings \n“You don’t like that. Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way muthafuckas put money up so high. Popularity. Radio spins. Feelings matter, bruh. It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton. It’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way, and they showed you how they felt […] It’s a new world Barack. It’s a new world Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro, this ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We’re growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.” On Drake & DJ Khaled Getting Radio Play \n“Is it just me or did you hear that song so many times—you say you wanna play “For Free.” Aye, aye. You know what it is, though? Because aye, I love Drake. I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro. … Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys.” On Fake Truth \n“I ain’t here to massage you with the fake truth, telling you that Hillary going to win over and over and over. Then you wake up and you still can’t believe it. You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.” On Mark Zuckerberg \n“Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now? Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg? Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about Donda. You said you would help and you didn’t. Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro.” On Change \n“There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing anything, just becoming a part of the power. That’s happening with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. Things won’t change until people admit they own falsehoods. I got the vision, bruh. That is what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way. I’m going to say it how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season four racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready. Get ready. Because the show’s over.” Post-concert reaction \nFans (including members of the Sacramento Kings) were left in shock. A \"Fuck you Kanye\" chant started. #saintpablotour",

      "text": "Story highlights West took aim at Facebook, Google and the media Asked Jay-Z to call him to talk \"like a man\" He only performed two songs for Sacramento crowd New York (CNN) Kanye West left thousands of his California fans disappointed on Saturday night after cutting his show short, performing only two songs and engaging in a long rant about politics, the media and Beyonce and Jay-Z.\nWest came on stage 90 minutes late in Sacramento, according to concert goers, and told his audience that they couldn't believe Hillary Clinton had lost \"Cause you was lied to by Google. You was lied to Mark Zuckerberg.\" West made another reference to Clinton's defeat while taking aim at radio executives. If radio stations \"keep following old models,\" he said, they would be \"Hillary Clintoned.\" West, who once posed for a selfie with Clinton and his wife, Clinton supporter Kim Kardashian West, told an audience earlier in the week that he didn't vote in this year's election but if he did he would have voted for Donald Trump. Fellow celebrities Read More West was joined on stage by fellow hip hop star Kid Cudi during the show The artist also took aim at some of his fellow celebrities, encouraging Jay-Z to call him back and talk to him \"like a man,\" and also suggested that Beyonce won video of the year at the MTV Video Music Awards earlier this year because she agreed to perform at the event. Addressing the media, West told them to \"get ready to write your passive aggressive\" and \"racist comments\" before telling the audience the show was over. He dropped his microphone and walked off the stage. Disappointed fans Update: Kanye West at Golden 1 Center\n\nSacramento, Calif -- We encourage all guests to travel home safely. More information to follow.\n— Golden 1 Center (@Golden1Center) November 20, 2016 Video shows stunned members of the audience asking if the show was really over, shortly after a chorus of boos erupted. Yesenia Miranda, from Sacramento, who was at the show in the Golden 1 Center, told CNN, \"\"He's very ignorant. People in our city work hard for our money and for him just to do that was disrespectful. Not only did he perform two songs he was also an hour and a half late.\" Baylee Poole, a student at California State University, was also disappointed. \"Kanye talked about how feelings mattered in his speech but when he left the stage, he left us in the Sacramento crowd confused and frustrated,\" she told CNN.",

      "text": "You're not the only one upset that the internet might have misled you . Kanye West cut short a Sacramento concert with an epic 15-minute speech where he railed against the state of the music industry, politics, and... the internet. The superstar says that people feel like they lost (due to the election, among other issues) because Facebook and Google \"lied to you.\" He even calls out Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg by name around the 12-minute mark. Supposedly, the internet mogul reneged on a promise that he \"would help\" Kanye and then decided to \"look for aliens.\" We're not sure where that last part comes from, since Facebook's out-there projects are largely limited to Earthly concerns like solar-powered internet drones .\nHe also tells people to only put their iPhones in the air, since he wants \"only originals.\" Guess we know where he stands on smartphones, then (although he recently got rid of his phone to focus on creativity).\nIs Kanye presenting a complex, nuanced take on the problems of internet accuracy and corporate responsibility in Silicon Valley? Hell no. This is a shoot-from-the-hip diatribe. However, it shows that concerns over online authenticity are bubbling to the surface. If Kanye sees it as a problem as serious to him as unfairness to Obama and alleged corruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, you know it's in the mainstream consciousness. In that sense, efforts to fight fake news are overdue -- Kanye's speech is a reflection of frustration that, in some ways, has been simmering for months or even years.\nLost in all of this: 'If you ain't got an iPhone, don't put it up. Only originals.' He's in Ye mode now. https://t.co/0LYyxhz1Rz\n— Edgar Alvarez (@abcdedgar) November 20, 2016",

      "title": "German Chancellor Merkel to seek fourth term",
      "text": " Google+\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she will run for a fourth term in office in elections scheduled for next year.\nBy Kirsten Grieshaber Associated Press November 20, 2016\nBERLIN (AP) — Angela Merkel, who has steered Germany through several global crises as its first female leader, said Sunday that she will seek a fourth term as chancellor in general elections next year.\n‘‘I literally thought about this decision endlessly ... but I am ready to run for office again,’’ Merkel told reporters after meeting with high-ranking members of her center-right party. ‘‘I want to serve Germany.’’\nAdvertisement\nMerkel said she expected strong challenges from the left and right fringes of society as Germany has become more polarized.\n‘‘This election will be difficult — like no other election since the reunification’’ of West and East Germany in 1990, she said.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Clearly the dominant leader in Europe, Merkel urged caution against outsized expectations about what she might yet achieve.\n‘‘Everything that’s about how it all depends on me, especially after the elections in the U.S., honors me, but at the same time I find it very much grotesque and almost bizarre,’’ she said.\n‘‘No person ... not even with the biggest experience, can turn things in Germany, Europe and in the world more or less to the good, and especially not the chancellor of Germany.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe 62-year-old chancellor will also seek re-election as chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union party at its national convention next month, but she faces no serious opposition within the party.\nA physicist by training, Merkel became chancellor in 2005. She is the first leader of a reunited Germany to have grown up under communism in the former East Germany.\nIf she wins next year and serves the entire four-year term, Merkel would match her one-time mentor Helmut Kohl’s post-war record of 16 years in office.\nRepeatedly named ‘‘The World’s Most Powerful Woman’’ by Forbes magazine, Merkel also has been suggested by some as the last powerful defender of liberal values in the West following Donald Trump’s election as the next U.S. president.\nNearly 60 percent of Germans surveyed in a recent poll said they wanted Merkel to run for office again, said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency.\n‘‘In these difficult times, Merkel is a pillar of stability,’’ Guellner told The Associated Press. ‘‘People have the feeling she represents German interests well abroad.’’\nWhile she’s never been described as a visionary or earned much praise for stirring speeches, Merkel has won respect for being tough, shrewd and doggedly tackling problems.\nSince becoming chancellor, she’s dealt with several international crises, including the Eurozone debt crisis in 2008-09 for which she brokered compromises among fractious European Union leaders.\nShe has been a strong advocate of efforts to combat climate change, and in 2011 abruptly accelerated the shutdown of Germany’s nuclear power plants following the meltdowns at Japan’s Fukushima plant.\nUnresolved diplomatic challenges include Europe’s relationship with Russia, the future of Ukraine, autocratic developments in Turkey, the ongoing war in Syria and negotiations over Britain’s exit from the European Union.\nMerkel also needs to brace herself for the populist wave sweeping both the United States and Europe, where elections next year could see a far-right politician become president of France.\nDomestically, the nationalist Alterative for Germany, or AfD, could prove to be one of the biggest stumbling blocks to her re-election. The populist party, which is now represented in 10 state parliaments, has aggressively campaigned against Merkel’s decision to welcome an estimated 890,000 migrants into Germany last year.\nIn elections in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania earlier this year, Merkel’s party came in third behind the Alliance for Germany. According to recent polls, the AfD would win around 10 percent of the vote if general elections were to be held now.\nMerkel, the oldest of three children and the daughter of a Protestant pastor, entered politics in her mid-30s after working as a physicist behind the Iron Curtain. She served as minister for women and families in Kohl’s first post-reunification Cabinet in the 1990s and then also as an environment minister.\nIn the beginning of her political career, she was often underestimated by her mostly male, Catholic, West German party companions who sometimes referred to her condescendingly as ‘‘Kohl’s girl.’’ But in the end, she eliminated her rivals with abundant tactical skill and sheer luck to make it all the way to the top in 2005.\nIn Germany, Merkel is sometimes referred to as ‘‘Mutti,’’ or ‘‘mom,’’ despite being known for a pragmatic, rational style of governing.\nWhile Merkel often appears reserved and even stiff in public, she has tried in past campaigns to show a more human side. She opened up about her favorite pastimes outside politics, which include baking plum cake for her husband, the publicity-shy chemistry professor Joachim Sauer, and spending weekends at a little cabin outside Berlin.\nIf Merkel wins and serves out a fourth term, she wouldn’t just equal Kohl’s record tenure but also would overtake conservative icon Konrad Adenauer, who served just over 14 years as chancellor from 1949-1963.\n‘‘I can see how Merkel has this personal ambition to show the people that she, who used to be such an outsider when she first entered politics as an East German and a woman, made it all the way,’’ said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University.\nA date has not yet been set for the election, but they will take place sometime between Aug. 23 and Oct. 22 next year.",

      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nKanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.\nBy Joe Coscarelli New York Times November 20, 2016\nKanye West likened himself to Donald Trump at a concert Saturday in California before tumbling into a 17-minute, free-associative speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyoncé, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more.\nAfter getting an array of grievances off his chest — from real-world politics to awards-show politics — West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world,” West said from his floating platform stage above the crowd. “Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in Middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt.”\nThe brief concert, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, came two nights after West shocked his audience by announcing at a show in San Jose, California, that he had not voted, but would have cast a ballot for Trump if he had. Though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like Black Lives Matter and women’s rights, he praised Trump’s “method of communication” as “very futuristic.”\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break On Saturday night, in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current Saint Pablo tour, West doubled down on his embrace of Trump-like political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media. “Yeah, I’m taking his lead,” West said of the president-elect.\n“A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost,” the rapper began. “You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you.”\nTurning his focus on the music industry, West questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by Drake but not Frank Ocean, and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows. Referring to this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, West pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political behind-the-scenes dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events.\nAdvertisement\n“Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling,’” he said.\n“Sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win,” he continued. “I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life — even at the risk of my own success, my own career.”\nHowever, West said, such truth-telling was necessary for real progress. “Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was,” he said. “Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this” — the rapper screamed — “and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change” things.\nWhen more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech, disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds. The arena replied on Twitter: “We encourage all guests to travel home safely. More information to follow.” Representatives for West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEven amid his raw, spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue, West seemed to know he was courting controversy. “I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way,” he said. “But I’m going to say how I feel.” He added, “Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over.”",

      "text": " Google+\nMike Segar/REUTERS\nDonald Trump and Mitt Romney emerged after their meeting at a Trump-owned golf club in Bedminster, N.J., on Saturday.\nBy Catherine Lucey and Laurie Kellman Associated Press November 20, 2016\nBEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) — Mitt Romney is a key contender to become the nation’s next secretary of state and Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis was an ‘‘impressive’’ prospect for defense secretary, President-elect Donald Trump and his No. 2 Mike Pence said Sunday.\n‘‘Gov. Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,’’ said Pence, the vice president-elect who is leading the search for Trump’s cabinet members, in an interview on CBS’s ‘‘Face the Nation.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe remark made clear Trump and Romney’s meeting a day earlier in New Jersey was more than a public attempt to bury the hatchet after trading ferocious insults during the campaign.\nTrump met with Ret. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis a few hours after Romney. On Sunday, the billionaire interrupted his tweeted criticisms of ‘‘Saturday Night Live,’’ the hit musical, ‘‘Hamilton’’ and Democrats to write that, ‘‘General James ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, who is being considered for secretary of defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General’s General!’’\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. The comments were indications that Trump could be nearing additional Cabinet announcements soon as he works toward rounding out his foreign policy and national security teams. He took a hard line on both subjects during the presidential campaign, proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and more.\nView Story Romney says his talk with Trump was ‘far-reaching’ Mitt Romney was vocal with his criticism of Donald Trump during the campaign but met with him Saturday.\nBut even as Trump and his team discussed some of the weightiest matters facing the country, the president-elect continued tweeting about an array of matters.\nHis targets Sunday included incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer, another media-savvy New Yorker, who Trump said was ‘‘far smarter’’ than retiring Democratic Leader Harry Reid. He also complained that ‘‘Saturday Night Live,’’ which thrives on making fun of politicians, is ‘‘biased’’ and not funny. The night before, actor Alec Baldwin portrayed Trump as Googling, ‘‘What is ISIS?’’\nAdvertisement\nTrump also insisted again that the cast and producers of ‘‘Hamilton’’ should apologize after the lead actor addressed Pence from the stage Friday night, telling the vice president-elect that ‘‘diverse America’’ was ‘‘alarmed and anxious’’ about the incoming administration. Pence said on CBS’s ‘‘Face the Nation’’ that he enjoyed the show and wasn’t offended.\nMeanwhile, Trump received more visitors to his golf club in New Jersey Sunday. His schedule in Bedminster was to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.\nTrump said he may announce some of his picks on Sunday.\nBoth Romney and Trump put on a show of smiles, a public handshake and a thumbs-up Saturday, a marked shift in tone after a year in which Romney attacked Trump as a ‘‘con man’’ and Trump labeled him a ‘‘loser.’’ But the two have started to mend fences since Trump’s victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nTrump started filling key administration positions on Friday, picking Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.\nTrump’s initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam’s role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard line immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ‘‘potentially complicit’’ in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam.\nPompeo’s nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. ‘‘should go tougher than waterboarding,’’ which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for ‘‘ending our interrogation program’’ and said intelligence officials ‘‘are not torturers, they are patriots.’’\nSessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not.\n___\nKellman reported from Washington.",

      "text": "</intent-filter></activity> \nThe main theme of the text is fairly predictable for a setup and usage. There are instructions to check either the phone or watch at certain times, and a line about trying again to perform a payment by holding a watch to a payment terminal. \nOf course, this is far from a revelation. There have been a couple of activities with \"tapandpay\" and \"wear\" in their names going all the way back to July with the release of Play services v9.4 (shown below); but this is the first time text has shown up, which means interfaces are under development and possibly already in testing. Wear + Tap and Pay activities \n<activity android:enabled=\"false\" android:exported=\"false\" android:icon=\"@drawable/tp_logo_android_pay_color_48dp\" android:label=\"@string/tp_payments_application_name\" android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.tapandpay.wear.WearProxyActivity \" android:process=\"com.google.android.gms.ui\" android:theme=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\"/> \n<activity android:enabled=\"false\" android:exported=\"false\" android:icon=\"@drawable/tp_logo_android_pay_color_48dp\" android:label=\"@string/tp_payments_application_name\" android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.tapandpay.wear.WearProxyCompanionActivity \" android:process=\"com.google.android.gms.ui\" android:theme=\"@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\"/> \nThe timing for these additions to Play services may not be a coincidence. The original activities in v9.4 arrived shortly after the first developer previews were released for Wear 2.0 . With the announcement of a delayed release until 2017 , it's likely work was temporarily halted until details could be ironed out. It's certainly possible that things are back on track and the development has resumed. \nThis also coincides rather closely with the leaked pair of Google-made Wear smartwatches . Neither watch was ever specifically rumored to include NFC capabilities, but with this capability showing up in Play services an obvious drive to make Android Pay successful, there's certainly a good chance these watches will be equipped for contactless payment. This is speculation, but it's hard to overlook the association. Instant Apps \nI don't think much introduction is necessary for this one, everybody will probably remember Instant Apps announced at Google I/O 2016 . There aren't any new things in the Play services v10 update. This is more like a progress update, or maybe a hint about timing. \nAll of the activities, services, and a provider have just been switched on. To be specific, all of the manifest entries have an 'enabled' property, and it was just switched from false to true . This means Google is very likely testing the Instant Apps framework outside of lab conditions, and may be nearing a public launch. code \n<activity android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.instantapps.settings.OptInActivity \" android:enabled=\" true \" android:excludeFromRecents=\"true\" android:exported=\"true\" android:theme=\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\" /><activity android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.instantapps.routing.EphemeralInstallerActivity \" android:enabled=\" true \" android:excludeFromRecents=\"true\" android:exported=\"true\" android:theme=\"@style/Theme.Common.NoUIActivity\"><activity android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.googlehelp.helpactivities.SystemAppTrampolineActivity \" android:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize\" android:excludeFromRecents=\"true\" android:exported=\" true \" android:label=\"@string/gh_menu_help\" android:process=\"com.google.android.gms.ui\" android:theme=\"@style/gh_ActivityStyle\"><activity android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.googlehelp.helpactivities.HelpActivity \" android:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize\" android:excludeFromRecents=\"true\" android:exported=\" true \" android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:label=\"@string/gh_menu_help\" android:process=\"com.google.android.gms.ui\" android:theme=\"@style/gh_ActivityStyle\" android:uiOptions=\"splitActionBarWhenNarrow\"> \n<provider android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.instantapps.routing.InstantAppsContentProvider \" android:authorities=\"com.google.android.gms.instantapps.provider.api\" android:enabled=\" true \" android:exported=\"true\" android:process=\"@string/common_persistent_process\" /> \n<service android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.instantapps.service.InstantAppsService \" android:enabled=\" true \" android:exported=\"true\" android:process=\"@string/common_persistent_process\"><service android:name=\" com.google.android.gms.instantapps.routing.DomainFilterUpdateService \" android:enabled=\" true \" android:exported=\"false\" android:process=\"@string/common_persistent_process\"> \nThis wasn't the only sign that Instant Apps is progressing beyond its own developer team. The recent Play Store v7.2 update also contains a pair of new lines for the debug settings screen (intended for developers and testers only). These add a link to install an \"Instant Apps Supervisor\" tool for testing and diagnostic purposes. \n<string name=\"debug_instant_apps\"> Instant Apps </string><string name=\"debug_instant_apps_summary\"> Install Instant Apps Supervisor </string> \nAgain, there's not really much else to say, but these things can be taken as signs that Instant Apps may launch in the near future. It's still too early to make any assumptions about when exactly that will happen, especially if the testing phases go on for quite a while. The upcoming holiday season could also play a role in the release schedule. We'll either see Instant Apps go live in the next 3 weeks, or it won't happen until at least the end of January. Download \nThe APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK. \nVersion: 10.0.84",

      "text": "20 \nKanye West put on a spectacle for his fans in Sacramento, California Saturday night (November 19), reportedly performing three songs, bringing out Kid Cudi, going on another extended rant that took shots at people and organizations across a broad spectrum and then cutting the show short after about 30 minutes. \nThe erratic performance came only days after Kanye’s last politically fueled tirade, where he proclaimed his support for president-elect Donald Trump . \nBringing Kid Cudi out for an emotional moment of reconciliation, the two hugged it out on the floating stage as throngs of people watched from below. Cudi and Kanye’s relationship went through some turmoil in September , ahead of Cudi checking into rehab for depression . Kanye West and Kid Cudi hugging it out on stage! BEEF SQUASHED! pic.twitter.com/Xhb3riEG4L \n— DJ Akademiks (@IamAkademiks) November 20, 2016 \nKanye then went on a lengthy rant, veering from topic to topic and occasionally pausing to address the crowd’s increasing boos. \nHere are some key points, divided by topic. Watch the full rant below. On Obama \n“Obama couldn’t make America great. Because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this [yells] and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bruh. On Beyonce \n“Beyoncé, I was hurt, because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won video of the year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling.’ Now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé, she is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bro. I’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth.” On Jay Z \n“Jay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t call me. Jay Z, call me. Hey, bro, Jay Z, I know you’ve got killers. Please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man.” On Equality \n“I’m not trying to be the man, I’m just a man. The same as everybody here. I ain’t above or below none of y’all. We all equal. This is the vibes, bruh. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again.” On Feelings \n“You don’t like that. Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way muthafuckas put money up so high. Popularity. Radio spins. Feelings matter, bruh. It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton. It’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way, and they showed you how they felt […] It’s a new world Barack. It’s a new world Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro, this ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We’re growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye.” On Drake & DJ Khaled Getting Radio Play \n“Is it just me or did you hear that song so many times—you say you wanna play “For Free.” Aye, aye. You know what it is, though? Because aye, I love Drake. I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro. … Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys.” On Fake Truth \n“I ain’t here to massage you with the fake truth, telling you that Hillary going to win over and over and over. Then you wake up and you still can’t believe it. You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.” On Mark Zuckerberg \n“Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now? Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg? Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about Donda. You said you would help and you didn’t. Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro.” On Change \n“There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing anything, just becoming a part of the power. That’s happening with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. Things won’t change until people admit they own falsehoods. I got the vision, bruh. That is what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way. I’m going to say it how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season four racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready. Get ready. Because the show’s over.” Post-concert reaction \nFans (including members of the Sacramento Kings) were left in shock. A \"Fuck you Kanye\" chant started. #saintpablotour",

      "text": "When we think of local SEO, we think of local packs, Google My Business listings , and local citations . While these things certainly are local SEO, they aren’t the whole picture. Local SEO can be split into three categories: \nLocal pack results for organizations with local premises Organic results for organizations with local premises Organic results for organizations without local premises It’s the third category that I want to cover here today. This often-neglected and little-discussed area plays host to some of the biggest and most lucrative spaces in organic search. Think about searches like: \nChemical engineering jobs in London Flats to rent in London Used Ford Focus for sale in London These terms are local in nature, and local businesses might compete for them — whether they be recruitment agencies, letting agents, or car dealerships. However, businesses without any local premises might also compete for them — whether they be online-only job boards, property listings sites, or eBay and Craigslist. \nLet’s take recruiters as an example. A search for “recruiters near me” from Distilled HQ in London produces this result: \nThere’s a local pack, but the top result is for a listings site that does not itself have any local premises. \nIf we search for something more specific: \n\nFirstly, this is a “near me” search with no local pack. The second very noticeable thing is that after the four PPC ads, Totaljobs.com are ranking both first and second(!!!). Neither they nor Indeed.co.uk have any physical premises, and the second result ranking isn’t even location-specific. In case you’re curious, Indeed gets the double-rank if I swap out “near me” for “in London”:\n\nThe points I want to make are that: \nIt’s totally legitimate for Indeed and Totaljobs to try to rank for these queries This is local SEO, but there are no local packs, and these are not local sites There are a whole range of niche concerns around this sort of situation, which I’ll cover in turn: \nWhether this applies to you: Should you be competing for local queries at all? Granularity: Which local queries should you be competing for? Optimizing pages to compete in these spaces. A quick side note: It is possible to generate Google My Business listings for locations where you can get someone to sort your verification, but you yourself have no real premises. This is either spam or misleading marketing depending on how you look at it. Like many other spam techniques, some sites are having success with it, but it’s not something I would endorse or recommend, and I won’t be covering it any further here. \nShould you be competing for local queries at all? The example search queries I used above all had something in common — they were different offerings based on the location a user was interested in, so having location pages made absolute sense for the users, for the sites, and for Google. \nThis isn’t always true. Take this example from Serenata Flowers: \n\nAward-winning florist in West Wellow. \nFor context, there are no florists in or even particularly near West Wellow, which is a tiny place on the edge of the New Forest National Park in Southern England: \n\nFurthermore, the offerings on this page are identical to those that Serenata appears to offer on every other location page. This page exists purely for SEO benefit — it’s to target local search volume, with no benefit to users other than their ability to find it through that search volume. There’s nothing you can do on this page that you can’t do from any other non-location-specific page on the site. \nThis isn’t unusual in this vertical, or in several others. In fact, this is one of the last big areas where doing something just for the SEO benefit not only makes sense, but seems sustainable and fairly white-hat. \nOne might tenuously argue that users want reassurance that their flowers will be cut close to their intended delivery destination, or that Serenata offers delivery in this area. However, in this case it would make far more sense for Serenata to have landing pages for the locations where the flowers are cut, or for logical delivery areas rather than individual villages; nobody would think that a florist in nearby Romsey offering delivery would for some reason refuse to deliver to West Wellow. \nThe best litmus test for whether you should be pursuing this type of landing page strategy is whether you can actually think of a useful way to differentiate these pages for users (as opposed to for Google). A flower delivery site probably can — by showing local stock and delivery times and distances — but small villages are too fine a granularity for this. \nI imagine Serenata drive considerable revenue through some of their location pages for higher volume locations — despite not differentiating these pages in this way — but it’s the fact that users would look for a locally differentiated page in the first place that makes this strategy viable. \nGranularity: Which local queries should you be competing for? When deciding how to target your location pages, there will be a wide range of options, for example: \nState County City Town Zip/Postal Code Street All of the above Which of these options makes sense for you comes down to two main factors: \nAt what level of granularity are your potential customers searching? What level of indexation can your site support? The first question initially looks like a simple keyword research problem, but it’s harder than that. We’re getting into the seriously long-tail with some of these groupings, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t volume. Search volume tools like Google Keyword Planner and Moz’s own Keyword Explorer start to struggle to tell the difference between “zero” and “low” when we get into this sort of territory, so you’re probably going to have to do something better than that. Some ideas worth considering: \nTest for volume and interest with paid search If you already have a variety of pages, find out which ones receive zero or nearly zero organic traffic and conversions Test opening up deeper locations for a small number of areas (small enough that you’re confident the strain on indexation and spreading of equity won’t impact your site as a whole!) Search for the smaller locations you’re considering. Does your higher-level page already rank well? Look at data from your internal site search See what your competitors are doing. They might not be getting it right, but it could be a useful source of ideas to validate The second question is more complex. Adding thousands or even millions of extra pages to any website is a dangerous game. You should be concerned as to whether Google will allocate enough crawl budget, or whether you’ll damage the strength of existing pages. \nHere are some ideas to consider: \nTest opening up extra locations for half of areas. Monitor the performance of the unaffected half of the site vs. a counterfactual , as well as the affected half of the site vs. the unaffected half. If the affected side underperforms, you’re spreading yourself too thin. If the unaffected side underperforms but the affected side does not, work out whether the aggregate effect was positive or negative. Make sure you’re being clever with your information architecture . Minimize the number of extra URLs Google has to crawl. Consider using HTML sitemap (“browse all areas”) pages that are linked to internally, but “NOINDEX, FOLLOW” to distribute equity without crowding user-facing pages with links. Test using nofollow attributes on individual facet links to control any potential spider traps. Use breadcrumbs (marked up in structured data) to make the structure of the site and location hierarchy as clear as possible to search engines. Monitor server logs to discover any crawling problems. (How not to) Optimize pages for local search Here’s what Serenata have done to optimize for local search in the example I used above: \n\nThis is sitting at the bottom of the category page and contains such stunners as “Our florists in West Wellow have the experience and the passion to create beautiful bouquets for any occasion.” I’m sure they would, if they existed. \nClearly this is keyword stuffing at its finest. In or out of local search, this kind of category/listing page SEO drivel feels like it shouldn’t work anymore, but in fact your mileage may vary, and again, if you already have this, you should test: \nRemoving it entirely Turning down the keyword density I’ve seen numerous examples in the last year of sites benefitting from improving or getting rid of this kind of useless content. \nSo what to do instead? Above, I said: \n“The best litmus test for whether you should be pursuing this type of landing page strategy is whether you can actually think of a useful way to differentiate these pages for users.” This means that you should have something genuinely useful that you can put on these pages. Some recommendations : \nProprietary data – e.g. what the most popular flowers are in this location. Local differentiation – e.g. are some of the products delivered to this location sourced locally? Genuine local expertise – could any employees or subcontractors in this area contribute? Reviews for this location Reassurance – e.g. if you think a user is looking for a local florist because of delivery concerns, say how long the flowers will be traveling for Looking forward As location targeting without physical premises is an area that still feels a little old-fashioned in its SEO trends, it’ll be interesting to see how it develops in the next few years. Personal assistants could have a particularly large impact here, for example.

      "text": "Google readying tap-to-pay for Android Wear smartwatches It's trailing both Apple and Samsung on wearable payments. Share Save \nGoogle may finally be ready to bring tap-to-pay to Android Wear , judging by evidence discovered in the Google Play Services version 10.0 by Android Police . Text prompt strings with messages like \"Try holding your watch to the terminal again\" make it fairly clear that Google is in the late stages of testing the feature. If you have a compatible Android Wear watch (one with an NFC chip), it will let you touch your watch to an NFC-equipped retail terminal to pay for goods. \nAnother new feature that appears to be coming soon is Instant Apps , a way to get apps (for one-time use or other reasons) without actually installing them. Android Police notes that the Instant App services have been switched on and a flag set from false to true, meaning the feature is likely being tested in the wild. \nYou can actually tap to pay on Android right now if you really want to, but you have to use a Samsung Gear S3 watch and Samsung Pay, ironically. That feature works on any Android device with KitKat 4.4 or later, because Samsung just made its payment service available to other Android smartphone brands, provided you're using its Tizen OS-based watch. The Gear S3 is equipped with the same magnetic stripe payment tech as Samsung's phones, letting you pay with the watch just about anywhere in the US. (iPhone users have also been able to pay with the Apple Watch and Apple Pay for over a year, of course.) Samsung's Gear S3 smartwatch \nSmartwatches and wearables in general have disappointed of late sales-wise, and companies like Intel are reportedly scaling back development. It probably didn't help matters that Google delayed Android Wear 2.0, expected this fall, to 2017. Hopefully, Mountain View used the time wisely to improve the software and give folks more reasons to buy a smartwatch (and use Android Pay, which hasn't exactly set the world on fire either). \nDespite its appearance in Google Play Services, you likely won't see tap-to-pay now until Android Wear 2.0 arrives early next year. It could arrive at the same time as a pair of rumored Android Wear watches designed and built by Google to be the smartwatch equivalent of its Pixel phones.",

Larger handsets or tablets will likely provide a better experience, as it makes use of a number of on-screen buttons, and also note that it’s currently on release version 1.0, so bugs and performance issues may be apparent.",

      "title": "Google forms Montreal AI research group, gives $3.37 million grant to Yoshua Bengio, others",
      "text": "Google today is announcing that it’s setting up a deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) research unit in its office in Montreal and giving $3.37 million in grant money to deep learning luminary Yoshua Bengio and seven other people associated with the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) .\nBengio himself has previously received backing from Google, and other companies as well — IBM, Samsung, Intel. But the new grant is “bigger than any of the other funding we’ve received from private companies up until now,” he said during an interview with VentureBeat.\nBut Bengio will not be formally allying himself with Google proper, because he wants to stay independent.\n“That’s who I am,” he said, “that’s the choice I made that fits with my values, and I don’t need to get the millions, I’m fine. My salary is very good, and I care more about how what I can do could have a positive impact for science, humanity, and for training the next generation [of researchers].”\nGoogle’s move to build a bigger AI presence and more closely ally with MILA, which has a presence at the University of Montreal and McGill University — mostly at the former — comes as other big technology companies take steps to enhance their products with deep learning. The approach typically involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data, such as photos, and then getting them to make inferences about new data. Facebook has created an AI research lab, and Google has the Google Brain group, while Google parent company Alphabet also operates the DeepMind group, and Baidu has formed its own research operations. Microsoft Research is also active in this area.\nWhile this is a time of great activity in AI research and development, Bengio, who supervises 25 students and five post-doctoral students as a full professor at the University of Montreal, intends to stay on the research side and not shift toward the development side. Interestingly his brother Samy Bengio works at Google Research and has contributed to working products such as Google’s image search.\nThe new Google AI research group in Montreal will be led by Hugo Larochelle, who recently left Twitter’s Cortex deep learning division.\nThe other MILA grant recipients are Christopher Pal, Doina Precup, Joelle Pineau, Simon Lacoste-Julien, and Laurent Charlin, as well as two of Bengio’s frequent collaborators, Pascal Vincent and Aaron Courville.\nA blog post has more on the news.\n",

      "text": " \n\nEarlier in the year, Google introduced its two-step verification Prompt feature to help make verifying your account identity a little easier. Today, user reports reveal that Google Prompt is starting to roll out to a selection of Android Wear devices as well.\nFor the feature to work, smartwatch owners much have their wearable connected up to a smartphone that has already been approved via the two-step authentication process. Once setup, users can allow or deny login attempts from their smartwatch, rather than having to reach for their phone. This update doesn’t replace the existing Google Authenticator feature on Android Wear devices, but simply makes managing requests a little easier.\nIn case you missed the original news, Google Prompt enables devices owners to respond to account authentication requests through a little prompt window, rather than having to enter a code sent via SMS. Users can simply tap yes or no to allow or block the login attempt.\nSee also: How to set up two-factor authentication on your Google account April 30, 2015 It isn’t clear how far or wide the Google Prompt roll out for Android Wear will be at this point, and it’s likely only available on Android devices for now. So we will be keeping an eye out for an official word from Google. Have you spotted the feature on your smartwatch?",

      "text": "\nGoogle could be on the verge of introducing tap-to-pay functionality to Android Wear, judging by references made in the latest version of the Google Play Services code. After tucking into the Google Play Services version 10.0 APK file, Android Police discovered a number of strings pertaining too both the Android Pay mobile payments system and Android Wear.\nThe code contains multiple simultaneous instances of the “wear” and “tp” prefixes, used for Android Wear and tap-to-pay, as well as explicit statements like: “Try holding your watch to the terminal again”, serving as a strong indication that the feature is approaching release.\nSee also: Android Pay adds 30 more US banks and reconfirms Capital One support 2 weeks ago The news follows an October rumor that Google is preparing the launch of its own smartwatches in early 2017, which may coincide with Android Pay’s debut on Android Wear.\nMeanwhile, the Google Play Services APK teardown also suggests that Google’s Instant Apps functionality, announced at Google I/O 2016, could arrive shortly.",

      "text": "Countries Don’t Control the Internet. Companies Do. \nThe Google empire has been created by a mixture of great products, corporate ambition, and first-mover advantage. So far, so normal. But governments are contributing by handing over to tech companies stuff that’s too difficult or too expensive, like collecting surveillance data or mediating cross-border freedom of expression issues. We as consumers also play our part, as Al Gore noted at a conference in 2014: “Every time we—collectively—have had a choice between convenience and privacy/security, we’ve chosen convenience.” Advertisement \nFor instance: Have you ever read your favorite providers’ terms of service? \nWhen we click “I agree,” we hand over the right to track us, to profile us, to scan our email and chat content; to remove, edit, or share and sell our content without giving us a cut of the revenues . Facebook “likes” alone can reveal an individual’s gender, age, race, sexuality, political, and religious views. Target correctly inferred that a teenage girl was pregnant based on big data profiling—as her father found out when he phoned to complain that she’d been sent coupons for baby products. \nWe don’t know—because we’re rarely told—how long all this data will hang around. Our words and clicks today may be resurrected in the future, and conclusions drawn by advertisers or governments. Knowing that President-elect Trump will shortly have access to NSA data may or may not renew concerns about the “collect it all” strategies that have shaped counter-terrorism since 2001. \nWhoever’s in charge of the free world, we should worry about the powerful alignment of state and corporate interests, and how enmeshed private companies are becoming in the machinery of law enforcement. As Bruce Schneier put it in Data and Goliath : “As long as these companies are already engaging in mass surveillance of their customers and users, it’s easier for them to comply with government demands and share the wealth with the NSA.” It works for everybody, apart from individual citizens. Advertisement \nToday’s popular platforms are increasingly forced to take on roles that used to be done by states. A European court judgment forced Google to implement the controversial right to be forgotten , a process for users to request that historic materials about them be suppressed from search results. It’s not so much the right to be forgotten, as the right not to be found. Users fill in a form , and Google decides. So far, Google has received nearly 600,000 requests under the scheme. Despite being a quasi-judicial process that has an impact on fundamental rights such as access to knowledge, freedom of expression and privacy, Google’s right to be forgotten falls way short of the rule of law gold standard . We don’t know who takes the decisions. There are no public judgments, no appeal process, no evidence about decision-makers’ qualifications or freedom from conflicts of interest. \nAnother area where big tech impacts our fundamental rights is in content moderation. Despite sincere commitment to free expression, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have found themselves drawn in to taking decisions about taking down content. That’s why, as Adrien Chen memorably put it in Wired , you don’t see “ dick pics and beheadings ” in your news feeds. The companies—no doubt uncomfortable that they’ve ended up with de facto censorship powers—are rather secretive about their processes, workforces, and what criteria are used to remove content. \nSure, we need processes that work at internet speed, not the snail’s pace of most judicial systems, but it’s also vital that there is transparency, due process, and right of appeal. Decisions about censorship or copyright infringement can be nuanced, and are highly dependent on culture and context. Big tech and their hidden workforces have ended up with these tasks through the lack of a better way to do it. This is dangerous for democracy and human rights: Private companies have different priorities than, say, the courts. They are duty bound to maximize profit and minimise potential liability. That doesn’t always make for robust legal decision-making. Get Futurography in your inbox. \nRather than having a whinge-orama , what can be done to re-balance the power of Google and other modern day data-empires? The Global Commission on Internet Governance says that it is up to all of us to create a healthy future for the internet. The commission calls for users to have more say in how their data will be used and to be offered meaningful alternatives, rather than the binary choice of sharing data or being excluded from the service. Advertisement \nIt also says that big tech should be more accountable. Independent projects such as New America’s Ranking Digital Rights shine a light on some corporate practices. But Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads the project, notes that while companies are becoming more transparent about their responses to government requests for data or content restriction, they are “much more opaque about their internal decision-making processes around how and when their own rules are enforced.” \nAnother area where there needs to be more choice and transparency is in the handling of our personal data. We’ve all had the experience of being followed around the web by products we’ve almost just bought. It’s like being stalked by your own underwear, and it feels unsettling. Despite grumbling about the “creepiness” and “spookiness” of data profiling or targeted advertising, we just seem to put up with it. \nBut we may have more power than we think. If we were a little more feisty, we could, say, demand that companies differentiate between different types of data . If that happened, there could be more frequent deletion of ephemeral data such as chat conversations (like Snapchat’s delete by default ), search terms, geolocation, and a “do-not-scan” for inherently confidential data such as legally privileged emails. \nObserving the internet’s development can sometimes feel like watching evolution in fast-forward. Whether you’re living in 44 B.C. or 2016, running a giant empire creates governance risks, particularly concentrations of power and autocracy. If we learn from history, we should be wary of empire builders—whether they come armor-clad or in primary colors with Comic Sans fonts. \nAs Voltaire (or was it Spider-Man ?) said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” And it’s a problem for all of us to resolve, not just the big tech companies. We need to wake up to the concentrations of power and demand that both states and corporates shoulder their responsibilities. \nThis article is part of the “Who Controls the Internet?” installment of Futurography , a series in which Future Tense introduces readers to the technologies that will define tomorrow .

      "text": "What does Trump mean for tech M&A? Posted Google opens new AI lab and invests $3.4M in Montreal-based AI research \nAfter Donald Trump’s unexpected presidential victory earlier this month, the tech community has been trying to assess how the new administration will impact them. \nThere are concerns that there will be fewer H-1B visas for engineers , making it harder to hire the world’s best talent. People also interpret Trump’s stance on the Apple-FBI controversy as an indication that he will be in favor of more government surveillance. And he’s talked about reducing jobs overseas, which could make some U.S. tech businesses have higher costs and ultimately be less competitive. \nYet while he opposes the AT&T-Time Warner deal, possibly because of his angst toward CNN, some leaders in Silicon Valley remain hopeful that he will be like his Republican predecessors and advocate for less regulation. This could prevent many business roadblocks and it could also be good for M&A, one of the key outcomes where venture capitalists can make strong returns. \nDespite criticizing Amazon’s low taxes amid a conflict with CEO Jeff Bezos, Trump has generally advocated for lower corporate taxes, which could leave more cash for purchases. \nIf he does in fact reduce taxes for businesses, “that potentially frees up a lot more capital to be investing in acquisitions,” said Stephanie Palmeri, partner at SoftTech VC. \nDramatically lower taxes, such as Trump’s proposed 15% rate, could cause some companies to shift money to the U.S. \n“The repatriation of capital, if that comes from overseas, that should accelerate M&A as well,” said Hemant Taneja, managing director at General Catalyst. \nBut it’s hard to say what Trump will actually do, because he’s consistently inconsistent when it comes to discussing policy. His unpredictability could cause market swings, which could lead to more acquisitions, but at lower price tags. \n“ As staff and policies continue to take shape, we could see more volatility which will impact both IPO and M&A markets,” said Todson Page, U.S. technology deals leader at PwC. “IPO hopefuls could turn to M&A as their exit route of choice.” \nThis would be a disappointment for companies who were hoping to grow their value as a public company. Selling can be a safer bet, but it eliminates the upside potential.

But these are small acquisitions that generally provide very little return for their investors. \nAnd heightened scrutiny over cross-border activity could lead to a “decrease in Chinese inbound deals,” he warns. Asian buyers have made some significant acquisitions in recent months. \nAnd if Trump’s opposition of AT&T-Time Warner turns out to be a sign that he’s against “megadeals,” then increased antitrust scrutiny could prevent the acquisitions with the largest price tags. \nWe don’t know yet who he will appoint to the FCC, but they could potentially make it harder for industry leaders like Alphabet to make large strategic purchases. “ Potential headwinds include issues relating to increased regulatory review on deals,” said Page. \nPolicy changes that result in a sudden rise in interest rates could make it more costly for corporations and private equity firms to finance deals, he pointed out. Some of the largest transactions require a lot of debt. \nBut for now, it’s “ business as usual,” says Jamie Leigh, co-chair of Cooley’s M&A Group, referencing what has been a very active past few months for tech acquisitions . She says that a competitive landscape has resulted in “ more movement in our space than most market participants can tally.‎” \nIn particular, Leigh is bullish about analytics and cybersecurity. Page also expects more security M&A and is forecasting more activity in the “Internet of Things” and artificial intelligence categories. \nSaid Page, there’s still a “need for growth, whether it be from consolidation, expansion or disruptive technology.” 0 ",

      "text": "Did you know that, on average, smartphone users touch their phones 2,617 times each day?\nAccording to the survey conducted by dscout in the spring of 2016, smartphone users also spend an average of 145 daily minutes on their mobile phones.\nIn other words, we're leaning on our mobile devices more than ever before. In fact, data from HubSpot Research revealed that a whopping 33% of respondents use their smartphone as their primary device for internet use.\nUnsurprisingly, Google has responded to the growth of mobile search by launching The AMP Project , or Accelerated Mobile Pages. In short: AMP was designed so publishers could build web pages that load more quickly on mobile devices.\nWhat do marketers need to know about this new project? We're glad you asked. Let's walk through some of the most common questions and answers below.\nWhat is AMP? AMP enables content to load near-instantaneously by removing JavaScript from the page. It prioritizes text-based content, then loads additional content after the remainder of the page has rendered.\nGoogle's decision to launch this open-source initiative was rooted in the importance of improving the user experience (UX) for the millions of mobile searchers worldwide. (And, in part, to compete with Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles.)\nGoogle has partnered with several different publishers and platforms to start using AMP on its content -- Twitter, Vox, BuzzFeed, and the Washington Post, to name a few. It's also created a carousel of “Top Stories” in Google Search that highlights web pages and articles built with AMP.\nHere’s an example of what an AMP-formatted story on the Top Stories carousel looks like once you click:\nSource: Search Engine Land\nYou can test what AMP looks like on your own mobile phone now. Open up your Google app and type in the newsworthy topic of your choosing (I chose Mars):\nPretty fast loading speed, right? As you also probably noticed, articles with the lightning bolt AMP designation can appear in a carousel of results at the top of the search engine results page.\nAMP-formatted websites also appear in the main Google search engine results page, as shown below:\nSource: Search Engine Land\nIf this seems like a big shift, you’re right. Let’s explore why AMP will be so impactful on mobile search and search engine optimization (SEO).\nWhy Does AMP Matter? The biggest benefit of AMP is improved user experience : When mobile searchers find the information they're looking for faster, they're less likely to navigate away from a website. The AMP Project Product Manager, Rudy Galfi, said that the median time for an AMP-formatted page to load is 0.7 seconds -- in comparison, the median load time for other web pages is 22 seconds.\nMore than half of site visitors spend fewer than 15 seconds on a website before navigating away, so AMP has a huge impact on publishers' ability to attract and keep potential customers on their blog and landing pages. Google found that 29% of smartphone users will immediately navigate away from a site if it loads too slowly or if they can't find the information they're looking for.\nUsers are spending more time searching on their mobile devices than on computers all over the world . If you've optimized your website and email for mobile devices, AMP is a way to optimize your content for mobile search, too.\nAnother benefit of AMP is content visibility. AMP-formatted content is published in the AMP carousel at the top of a Google search results page, and the lightning bolt icon denotes AMP-formatted pages in search results. These layout and design changes help AMP content stand out in the crowd to users searching for information, which could drive more clicks and traffic.\nHow Does AMP Impact SEO? According to Advanced Web Ranking , the first position in Google search results achieves an average clickthrough rate of 31% internationally. The second position? Only a 19.5% clickthrough rate. So, search rankings are very important to marketers.\nThe ultimate goal of inbound marketing is to get your website discovered by potential customers, and discovery in search engine results is key to making that happen. Blog posts and news articles formatted with AMP HTML code is one of many tools, such as keywords, headings, and alt-text , that marketers can use to optimize their content for search results.\nBut AMP is not a direct search engine ranking factor, and sites that format their pages with AMP will not see an immediate leap in search rankings. Instead, Google Senior Director of News and Social Products, Richard Gingras, told AdAge that AMP is one of the 200 signals Google looks at when determining rankings.\n\"If we had two articles that from a signaling perspective scored the same in all other characteristics but for speed, then yes we will give an emphasis to the one with speed because that is what users find compelling,\" explained Gingras .\nSo, what's the takeaway for marketers? Speed is a signal that impacts search rankings, but that doesn't mean AMP formatting alone will get your site on the first page of Google.\nBut, it could contribute to higher rankings in combination with other strong signals. For example, if fewer visitors are immediately navigating away from your content because it loads quickly and is relevant to their search query, that would signal to Google to increase the ranking in search because it's highly useful for users.\nHow to Use AMP In order to implement AMP on your own web pages, you’ll need to build and develop new version of web pages with AMP HTML .\nThe reason you can’t simply build one web page with AMP for desktop and mobile search? AMP removes third-party JavaScript to speed up the page’s load time for mobile users, so the same web page would be simplified and less exciting for the viewer on their computer.\nRemember, AMP is designed to improve user experience, so when you create a separate AMP version, you ensure that desktop and mobile visitors alike enjoy your content. Marketing Land recommends using rel= “canonical” tags so Google doesn’t downgrade your content because it’s been duplicated.\nThe AMP Project website provides specific instructions and tutorials for how to build a web page with AMP code. Additionally, they offer a portfolio of AMP examples for AMP design inspiration.\nBelow is a video from The AMP Project that explains the ins and outs of what goes into an AMP-formatted page:\nSource: The AMP Project\nIf you’re a HubSpot customer , AMP is coming to the HubSpot Marketing Platform in early 2017. With this setting, blogging teams won’t have to hire a developer or learn how to code AMP with the resources outlined above. Instead, users will only have to check a box in order to create AMP-formatted blog posts to get discovered in mobile search.\nHere’s what it will look like:\nSee the check box above the “Save changes” button? That’s the entire process for creating pages formatted with AMP in HubSpot Software. Easy, right?\nWhat's Ahead Expect to see more results appear in the AMP carousel when you search for content on your mobile device, and keep an eye out for new developments in mobile optimization from Google’s competitors among search engines, software, and social media networks.\nFor now, head to The AMP Project to learn more about AMP, and look for HubSpot blog content in your AMP carousel soon.\nWhat are your strategies for optimizing your blog for mobile search?

      "text": "New Google search tool helps you avoid crowds in real time New Google search tool helps you avoid crowds in real time This could come in handy for finding some peace and quiet on Black Friday. New Google search tool helps you avoid crowds in real time 0 \nGoogle's live look at how crowded businesses are will come in handy on Black Friday. Photo by Courtesy of Google \nBah, humbug. \nJust in time for the holiday shopping frenzy, Google is rolling out a tool to let you know how crowded a business is in real-time -- so you know exactly where to avoid. \nThink of it like Waze, but for pedestrians. Waze, a Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic app, warns users when there's traffic on certain roads or things to watch out for such as a crashed car or speed radars. But instead of saving you from traffic jams, Google's live-crowd feature helps you dodge packed places, like the swarm that'll surround your mall on Black Friday. \nStarting Monday, just look up a business and tap on the arrow to get more information. Google will give a live analysis on how busy the business is and what you're up against if you go there. \nThe search giant's live feature builds off its Popular Times tool, which lets you know when a place is at its busiest. That tool compiles the hours when certain businesses reach peak popularity by collecting data from users who store their location information on Google's servers . \nThe latest enhancement will determine how crowded an area is within an hour time frame based on aggregated, anonymized location history data. That might help you decide between heading out to your nearby stores for deals on Black Friday , or choosing to stay home and waiting for Cyber Monday deals . \nIt can also help users manage their time by providing live crowd numbers for specific businesses. If there're too many people shopping at Best Buy at a particular moment, you could check the stores around it to see where you can go to kill time until the crowd dies down. \nYou'll be able to use it for restaurants and bars. That will give you a sense of how long you might have to wait for a table well before you even reach the door. \nIf you're anything like me, you'll be sure to use the live-crowd feature to find the most remote bar in New York City on New Year's Eve -- you don't need an app to figure out where nearly 1 million people will be crowding that night.

      "text": "55 shares \nJust as Google’s preparing to start shipping its Wi-Fi router , Apple has reportedly reassigned the engineers tasked with developing its AirPort wireless routers to other product teams, reveals Bloomberg . \nIt’s believed that the company has been slowly shutting down the division over the course of the past year to “sharpen [its] focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue.” \nWi-Fi routers — which fit into the “other products” category of Apple’s annual financial results — accounted for around 5 percent ($11.1 billion) of the firm’s total sales in fiscal 2016. \nApple’s hoping to use the extra manpower to develop more innovative next-generation products that make up the majority of its revenue, like the Apple TV , iPad and iPhone . \nIt’s currently unclear whether the Cupertino company is planning to stop manufacturing its AirPort routers, but for the time being, all three models are still available to purchase from both its online and brick-and-mortar stores. \nHowever, seeing as the AirPort range — the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule — hasn’t been refreshed since 2013, we expect it to be phased out pretty soon.",

      "text": "When using a search engine as popular and trusted as Google, you probably don't think twice about the safety of the domain.\nMaybe you should.\nSEE ALSO: Google's new Pixel phone hacked in 60 seconds\nThe Next Web noticed something weird about one of the domains in the Google Analytics for its site a few weeks ago: a piece of spam that was telling them to vote for Donald Trump. That in and of itself wasn't weird, but the domain was: ɢoogle.com (warning: Don't go there).\nDid you spot the difference between that URL and the real Google.com? Yep, the capital G in the Google domain they were using appeared smaller than usual.\nThis smaller capital letter G is actually a Unicode character for the Latin small-capital G. Spammy domains often use characters that look like \"normal\" ones to capitalize on the small-but-significant number of users who will click or type the domain unwittingly.\nApparently the spammer had popped up in the Analytics pages of a variety of websites. According to Analytics Edge, the goal of these spammers is to create fake traffic that will serve as clickbait for these web page owners. Given the possibility of malware, visiting a site like this can be extremely risky.\nGoogle Analytics has instructions of how to get rid of this spammer specifically. And although the site is undeniably garbage, you have to give him credit for the creative URL.\nBONUS: Google Home answers the mind-boggling questions Google uses in job interviews",

      "text": "It can be easy to take the services and accounts we use online for granted, but at the drop of a hat access to a service can be taken away, and for reasons that leave you dumbfounded. Reddit user Donovan McLeod (Reddit handle chicken_scratch) found this out first hand when Google decided to lock his account for no immediately obvious reason.\nImagine a situation where you rely on an smartphone running Android , rely on Google's services for online communication and data storage, and have spent a significant amount of money on purchasing Google services and products. Then it is all taken away from you automatically and without warning.\nDonovan's ordeal played out over three weeks and began with an email from Google claiming \"potential suspicious activity\" on his account, which also resulted in the account being locked. A call to Google instructed Donovan to scan his driving license and credit card to verify his identity. The account remained locked and Google refused to share any further details as to why because, \"It is our policy to not discuss the specific reasons for an account closure.\"\n\nMultiple calls to Google result in Donovan being told to accept the old account is permanently locked and to setup a fresh account. However, to do that requires a new credit card as Google will not accept the card linked to the locked account. It gets worse, though, as no data or purchased items can be transferred from the old to the new account, meaning everything is lost.",

      "text": "News \nGoogle has announced this morning that the live place data feature one of our APK teardowns hinted at last month is now official. The feature will allow you to see an estimate of how busy a business or point of interest is right now , which, let's just stop and think about how completely insane the future is for a minute. Your phone can tell you how many people, relatively, are at a place. Just, wow. \nAnyway, the rather awesome technology on display here aside, Google has announced two other features regarding places. The first will let you know how long people typically stay at a particular place, theoretically allowing you to gauge how much time to make for your visit to that hot new Asian fusion taco place that's everyone's raving about (just me? OK). It's handy, I suppose, but even in Google's example, the range of time (10-45 minutes) doesn't exactly scream \"actionable data\" to me. \nThe third feature now allows places to have separate hours for individual sub-places under a single place card. So, for example, if you visit a big public park that happens to have a museum or gallery on the grounds, the hours for those attractions can also now appear in the larger place card for the full park. It makes a lot of sense, and hopefully Google is using some algorithmic and crowd-sourcing management to get this stuff merged into locations quickly and accurately. \nThe post does not indicate when these features are going live. It's likely this will be a server-side switch sort of thing, though if an updated APK is necessary, we'll be sure to update this post when we have it. Source:",

      "text": " Google+\niStock\nBy Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nA new study has found that 127 people died worldwide while trying to take selfies between March 2014 and September of this year.\nThe study , by scholars from Carnegie Mellon University and from two other colleges in India, defined selfie-related casualties, or “killfies,” as “a death of an individual or a group of people that could have been avoided had the individual(s) not been taking a selfie.”\nAdvertisement\nThe vast majority of selfie-related deaths that the study’s authors uncovered, 76 of them, occurred in India, where no-selfie zones were established recently to try to prevent people from trying to take dangerous selfies in high-risk areas.\nPakistan was a distant second with nine selfie-related deaths, followed by the United States, with 8; Russia, 6; China, 5; Philippines, 4; and Spain, 3.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here There were two selfie-related deaths apiece in: Indonesia; Portugal, Peru, and Turkey. There was one apiece in: Romania, Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Italy, Chile, Serbia, and Nepal.\nOther highlights of the report include:\n• Men accounted for about 76 percent of the deaths, suggesting they may be more prone to taking dangerous selfies, the researchers said.\nAdvertisement\n• Nearly three-quarters of victims were 29 years old or younger. The researchers said that fit with the trend of taking selfies being “really popular among millennials.”\n• The most common reason for the deaths, accounting for 25 percent of them, was falling from an elevated location, like off buildings or mountains, while trying to take a selfie. Water-related deaths and ones involving both height and water were tied as the next most common type, at 21 percent each. Next were cases involving trains, 12 percent; weapons, 6 percent; and vehicles, 5.5 percent.\n• While 127 people died, there were only 85 deadly incidents. That’s because multiple lives were lost in 24 of the deadly selfie-taking attempts. (An example researchers provided was an incident in India where a number of youths were boating in a lake. While trying to take a selfie, the boat tilted and seven of them died.) The taking of “dangerous selfies not only puts the selfie-taker at a risk but also can also be hazardous to the people around them,” the study concluded.\n• The report said the data dates back to March 2014 because that is the earliest case the researchers were able to find of a selfie-related death. During 2014, there were 15 selfie-related deaths, followed by 39 in 2015 and 73 in just the first nine months of 2016.\nMatt Rocheleau can be reached at matthew.rocheleau@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBarry Chin/Globe Staff\nMilton resident Jessica McDaniel is notifying family and friends that instead of giving them gifts this holiday season, her family will donate to nonprofits that may be affected by President-elect Donald J. Trump&apos;s policies.\nBy Sacha Pfeiffer Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nA new term has emerged in the nonprofit world since Donald Trump’s presidential victory: rage donations.\nImmediately following Trump’s election, the number of contributions to the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts jumped by 500 percent. The Conservation Law Foundation in Boston enjoyed a 222 percent surge. California-based Muslim Advocates and the New England office of the Anti-Defamation League reported a 50-fold increase in donations.\nAdvertisement\nEven at the Berkshire Immigrant Center, a tiny nonprofit in Pittsfield that helps newcomers to the U.S., more than a third of the gifts it has received this year — 18 of 52 — arrived within the past week. Some were accompanied by “heartfelt notes” from donors lamenting the political turn of events, according to the center’s director, Hilary Greene.\n“People are trying to find a way to respond to the outcome of the election,” Greene said, and by donating to nonprofits that oppose Trump “they feel like they’re doing their part, especially combating racism and xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment.”\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

Sign up for more newsletters here As many Americans wrestle with a tide of negative emotions unleashed by Trump’s win — from grief to fear to anger to frustration – charitable contributions are gushing into a variety of nonprofits nationwide whose work is potentially threatened by his presidency.\nThat phenomenon is being fueled by appeals from celebrities like comedian John Oliver, who urged his viewers to support certain nonprofits , even singling out specific organizations.\nA website launched last week called RageDonate also is encouraging the trend by facilitating online gifts to charities that advocate for women, immigrants, and other groups Trump has disparaged. The site reports receiving 10,000 views in its first 48 hours of existence.\nAdvertisement\n“A lot of people are upset now, and you can sit around moping, or go on Twitter or Facebook and complain, or you go on platforms like ours and actually do something,” said Earl Carlson, a Brooklyn product design manager who is one of RageDonate’s creators. “We’re allowing people to take the negative feelings they have and use those feelings to do better in the world through donations.”\nThat desire is what spurred 41-year-old Milton resident Jessica McDaniel to send holiday cards this year notifying her family and friends that, in lieu of giving them gifts, her family would be making donations to the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Planned Parenthood. She encouraged them to do the same.\n“It seemed like the election was casting this darkness over everything, so we thought: what can we do to turn that around?” said McDaniel, the owner of Boston Baby Photos, a photography company. She and her husband decided that instead of spending money on craft supplies to make ornaments, soaps, and other homemade gifts, they’ll give that money to charity.\nMcDaniel acknowledged that she has “some Trump-supporting family” members who may not agree with her holiday card’s political message, “but this is important enough to us that we’re willing to make a statement to the family,” she said.\nThe Boston affiliate of one of McDaniel’s chosen charities, Planned Parenthood, has enjoyed a 32 percent increase in online donors since the election, nearly 20 percent of which were made in the name of Vice President-elect Mike Pence , an abortion opponent who has tried to defund the organization.\nFor some people dismayed by the Nov. 8 outcome, public protests have been their preferred means of expressing distress. But for others more comfortable with a quieter form of dissent, charitable giving is an appealing option.\n“This giving burst we’re seeing is another way people can have passive resistance to policies they don’t like or believe in,” said Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, whose mission is to increase philanthropy in society. “You need to have your voice known, and one way you can have your voice known in the United States of America is to give to nonprofits important to you.”\nCharitable groups haven’t been the only financial beneficiaries of public upset over Trump’s election. Nonprofit investigative newsrooms such as ProPublica, one of the organizations singled out last weekend by HBO’s Oliver, say they’ve since received an unusually large number of donations. And the Washington Post and New York Times both report a significant surge in subscribers since the election.\nThe newspapers attribute the increases to readers wanting to ensure aggressive coverage of Trump, especially since he has repeatedly publicly criticized the New York Times for what he calls its “unfair” coverage of him.\nSpikes in charitable giving have happened after past presidential elections. Conservative nonprofits have benefitted when Democratic presidents were elected. During Barack Obama’s presidency, for example, contributions to the National Rifle Association rose as firearm owners prepared for a renewed emphasis on gun control.\nIt’s unclear whether the anti-Trump charitable giving will continue at its current volume, as time passes and emotions cool down.\n“I’m not sure it’s going to stay to this extreme,” said Heisman, of the National Philanthropic Trust, “but if the policies he starts promoting anger a group of people who wish he would be doing the opposite, we could have continual bursts.”\nHeisman noted that no one can say for sure how Trump will govern or what his administration’s policies will be; apprehensions about his presidency are rooted in anxiety over the unknown. “But in the interim,” she said, “people can express their concerns through this giving.”\nJamaica Plain resident Jeff Deutsch, 42, is among those who have turned to philanthropy in reaction to Trump’s election. He recently posted a Facebook message explaining that instead of buying holiday gifts this year, he would be making donations to charities that will “help the fight.”\nHe’s donating to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, and he’s asked friends and family to make similar contributions rather than give him presents.\n“I wasn’t motivated by rage or anger, but sadness or concern,” Deutsch said. “In some ways, rage is very healthy, but rage has to be channeled, and I think channeling anger toward donations or peaceful protests is more constructive.”\nSacha Pfeiffer can be reached at pfeiffer@globe.com .

      "text": "Google says its own multi-router networking solution bests the more expensive competition.\nNow that Google Wifi is on sale and shipping within the next two weeks, Google has put out a blog post showing just how well in performs against the mesh networking competition. Google provided its latest networking equipment to an independent testing company, Allion USA , to test in a controlled environment against both Eero and Luma.\n\nAnd as you'd expect considering Google is promoting the results, Google Wifi came out on top. The tests were conducted in a two-story, 3000 square foot house and show that across four different locations (two on each level) Google Wifi outperformed Eero and Luma considerably.\nThere are too many factors that go into Wi-Fi speeds to put stock in just one test.\nFor measurements made closest to the main router, Google Wifi provided a base level of 567 Mbps to Eero's 520 and Luma's 467. Stepping to a room across the house, Google Wifi offered 228 Mbps to Eero's 42 and Luma's 205. Downstairs and on the other side of the house — the furthest point away — showed Google Wifi still offer 82 Mbps to Eero's 46 and Luma's 32.\nObviously there are an immense number of factors that influence Wi-Fi speeds, not the least of which being the ideal layout of the access points, the type of materials your home is made of and which devices are actively using the network. With these tests, using an obviously strong internet connection, Google Wifi came out on top. Google claims that its purpose-built hardware and strong antennas mean it will always be the best, but it's not tough to see either Eero or Luma coming out closer to Google Wifi with some tweaking and better router positioning.\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": " Google+\nTIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images\nPope Francis said Monday that “abortion is a grave sin.”\nBy Frances D’Emilio Associated Press November 21, 2016\nVATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is allowing all priests to absolve the faithful of the ‘‘grave sin’’ of abortion, extending indefinitely the special permission he had granted for the duration of the just-ended Holy Year of Mercy.\nFrancis wrote in the Apostolic Letter made public by the Vatican on Monday that ‘‘there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled’’ with God.\nAdvertisement\nBut he Quote: : ‘‘I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life.’’\nBecause the Roman Catholic Church holds abortion to be such a serious sin, it was long a matter for a bishop who could either hear the woman’s confession himself or delegate that to a priest who was expert in such situations.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But in 2015, Francis allowed all rank-and-file priests for the duration of the Holy Year to grant absolution for an abortion. The Holy Year, which began on Dec. 8, 2015, ended on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, the day he signed the letter.\nBy permitting all priests to absolve the sin of abortion, Francis was further applying his vision of a merciful church. Last year, he wrote that some women who had abortions felt they had no choice but to make ‘‘this agonizing and painful decision.’’\n‘‘May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation’’ after abortion, Francis said in his latest letter.\nAdvertisement\nA top Holy See official, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, told a news conference at the Vatican Monday that the pope’s words applied also to those who were involved in an abortion.\n‘‘The sin of abortion is technically an expression that includes all the people who are involved in an abortion,’’ Fisichella replied to a question from The Associated Press. ‘‘Thus from the women to the nurse to the doctor and whoever supports this procedure.’’\nFisichella added: ‘‘The sin of abortion is inclusive. Thus forgiveness for the sin of abortion is all-inclusive and extends to all those who are participants in this sin.’’\nIn his Apostolic Letter, Francis explained his rationale: ‘‘Lest any obstacle arise between the request for reconciliation and God’s forgiveness, I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.’’\nDuring the recent U.S. presidential election campaign, some pastors urged their congregations to keep the ‘‘sacredness in life’’ — seen as a reference to abortion — in mind when deciding which candidate would get their vote. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voiced his opposition to abortion while campaigning, while his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, supported women’s right to have an abortion.\nFour cardinals, including archconservative U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, recently criticized Francis for what they indicated was ambiguity in past statements on whether divorced Catholics who remarry can receive Communion. Burke and the others expressed fear that Francis was causing ‘‘confusion’’ by saying the matter could be left to the discernment of local priests. Church teaching holds such Catholics are adulterers living in sin, and thus shouldn’t receive Communion.\nIn the letter on abortion, Francis made plain that there can be no ambiguity in laying out moral principles, even while stressing the church’s merciful side.\nAddressing priests in part of the 10-page letter, Francis said: ‘‘I ask you to be welcoming to all, witnesses of fatherly love whatever the gravity of the sin involved, attentive in helping penitents to reflect on the evil they have done, clear in presenting moral principles, willing to walk patiently beside the faithful on their penitential journey, farsighted in discerning individual cases and generous in dispensing God’s forgiveness.’’\n‘‘Mercy cannot become a mere parenthesis in the life of the church; it constitutes her very existence,’’ Francis wrote.",

      "text": " Google+\nJewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made a concession speech earlier this month. Though she won the popular vote, she lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump.\nBy James Pindell Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nGet James Pindell’s analysis first via his newsletter, Ground Game. Sign up here .\nIf it were Republicans who had been delivered their worst lost in nearly a century, the fight about why that happened and what to do next would be obvious. In many ways, that battle had been scripted for months.\nThere would be one side who would argue Donald Trump was the first candidate in a long time to represent the Republican grass roots, but he didn’t get enough support from more traditional Republicans. The traditional set would say that Trump and his forces weren’t inclusive enough and didn’t adhere to the three-legged stool that has held up conservative thought since Ronald Reagan: fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, and a hawkish position on national security.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, none of that matters today. Democrats are in their worst political position since the 1920s. Not only is there a President-elect Trump and a Republican-led US House and Senate, but also the down-ballot picture looks even worse.\nThere are 25 states with a Republican governor and a Republican legislature. (One can now drive from Florida to Idaho and never enter a state where Democrats have any power at all.) Democrats completely control just five states, and one of them, Connecticut, is basically an asterisk because the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks the tie in the state Senate.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller.

Sign up for more newsletters here Perhaps the bigger problem for Democrats moving forward is the fact they don’t even know how to think about the future of the party. It’s been nearly two weeks since the election, and party leaders are still shellshocked. If Republicans had lost, there would be at least some agreement about why. Democrats are looking around and saying they lost for all kinds of reasons.\nFor example, some Democrats say Clinton didn’t do enough to drive out the Obama coalition of young people and people of color. This reliable Democratic voting group simply didn’t turn out in the numbers it did in 2008 and 2012. Other Democrats argue that Clinton was too much a member of the American political establishment that white working class voters rejected her.\nBut those white working class voters were part of the Obama coalition too, leading other Democrats to argue the party needs to do a better job on focusing on one group over the other. Or, the party just need to focus on doing better with everyone.\nAdvertisement\nTo be fair, the losses look worse than they were on Election Day. After all, Clinton did win the popular vote. As ballots trickle in from western states, Clinton’s lead over Trump is now three times what Al Gore had over George W. Bush in 2000. If you just look at the swing states, Clinton lost the presidency by just 53,667 votes out of some 120 million cast.\nBut the question about how to do better with everyone doesn’t leave Democrats looking to fight over the path forward, but simply hugging each other. When leaders offer a theory as to why their party lost, the likely response is “you are right” -- since there are so many reasons and no immediately evident sides.\nJust look at the race for Democratic National Committee chairman. There are a collection of people who are essentially running on the power of their political resumes, but none so far with a strategic vision on how to move the party one way or the other. Three candidates -- including former Vermont governor Howard Dean -- are leaving aside an intellectual vision and just want to focus on the tactical basics of campaign organizing.\nWhere Democrats go from here is anyone’s guess. But you can expect an especially difficult road for the party given Democrats don’t even know where to begin. James Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nEdward A. Ornelas/The San Antonio Express-News/AP\nSan Antonio police investigated after an officer was shot and killed Sunday.\nBy Jamie Stengle and Jim Salter Associated Press November 21, 2016\nFour police officers were shot in separate incidents Sunday, officials said. One died; another the other was shot twice in the face but was expected to survive.\nTwo of the incidents were targeted attacks, police said, who didn’t know the motives in the other attacks.\nAdvertisement\n■ In San Antonio, a detective was writing out a traffic ticket when he was shot to death in his squad car late Sunday morning outside police headquarters by another driver who pulled up from behind, authorities said.\nSan Antonio police Chief William McManus identified the officer as Benjamin Marconi, 50, a 20-year veteran of the force.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Police said the search for a male suspect was still underway early Monday and that no arrest has been made. McManus said he doesn’t believe the suspect has any relationship to the original motorist who was pulled over, and that no motive has been identified.\n■ A St. Louis police sergeant was hospitalized in critical condition after he was shot twice as he sat in traffic in a marked police vehicle about 7:30 p.m. Sunday.\n‘‘This officer was driving down the road and was ambushed by an individual who pointed a gun at him from inside of his car and shot out the police officer’s window,’’ Police Chief Sam Dotson said during a news conference.\nAdvertisement\nDotson declined to name the 46-year-old officer, but said he is a married father of three who has been with the department for about 20 years.\n‘‘Fortunately, for the blessing of God, the officer’s going to survive,’’ Dotson said.\nPolice reported early Monday that the suspect, who was wanted for other violent crimes, was later killed in a shootout with police.\nAt least two other police officers were also shot in other cities Sunday night, but it wasn’t clear whether the incidents were targeted attacks.\n■ An officer with the Gladstone, Mo., police department near Kansas City was shot, along with a suspect.\n■ A Sanibel, Fla., officer was shot in the shoulder during a traffic stop, and was treated for his injuries and released.\nThe attacks on police came less than five months after a gunman killed five officers in Dallas who were working a protest about the fatal police shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. It was the deadliest day for American law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001.\nTen days after the Dallas attack, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, La. And earlier this month, two Des Moines, Iowa-area police officers were fatally shot in separate ambush-style attacks while sitting in their patrol cars.\n‘‘It’s always difficult, especially in this this day and age, where police are being targeted across the country,’’ McManus said.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott called the slaying of Marconi a ‘‘horrific act of violence.’’ Abbott said in a statement that ‘‘attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice.’’\nStengle contributed to this report from Dallas, Salter from St. Louis.",

      "text": " Google+\nPat Greenhouse/Globe staff\nRobert O. Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, addressed the crowd at the State House.\nBy Cristela Guerra Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nThere’s no place for hate.\nThose were the chants from the steps of the statehouse this morning in Boston. Hundreds gathered at a rally hosted by the Anti-Defamation League and stood together against discrimination in any form.\nAdvertisement\nElected officials from the state and the city joined with community leaders to lead the event.\nRobert Trestan, regional director for the league’s New England office, said there’s been a surge in incidents of intolerance both locally and across the country. It was important to come together and speak with one voice, he said.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.

People are getting calls,” Trestan said. “People on the ground in communities and cities across the Commonwealth are concerned.”\nThe rally comes amid concerns that the election of the divisive and controversial Donald J. Trump as president will stir turmoil in the country.\nThe Anti-Defamation League of New England has recorded about 25 hate incidents in recent weeks, three times the usual rate.\nAdvertisement\nParticipants on Tuesday hoisted signs with messages like “Jews Against Trump” and “In the name of humanity we refuse to accept a fascist America.” Families brought their children.\nThe crowd was as diverse as the city.\n“We will protect our neighbors,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “We will stand up to hate.”\nThe mayor cited statistics: the percentage of the city that’s Asian, the percentage that’s African-American, the percentage that’s Latino or lives with parents born in another country.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nMelissa Ellis of Newton said Daisy, her dog — who wore a \"No Place For Hate\" pin —is a \"representation of all the dogs against hate.\"\nWalsh held a citywide conversation on race on Saturday. While the conversation had been planned long before Donald Trump’s election, Walsh acknowledged the election’s impact on the discussion.\n“I saw Boston. I saw America,” Walsh said about the forum. “I saw hope there. I saw love there.”\nHarmann Singh, a first-year law student at Harvard University, spoke of being harassed in a Cambridge store recently. A man followed him around, he said, cursing at Singh because he the thought the student was Muslim.\nSingh called on those before him to intervene if and when they witnessed hatred.\n“This type of hate and intolerance can occur anywhere and to anyone,” Singh said.\nHe advocated for bystander intervention. He said no one in that store said anything to him or to the man that was bothering him.\n“At a moment when many of our brothers and sisters across the country do not feel safe in their own homes, we must stand up for those around us,” Singh said.\nThere were cheers from the crowd. Amanda Darisse, 38, drove from Salem for the rally. She brought her son, Bodhi, 4.\n“Just put it up, mom,” the boy said as he sat on his mother’s shoulders. Darisse smiled and lifted their sign up high over their heads.\nIt said “Love is the Answer.”\n“I wanted to be another voice that said, ‘Hate speech, violence is not acceptable,’” Darisse said. “It isn’t right, it isn’t OK, and we are better than this.”\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nA “Massachusetts Speaks Out Against Hate” rally was held on the steps of the State House.\nGlobe correspondent Reena Karasin contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nMatthew Cavanaugh for The Boston Globe/file 2012\nHolyoke Mayor Alex Morse.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 21, 2016\nFor the second time in a week, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse was the target of harassment due to his sexual orientation.\nOn Sunday, a handwritten discriminatory message was discovered attached to the bottom of one of Morse’s mayoral campaign signs that was hanging on a tree near the city’s Community Field.\nAdvertisement\nThe red writing, which appeared to be scrawled in marker, said “Suck’s” beneath Morse’s name. Under that was the word “Litteally,” an apparent effort to spell the word “Literally.” The sign also included a reference to a website, “gay.com.”\nMorse told the Globe in a telephone interview that he learned about the sign after someone came across it Sunday while near the park. Morse sent a picture of the sign to the Globe on Monday. An image of the message was also shared by a concerned person to Morse’s Facebook page over the weekend. The story was first reported by MassLive.com .\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

He became Holyoke’s mayor at the age of 22. He is currently in his third term and plans to run for reelection next year.\nMorse seemed undeterred by the latest message, which was taken down by a group of people using a ladder Sunday evening. He stressed the importance of equality for people in the gay community and beyond.\nAdvertisement\n“I worry more about the message that it sends to residents of our city — LGBT residents and our youth, in particular,” he said. “I want to let Holyoke residents know that Holyoke will remain a safe community for all of us. It isn’t just coming after me. It really is an attack on all of us.”\nLess than a week before the defaced sign was found, Morse was the victim of a separate incident referencing his sexual orientation. It came in the form of a message that was sent directly to his home.\nOn Nov. 14, Morse received an anonymous letter that read , “Alex, you are one of the most selfish people that I know due to your ‘gay’ lifestyle. You are going down.”\nAfter he posted an image of the letter to his Facebook page Friday, Morse said that he believed the note was a result of president-elect Donald Trump’s victory.\n“It seems to be part of a larger trend happening around the country, and it’s unfortunate to see it happening close to home,” he said.\nMorse said the note sent to his home led to an outpouring of support, and seems to have motivated people to fight back against inequality and discrimination.\n“This has only inspired people to get involved in the community and come together,” he said Monday. “I think it’s important that we move forward ... We are not going to let anything like this distract us or bring us down to that level.”\nThx to residents who removed sign. I'm the mayor; I can handle it. But our LGBT youth need to know they're loved and safe in this city. pic.twitter.com/S7IdB83I6B\n— Alex Morse (@AlexBMorse) November 20, 2016\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\nStephen Bannon was appointed chief strategist for the incoming administration.\nBy Martha Schick Globe Correspondent November 21, 2016\nThe leaders of the historic Seven Sisters colleges published a letter addressed to a top Trump administration appointee Monday, taking exception to his comments disparaging lesbians, feminists, and alumnae of the elite schools.\nStephen Bannon, appointed as chief strategist by the president-elect Nov. 13, gave an interview in 2011 on Political Vindication Radio in which he praised commentator Ann Coulter, former congresswoman Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin for being female leaders who were “pro-family” women, with husbands, who loved their children.\nAdvertisement\nHe went on to call those in the traditional “women’s liberation movement” a derogatory lesbian slur and said they all “came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England.”\nThe Seven Sisters letter read: “We are proud of our alumnae and students, who represent the spectrum of sexual orientation, race, class and religion as well as political party ... Now more than ever, we look to those who would lead the United States of America for a message of inclusion, respect and unity.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

The NAACP and the Southern Poverty Law Center have also denounced Bannon and his record as head of the conservative website Breitbart News.\nMartha Schick can be reached at martha.schick@globe.com .

      "text": "\nCarphone Warehouse is trying hard to get your attention before the holiday shopping season gets in full swing. The company started offering a free VR Goji headset with any pay monthly smartphone purchase a couple of days ago. Now, the retailer is taking it up a notch with its »Black Tag Event«. It’s currently offering a discount in the amount of 70 pounds for Google’s Pixel smartphones, which launched about a month ago. The smaller of the two – Pixel — will set you back 529.99 pounds, while the Pixel XL can be yours for 649.99 pounds.\nSee also: Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective 4 weeks ago Do note that the offer is only valid for the 32GB version of the devices. So if you want to get your hands on the 128GB model, you’ll, unfortunately, have to pay full price – £699.99 (Pixel) and £819.99 (Pixel XL).\nThis is currently the best deal for Google’s Pixel smartphones we’ve seen in the UK. As always, the deal won’t last forever, so if you’re interested in getting it, head over to Carphone Warehouse’s official website by clicking the button below. You can choose between the Quite Black or Very Silver color options, while the Really Blue version still remains a US exclusive.\nAre you thinking of getting this deal? Will you be opting for the Pixel or Pixel XL? Let us know.\nGet the Pixel deal Get the Pixel XL deal ",

      "text": "News \nAndroid 2.3 Gingerbread , according to Google, still runs on approximately 1.3% of devices hitting the Play Store every month. But with Google Play Services 10.0.x, Google is placing an end-marker for the OS's support of the Play Services package going forward, which signals what is essentially the final death of the platform as far as Google is concerned. When Play Services 10.1 arrives, it will leave behind Android's crunchiest iteration. \nGoogle Play services 10.0.x is the final release that includes full support for Android version 2.3.x (Gingerbread). Apps developed using future SDK releases after 10.0.x will not be able to connect to Google Play services on Android Gingerbread devices. \nThis means that while Gingerbread devices will still have Play Services functionality on the v10.0.x GMS packages going forward, apps built with the SDK after Play Services 10.1 launches will see GMS functionality fail on Android 2.3. In order to keep support for Gingerbread, a separate APK built on the older SDK would have to be created (or an older one maintained, as the case may be). \nLoss of GMS support is pretty much the end of the line for an Android version these days. And given Gingerbread was launched nearly five years ago, it's probably safe to pull the plug. We'll miss you, Gingerbread... I guess. Source:",

      "text": "Google today said it has acquired Qwiklabs , a startup that developed commercially available training courses that people could use to become familiar with public cloud infrastructure services. For now the startup will keep offering credits and selling subscriptions, but clearly Google will be using Qwiklabs to more directly support the Google Cloud.\n“We want to help businesses get the most out of their cloud investment and, with Qwiklabs, we’ll give users a place to learn and expand their cloud skills to deliver more innovation, more features and more efficiency for their customers,” Jason Martin, director of professional services at the Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post .\nCurrently Qwiklabs offers lots of content that can help people learn more about using Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest public cloud infrastructure provider. “We are pleased to have been chosen by Amazon Web Services to provide all AWS hands-on training for all of its customers, partners and employees globally,” the startup says on its about page.\nThis move comes after Google acquired Synergyse earlier this year. That technology has since been incorporated into Google Apps .\nQwiklabs was founded in 2012 and based in Carlisle, Massachusetts. More than 500,000 people have gone through 5 million hours of training on the service, Qwiklabs founder and chief executive Enis Konuk, a former Sun and VMware executive, wrote in a blog post . \n",

Google’s predictions are based users’ location history, which is broken down by time of day.\nWhile the popular times feature shows estimates based on historical trends, the live view uses real-time data to show how busy a particular location is at that moment.\nThe update also adds details about how long people tend to stay at any given place to help you anticipate how long the crowds will last.\nWhile it's likely impossible to avoid holiday shopping crowds entirely, Google's predictions should help you feel a bit more prepared going in.\nMonday's update is also updating results for businesses' holiday hours to reflect when stores and restaurants have different seasonal hours. It will also add in details for when a department within a particular business — like a pharmacy within a grocery store — has different hours than the main business.\nAll of the latest updates are available now in browser-based Google search results as well as in Google Maps on Android and desktop.\nBONUS: This is how America's biggest online shopping day came to be",

On that day, Google will discount the smart home assistant to $99, down from its original retail price of $129. The deal, as you likely assumed, is only temporary as a means to sell a bunch of these over the Black Friday shopping weekend. \nThe discount should happen at all of Google Home’s sellers, including Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and the Google Store. Once Wednesday rolls around, we’ll be sure to remind you. But again, don’t buy Home today or tomorrow – be patient. \n— Made by Google (@madebygoogle) November 21, 2016 Post navigation \nI have one already but unimpressed so far. mlm5em \nThis was just the incentive I needed.

      "text": "Harsh truths about fake news for Facebook, Google and Twitter Digital platforms are urged to take responsibility and accept their role as publishers by: Richard Waters , Matthew Garrahan and Tim Bradshaw \nTo judge by the headlines being passed around on social media during her campaign, Hillary Clinton was often in serious trouble. \n“Experts” believed the Democratic presidential candidate had suffered brain damage. Or maybe she was trying to hide alcohol and drug addiction. She was also facing imminent indictment, now that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had finally found evidence of criminality in her use of a private email server — though the New York Police Department, after uncovering shocking evidence of her links to money laundering and sex crimes involving children, might pounce first. \nIn the heat of the most bitter US presidential election in memory, the internet was having a field day. A barrage of fake news — much of it aimed at undermining Mrs Clinton or boosting her opponent — was just part of the diet. It included conspiracy theories, misdirection, prejudice, harassment and hate speech, specially created to circulate on the digital networks that are now central to mass communication and media consumption. \nAccording to critics, the digital platforms contributed to a virulent tribalism, as long-simmering partisan divisions boiled over. And they served to further undermine faith in established media outlets, as many members of a polarised electorate found ready support for the prejudices and unfounded suspicions they already harboured. \nThe aftermath has brought criticism of some of the biggest internet companies — in particular Facebook and Twitter — and an admission that change is needed . “We have a problem in the tech industry we have to deal with,” says John Borthwick, a New York tech investor. “These platforms are central to our democracy. Something has started to go wildly wrong.” Finger pointing \nThe backlash in the wake of the election of Donald Trump , the Republican candidate, has centred on fake news: false reports that are dressed up to look like genuine news articles, sometimes from news sources invented solely for the purpose. Passed around widely on Facebook, retweeted on Twitter or promoted by Google’s search algorithms, some of these stories managed to infiltrate the popular political discourse. A site's fake news story about the popular vote in the US election \nThey included the “report” from the Denver Guardian, a non-existent publication, that an FBI agent suspected of leaking emails from Mrs Clinton’s private server had been found dead in a murder or suicide. With the velocity that characterises the flow of news on Facebook, that report was shared up to 100 times a minute on the network. \nNot all the misinformation favoured the Republican candidate, though most of it did. Of the 20 fakes that generated the most audience engagement on Facebook in the final three months of the campaign, all but three were either pro-Trump or anti-Clinton, according to an analysis by news website BuzzFeed. The made-up stories also touched a nerve: Facebook’s users engaged more deeply with the fakes than the top 20 stories produced by a selection of established media companies. \nThe viral success of fake news on Facebook and the role the sharing of these articles might have had in tilting the election for Mr Trump have caused considerable angst inside the company. Comment Zuckerberg’s flawed approach to fixing his fake news problem His evasions smack of someone fearful of unpicking his own business model \n“There is anxiety around the election and there are questions around the role that Facebook and other organisations may have played,” says one person with knowledge of the internal discussions at the social networking site. \nPresident Barack Obama said last week that, when it is no longer possible to tell “what’s true and what’s not, and particularly in an age of social media…then we have problems”. \nIn Silicon Valley, where a dominant liberal culture is in shock over the election result, there has been finger pointing over the part the world’s most powerful tech companies may have played. \n“People need to step up and call out the platforms for being effectively propaganda machines for either side,” says Justin Kan, a successful entrepreneur and now an investor at Y Combinator, which funds internet start-ups. “The leadership in Silicon Valley needs to call out Facebook to do the right thing.” \nMark Zuckerberg , Facebook’s chief executive, has rejected much of the criticism , while conceding that there is “more to be done” to stop the spread of fake news. In the days after the election, he claimed it was a “pretty crazy idea” that false stories had somehow had a bearing on the result. But growing pressure led him at the end of last week to outline a number of measures the site was taking to try to tackle the problem. How a fake news item about Hillary Clinton appeared on Twitter \nThe steps taken by the big internet companies in the wake of the election highlight the pressure they have been under to act. Google and Facebook moved last week to prevent their advertising from appearing on sites that carry fake news, a belated attempt to make lying less profitable. Twitter suspended a batch of alt-right accounts — linked to US rightwing extremist groups — for hate speech. \nEvidence that has surfaced since the election shows that the digital platforms will have to do more to weed out misinformation and harassment from their systems, taking in not just fake news but a wider range of abusive behaviour. \nBots — automated systems designed to imitate people — did much to circulate fake news headlines on Twitter, according to Philip Howard, a professor at Oxford university’s internet institute. About a fifth of all tweets about the election were generated by accounts that produce high volumes of posts, he says, a clear indication that they were bots rather than real users. ‘Digital denial’ \nGoogle’s algorithms have also been shown to be vulnerable. For instance, it is a week since a false report that George Soros — often a target of rightwing attacks — had died. \nBut a search for “George Soros” on November 20 still returned this headline at the top of the In the News section of Google’s first page of results: “ Breaking Intel: George Soros DEAD ”. The story was from a site called the Event Chronicle. The Event Chronicle's fake news article about George Soros \nFacebook’s Mr Zuckerberg says only 1 per cent of news circulating on the site was fake. But with the company now used as a news source by nearly half of Americans, that represents a vast amount of traffic. Also, Mr Howard says the location of bot groups operating on Facebook suggests much of the fake information was targeted at Facebook users in swing states like Ohio and Florida, potentially increasing its impact. \nThe failure to block the tide of misinformation has reawakened complaints from the traditional media world that the digital companies have deliberately turned a blind eye, much as they were accused of doing in the case of copyrighted content. \nGoogle and Facebook have resisted describing themselves as media companies or publishers that are responsible for the content they distribute. \n“These companies are in digital denial,” says Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp. “Of course they are publishers and being a publisher comes with the responsibility to protect and project the provenance of news. The great papers have grappled with that sacred burden over decades and centuries, and you can’t absolve yourself from that burden or the costs of compliance by saying, ‘We are a technology company’.” A Facebook post linking to a fake news item on Obamacare \nAlong with other recent failures, such as errors in measurement that led Facebook to inflate the number of times its video ads were seen, the furore over fake news has intensified calls for internet companies to think of themselves as media concerns. \n“The measurement, fake news and extremist content issues highlight that new media or social media companies are not technology companies; they’re media companies,” says Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP , the world’s largest advertising group. “They are responsible for the content in their digital pipes.” \nYet the business imperatives the internet platforms follow may have given them too little incentive to exercise this type of responsibility. Weeding out false information “hasn’t been a priority”, says Mr Borthwick. “Content, more often than not, has been a means to an end — and the end is more sharing, more connectivity.” \nOne former Facebook staffer also says the way the company is run may have exacerbated the distribution of fake news. Its engineers focus on improving engagement — clicks, likes, comments, shares — as the primary measures of success of any new feature. New projects are typically released after six-month “sprints”, during which pressure to increase those metrics is intense. \n“Engagement is a dangerous drug,” says a former Facebook manager. “Nobody is incentivised to think critically about unintended, often long-term consequences.” Another Facebook post linking to a fake news item critical of President Obama \nThat may also contribute to a “filter bubble” problem that leaves users inside an echo chamber of similar views. \nWorse, the pursuit of engagement for its own sake may exacerbate the problem and add to the flow of angry, hateful and inaccurate information. “There’s a lot of evidence that what people share is not necessarily what they researched but what gives them an emotional response,” says Mr Kan. \nThe posts that bring the strongest reactions, adds Mr Borthwick, are “catnip to the news feed”. So the Facebook engineers have an incentive to feature these items most prominently, aiding the spread of information that deepens political divisions. Room for improvement \nIt is unclear how far the internet companies will move to address these issues. Early attention has turned to the algorithms used to weed out fake news, an area in which many experts believe there is scope for improvement. The age of vitriol Edward Luce on US politics and social media Social media is enabling prejudice to slip into the mainstream. What does this mean for democracy? \nMr Zuckerberg has made no mention of another issue raised by critics: whether the sites should hire human editors. Employing people to carry out detailed filtering of content is impractical given the scale of the networks, say critics such as Mr Borthwick. \nBut he, and others, argue that internet companies should still hire “public editors” who can help to establish guidelines and shape their thinking in product design and other issues that will affect the way their services are used. \nSuch calls may continue to fall on deaf ears. “The culture they’ve built and the people they’ve hired” mean that internet companies like Facebook simply do not recognise any need for editorial sensibility, says Ben Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. \nThe cultural chasm runs even deeper. On Twitter, a commitment to free speech has long contributed to the site’s hesitation to stamp out harassment, a flaw it belatedly tried to fix last week with new controls to combat bullying, racism and misogyny. \nMr Zuckerberg, casting Facebook more as a communication platform than a media site, takes a similar stance. “We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible,” he wrote last week. \nBut old authorities become muted in a world where users’ voices are pre-eminent. In an interview last week with The New Yorker, Mr Obama complained that, on a Facebook page, an explanation of global warming by a Nobel Prize winner looks no different than one by a paid climate change denier. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook 'errs on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible'© Bloomberg \nHe added: “The capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal — that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarise the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.” \nIn the wake of a bitterly divisive US election, Facebook users are retreating deeper into their “filter bubbles”. The bitterness of the loss, says Mr Howard, means that many on the losing side have been systematically “unfriending people who voted for the other candidate”. \nThe result is likely to be even deeper tribal divisions. That can only add to an environment in which many people are all too ready to believe the most biased or inaccurate information about the opposing camp — and to shout it out to anyone who will listen. Blocking tools that help machines tell good stories from bad \nHow hard would it be to train a computer to spot fake news? Not very, according to critics who say companies such as Facebook and Twitter have not tried hard enough to block misinformation from their sites. \nThey compare the problem to previous online scourges, like the spam that once threatened to overwhelm email systems, as well as so-called “content farms”— sites that produce large amounts of low-quality articles designed to trick search engines and generate advertising. In these and similar cases, algorithms were adapted to identify and either expunge or downplay the offending material. \nWith their huge resources, the internet companies should find this an easy problem to crack, says Ben Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. “Facebook has more money than God,” he adds. \nIt took four students 36 hours last week to come up with a rudimentary tool for blocking fake news. Developed during a coding competition at Princeton University, the browser plug-in adds warnings to information that cannot be verified and suggests alternative material pulled from more reliable sites, says Nabanita De, one of the developers. \nA number of media companies are working on a project to help machines tell good information from bad, such as new types of metadata to help an algorithm judge a story’s reliability. Such signals might include how a news site was funded or information about the reporter, says Sally Lehrman, director of a journalism ethics programme at Santa Clara University who leads the project. Google and LinkedIn have backed the idea. \nWriting last week, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was working on better ways to detect misinformation but the plague of fake news during the US elections has left many doubters.

      "text": "Study: most students can't spot fake news That's one reason why Facebook and Google would want to fight bogus stories. Save Cultura Creative (RF)/Alamy \nIf you thought fake online news was a problem for impressionable adults, it's even worse for the younger crowd. A Stanford study of 7,804 middle school, high school and college students has found that most of them couldn't identify fake news on their own. Their susceptibility varied with age, but even a large number of the older students fell prey to bogus reports. Over two thirds of middle school kids didn't see why they shouldn't trust a bank executive's post claiming that young adults need financial help, while nearly 40 percent of high schoolers didn't question the link between an unsourced photo and the claims attached to it. \nWhy did many of the students misjudge the authenticity of a story? They were fixated on the appearance of legitimacy, rather than the quality of information. A large photo or a lot of detail was enough to make a Twitter post seem credible, even if the actual content was incomplete or wrong. There are plenty of adults who respond this way, we'd add, but students are more vulnerable than most. \nAs the Wall Street Journal explains, part of the solution is simply better education: teach students to verify sources, question motivations and otherwise think critically. That's happening in some schools. However, the data also illustrates the responsibilities that internet companies and parents share in keeping a lid on fake news. Facebook and Google can help by taking down these stories or depriving their creators of ad money , but parents also need to talk about accuracy and prevent younger kids from accessing sites with significant accuracy problems.",

      "text": "Google Will Tell You How Crowded Places Are in Real Time Google Will Tell You How Crowded Places Are in Real Time 10 Comments You can also now see how long people typically stay at a given location, so you can 'plan your itinerary to the minute.' \nThinking about making a trip to the mall for a little holiday shopping ? Now there's a way to see if it's mobbed before you head out the door. \nGoogle last year introduced a \"Popular Times\" feature in Search and Maps, which lets you see how busy a place typically is at different times of the day and week. Now, the Web giant is updating that feature with real-time data. \n\"Just in time for the Black Friday swarms, we're adding a real-time look at how crowded a place is right now , to help you decide where and when to go,\" Google Product Manager Jamie Aspinall wrote in a blog post . \"Whether you're rushing to pick up a last-minute gift or seeking a lively bar for some festive spirit, check Popular Times for a sneak preview of what to expect when you arrive.\" \nIf you're one of those people who always needs a plan, you're going to love the next new feature. You can now see how long people typically stay at a given location, so you can \"plan your itinerary to the minute.\" \n\"After all, you want to be sure you leave enough time to enjoy a cup of hot chocolate at your local sweets shop before heading to your dinner reservations,\" Aspinall pointed out. \nFinally, Google is getting more accurate when it comes to the hours it displays for stores, businesses, and restaurants. Different departments may be open at different times (think a pharmacy inside a drug store or supermarket), and Google will now show that. This way, \"you'll know what time to pop by the pharmacy..., when food delivery begins at a nearby restaurant..., and what the service hours are at the auto dealership,\" Aspinall wrote. \nThese new features are available within Google Search and Maps.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google’s Top Result for Changing the U.S. Constitution Is Quite a Surprise \nThe recent success of Republicans in state legislatures has renewed interest in a topic that has long been dormant in U.S. politics: how to change the Constitution to rewrite basic rules about how the country is governed. \nThat’s why many people will be surprised to see an article from Breitbart, a partisan right-wing news outlet, featured prominently atop Google’s GOOG search results for “Article V”—which is the part of the Constitution that describes how the document can be amended. \nLaw professor James Grimmelmann called attention to the Google result on Twitter over the weekend and included a screenshot of what he saw. Here’s the tweet: \n— James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) November 20, 2016 \nThe text shown in the Google result, taken from Breitbart article, is not controversial since it faithfully produces the part of the Constitution that explains the two ways lawmakers can make an amendment. \nBut the inclusion of the article itself, including its headline of “An Emergency Solution, Hidden in Plain Sight,” in the primary search result is a surprising move on the part of Google. \nUnlike an encyclopedia entry or even a standard news article, the Breitbart article is not just an explanation of Article V. Instead, it’s a partisan call to join a movement to amend the Constitution through a never-used method that involves a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the states. (The other amendment method, used 17 times since the passing of the Bill of Rights, originates in the House and Senate). \nSince the election there has been renewed in the constitutional convention process—some Republicans see it as an opportunity to permanently advance their agenda, while some Democrats have expressed fear over this possibility. Get Data Sheet, Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nBut no matter how one views the prospect of a constitutional convention (which for now appears unlikely ), it is a curious action by Google to present a partisan article as its top information source. While the search result above is technically what Google calls a “ featured snippet ,” it’s still the first thing a user sees, and its placement will drive many people to the Breitbart article. \nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for a comment about the placement of the Breitbart article. \nGrimmelmann’s tweet comes at a time when both Google and Facebook FB are under scrutiny over how their platforms can shape news and political opinions. Google, for instance, was criticized for displaying a fake news site as its top result for “final election numbers” while some say a glut of fake news on Facebook helped to elect Donald Trump. ",

      "text": "\nGoogle’s upcoming Wi-Fi router, Google Wifi , is designed to provide a reliable internet connection throughout the home on all devices. In an effort to see how it stacks up against the competition before it ships on December 5, Google asked an independent company, Allison USA , to put Google Wifi up against two similar systems, Eero and Luma .\nThe three products are all “mesh” systems, which means they use a group of routers that communicate wirelessly with each other to create a single Wi-Fi network. Instead of just one router, mesh systems allow for multiple sources of Wi-Fi throughout your home, theoretically providing better coverage.\nSee also: OnHub to be compatible with Google WiFi October 5, 2016 Though Google considers mesh systems to be a superior alternative to the typical single router setup in most households, there are, of course, different levels of efficiency offered by each product.\nIn the test, Allison connected two units from each of the three systems in a 3,000 square foot, two story home. It then measured the Wi-Fi speeds at four different locations with a Macbook Air. You can see the results in the graphic below which shows the average speed in Mbps (megabits per second) from more than 60 measurements.\n\nGoogle Wifi came out on top, with the fastest Wi-Fi speeds at each location – sometimes providing more than double the performance. In one of the upstairs bedrooms, for example, Google Wifi was five times as fast as Eero (228 Mbps vs 42 Mbps).\nOf the results, which were posted on its blog , Google said: “Google Wifi is able to outperform other mesh routers because we built it from the ground up to provide fast Wi-Fi in every room. Each Google Wifi point packs high-gain antennas along with powerful amplifiers that make the signal stronger and farther-reaching.”\nSee also: Deal: Google Home on sale for $99 ($30 off) at Google Store and other retailers 2 hours ago Google also reaffirmed its commitment to providing better, faster home Wi-Fi and said Allison would continue to run tests on its system in the coming weeks.\nGoogle Wifi is available for pre-order now at the Google online store for $129 for a single unit or $299 for three.",

Getty Images While U.S. retailers are getting ready for the holiday shopping season to begin in earnest, shoppers are already turning to Google to research the latest trends and deals. Ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Google analyzed recent search data to look at shopping trends and top products for 2016. The top trending brands so far this season include Hatchimals, Nintendo, DJI drones, Pokemon and Trolls. According to Google's Think With Google team, 76 percent of people who search for nearby products on their smartphones visit a brick-and-mortar businesses within a day. The search giant also has some good news for online shoppers: According to The Wall Street Journal, Google is showing lower prices for some Amazon products than Amazon itself. Google has added a number of new tools for retailers since last year, including a way to tell how far away people are from stores when they search, which in turn lets retailers know if they're worth targeting with ads and set higher bids on ad buys with specialized promotions. Retailers can also now see which areas drive the most ad clicks. Here's a look at four trends Google is seeing so far for this holiday season: Get the Technology  ",

      "text": "Free Google app turns old photo prints into glare-free digital images Stop using your phone to take pics of old snapshots and try this. Tweet Old photos that capture a wonderful moment in your family history but never see the light of day are useless. We may have a solution that problem. (Photo: Roman Nerud /Shutterstock.com) \nI think I know what I'll be doing over Thanksgiving weekend: hauling boxes and boxes of photographs I've saved since fourth grade out of the attic and turning them into digital images, thanks to the PhotoScan app by Google. I've been playing with the app for the past day, and it's better than any other free method I know of for turning my old prints into digital images. \nThis is how the PhotoScan app works: Download the free app for iOS or Android. Open the app and it's ready to take a photo. Position the camera over the photo, with the circle that pops up on your screen in the center of the photo. Make sure the entire photo is in the frame. It's OK if it doesn't fit exactly; the app will crop out anything outside the photo for you. Shoot the photo, but before you hear the shutter sound, four circles will appear in the corners of the screen. Move your phone so that the circle that was in the center goes on top of one of the corner circles. It will take another photo. You will know it's done when a blue line runs completely around the circle. Repeat with the three remaining corner circles. The app will then combine the five photos it just took. That's how it removes any glare. It can take several seconds to finish the image. You can then export the photo to Google Photos (if you have it downloaded on your mobile device) or into the photo app that comes with your phone. \nIf my instructions aren't clear enough, you can see Google PhotoScan at work in the video below: \nI've thought about buying a Groupon deal to send away hundreds of photos to be scanned, but that's scary. What if something happens to my photos and I never get them back? I've never been willing to take that risk. \nI have a scanner on my printer, but it doesn't do photos very well. Plus, it takes several minutes to scan a single photo. (The video is pretty spot-on when it talks about the hassle of scanning print photos at home.) \nAfter giving Google PhotoScan a try, I'm impressed. \nTake a look at this photo from the 1970s of my dog, Toto, in my parent's groovy yellow kitchen with flowered wall paper. I turned it into three digital images using the scanner on my HP OfficeJet Pro, the regular camera feature on my iPhone and the PhotoScan app on my iPhone. \nThis is the image I created using my HP Officejet Pro. It's not a very good quality image and it's a smaller size than the other photos. (Photo: Robin Shreeves) \nThis image was created using the standard camera app on my iPhone. It's better than the one created by using my Officejet Pro, but it has some glare. It also needs to be cropped. (Photo: Robin Shreeves) \nThis image was created using Google's PhotoScan. It's automatically cropped so that just the photo is in the image and there's no glare. (Photo: Robin Shreeves) \nI found that using the app in a room filled with natural light worked best. The image of my dog created using PhotoScan looks darker than the other images, but it's truest to the original print. GoogleScan does not make changes to the digital image. You can do that yourself using photo editing software. With a few tweaks, the black and white of Toto's fur can look sharper. \nI imagine a professional-quality scanner made specifically for photos would do an even better job, but that takes money and time. The app is free, and while it will definitely take a lot of time to go through all my photos, the ease of using my phone makes it more likely I'll get it done. \nAnd hey, if I make my sons download the app onto their phones and help me, it will go even faster. That's another advantage to this method of scanning prints: You can have as many scanners in the house as you have mobile devices that support the app.",

      "text": "Brexit's good for tech, Brexit's bad for tech Google, Facebook and IBM are reaping the pre-Article-50 PR opportunities. Save Gail Orenstein/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nEver since 52 percent of referendum voters helped decide that life would be better outside of the European Union, Britain's economic future has been less than certain. The government continues to insist \"Brexit means Brexit\" and is attempting to negotiate trade terms before invoking Article 50 early next year, leaving markets and statisticians to estimate its true impact. \nWhile those talks are held behind closed doors, some of the world's biggest technology companies -- Google, Facebook and IBM -- have seized the opportunity and confirmed their commitment to the UK. \"Leavers\" may see it as justification of their vote, but there's more to these announcements than meets the eye. \nIt started when Google CEO Sundar Pichai visited London last week and announced plans to bring VR to one million UK schoolchildren . He later followed that up with updated plans for its new London HQ in Kings Cross . With help from Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), Google's first \"wholly owned\" building outside of the US will be constructed in the capital, creating up to 3,000 new jobs. \nFacebook's commitment to the UK came yesterday with a promise to hire 500 workers when it opens its new London HQ in Fitzrovia next year. Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's European chief, underlined Britain's importance as a tech centre and that it's \"an important part of Facebook's story.\" When its new offices open next year, the company will employ a total of 1,500 people in the UK. \nToday, IBM announced it will triple the number of its datacentres (from two to six) in the UK, allowing it \"keep pace with growing client demand\" and underscore its \"long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK.\" The company didn't note the referendum in its statement, but IBM Europe's General Manager for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, told Reuters that \"everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit.\" \nAll three announcements can easily be positioned as pro-Brexit, confirmation that tech giants aren't phased by the UK's current economic status. Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan are happy to proclaim that \"Britain is open for business.\" Yet another endorsement of a UK free of EU regulation as a tech hub for the world — jamie martin (@jamieamartin1) November 21, 2016 \nBefore the vote, UK tech was earmarked as one of the industries that would experience the brunt of the impact. In fact, when we asked 50 technology companies that are either based in the UK or have large operations there, only one (Dyson) supported the Leave campaign. \nSkeptics will also be aware that Google's Kings Cross redevelopment has been on the books since 2013, when it spent $1.6 billion buying the land on which its new offices will reside. As for Facebook, it confirmed it was starting work on its new London HQ in September 2015. Both companies were committed to the UK months, if not years, before the EU referendum. \nBuilding offices is one thing, but finding skilled workers to fill them is another matter. \nBritain, more specifically London, is renowned for bringing in talent from across Europe, but its standing could be affected should the UK impose tougher immigration policies. Building offices is one thing, but finding skilled workers to fill them is another matter. \nAn average 15 percent fall in the value of the pound certainly makes hiring UK workers more cost-effective for Google and co. as a whole, but that same fall will make hiring non-UK talent hard: A £100,000 salary that used to be worth €140,000 is, at the time of writing, worth €117,000. With every aspect of Brexit, both sides can tout their own positives and negatives, but the reality is, until Article 50 is triggered, and the trade deals signed, no one really knows what the future has in store.
