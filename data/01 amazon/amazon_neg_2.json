      "text": "November 08, 2016 at 09:40 AM EST How to Win Big and Rank Number One on Amazon \nTempe, Arizona (prbuzz) November 8, 2016 - Amazon is a big exciting platform for online business owners to broaden their customer bases and boost their sales. When most people buy something on Amazon and they think they are buying from Amazon, but the third party sellers sell over 33% of all items sold on Amazon. \nTo help those sellers, Justin Ligeri, the famous fast growing online retailer is going to conduct a meet on December 4th - 6th 2016 in Scottsdale, Arizona. From the first evening-then continuing for two solid days-Justin will reveal his unique process for consistently ranking #1 in category and immediately gaining more sales. \nAlso, he'll discuss how to successfully choose, source and scale the products for massive growth. He'll lay out several key strategies to stay ahead of the competition by controlling the supply of the products. He'll even teach the amazon sellers how to protect their legal interests as scale their Amazon business. \nThe spokesperson stated, \"Justin Ligeri pioneered the secrets of successful retailing on Amazon, turning a small $40 investment into almost $100 million in sales in just a few years. On Cyber Monday 2014-he broke the world record becoming the first person to sell one million dollars in one day in Amazon history. Later, he became the first person to sell over $10 million in one month on Amazon.\" \nHe also continued, \"Now, he's agreed to help a handful of Amazon Sellers sell millions of dollars' worth of retail products using the same unique and proprietary strategies he pioneered. But to use these strategies, you must have an established Amazon business with products to sell on Amazon and a fulfillment system in place (even if it's FBA).\" \nThis all-inclusive event not only features breakfast and evening meals, private Q&A sessions and high-level training and interaction with Justin, but it's also a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to join a circle of advanced Amazon professionals, that everyone can network and mastermind with. Each and every detail of the event is designed in such a way to obtain exactly what amazon sellers need to take their business to the next level. \nRonda Torch, the emerging Amazon seller delightedly stated, \"After meeting Justin Ligeri, I took my business from $80,000 per year to $500,000. The following year, I took it to $1.1 million [and] the year after that to $2.1 million. And I'm still growing.\" \nThe spokesperson finally stated, \"Understandably, the seats at this training are limited. And for that reason, Justin is pre-qualifying all participants to make sure he's reserving seats only for those Amazon Sellers who can benefit the most. Pre-qualification process is going on, so block your calendar NOW for December 4th-6th and get pre-qualified to attend this never-before-conducted program.\" \nAbout Ranked1Pro, \nMeet Justin Ligeri, the fastest growing online retailer on December 4th to 6th at Fairmount Princess Resort in Arizona, Scottsdale. Justin Ligeri will work with a handful of Amazon Sellers to build their business and get them ranked. For more details, visit http://www.ranked1pro.com \nVideo Links :",

      "text": "What's coming to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon in November \n5. Trailer Park Boys (2001-2007, revived by Netflix in 2014) When fleeing America due to the Illuminati conspiracies that have rigged every election since George Washington took office, you'll want a few creature comforts to ease your transition to bags of milk, Tim Horton's and toothless hockey players. And what's more American and familiar than trailer-park trash? Trailer Park Boys follows three petty criminals who live in a Nova Scotia trailer park as they concoct schemes to get rich and probably blow all the money on rum and weed. It's rude, crude and full of bad dudes, just like the United States. God bless America! I mean Canada! Trailer Park Boys \n4. SCTV (Second City Television) (1976-1984) When fleeing a once-great democracy that's now smoldering ruins, it's important to laugh! SCTV was Canada's Saturday Night Live , launching the careers of John Candy , Eugene Levy , Rick Moranis and Martin Short . This gave us Strange Brew , hosers! Available: Unfortunately, full episodes are not streaming anywhere, but you can watch highlights on YouTube . \n3. Heartland (2007-present) Canada's long-running drama is based on the book series of the same name -- albeit swapping the locale from Virginia in the States to the Alberta Rockies. It chronicles the story of a young woman, Amy Fleming ( Amber Marshall ), who realizes she has the gift of healing wounded horses from her deceased mother. Of course, Amy's family ranch isn't just home to horses but her grandfather Jack ( Shaun Johnston) , love interest Ty ( Graham Wardle ), as well as the setting for sweeping emotional sagas with her sister Lou ( Michelle Morgan ) and once-estranged father Tim ( Chris Potter ). Having begun its 10th season this year, it's a flagrant and unapologetic tugger of heartstrings. They don't call it Heartland for nothing. \n2. Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1990-1996, 1999-2000) Americanyoung adults may remember this '90s horror-fantasy show as an integral part of their childhoods when it aired on Nickelodeon. A group of teens who called themselves The Midnight Society would convene at a secret location in the woods and tell a frightening story -- tales of witches, vampires, ghosts and the like that scared the bejesus out of children all across the country. Even though it was for kids, its creepy clowns and special effects were legitimately terrifying -- effects that, for the time anyway, seemed as gory as anything we'd see on The Walking Dead today.",

      "text": "Nov 8, 2016 9:00 AM Photos: Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images; C. Flanigan/Getty Images Photos: Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images; C. Flanigan/Getty Images Share Tweet \nOver the summer, David O. Russell announced that he’d be wading into TV waters with his own drama, thereby drawing interest from traditional media and streaming platforms alike. His untitled project stars Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore, and even though few details were available when we first reported on it , the highly competitive situation seems only natural. Russell’s writing and directing every episode, and while De Niro and Moore’s episodic commitment to the series hasn’t been fully established, it’s fairly oozing with prestige. But according to Deadline , Amazon has emerged victorious in this bidding war, giving a two-season order to the show. \nWith the Weinstein Company producing, Amazon edged out FX to be the home of Russell’s new project, which is reportedly a “mafia crime series” that could also be serialized. The two 8-episode seasons were secured in a $160 million deal, with Variety reporting that De Niro could bring in as much as $850,000 for every episode in which he does appear. (Moore’s salary isn’t mentioned, presumably because the wage-gap calculator was on someone else’s desk at the time of the posting.) There’s currently no word on when production will start. \n ",

      "text": "Netflix's US streaming catalog has shrunk by over 50% since 2012 , but Netflix's argument is that it's filled with more TV shows and movies that you'd actually want to watch — as opposed to filler. \nBut still, some movie fans have grumbled that Netflix doesn't feel like it's built for them anymore. \nNetflix's selection of the best 200 movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, has gone down in the last two years by a substantial amount . And Netflix is simply not producing original films at the same rate it is TV shows (though it is reportedly dropping $90 million for a new Will Smith movie). \nResearch by Barclays earlier this year even showed that, at that time, Netflix had four times fewer movie titles than Amazon Prime Video, one of its major competitors. \nThere's a narrative floating around that as Netflix pivots toward original content, its selection of good movies is suffering. \nBut new research from Streaming Observer puts that into a bit of perspective, and shows that Netflix is still beating Amazon and HBO when it comes to good movies — at least judged by Rotten Tomatoes scores. \nReviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a section of movies designated \"Certified Fresh,\" which means they have a steady rating of 75% or higher, after a certain review threshold. Streaming Observer looked at these \"Certified Fresh\" movies and compared their availability on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, to see which service had the best movie selection. \nNetflix came in with a commanding lead at 357 titles, whereas Amazon Prime had 236, and HBO had 52. \nHere's the chart: \nStreaming Observer \nSo Netflix, while its stable of films may be declining, still has a few hundred movies that are probably worth your time. However, as an absolute number, Netflix had only 15% of the movies on Rotten Tomatoes' list. Other options \nIf you are a diehard movie fan and willing to pay a few dollars a month, it might be worth it to look elsewhere. There are a host of new streaming services that have cropped up built just for you. A recent service that looks promising is FilmStruck, Turner's standalone streaming service targeted at \"film aficionados.\" \nIt certainly has some impressive titles, like “Seven Samurai,” “A Room With A View,” “Blood Simple,” and \"Breathless.\" \nThe catalog features \"an eclectic mix of contemporary and classic art house, indie, foreign, and cult films,\" and was built by the teams behind Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and the Criterion Collection. The focus is on critically acclaimed and \"hard to find\" films, according to the company, so you won't find any TV shows. A standard FilmStruck subscription will cost $6.99 per month, while getting access to 1,200 movies from the iconic Criterion Collection will make it $10.99. \n“It's tailor-made for the diehard movie enthusiast who craves a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art house films,” John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner, said in a statement earlier this year.",

      "text": "by Kelly Woo Amazon is shelling out the big bucks once again to acquire a high-profile TV project. Just a couple weeks after the streaming service picked up \"Mad Men\" creator Matthew Weiner's next series for $70 million, it has landed an untitled drama created by David O. Russell ( \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" \"American Hustle\" ) and starring Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore , according to Deadline . This marks the second collaboration between Amazon and the Weinstein Company, which jointly will pay $160 million for two eight-episode seasons. De Niro reportedly will make $850,000 an episode. Not much is known about the series other than that it is a mafia crime drama. Like Weiner's project, it was heavily pursued by various networks, including FX. The series reunites Russell with his \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and \"Joy\" star, De Niro, who can next be seen playing Bernie Madoff in HBO's \"Wizard of Lies.\" Moore, meanwhile, next stars in Todd Haynes' \"Wonderstruck\" on Amazon.",

      "text": "prime tv Share this article \nAmazon Prime came out with a new series that has sparked the interest of many Mad Men fanatics, especially the women. Good Girls Revolt is about women employed at a magazine called News of the Week (subtle subtweet @Newsweek) during the 1960’s, where they do all the work and the men get all the credit. Totally unbelievable, am I right?The women in the show are hired as “researchers” but are designated to find the information, gather sources, and essentially make the story. Then, their male counterpart looks it over, slaps his name on it, and turns it in. \nUnfortunately, although News of the Week is technically a fictional magazine, the story is based off a book called “Good Girls Revolt,\" written about a true, very similar discrimination case at Newsweek magazine. \nNot only are the women given unequal pay and no credit for their excessive work on the magazine’s stories, but they are also harassed and disrespected by their male coworkers. The ladies are often found fetching coffee or fulfilling the sexual endeavors of the men in the office. \nAlthough the show shares lots of similarities with Mad Men , there’s definitely huge contrasts in the direction each show decided to lead. While Mad Men touches on workplace discrimination with many instances where women are treated with disrespect, it’s not the overarching theme of each episode like it is in Good Girls Revolt . \nDiscrimination and sexual harassment unfortunately are still problems in today’s society, so while the series shows how far we’ve come, it also shows how far we have not come. Women are still fighting for equal pay, benefits, and treatment.Although I love the idea behind the series, I didn’t find myself instantly drawn or attached to the characters or plot during the pilot episode. But, the whole first season is officially on Amazon Prime, so there are many more chances for my opinion on Good Girls Revolt to change—and if I know myself at all, I’m sure I’ll become emotionally attached in no time. \nIf you’re a woman in journalism, or just someone who believes in achieving equality between men and women, I recommend you give Good Girls Revolt a chance!

      "text": "Robert De Niro, Julianne Moore drama series lands at Amazon November 8, 2016 - 18:44   Amazon's spending spree continues. The streaming service and retail hub has landed a drama series package from David O. Russell that stars Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore , The Hollywood Reporter has learned. \nSources tell THR that Amazon has committed to a two-season order — eight episodes each — for the mafia drama, with each installment to be written and directed by Russell. The series is said to have landed at Amazon with a price tag of a whopping $160 million. Insiders told THR that Russell was seeking $1 million an episode just to hear the pitch, with Amazon now appearing to have agreed to his terms (though the initial pitch had the project eyeing a $20 million payday for 20 episodes). The project was first announced in August with multiple offers coming in for the package sight unseen at the time. De Niro is said to have scored $850,000 per episode for the series. \nScott Lambert, Alexandra Milchan and Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures (Russell's American Hustle, Joy) are attached to produce the show with Russell at the helm. \nRussell's largest TV commitment to date is 2014's The Club, which was picked up with a 12-episode straight-to-series order at ABC. He quickly exited the project and the network reversed course on the series, which was poised to star Betsy Brandt. \nFor Amazon, the Russell package comes two weeks after the streamer ponied up what is said to be $70 million to land Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner's TV follow-up with an eight-episode straight-to-series order. The anthology landed at Amazon with six other outlets competing for the project, which like the Russell drama, will be produced by The Weinstein Co. \nThe Russell project comes as A-list talent continues to segue to the small screen, where many are drawn by limited episode counts, stronger creative and more time to explore the material and characters. On the TV side, high-level talent helps broadcast, cable and streaming outlets cut through the increasing amount of original scripted programming in the so-called \"Peak TV\" world where talent and recognizable IP are considered keys to breaking through the clutter. \nThe Russell/De Niro/Moore series comes after Russell earned back-to-back screenwriting Oscar nominations for Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle. Moore recently won an Emmy for HBO's Game Change. De Niro, for his part, scored a supporting Oscar nomination for his role in Silver Lining Playbook. Related links:",

      "text": "Every week another star falls from the silver screen and into our homes. That’s a good thing, though, considering television has been kicking the film industry’s ass over the last year. HBO’s The Night Of , FX’s Atlanta , and AMC’s Halt and Catch Fire have offered far more thrills, laughs, and drama than anything found at the box office.\nSo, it makes sense that award-winning veterans like director David O. Russell ( Silver Linings Playbook , American Hustle ), Robert De Niro , and Julianne Moore would join the party, and that’s exactly what they’ve done. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Amazon has signed their mafia drama for two seasons that will total 16 episodes.\nIt cost the streaming giant a pretty penny, too. Apparently they’ve ponied up around $160 million with De Niro reportedly making $850,000 per episode per series. This comes only two weeks after they paid Matthew Weiner $70 million for the rights to his highly anticipated followup to Mad Men . To be fair, this is all chump change for Jeff Bezos.\nNot much is out there about O. Russell’s series, but Scott Lambert, Alexandra Milchan, and Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures will produce. And if you’re familiar with Ellison’s catalogue over at Annapurna, they only sign quality.\nShould be fun.",

      "text": "Amazon’s Echo Speaker is a cross between Siri and a jukebox with the brainpower to pay your mortgage , read the latest news headlines, and naturally, order items directly from Amazon . Behind the Echo is Alexa, Amazon’s Siri-like digital assistant, which just celebrated her second birthday. As part of the celebration, Amazon and Best Buy are taking $40 off the $180 device — a deal rarely seen — for one day only.\nIn its simplest form, the Echo is a cylindrical, wireless speaker that stands about 9 inches tall. Using the Alexa app, users connect the Echo to their Wi-Fi network and their Amazon account. Within seconds, Echo is up and running. The speaker’s built-in microphone connects you to Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, a versatile AI capable of controlling nearly your entire home through the power of voice commands.\nFor instance, Echo has access to Amazon’s Prime music service and any music stored in your Amazon account, including digital copies of any CDs you may have ordered from Amazon in the past. That means you can instantly start streaming music directly from the Echo.\nThe Echo can also stream from other popular services like iHeartRadio, Spotify, or Pandora — you’ll have to set them up via the Alexa app for Alexa to access your account.\nTo get Alexa’s attention, you need to call out “Alexa” followed by a command. For instance, “Alexa, play Bloc Party,” will have Alexa stream all songs by the band Bloc Party. While music is streaming, you can give Alexa further commands to raise/lower volume (i.e. “Alexa, volume 5”), skip a song, repeat, pause, and so forth. A few weeks ago, Amazon announced that Echo owners — who are also Prime members — will be able to subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited for just $4 per month, instead of the $8 per month price for non-Echo owners. The catch is you’ll only be able to stream from the Echo device.\nPerformance-wise, we found the speaker’s sound quality is good enough . Bass response isn’t as deep or prominent as other standalone speakers, but other devices don’t speak back to you. It’s good enough for a small room, like a bedroom, or a small living room.\nWhile music is a huge part of the Echo device, Alexa can also answer other questions. You can ask her random fact-based questions (“how fast can a cheetah run”) or measurement conversions. Alexa can also tell you the weather, set up multiple alarms/reminders, and create to-do lists. Alexa also has ambitions of becoming your smart home’s control center . Google-owned Nest announced it’s collaborating with Amazon to give Alexa control of its devices, as is Nest’s rival Vivint. Since its launch in June 2015, Alexa has been supplied with over 300 skills by third party developers . There are even rumors Alexa may receive an update this fall that gives it push notifications .\nMore: Learn how to build your own Amazon Echo\nNo matter how you use it, the Echo is a fun device that quickly becomes like an extended member of the family. For today only, Amazon and Best Buy are offering the rarely-discounted device for just $140.\n$140 on Amazon\nSave as much as $50 on two Amazon Echo Dot bundles you’ll actually want Amazon will offer an Echo-exclusive music streaming plan for $4 or $5 a month Amazon’s music streaming service may be a lot cheaper than Spotify",

      "title": "Netflix has more 'Certified Fresh' movies than HBO and Amazon Prime combined",
      "text": "(IMDB / Dreamworks) \nNetflix's US streaming catalog has shrunk by over 50% since 2012 , but Netflix's argument is that it's filled with more TV shows and movies that you'd actually want to watch — as opposed to filler. \nBut still, some movie fans have grumbled that Netflix doesn't feel like it's built for them anymore. \nNetflix's selection of the best 200 movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, has gone down in the last two years by a substantial amount . And Netflix is simply not producing original films at the same rate it is TV shows (though it is reportedly dropping $90 million for a new Will Smith movie). \nResearch by Barclays earlier this year even showed that, at that time, Netflix had four times fewer movie titles than Amazon Prime Video, one of its major competitors. \nThere's a narrative floating around that as Netflix pivots toward original content, its selection of good movies is suffering. \nBut new research from Streaming Observer puts that into a bit of perspective, and shows that Netflix is still beating Amazon and HBO when it comes to good movies — at least judged by Rotten Tomatoes scores. \nReviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a section of movies designated \"Certified Fresh,\" which means they have a steady rating of 75% or higher, after a certain review threshold. Streaming Observer looked at these \"Certified Fresh\" movies and compared their availability on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, to see which service had the best movie selection. \nNetflix came in with a commanding lead at 357 titles, whereas Amazon Prime had 236, and HBO had 52. \nHere's the chart: \n(Streaming Observer) \n\nSo Netflix, while its stable of films may be declining, still has a few hundred movies that are probably worth your time. However, as an absolute number, Netflix had only 15% of the movies on Rotten Tomatoes' list. \nOther options If you are a diehard movie fan and willing to pay a few dollars a month, it might be worth it to look elsewhere. There are a host of new streaming services that have cropped up built just for you. A recent service that looks promising is FilmStruck, Turner's standalone streaming service targeted at \"film aficionados.\" \nIt certainly has some impressive titles, like “Seven Samurai,” “A Room With A View,” “Blood Simple,” and \"Breathless.\" \nThe catalog features \"an eclectic mix of contemporary and classic art house, indie, foreign, and cult films,\" and was built by the teams behind Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and the Criterion Collection. The focus is on critically acclaimed and \"hard to find\" films, according to the company, so you won't find any TV shows. A standard FilmStruck subscription will cost $6.99 per month, while getting access to 1,200 movies from the iconic Criterion Collection will make it $10.99. \n“It's tailor-made for the diehard movie enthusiast who craves a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art house films,” John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner, said in a statement earlier this year. \nIf you're curious, you can try FilmStruck out free for 14 days .\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n\nMore From Business Insider \nNetflix is working on a way for you to download shows and movies to watch when you don't have internet \nIf you can never find any good movies on Netflix, try this new service \n10 terrifying predictions from 'Black Mirror' that could become reality",

      "text": "(IMDB / Dreamworks) \nNetflix's US streaming catalog has shrunk by over 50% since 2012 , but Netflix's argument is that it's filled with more TV shows and movies that you'd actually want to watch — as opposed to filler. \nBut still, some movie fans have grumbled that Netflix doesn't feel like it's built for them anymore. \nNetflix's selection of the best 200 movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, has gone down in the last two years by a substantial amount . And Netflix is simply not producing original films at the same rate it is TV shows (though it is reportedly dropping $90 million for a new Will Smith movie). \nResearch by Barclays earlier this year even showed that, at that time, Netflix had four times fewer movie titles than Amazon Prime Video, one of its major competitors. \nThere's a narrative floating around that as Netflix pivots toward original content, its selection of good movies is suffering. \nBut new research from Streaming Observer puts that into a bit of perspective, and shows that Netflix is still beating Amazon and HBO when it comes to good movies — at least judged by Rotten Tomatoes scores. \nReviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a section of movies designated \"Certified Fresh,\" which means they have a steady rating of 75% or higher, after a certain review threshold. Streaming Observer looked at these \"Certified Fresh\" movies and compared their availability on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, to see which service had the best movie selection. \nNetflix came in with a commanding lead at 357 titles, whereas Amazon Prime had 236, and HBO had 52. \nHere's the chart: \n(Streaming Observer) \n\nSo Netflix, while its stable of films may be declining, still has a few hundred movies that are probably worth your time. However, as an absolute number, Netflix had only 15% of the movies on Rotten Tomatoes' list. \nOther options If you are a diehard movie fan and willing to pay a few dollars a month, it might be worth it to look elsewhere. There are a host of new streaming services that have cropped up built just for you. A recent service that looks promising is FilmStruck, Turner's standalone streaming service targeted at \"film aficionados.\" \nIt certainly has some impressive titles, like “Seven Samurai,” “A Room With A View,” “Blood Simple,” and \"Breathless.\" \nThe catalog features \"an eclectic mix of contemporary and classic art house, indie, foreign, and cult films,\" and was built by the teams behind Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and the Criterion Collection. The focus is on critically acclaimed and \"hard to find\" films, according to the company, so you won't find any TV shows. A standard FilmStruck subscription will cost $6.99 per month, while getting access to 1,200 movies from the iconic Criterion Collection will make it $10.99. \n“It's tailor-made for the diehard movie enthusiast who craves a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art house films,” John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner, said in a statement earlier this year. \nIf you're curious, you can try FilmStruck out free for 14 days .\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n\nMore From Business Insider \nNetflix is working on a way for you to download shows and movies to watch when you don't have internet \nIf you can never find any good movies on Netflix, try this new service \n10 terrifying predictions from 'Black Mirror' that could become reality",

      "text": "Amazon Says FCC Licensing Body Is Wrong Set-Top Approach But pushes consumption-only app that would exclude VOD, premium content 11/08/2016 10:06 AM Eastern \nAmazon execs met with a top aide to FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel last week to pitch their take on the FCC's app-based set-top revamp order, including that a proposed licensing body is the wrong way to go. \n\nThat item remains among the commissioners for vetting after FCC chairman Tom Wheeler pulled the item from a public meeting vote in September after, it is widely believed, Rosenworcel still had issues with its impact on copyrights and contracts. \n\nWheeler proposed a licensing body that, with FCC oversight and input, would approve an MVPD-supplied app giving third-party navigation devices access to MVPD content. \n\nWhile a later iteration of the set-top proposal was said to have backed off the FCC's explicit role in backstopping app licenses to make sure they are reasonable and not anticompetitive, that was not enough for programmers, who made that point clear to Rosenworcel. \n\nAmazon argued that the licensing body approach could \"delay competition and consumer choice.\" \n\nIn meetings with Rosenworcel legal advisor Marc Paul, Amazon representatives said the FCC could rely on the standards and practices of app stores, which are \"well-understood, transparent, and accepted by media companies, including cable programmers and MVPDs that work within these practices to provide apps to phone and tablet devices today.\" \n\nAs to the issue of the FCC's proposal on copyrights and contracts, Amazon argued that if an MVPD could not strike an agreement with a device maker on in-app transactions -- VOD, for example -- they should have to offer a \"consumption only\" app that allows users to access already purchased content but not new content. \n\nAmazon says that will insure that an inability to agree on commercial terms for the sale of content \"will not delay the availability of MVPD linear and VOD services on widely distributed devices.\" \n\nRelated: Microsoft Has Issues with Set-Top Proposal \n\nAmazon also says that at a baseline, the data MVPDs should supply to third-party devices must include basic programming information and consumer entitlement information (what a device is permitted to do with content--recording, for example). \n\nRelated: App Developers to FCC: Rethink Set-top 'Intervention' \n\nCable operators say there should not be obliged to provide a consumption only app without the transactional offerings. \"Such an app would not provide consumers with the MVPD’s premium and video-on-demand content to which they are entitled and would cause customer confusion,\" NCTA: The Internet & Television Association has told the FCC. \n\nThere is no sign of a vote yet on the set-top proposal. It has not been scheduled for the November public meeting. It has been circulated to the commissioners for a vote outside that meeting, but given the calls for transparency on the item from both Hill Democrats and Republicans, a public vote would appear more likely. \n\nWheeler has said he was still hoping for a vote by the end of the year.

      "text": "Print \nGet ready for absolutely-must-see TV. Amazon has signed on to produce two seasons of a new drama starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore. The limited series will be directed by David O. Russell, whose Oscar-nominated movie collaborations with De Niro, 73, include \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and \"Joy.\" \nMoore, 55, won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in 2014's \"Still Alice\" and has been nominated four other times. \nThe untitled project ups the ante on a recent wave of TV series fronted by major movie stars. Recent examples include the first season of HBO's \"True Detective,\" with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, and Showtime's upcoming \"Purity,\" a two-season drama starring Daniel Craig, based on Jonathan Franzen's bestseller. \nAmazon hasn't released details about its new show, but New York magazine reported this morning that the series will likely be a mafia drama. That of course would be a natural for De Niro, who has played gangsters ranging from young Vito Corleone in \"The Godfather Part II\" to Victor Tellegio, the Arabic-speaking mob boss in the Russell-directed \"American Hustle.\" by Kevin Haynes",

      "text": "Amazon's 'Black Friday Deals Store' Lasts 52 Total Days By: Joey Haar   amazon & inverse A large part of the logic behind Black Friday's initial conception was to give consumers the opportunity to tackle their holiday shopping in the run-up to the season, and Amazon's Black Friday Deals Store is the inevitable extension of that logic. Rather than simply offering deals on Black Friday itself, or even in the week proceeding Black Friday, Amazon is offering Black Friday deals weeks before and extending those deals until just before Christmas. In total, Amazon's Black Friday Deals Store will be in operation for 52 days -- from the first day of November until December 22nd. By leaving the deals open for that long, Amazon hopes to entice even the biggest procrastinators into doing their Christmas shopping through the massive e-retailer. To further amplify the convenience, consumers will be able to use Amazon Alexa and their smartphone cameras to find products online.",

      "text": "Amazon, the world’s largest retailer, is among those no longer waiting for the single-day shopping bonanza known as “Black Friday”. They’re joining the trend of those taking part in “Black November” instead. \nPhoto: Video Screen Shot Several surveys agree consumers are eager, with more than 40 percent well underway with their Christmas shopping, stretching purchases over several paychecks instead of just one. “They’re demanding to do their shopping earlier than ever so that when it’s December, it’s time to enjoy it with their families,” says RetailMeNot.com’s Sara Skirboll. Retail experts also expect other retailers to join in long before the day after Thanksgiving. They say shopping earlier in the month means skipping crowds, less stress, and a better chance at getting the bigger bargains. “November is the best month to buy electronics such as laptops,” said Courtney Jespersen, retail and shopping expert at NerdWallet . “We also expect massive electronics deals at Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Costco, and more,”.

The power bank will cost just $19.99 but be aware, there are only 60 units available, so hurry up! \nThe MGCOOL ELEPower Thunder is a 8000mAh power bank with two-way Quick Charge 3.0 technology, this allows for the powerbank to get fully charged in only 2 hours. \nIf you connect it to a smartphone with a battery capacity of around 3000mAh, such as the LeEco Le 2 Max, it can charge it to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is pretty cool. \nThe power banks is obviously backward compatible as well, it can charge phones with micro USB ports as well as the new USB type-C port, so it’s good for any occasion. \nIt could even charge the new MacBook through the USB type-C if you really wanted to! \nCheck out the flash sale over at this link and learn more about MGCOOL on their Facebook page .

It’s going to be a long day, folks.\nIf you don’t want to follow along on Twitter or tune into the all-day TV circus, Amazon is offering a 2016 solution to keep tabs on the presidential race.\nAlexa, the virtual assistant that powers Amazon’s Echo devices, is now equipped with real-time election update capabilities.\nHere are some of the questions Alexa can answer:\n“Alexa, who is winning the presidential election?”\n“Alexa, which states has Trump won?”\n“Alexa, which states is Clinton projected to win?”\n“Alexa, what percent of the popular vote does Clinton have?”\n“Alexa, who won Iowa?”\nThe data comes from global news wires and big news outlets, according to an Amazon rep. The update went live as soon as polling opened Tuesday but Alexa has actually had some election smarts for a while.\nAccording to Amazon, Alexa has been asked millions of questions related to the presidential race, including such gems as “Alexa, who should I vote for?” and “Alexa, what’s Donald Trump’s age?”\nCustomers asked questions about Trump twice as many times as they asked about Clinton.\nGeekWire tested out Alexa’s election skills and compared her to Siri, another candidate in the A.I. race.

      "text": "Share Save \nIn November 2014, Amazon released the Echo, a revolutionary device that changed the way that people listen to music and tackle personal assistant tasks. The introduction of a smart speaker boosted this company to the top of the world of technology. To compete, Google has unveiled it version called \"Google Home.\" How do these units compare? Here is a closer look at the features of Google's Home and Amazon's Echo. Appearance and Design Appearances are subjective. Even though both speakers have a cylindrical shape, the Echo device stands a bit taller and is only available in a black color. During use, a blue ring glows on the top. Google Home is shorter and has a white top with colored lights. The bottom is customizable. Users may swap the lower grills to match individual decors. Audio and Media Delivery When a person purchases a speaker, he or she wants high quality sound. Echo provides rich bass tones. Google Home struggles in this area and seems best at delivering high-pitched audio. However, Home offers more media capabilities. It streams the most popular music services, including Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Pandora. Also, it let users play multi-room audio and stream music through speakers that are not in the home. Conversation Commands The way to interact with a smart speaker is with voice commands. Amazon has tried to make conversations more intimate by introducing Echo's \"Alexa,\" its personal assistant. Google's system has no named voice. Despite missing this feature, Home can carry out complete conversations by linking questions. Echo can only address one inquiry at a time. Personal Assistance Services When evaluating how well the two systems execute tasks, Echo has the edge. Although Home has high conversational abilities, Echo can complete a higher number of \"skills.\" Even though the two devices can create shopping lists, check the status of flights, track packages, and create functional calendars, Echo's rich SDK allows it to complete specific tasks like ordering a pizza or calling an Uber. Third-Party Apps and Smart Home Integration Out of the box, both units can perform a number of tasks. However, things get better when a person can use third-party apps and sync the speaker to smart home devices. Since Echo has been around longer, it offers more services. For now, Google's Home is much more limited. Although Home can be synced to music services and supports the Nest thermostat, Echo offers connections to recognized names like Capital One and Domino's Pizza. Also, it supports in-home products from Nest, Wink, Belkin, and many similar manufacturers. Price Neither system is a budget buster. The Amazon Echo usually runs $180, and Google's Home has been released with a price of $130. The Verdict Despite the superior conversational abilities of Google's Home, it appears that Amazon's Echo offers many more skills. This mean that Echo owners are not encouraged to race to the store for Google replacements. However, with time, Home developers are sure to add services so that the devices are more competitive. As technology advances, these two speakers are sure to be joined by many other offerings from recognized companies that will provide even more useful functions and features. In a short period of time, the public may use smart speakers as often as smart phones. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "Don’t feel like turning on CNN to watch election returns? Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa, has been updated to provide real-time election updates, the e-commerce giant announced on Tuesday.\nAlexa is Amazon’s voice-controlled digital assistant, which can already answer simple questions like “Who is the 44th President of the United States?” as well as play music on-command and order household goods. The service is limited to select Amazon amzn devices, such as one of Amazon's home automation devices (the Echo and Echo Dot) or Fire TV for streaming video.\nFor the past few months, Alexa has been able to inform users with the latest polling numbers for the two presidential candidates: Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nAs of Election Day, Alexa will be able to answer questions about which states Trump and Clinton have won, respectively, how many electoral votes each candidate has, how much of the popular vote each candidate has, projections for state winners, and how many votes each candidate has in each state. Later on, Alexa will be able to provide final election results for the presidential race when ready to call.\nAlexa is powered by artificial intelligence, the machine learning technology that powers driverless cars and other intelligent machines that are slowly taking over human tasks. But in order to make Alexa more human-like, the technology needs human interaction to help program and teach it.\nAccording to a recent Seattle Times report, Amazon has had a team comprised of a half a dozen employees working to ensure Alexa was ready to answer up-to-date queries about the presidential election. But this wasn’t the first time Alexa has been “prepped” to answer specific questions about a major news event as the company did something similar during the Summer Olympics in August.",

      "text": "Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images \nAmazon has scored Robert De Niro's first TV series as it continues to beef up its Prime Video content in its war against Netflix.\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter , the new mafia drama will star De Niro and fellow Oscar winner Julianne Moore. It will be directed by David O'Russell, whose previous work includes \"Silver Lining Playbook\" and \"American Hustle.\"\nBut De Niro's new show won't come cheap for Amazon. It's reportedly paying $160 million for the 16-episode show, while De Niro is getting paid $850,000 per episode.\nThat would make De Niro one of the highest paid actors on TV, right behind the three lead costars of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" who are each getting paid $1 million a pop, based on Variety's estimates . \"Gilmore Girls\" Lauren Graham gets $750,000 per show, while Kevin Spacey gets $500,000 for each \"House of Cards\" episode, Variety says. The highest paid actor among Amazon shows is Jeffrey Tambor from \"Transparent\" at $275,000 per show.\nAmazon has been stepping up its investment in its Prime Video service lately.  I n a clear sign that it's going after Netflix , Amazon made its video service available to non-Prime members in April,  launching a standalone video service that can be purchased month by month. Prior to that, Prime Video was only available through the $99 annual Prime membership, which gives access to two-day free shipping and a bunch of video and music content. \nIt's also doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call.  Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion.  \nDe Niro is the latest high-profile movie star to make the transition to TV.  Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are part of HBO's \"True Detective,\" while Netflix recently landed Jonah Hill and Emma Stone for its new series \"Maniac.\"\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

I n a clear sign that it's going after Netflix , Amazon made its video service available to non-Prime members in April, launching a standalone video service that can be purchased month by month. Prior to that, Prime Video was only available through the $99 annual Prime membership, which gives access to two-day free shipping and a bunch of video and music content. \nIt's also doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nDe Niro is the latest high-profile movie star to make the transition to TV. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are part of HBO's \"True Detective,\" while Netflix recently landed Jonah Hill and Emma Stone for its new series \"Maniac.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "Amazon appears to be getting into housekeeping. Credit: Bigstock. Amazon is looking for a couple of experienced housekeepers, pointing to the possibility that it is experimenting with a new benefit for members of its $99 per year Prime service.\nAccording to job postings first spotted by The Seattle Times , Amazon is seeking people with several years of experience cleaning homes and dealing with customers to help people keep up their homes. The Times spotted language saying the job involves “timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,” allowing for an “errand-free” home, though GeekWire found no mention of Prime in job postings.\nAmazon posted four jobs yesterday in its customer service section for “ home assistants ” and “ cleaning technicians .” Here is a description of the home assistant job.\nYou will be an expert in helping Amazon customers keep up their home. You will be working with customers each day with tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away. You will assure that customers return to an errand-free home.\nAnd cleaning technician:\nAmazon is looking for a self-driven cleaning professional who has an obsession with Customer satisfaction and a passion for making a house feel like a home. The cleaning technician will be responsible for coordinating the weekly schedule of cleanings requested by Amazon Customers along with providing transportation to and from clients’ homes.\nThe candidate must be highly motivated, detail oriented and carry a positive attitude at all times. Amazon will provide all the cleaning supplies needed along with a gas stipend to cover costs to and from our customer’s homes. Amazon will also provide on-site training along with benefits including Amazon stock and health insurance. If you love making a house feel like a home then this role is for you.\n",

      "text": "Many people are noticing an offer showing on Amazon to get $25 off a purchase of $150 when paying with an Amex card. Even non-Prime members see this offer.\nIt shows under all items which are shipped and sold by Amazon – not FBA items ( sample link ), with the exception of Amazon gift cards and third-party gift cards ( sample link ).\n\nWhen trying to use the offer by paying $150+ with an Amex card, it doesn’t actually work. The ‘See Details’ link is not working to give more info on the promo.\nMost Slickdeals members assume that this is an upcoming promo – not yet live – which will offer $25 off $150 on most items on Amazon. This makes sense based on historical trends of Amex/Amazon offers during holiday season.\nHowever, Dannydealguru got the promo to actually work by paying with a Membership-Rewards-earning card and using at least 1-point toward the purchase using Shop-with-Points.\nIt’s not working for me and others which would mean it’s a targeted offer. This is odd being that it’s advertised on all accounts and being that there’s no mention of using Shop with Points.\nIf anyone has more info on how to get this offer to work, please let us know.\nHere’s our Amazon affiliate link – we appreciate if you use it for holiday shopping. You can also signup for a free 30-day trial with Amazon Prime and get 2-day shipping for your holiday shopping season. Amazon also offers a monthly Prime option for $10.99 per month which might make sense for a busy shopping season. \nThe post Use Amex and Get $25 off $150 on Amazon [YMMV] appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "By: PRWeb via PRWeb November 08, 2016 at 14:00 PM EST VisualVault Announces Newest Step of Globalization Strategy to Migrate From Private Cloud Offering to Amazon Web Services \nA long time SaaS provider, VisualVault’s AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today’s demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. \nTEMPE, AZ   \nVisualVault , a SaaS-based (BPA)/ Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software company has moved all VisualVault clients into Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) leveraging multiple AWS services as part of their global strategy . \nA long time SaaS provider, VisualVault’s AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today’s demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. “AWS has continually met and exceeded our performance expectations for our enterprise clients with demanding Service Level Agreements,” stated Tod Olsen, CTO of VisualVault. “We have very large clients managing mission critical business processes so reliability, scalability and security are critical for us to service their requirements.” \nThe move from a private cloud to AWS has been met with positive feedback from existing as well as prospective clients. By virtue of extensive planning and diligent execution, the transition has been seamless and has met all timetables. The upside for current as well as prospective VisualVault clients includes scalability, increased performance levels that are capable of accommodating the input of large repositories of content and data with demanding Service Level requirements and providing better geographic coverage of data centers; effectively eliminating potential global data residency issues. \n“With very demanding timelines, we have already successfully executed the migration from legacy ECM and EMR systems to AWS for several enterprise level clients and have met or exceeded their requirements,” stated Olsen. “The ability to immediately add processing capacity is critical; as most of the migrations have been larger than forecasted. This flexibility is mandatory in those circumstances.” \nAbout VisualVault Founded in 2009, VisualVault is a private, Arizona-based, Business Process Automation (BPA)/Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company specializing in the automation of data and document intensive processes at an enterprise level. The VisualVault® platform is a cloud-based application that includes Intelligent Forms (i-Forms) which automate and validate both structured and unstructured data. These i-Forms streamline manual data entry and routing processes to boost overall productivity and accelerate business results. \nVisualVault enables its clients to search and present content in a contextual manner configured for their specific business requirements, improving adoption through flexibility and ease of use. VisualVault's integrated platform standardizes user data so it may be accessed, viewed and used across an enterprise providing users with live dashboards for end-to-end reporting, analysis and decision making. VisualVault’s mission is transforming our client’s processes quickly and cost-effectively, without replacing expensive core legacy systems, by streamlining their data and document intensive processes with our uniquely configured software that is delivered as a service. \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/11/prweb13833832.htm Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

      "text": "Amazon Says FCC Licensing Body Is Wrong Set-Top Approach But pushes consumption-only app that would exclude VOD, premium content 11/08/2016 10:05:00 AM Eastern Follow @eggerton \nAmazon execs met with a top aide to FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel last week to pitch their take on the FCC's app-based set-top revamp order, including that a proposed licensing body is the wrong way to go. \nThat item remains among the commissioners for vetting after FCC chairman Tom Wheeler pulled the item from a public meeting vote in September after, it is widely believed, Rosenworcel still had issues with its impact on copyrights and contracts. \nWheeler proposed a licensing body that, with FCC oversight and input, would approve an MVPD-supplied app giving third-party navigation devices access to MVPD content. \nRelated: Microsoft Has Issues With Set-Top Proposal \nWhile a later iteration of the set-top proposal was said to have backed off the FCC's explicit role in backstopping app licenses to make sure they are reasonable and not anticompetitive, that was not enough for programmers , who made that point clear to Rosenworcel. \nAmazon argues that the licensing body approach could \"delay competition and consumer choice.\" \nIn meetings with Rosenworcel legal advisor Marc Paul, Amazon representatives said the FCC could rely on the standards and practices of app stores, which it said are \"well-understood, transparent, and accepted by media companies, including cable programmers and MVPDs that work within these practices to provide apps to phone and tablet devices today.\" \nRelated: App Developers to FCC: Rethink Set-top 'Intervention' \nAs to the issue of the FCC's proposal on copyrights and contracts, Amazon argued that if an MVPD could not strike an agreement with a device maker on in-app transactions—VOD, for example—they should have to offer a \"consumption only\" app that allows users to access already purchased content but not new content. \nAmazon says that will insure that an inability to agree on commercial terms for the sale of content \"will not delay the availability of MVPD linear and VOD services on widely distributed devices.\" \nAmazon also says that at a baseline, the data MVPDs should supply to third-party devices must include basic programming information and consumer entitlement information (what a device is permitted to do with content—recording, for example). \nCable operators say they should not be obliged to provide a consumption-only app without the transactional offerings. \"Such an app would not provide consumers with the MVPD’s premium and video-on-demand content to which they are entitled and would cause customer confusion,\" NCTA: The Internet & Television Association has told the FCC. \nThere is no sign of a vote yet on the set-top proposal. It has not been scheduled for the November public meeting. It has been circulated to the commissioners for a vote outside that meeting, but given the calls for transparency on the item from both Hill Democrats and Republicans, a public vote would appear more likely. \nWheeler has said he was still hoping for a vote by the end of the year.

November 08, 2016 14:03 ET | Source: VisualVault \nTEMPE, Ariz., Nov. 8, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - VisualVault , a SaaS-based (BPA)/ Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software company has moved all VisualVault clients into Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) leveraging multiple AWS services as part of their global strategy . \nA long time SaaS provider, VisualVault's AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today's demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. \"AWS has continually met and exceeded our performance expectations for our enterprise clients with demanding Service Level Agreements,\" stated Tod Olsen, CTO of VisualVault. \"We have very large clients managing mission critical business processes so reliability, scalability and security are critical for us to service their requirements.\" \nThe move from a private cloud to AWS has been met with positive feedback from existing as well as prospective clients. By virtue of extensive planning and diligent execution, the transition has been seamless and has met all timetables. The upside for current as well as prospective VisualVault clients includes scalability, increased performance levels that are capable of accommodating the input of large repositories of content and data with demanding Service Level requirements and providing better geographic coverage of data centers; effectively eliminating potential global data residency issues. \n\"With very demanding timelines, we have already successfully executed the migration from legacy ECM and EMR systems to AWS for several enterprise level clients and have met or exceeded their requirements,\" stated Olsen. \"The ability to immediately add processing capacity is critical; as most of the migrations have been larger than forecasted. This flexibility is mandatory in those circumstances.\" \nAbout VisualVault Founded in 2009, VisualVault is a private, Arizona-based, Business Process Automation (BPA)/Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company specializing in the automation of data and document intensive processes at an enterprise level.

      "text": "A suspected South Carolina serial killer left a series of ghoulish product reviews on Amazon in which he gives rave reviews to items that might come in handy during a murder, according to reports.\nTodd Kohlhepp, 45, who allegedly murdered up to seven people, wrote the disturbing reviews while shopping for potential weapons, NBC News reported. \n“Haven’t stabbed anyone yet,” he allegedly wrote about a knife being sold on the site. “When I do it will be with a quality tool like this.”\nIn another posting under the pseudonym “me,” Kohlhepp, 45, kvells about Master brand padlocks.\n“Solid locks,” the review states. “Have 5 on a shipping container.. wont stop them.. but sure will slow them down til they are too old to care.”\nKohlhepp was arrested last Thursday after police searched his property for a missing woman and found her alive – but chained like a dog to a metal storage container. Her slain boyfriend was later discovered in a shallow grave nearby.\nAnd an account linked to Kohlhepp left a review for a shovel with a folding handle: “Keep in car for when you have to hide the bodies and you left the full size shovel at home,” it read.\nKohlhepp – a registered sex offender — has confessed to killing four people whose corpses were found in 2003, police said. The unidentified remains of two more people were also unearthed on his property in Woodruff, SC.\nAuthorities have not been able to confirm that Kohlhepp wrote the Amazon reviews, but many of them appeared in a wish list in his personal account, and showed similarities to his alleged activities, The Huffington Post reported. \nThe reviews – both old and new – contained references to a “tactical pouch” and “shoulder pouch,” both of which are used to carry ammunition, the site reported.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under amazon ,  crime ,  homicide ,  investigations ,  sex offenders ,  shootings ,  south carolina",

      "text": "By: PRWeb  03 PM EST VisualVault Announces Newest Step of Globalization Strategy to Migrate From Private Cloud Offering to Amazon Web Services PRWeb \nVisualVault , a SaaS-based (BPA)/ Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software company has moved all VisualVault clients into Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) leveraging multiple AWS services as part of their global strategy . \nA long time SaaS provider, VisualVault's AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today's demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. \"AWS has continually met and exceeded our performance expectations for our enterprise clients with demanding Service Level Agreements,\" stated Tod Olsen, CTO of VisualVault. \"We have very large clients managing mission critical business processes so reliability, scalability and security are critical for us to service their requirements.\" \nThe move from a private cloud to AWS has been met with positive feedback from existing as well as prospective clients. By virtue of extensive planning and diligent execution, the transition has been seamless and has met all timetables. The upside for current as well as prospective VisualVault clients includes scalability, increased performance levels that are capable of accommodating the input of large repositories of content and data with demanding Service Level requirements and providing better geographic coverage of data centers; effectively eliminating potential global data residency issues. \n\"With very demanding timelines, we have already successfully executed the migration from legacy ECM and EMR systems to AWS for several enterprise level clients and have met or exceeded their requirements,\" stated Olsen. \"The ability to immediately add processing capacity is critical; as most of the migrations have been larger than forecasted. This flexibility is mandatory in those circumstances.\" \nAbout VisualVault Founded in 2009, VisualVault is a private, Arizona-based, Business Process Automation (BPA)/Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company specializing in the automation of data and document intensive processes at an enterprise level. The VisualVault(R) platform is a cloud-based application that includes Intelligent Forms (i-Forms) which automate and validate both structured and unstructured data. These i-Forms streamline manual data entry and routing processes to boost overall productivity and accelerate business results. \nVisualVault enables its clients to search and present content in a contextual manner configured for their specific business requirements, improving adoption through flexibility and ease of use. VisualVault's integrated platform standardizes user data so it may be accessed, viewed and used across an enterprise providing users with live dashboards for end-to-end reporting, analysis and decision making. VisualVault's mission is transforming our client's processes quickly and cost-effectively, without replacing expensive core legacy systems, by streamlining their data and document intensive processes with our uniquely configured software that is delivered as a service. \n //www.prweb.com/releases/2016/11/prweb13833832.htm  ",

From the menu’s Settings, under Account users can select Flash Briefing and tap the “WCCO 4 News Minnesota” toggle to turn on the updates.\nOnce enabled, Flash Briefings will include the top WCCO news stories happening now, summarized in minutes and updated multiple times daily.\nLaunched by Amazon two years ago, the Echo is an internet-connected, voice-enabled speaker that listens for commands and can carry out a wide range of functions: perform web searches, order food deliveries, control temperature and lighting in a smart home, play music, tune in to news and sports radio, and more.\nA portable version called the Amazon Tap became available earlier this year, and the smaller second-generation Amazon Dot debuted last month. Amazon plans to add Alexa voice-controlled functionality to more of its devices moving forward.\n",

      "text": "Deal: Amazon Refurbished Fire TVs and Kindles Starting at $25 – 11/8/16 November 8, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham \nToday, Amazon has opted to discount a number of their products that are refurbished. So you’re able to get some decent hardware at even cheaper prices. These include the Fire TV Stick which is $25, the Amazon Fire TV (1st Gen) for $50, the Amazon 4K Fire TV with Alerxa for $65, the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 6-inch WiFi e-reader for $80 and the Amazon Voyage WiFi e-reader for $120. These aren’t huge price drops from the original refurbished pricing, but they are still price drops, and ahead of Black Friday. Which is definitely exciting. All of these products are in our Holiday Gift Guides this year, and are definitely worth picking up. They would all make great stocking stuffers, especially the Fire TV Stick. \nIf you’re into reading lots of e-books, then the Kindle Paperwhite and the Voyage are both great options. The Voyage has been said to be the best e-reader around. Simply because of how comfortable it is in the hand, and also how lightweight it is. Not to mention the Voyage’s battery life as well. You can pick up all five of these items using the links down below. There are no promo codes needed to get these items at the prices listed above.",

      "text": "Share \nChina’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has warned retailers that it will be monitoring sales practices during Singles’ Day (Nov. 11), according to a report by Seeking Alpha . \nInspired by Alibaba’s SEC troubles earlier this year, the SAIC plans to closely monitor the site for misrepresented advertising, the selling of counterfeit products and fraudulent accounting practices. Alibaba is quoted as saying, “We are the industry leader in combating unfair and illicit practices; we never tolerate malpractices by merchants on our marketplaces.” \nAmazon, which just launched Prime in China at the end of October, along with JD.com, Baidu and other major retailers, are under similar SAIC scrutiny during Singles’ Day. \nIn a statement on their website, the SAIC said, “The SAIC will strengthen market supervision … monitor and manage online marketplaces according to law, and together with the majority of industry players jointly create an online market environment of fair competition and an environment for online consumption that is safe and secure.” \nSingles’ Day, a nationwide celebration of the single life, was made into a retail giant after Alibaba began offering sales back in 2009. It is the largest eCommerce shopping day in the world. Last year, Alibaba alone took in $14.3 billion , a 60 percent increase from 2014 figures. \nFigures for 2016 are expected to increase even further. By comparison, total Black Friday sales in 2016 are projected to exceed $3 billion for the first time in history — not a small amount by any means, but far less than what Singles’ Day reportedly brings in. \nFor the first time, Alibaba plans to cater to shoppers in Hong Kong and Taiwan on Singles’ Day, according to Seeking Alpha. The company hopes to be able to cash in on an increasing amount of international interest in Singles’ Day, as well as all the surrounding hype .",

      "text": "Share \nThe results are in. According to intelligence company Feedvisor, which just released its Amazon User Study for 2016, 92 percent of shoppers surveyed claimed they would not purchase a product with less than a three-star rating. \nThis comes with other findings by Feedvisor, which surveyed over 1,500 Amazon users in the U.S. about their online shopping habits. According to Press Release Rocket , the study reveals a majority preference for a high-quality shopping experience. Here are some of the additional key findings. \nEighty-seven percent of shoppers say they always or sometimes check third-party seller ratings. A majority of users find these sellers to be reliable: 80 percent of Prime users and 60 percent of non-Prime users have purchased from third-party sellers. \nSeventy percent of Amazon Prime users and over half of non-Prime users always or often check Amazon for product prices before making a purchase elsewhere. Interestingly, only 59 percent of those surveyed say they fully read the product description when researching. \nAmazon Prime members make more purchases: One-third of Amazon Prime members buy at least once a week compared to 5 percent of non-Prime members. Sixty-one percent of Amazon users also make purchases on other retail sites. \nShipping costs are a deal-breaker. The study found that 85 percent of Amazon shoppers won’t purchase an item if its shipping costs are high. \nPress Release Rocket quotes Ohad Hagai, vice president of marketing at Feedvisor: “Amazon users are savvy shoppers and have high expectations of their eCommerce experiences. It’s no longer enough for Amazon sellers to post their items on the marketplace and expect to make a sale. As the eCommerce marketplace becomes increasingly crowded, Amazon sellers need to focus on meeting consumers’ demands in order to be successful.” \nFaster shipping, detailed product descriptions and positive reviews will allow third-party sellers on Amazon to maximize sales, Hagai suggested.",

      "text": "Amazon’s virtual personal assistant Alexa might soon be able to help you tackle those household chores piling up. Or, at the very least, help you track down people willing to take on those household services for you.\n\nAmazon has published job postings to its website in hopes of hiring “Home Assistants.” The position is a full-time gig at Amazon that will require employees to clean homes, do laundry, and put away both groceries and household goods for anyone who orders up such services. “You will assure that customers return to an errand-free home,” the job posting reads. \nMORE: What Is Amazon Prime? \nAmazon’s job posting could prove to be a nice complement to Amazon Prime , the $99 one-year subscription service that gives customers the ability to get free two-day shipping on Amazon items, as well as access to the Prime Video and Prime Music streaming services. \nWhile Prime is best known for those few features, Amazon has been quietly adding other services over the last few years in an attempt to attract more customers. Among the more notable additions is the ability for Prime members to exclusively order thousands of household goods through the company’s Prime Pantry service. In select markets, Amazon also offers same-day delivery on a slew of products it sells through its site.\nGiven that context, it’s possible the Home Assistant position could be the next logical step. Indeed, Amazon was quick to note in the job posting that the Home Assistant will put away “groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels.” It’s possible, then, that Amazon's Home Assistants will also act as delivery people, bringing the products customers order through Amazon to their doorstep. (At least, until those Amazon delivery drones take flight.) From there, assistants might put away the goods and get down to the business of cleaning homes and doing laundry. \nFor its part, Amazon hasn’t said how Home Assistant might fit into its broader product lineup and why it might be trying to get into the home-services business. The company also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFor now, it appears Amazon’s Home Assistant program will be limited in scope and might only be available as a trial, since the positions are being offered in Seattle at the company's corporate headquarters. That said, many Amazon programs start in such a way and quickly expand to other markets around the U.S.\nSee Also : 20 Best Amazon Alexa Skills \nSiri vs. Alexa: Why Amazon Won Our 300-Question Showdown Amazon Alexa Guide: Tips, Tricks and How-Tos Amazon Black Friday Deals About the author Don Reisinger Read more Amazon   Audio   Title Subject Publish No comments yet Your comment  ",

      "title": "Amazon job listing hints home cleaning service heading to Prime",
      "text": "Reddit \nIn the near future, some Amazon Prime members may be able to order home cleaning help through the subscription service, at least if a new job listing is anything to go by. A pair of job listings have surfaced on Amazon’s website for “Home Assistant” workers who will help customers “with tidying up around the home.” The job listings are only for the Seattle region, however. \nThe job posts are for a service that appears to be called Amazon Assistants. These people will be in-home cleaners tasked with things like doing the laundry, ‘tidying’ up, putting away groceries, and more. ‘You will assure that customers return to an errand-free home,’ according to the job listing. The company says workers will receive on-site training and job benefits like health insurance and company stock. \nThe job listing includes relatively demanding qualifications for what is essentially a janitorial service, including three years of minimum relevant experience as a ‘basic qualification’ and at least half a decade of experience preferred. Other preferred qualifications include things like a college degree or equivalency to such and being ‘tech savvy.’ \nThese home cleaners will use their own transportation to travel to the customer’s home, where they will among other things ‘identify opportunities to delight customers.’ The job listings don’t detail what kind of pay comes with such a job, and it doesn’t appear Amazon has made any official statements about this service at this time. Given the service only seems to be hiring in Seattle, it is likely this is an early experiment for something that may never roll out at a larger level.",

Moved to Pennsylvania in 1987 and have worked in Mifflinburg, Williamsport and Johnstown. Moved to Harrisburg in '92. I've been in radio for over 25 years and this is by far the best job I've ever had. I've been with The River from day 1...March 16, 1992! \nMy wife, Nancy was born and raised in Harrisburg. We have a beautiful daughter, Emmalee Grace who was born April 7, 2005. We have 1 dog and 4 cats. Never a dull moment at our house! Bob Hauer \nRaised in the countryside just outside of Shamokin, Bob graduated from Our Lady of Lourdes Regional High School in Coal Township in 1998 and (after a two and a half year stop at Allentown College/DeSales University in Center Valley) graduated from Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove in 2002. \nBob is married and has three kids: Brodey, Cade, & Kenley Grace.

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase \nChances are that if you've made a few purchases through Amazon before, you know the basic perks of becoming an Amazon Prime  member: for $99 a year, you get free shipping, and early access to lightning deals and other Amazon discounts.\nWhile your thinking would be right on both counts, becoming an Amazon Prime member has many more lesser known advantages, and when all are considered together, that $99 price tag turns out to be a great value.\nBelow, we take you through all of the access that comes with a Prime membership, so you can see for yourself.\nThis article was originally published on 3/28/2016 and has been updated.  \nFree same-day shipping Amazon \nAs mentioned above, one of the most well known perks of being a Prime member is that you get free two-day shipping on all purchases. What you may not know is that in some cities, you'll have access to free same-day delivery .\nOn April 6, 2016, Amazon rolled out free same-day delivery   to 11 new metro areas (in bold below).\nSame-day delivery is currently available in  Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte , Chicago, Cincinnati , Dallas/Ft. Worth, Fresno , Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Louisville , Milwaukee , Nashville , New York City, North & Central New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh , Richmond , Sacramento , San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle/Tacoma, Stockton , Tampa Bay Area, Tucson , and Washington, D.C. , with more cities to be added to the list soon.\nAnd if you're not lucky enough to live in one of those cities, two-day delivery is still pretty good.\n \n\n\nPrime Now Amazon \nIf same-day delivery isn't fast enough for you, and you live in one of the metro areas listed below, Prime members also have access to the Prime Now app , which provides free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items, and the option of one-hour delivery if you want to pay a flat fee of $7.99.\nWhether you're in need of gifts, groceries, or meal delivery, Prime Now can get your goods to your door faster than ever before.\nPrime Now is currently available in  Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles & Orange County, Miami, Minneapolis & St. Paul, Nashville, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle & Eastside, and Virginia Beach. \n\n\nPrime Video Amazon \nPrime Video is one of the fastest growing aspects of Amazon Prime. The streaming service is making a play to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, and is doing a good job at it judging by the past two years of awards seasons. With Emmy-winning original series \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" on its roster, in addition to a large library of shows and movies, Prime Video  is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone who has cut their cable cord.\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "A long time SaaS provider, VisualVault’s AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today’s demanding security, compliance and governance requirements.\nTEMPE, AZ (PRWEB) November 08, 2016\nVisualVault , a SaaS-based (BPA)/ Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software company has moved all VisualVault clients into Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) leveraging multiple AWS services as part of their global strategy .\nA long time SaaS provider, VisualVault’s AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today’s demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. “AWS has continually met and exceeded our performance expectations for our enterprise clients with demanding Service Level Agreements,” stated Tod Olsen, CTO of VisualVault. “We have very large clients managing mission critical business processes so reliability, scalability and security are critical for us to service their requirements.”\nThe move from a private cloud to AWS has been met with positive feedback from existing as well as prospective clients. By virtue of extensive planning and diligent execution, the transition has been seamless and has met all timetables. The upside for current as well as prospective VisualVault clients includes scalability, increased performance levels that are capable of accommodating the input of large repositories of content and data with demanding Service Level requirements and providing better geographic coverage of data centers; effectively eliminating potential global data residency issues.\n“With very demanding timelines, we have already successfully executed the migration from legacy ECM and EMR systems to AWS for several enterprise level clients and have met or exceeded their requirements,” stated Olsen. “The ability to immediately add processing capacity is critical; as most of the migrations have been larger than forecasted. This flexibility is mandatory in those circumstances.”\nAbout VisualVault\nFounded in 2009, VisualVault is a private, Arizona-based, Business Process Automation (BPA)/Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company specializing in the automation of data and document intensive processes at an enterprise level. The VisualVault® platform is a cloud-based application that includes Intelligent Forms (i-Forms) which automate and validate both structured and unstructured data. These i-Forms streamline manual data entry and routing processes to boost overall productivity and accelerate business results.\nVisualVault enables its clients to search and present content in a contextual manner configured for their specific business requirements, improving adoption through flexibility and ease of use. VisualVault's integrated platform standardizes user data so it may be accessed, viewed and used across an enterprise providing users with live dashboards for end-to-end reporting, analysis and decision making. VisualVault’s mission is transforming our client’s processes quickly and cost-effectively, without replacing expensive core legacy systems, by streamlining their data and document intensive processes with our uniquely configured software that is delivered as a service.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2016/11/prweb13833832.htm\n ",

      "text": "News \nAnother day, another deal and today's comes from Amazon's Gold Box sale. Certain PNY flash storage items are on sale for up to 50% off. These include flash drives, SD cards, microSD cards, and OTG accessories. Most of the storage media are pretty high capacity, too. \nThe highlight of this sale is a 128GB microSD card with a USB/micro-USB reader for $34. The latter, of course, is for USB-OTG on compatible Android devices. The only bummer here is that it isn't Type-C. Among the other treasures in this Gold Box deal is a 64GB flash drive with a Lightning connector and a 480GB portable SSD. \nIf you've been itching for some more glorious space to store all of the (digital) things, then this is definitely worth checking out. It's also great if you're like me and hoard flash drives and SD cards. Source:",

      "text": "News \nWell, what do we have here? Amazon has an absolutely fantastic deal on the Logitech Harmony Ultimate, a \"universal remote\" extraordinaire. When all of those remotes for all of your devices start multiplying, one of these comes in real handy. Tempted yet? \nThe Harmony Ultimate usually costs $283 on Amazon, so the sale price of $140 is a pretty substantial markdown. It comes with backlit keys, a touchscreen, an Android app, and Alexa integration. Very customizable, it can control up to 15 devices (even ones in cabinets) and works with over 270,000. So, you have plenty of options with this thing. Oh, it's eligible for Prime, too. \nWhat I find awesome about this deal is that the price of the new model is $100 less than the manufacturer refurbished one. Kind of funny when that happens.

      "text": "http://str.sg/4gAD Copy \nI was amazed, almost in shock, when a friend bought all the furniture for her new home from Taobao e-marketplace last year. \nThat is, until I did something similar this year for my new place. \nBefore going on this eye-opening online journey, I had made several trips to regular, brick-and-mortar furniture stores. \nI had to check them out first as I prefer to deal with physical stores, especially for big-ticket items. \nThis fastidious shopper, who would not want to miss even a loose thread on a shirt, wants to be sure of what she is getting and that there is recourse if the quality of the goods is not up to par. \nI had in the past furnished my first home with everything from Ikea - from the ceiling lamps to sofa, dining table and bedframes - and I was a satisfied customer. \nThese days, online retailers have also upped the ante on quality and customer service. \nFor instance, I was pleasantly surprised when an e-tailer called me and offered a full refund for a bookshelf I paid for, saying it had received many complaints about the quality of the bookshelf and that it no longer wished to sell the item. \nFollowing the confidence boost, I tried out online furniture start-ups such as Nook and Cranny, Castlery and Ni-Night for bookshelves, sofa, bedframes and more. \nThe items have yet to be delivered so I am still anxious about their quality. \nAt least, these online stores have been promptly replying to all the questions I've bombarded them with delivery dates and the colour of light bulbs, among others. Some of them even responded to my messages via WhatsApp. \nThe rise of online shopping is a challenge for traditional retailers. And some of them do need to work on their online strategy if they want to stay ahead of the curve. \nFor instance, websites have to be easy to browse and should display a full catalogue, complete with payment and delivery options. \nMy recent encounter with a retailer should not be the norm. I spotted a bookshelf I like on the website of a brick-and-mortar retailer, but I could not find an option to buy it online. \nSo I sent an e-mail to the retailer and asked if I could close the deal online. \nThe reply? \n\"Regret that this is not an online item. Please visit our showroom to make the purchase.\" \nHaving an online strategy is probably the best ammunition traditional retailers can have in trying times - when sales are falling and rents are rising. \nSome brick-and-mortar retailers have successfully integrated the their offline and online shops. \nOne example is Ikea and, even then, its physical stores at Tampines and Alexandra Road are still packed with a healthy crowd. \nThis just shows that online browsing cannot, for many customers, substitute the experience of getting to see in person and getting a real feel of items they hope to buy. \nStill, other retailers have found it tough. John Little, which has been in Singapore for 174 years, is closing its last department store here by the end of next month. \nIn the third quarter of the year, Singapore also registered the highest mall vacancy rate - at 8.4 per cent - since 2011, when the Urban Redevelopment Authority began tracking this figure. \nAs the saying \"if you can't beat them, join them\" goes, retailers can learn a lesson or two from the world's largest e-tailer Amazon, which has set its sights on Singapore. It has plans to launch here next year. \nIt's unclear whether the e-tailer will sell in Singapore everything that it offers in the United States - books, movies, music, games, electronics, toys, apparel, sports and groceries. \nBut the powerful search function on its website allows shoppers to find anything they want easily. \nAmazon has also developed a powerful algorithm that recommends goods to online shoppers - although this may be hard to copy. \nAmazon's best practices in returns, goods tracking and shipping can also be followed by the retail industry. \nHopefully some of these best practices would filter down. \nIt can only inspire more to innovate and do better on customer service.
